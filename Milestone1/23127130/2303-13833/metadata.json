    "abstract": "In this paper we prove a new generic vanishing theorem for $X$ a complete homogeneous variety with respect to an action of a connected algebraic group. Let $A, B_0\\subset X$ be locally closed affine subvarieties, and assume that $B_0$ is smooth and pure dimensional. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a perverse sheaf on $A$ and let $B=g B_0$ be a generic translate of $B_0$. Then our theorem implies $(-1)^{\\operatorname{codim} B}χ(A\\cap B, \\mathcal{P}|_{A\\cap B})\\geq 0$. As an application, we prove in full generality a positivity conjecture about the signed Euler characteristic of generic triple intersections of Schubert cells. Such Euler characteristics are known to be the structure constants for the multiplication of the Segre-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of these Schubert cells.",

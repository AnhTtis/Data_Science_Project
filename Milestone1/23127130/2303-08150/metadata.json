    "abstract": "Using recent empirical constraints on the dark matter halo--galaxy--supermassive black hole (SMBH) connection from $z=0-7$, we infer how undermassive, typical, and overmassive SMBHs contribute to the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z=6$. We find that beyond $L_\\mathrm{bol} = 5 \\times 10^{46}$ erg/s, the $z=6$ QLF is dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex above the $z=6$ median $M_\\bullet-M_*$ relation. The QLF is dominated by typical SMBHs (i.e., within $\\pm 0.3$ dex around the $M_\\bullet-M_*$ relation) at $L_\\mathrm{bol} \\lesssim 10^{45}$ erg/s. At $z\\sim 6$, the intrinsic $M_\\bullet-M_*$ relation for all SMBHs is slightly steeper than the $z=0$ scaling, with a similar normalization at $M_* \\sim 10^{11} M_\\odot$. We also predict the $M_\\bullet-M_*$ relation for $z=6$ bright quasars selected by different bolometric luminosity thresholds, finding very good agreement with observations. For quasars with $L_\\mathrm{bol} > 3 \\times 10^{46}$ ($10^{48}$) erg/s, the scaling relation is shifted upwards by $\\sim0.35$ (1.0) dex for $10^{11} M_\\odot$ galaxies. To accurately measure the intrinsic $M_\\bullet-M_*$ relation, it is essential to include fainter quasars with $L_\\mathrm{bol} \\lesssim 10^{45}$ erg/s. At high redshifts, low-luminosity quasars are thus the best targets for understanding typical formation paths for SMBHs in galaxies.",

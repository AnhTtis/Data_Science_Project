    "abstract": "Preparing the ground states of a many-body system is essential for evaluating physical quantities and determining the properties of materials. This work provides a quantum ground state preparation scheme with shallow variational warm-start to tackle the bottlenecks of current algorithms, i.e., demand for prior ground state energy information and lack of demonstration of efficient initial state preparation. Particularly, our methods would not experience the instability for small spectral gap $Δ$ during pre-encoding the phase factors since our methods involve only $\\widetilde{O}(1)$ factors while $\\widetilde{O}(Δ^{-1})$ is requested by the near-optimal methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods via extensive numerical simulations on spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models. We also show that the shallow warm-start procedure can process chemical molecules by conducting numerical simulations on the hydrogen chain model. Moreover, we extend research on the Hubbard model, demonstrating superior performance compared to the prevalent variational quantum algorithms.",

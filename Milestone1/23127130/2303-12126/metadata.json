    "abstract": "On February 28, 2021, a fireball dropped $\\sim0.6$ kg of recovered CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites in South-West England near the town of Winchcombe. We reconstruct the fireball's atmospheric trajectory, light curve, fragmentation behaviour, and pre-atmospheric orbit from optical records contributed by five networks. The progenitor meteoroid was three orders of magnitude less massive ($\\sim13$ kg) than any previously observed carbonaceous fall. The Winchcombe meteorite survived entry because it was exposed to a very low peak atmospheric dynamic pressure ($\\sim0.6$ MPa) due to a fortuitous combination of entry parameters, notably low velocity (13.9 km/s). A near-catastrophic fragmentation at $\\sim0.07$ MPa points to the body's fragility. Low entry speeds which cause low peak dynamic pressures are likely necessary conditions for a small carbonaceous meteoroid to survive atmospheric entry, strongly constraining the radiant direction to the general antapex direction. Orbital integrations show that the meteoroid was injected into the near-Earth region $\\sim0.08$ Myr ago and it never had a perihelion distance smaller than $\\sim0.7$ AU, while other CM2 meteorites with known orbits approached the Sun closer ($\\sim0.5$ AU) and were heated to at least 100 K higher temperatures.",

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We tackle the camera relocalization problem and improve absolute pose regression (APR) methods by proposing a test-time refinement method. In particular, we design a novel model named Neural Feature Synthesizer (NFS), which can encode 3D geometric features. Given an estimated pose, the NFS renders a dense feature map, compares it with the query image features, and back-propagates the error to refine estimated camera poses from APR methods. In addition, we propose a progressive learning strategy and a feature fusion module to improve the feature robustness of the NFS model. The experiments demonstrate that our method can greatly improve the accuracy of APR methods.

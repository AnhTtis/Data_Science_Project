    "abstract": "Using an atom-cavity platform, we propose to combine the effective gauge phase of rotated neutral atoms and the superradiant phase transition to build a highly sensitive and fast quantum rotation sensor. The atoms in a well-controlled array of Bose-Einstein condensates are coupled to a single light mode of an optical cavity. The photon emission from the cavity indicates changes in the rotation frequency in real time, which is crucial for inertial navigation. We derive an analytical expression for the phase boundaries and use a semi-classical method to map out the phase diagram numerically, which provides the dependence of the photon emission on the rotation. We further suggest to operate the sensor with a bias rotation, and to enlarge the enclosed area, to enhance the sensitivity of the sensor.",

abstract = {We discuss a phase space representation of quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom. This representation is based on a perturbative expansion in quantum fluctuations around one of the classical limits. We explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or Newtonian limit in the coordinate–momentum representation, (ii) wave or Gross–Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of non-equal time correlation functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the phase space methods based on the Wigner–Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal product, Bopp operators, and others automatically emerge from the Feynmann's path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation. We illustrate the applicability of this expansion with various examples mostly in the context of cold atom systems including sine-Gordon model, one- and two-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model, Dicke model and others.}

abstract = {Time crystals are classified as discrete or continuous depending on whether they spontaneously break discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. Although discrete time crystals have been extensively studied in periodically driven systems, the experimental realization of a continuous time crystal is still pending. We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal. Time crystals are a new dynamical phase of quantum matter resulting from the breaking of time-translation symmetry and the subsequent interplay between interactions forming self-organized phases. To date, discrete time crystals have been observed in periodically driven systems. By contrast, Kongkhambut et al. report the observation of spontaneous breaking of a continuous time translation symmetry in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate inside a high-finesse optical cavity (see the Perspective by LeBlanc). Using a time-independent pump, the authors observed a limit cycle phase that is characterized by emergent periodic oscillations of the intracavity photon number and is accompanied by the atomic density cycling through recurring patterns: a continuous time crystal. —ISO A continuous time crystal was observed in a quantum condensate of rubidium atoms.}}

abstract = {The fine-structure constant, α, is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged elementary particles. Related by four fundamental constants, a precise determination of α allows for a test of the Standard Model of particle physics. Parker et al. used matter-wave interferometry with a cloud of cesium atoms to make the most accurate measurement of α to date. Determining the value of α to an accuracy of better than 1 part per billion provides an independent method for testing the accuracy of quantum electrodynamics and the Standard Model. It may also enable searches of the so-called “dark sector” for explanations of dark matter. Science, this issue p. 191 Atom interferometry provides a precise measurement of the fine-structure constant. Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10−10 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99\% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.}}

abstract = {Interleaved atom interferometry brings high sensitivity and temporal resolution to cold-atom inertial sensors. Cold-atom inertial sensors target several applications in navigation, geoscience, and tests of fundamental physics. Achieving high sampling rates and high inertial sensitivities, obtained with long interrogation times, represents a challenge for these applications. We report on the interleaved operation of a cold-atom gyroscope, where three atomic clouds are interrogated simultaneously in an atom interferometer featuring a sampling rate of 3.75 Hz and an interrogation time of 801 ms. Interleaving improves the inertial sensitivity by efficiently averaging vibration noise and allows us to perform dynamic rotation measurements in a so far unexplored range. We demonstrate a stability of 3 × 10−10 rad s−1 , which competes with the best stability levels obtained with fiber-optic gyroscopes. Our work validates interleaving as a key concept for future atom-interferometry sensors probing time-varying signals, as in on-board navigation and gravity gradiometry, searches for dark matter, or gravitational wave detection.}}

Using the Bose–Hubbard model, we study an array of Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in optical potentials and coupled to one another to form a ring. By rotating the ring so that each particle acquires on average half a quantum of superfluid flow, it is possible to create a multiparticle superposition of all the particles rotating and all the particles stationary. Under certain conditions it is possible to scale up the number of particles to form a macroscopic superposition. The simplicity of the model has allowed us to study macroscopic superpositions at an atomic level for different variables. Here, we concentrate on the tunnelling strength between the potentials. Further investigation remains important, because it could lead us to making an ultra-precise quantum-limited gyroscope.}

They are indicative of Earth system's mass redistributions and vertical surface motion, and are usually measured with falling corner-cube- and superconducting gravimeters (FCCG and SCG). Here we report on absolute gravity measurements with a mobile quantum gravimeter based on atom interferometry. The measurements were conducted in Germany and Sweden over periods of several days with simultaneous SCG and FCCG comparisons. They show the best-reported performance of mobile atomic gravimeters to date with an accuracy of 39nm/s2, long-term stability of 0.5nm/s2 and short-term noise of 96nm/s2/√Hz. These measurements highlight the unique properties of atomic sensors.

title = {Improving the accuracy of atom interferometers with ultracold sources},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We report on the implementation of ultracold atoms as a source in a state of the art atom gravimeter. We perform gravity measurements with 10 nm s−2 statistical uncertainties in a so-far largely unexplored temperature range for such a high accuracy sensor, down to 50 nK. This allows for an improved characterization of the most limiting systematic effect, related to wavefront aberrations of light beamsplitters. A thorough model of the impact of this effect onto the measurement is developed and a method is proposed to correct for this bias based on the extrapolation of the measurements down to zero temperature. Finally, an uncertainty of 13 nm s−2 is obtained in the evaluation of this systematic effect, which can be improved further by performing measurements at even lower temperatures. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefit brought by ultracold atoms to the metrological study of free falling atom interferometers. By tackling their main limitation, the method presented here allows reaching record-breaking accuracies for inertial sensors based on atom interferometry.}

abstract = {Abstract The recent development of the atom interferometer and its demonstration as an inertial sensor of acceleration and rotation rate augur a new generation of inertial navigation systems that would rival today's satellite navigation accuracy at the few-meter level. This paper reviews the principles of inertial measurement using the atom interferometer from a rudimentary viewpoint to illustrate the fundamentals and to highlight some of the potential shortcomings with a particular type, the cold-atom interferometer. One of these shortcomings is the fact that this interferometer requires a finite period of time during which the atoms are prepared (cooled) before they enter the interferometer and respond to its dynamics relative to an inertial frame. This lapse in the measurement duty cycle could be supplemented with very precise conventional inertial measurement units (IMUs), or eliminated with multiple, interleaved atom interferometers. Error analyses show that cold-atom interferometric IMUs that capture 50 percent of the dynamics must be coupled with conventional IMUs that are 50 times more accurate than typical navigation-grade units to sustain a horizontal position error of under 5 m (root mean square) after 1 h.},

abstract = {Time crystals are classified as discrete or continuous depending on whether they spontaneously break discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. Although discrete time crystals have been extensively studied in periodically driven systems, the experimental realization of a continuous time crystal is still pending. We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal. Time crystals are a new dynamical phase of quantum matter resulting from the breaking of time-translation symmetry and the subsequent interplay between interactions forming self-organized phases. To date, discrete time crystals have been observed in periodically driven systems. By contrast, Kongkhambut et al. report the observation of spontaneous breaking of a continuous time translation symmetry in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate inside a high-finesse optical cavity (see the Perspective by LeBlanc). Using a time-independent pump, the authors observed a limit cycle phase that is characterized by emergent periodic oscillations of the intracavity photon number and is accompanied by the atomic density cycling through recurring patterns: a continuous time crystal. —ISO A continuous time crystal was observed in a quantum condensate of rubidium atoms.}}

@article{Dreon2022,
	Abstract = {Pumps are transport mechanisms in which direct currents result from a cyclic evolution of the potential1,2. As Thouless showed, the pumping process can have topological origins, when considering the motion of quantum particles in spatially and temporally periodic potentials3. However, the periodic evolution that drives these pumps has always been assumed to be imparted from outside, as has been the case in the experimental systems studied so far4--12. Here we report on an emergent mechanism for pumping in a quantum gas coupled to an optical resonator, where we observe a particle current without applying a periodic drive. The pumping potential experienced by the atoms is formed by the self-consistent cavity field interfering with the static laser field driving the atoms. Owing to dissipation, the cavity field evolves between its two quadratures13, each corresponding to a different centrosymmetric crystal configuration14. This self-oscillation results in a time-periodic potential analogous to that describing the transport of electrons in topological tight-binding models, such as the paradigmatic Rice--Mele pump15. In the experiment, we directly follow the evolution by measuring the phase winding of the cavity field with respect to the driving field and observing the atomic motion in situ. The observed mechanism combines the dynamics of topological and open systems, and features characteristics of continuous dissipative time crystals.},

	Abstract = {A phase transition describes the sudden change of state of a physical system, such as melting or freezing. Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter--light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose--Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases.},

    "abstract": "(Chern--Simons) vector models exhibit an infinite-dimensional symmetry, the (slightly-broken) higher-spin symmetry. This symmetry can be understood as a certain strong homotopy algebra to which the higher-spin algebra is the first approximation. In this note we compute the $n$-point correlation functions of the higher-spin currents as higher-spin invariants directly on the CFT side, which complements earlier results that have a holographic perspective.",

    \caption{{\bf Online language literacy estimates across the world.} (A) Summary of the \olles across the seven geographical groups. The dashed line marks the global average (0.477, population-weighted). Within each box, a line denotes the median value of the group, and a diamond indicates the population-weighted mean of the group; boxes extend from the first to the third quartile of each group's distribution of values; whiskers (lines extending from the boxes) denote the most extreme values within 1.5 interquartile range of each group; dots denote observations outside the range of extreme values.

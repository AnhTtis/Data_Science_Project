\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
The results are two-fold. We first validate of our literacy estimates with existing official data and report the global state of online language literacy across 167 countries. Next, we consider within-country demographic segments such as gender and regions to benchmark the differences in online language literacy across subpopulations, and examine the socioeconomic factors that explain those differences.

    (A) Multiple regression model shows robust associations of the gender gap (female over male) in \olle with overall education status and women's civic participation. (B) The significant interaction between women's civic participation and Internet penetration in predicting gender gap in \olle. 
    (C) Multiple regression models show robust associations of regional disparity in \olle with inequality in education, internet penetration, inequality in income (Gini index), and overall educational attainment. (D) Inequalities in education and income appear to have the opposite contribution in predicting a country's regional disparity in \olle. 
    % (A,B) show the estimated effects with 5\% and 95\% confidence limits as error bars based on the OLS estimation. 
    Full regression estimates are provided in \smapp Tables \ref{tab:model-gender-main} and \ref{tab:model-region-main}, respectively.
    (B,D) show the average marginal effects of the two interaction terms. }

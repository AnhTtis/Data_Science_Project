    "abstract": "In this paper we employ the Circle Method to give exact formulae for Fourier coefficients of an infinite family of weight zero mixed false modular forms using and extending the techniques of Bringmann and Nazaroglu as well as Rademacher. To do so we additionally provide a bound on a Kloosterman sum of modulus $k$.",

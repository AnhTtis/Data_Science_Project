    "abstract": "We first study the convergence of solutions of a system of F-KPP equations related to irreducible multitype branching Brownian motions with Heaviside-type initial conditions to traveling wave solutions. Then we apply this convergence result to prove that the extremal processes of irreducible multitype branching Brownian motions converges weakly to a cluster point process.",

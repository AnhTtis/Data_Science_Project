\section{Learning from long-tail sub-populations}
As we have observed in Section 3, rare sub-populations have negligible impacts when learning with clean labels. However, when learning with noisy labels, several sub-populations incur significantly influences, such as a large variance in the test accuracy of each class/sub-populations and the distribution of influences on test samples. Based on these observations, we introduce a ``biased" treatment to sub-populations when learning with imbalanced classes from noisy labels.

    "abstract": "A superconductor with broken time reversal and inversion symmetry may exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport, including a nonreciprocal critical current, also known as superconducting diode effect. We report an intrinsic superconducting diode effect in a polar strontium titanate film. Differential resistance measurements reveal a superconducting state whose depairing current is polarity dependent. There is, however, no measurable deviation from Ohmic behavior, implying that this state does not arise from a bulk magnetochiral anisotropy. In the entire measurement range, the only deviation from linearity in the differential resistance is on the edge of the superconducting transition at high magnetic fields, likely due to the motion of flux vortices. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect is preserved even when the in-plane magnetic field is oriented parallel to the current, indicating that this effect truly does not originate from a bulk magnetochiral anisotropy.",

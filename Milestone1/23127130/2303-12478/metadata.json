    "abstract": "Let $ \\bbB_n =\\frac{1}{n}(\\bbR_n + \\bbT^{1/2}_n \\bbX_n)(\\bbR_n + \\bbT^{1/2}_n \\bbX_n)^* $, where $ \\bbX_n $ is a $ p \\times n $ matrix with independent standardized random variables, $ \\bbR_n $ is a $ p \\times n $ non-random matrix and $ \\bbT_{n} $ is a $ p \\times p $ non-random, nonnegative definite Hermitian matrix. The matrix $\\bbB_n$ is referred to as the information-plus-noise type matrix, where $\\bbR_n$ contains the information and $\\bbT^{1/2}_n \\bbX_n$ is the noise matrix with the covariance matrix $\\bbT_{n} $. It is known that, as $ n \\to \\infty $, if $ p/n $ converges to a positive number, the empirical spectral distribution of $ \\bbB_n $ converges almost surely to a nonrandom limit, under some mild conditions. In this paper, we prove that, under certain conditions on the eigenvalues of $ \\bbR_n $ and $ \\bbT_n $, for any closed interval outside the support of the limit spectral distribution, with probability one there will be no eigenvalues falling in this interval for all $ n $ sufficiently large.",

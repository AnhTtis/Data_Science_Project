    "abstract": "Conversational search applications offer the prospect of improved user experience in information seeking via agent support. However, it is not clear how searchers will respond to this mode of engagement, in comparison to a conventional user-driven search interface, such as those found in a standard web search engine. We describe a laboratory-based study directly comparing user behaviour for a conventional search interface (CSI) with that of an agent-mediated multiview conversational search interface (MCSI) which extends the CSI. User reaction and search outcomes of the two interfaces are compared using implicit evaluation using five analysis methods: claiming to have a better search experience in contrast to a corresponding standard search interface.",

    "abstract": "We study the spread of multi-competitive viruses over a (possibly) time-varying network of individuals accounting for the presence of shared infrastructure networks that further enables transmission of the virus. We establish a sufficient condition for exponentially fast eradication of a virus for: 1) time-invariant graphs, 2) time-varying graphs with symmetric interactions between individuals and homogeneous virus spread across the network (same healing and infection rate for all individuals), and 3) directed and slowly varying graphs with heterogeneous virus spread (not necessarily same healing and infection rates for all individuals) across the network. Numerical examples illustrate our theoretical results and indicate that, for the time-varying case, violation of the aforementioned sufficient conditions could lead to the persistence of a virus.",

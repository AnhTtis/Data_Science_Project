abstract = {For the calculation of neutral excitations, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is an exact reformulation of the many-body time-dependent Schrödinger equation, based on knowledge of the density instead of the many-body wavefunction. The density can be determined in an efficient scheme by solving one-particle non-interacting Schrödinger equations—the Kohn–Sham equations. The complication of the problem is hidden in the—unknown—time-dependent exchange and correlation potential that appears in the Kohn–Sham equations and for which it is essential to find good approximations. Many approximations have been suggested and tested for finite systems, where even the very simple adiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA) has often proved to be successful. In the case of solids, ALDA fails to reproduce optical absorption spectra, which are instead well described by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). On the other hand, ALDA can lead to excellent results for loss functions (at vanishing and finite momentum transfer). In view of this and thanks to recent successful developments of improved linear-response kernels derived from MBPT, TDDFT is today considered a promising alternative to MBPT for the calculation of electronic spectra, even for solids. After reviewing the fundamentals of TDDFT within linear response, we discuss different approaches and a variety of applications to extended systems.}

The package can be used to compute the electronic and optical properties of a wide variety of material systems from bulk semiconductors and metals to nanostructured materials and molecules. The package scales to 10 000s of CPUs and can be used to study systems containing up to 100s of atoms.
Program summary
Program title: BerkeleyGW Catalogue identifier: AELG_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AELG_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queenʼs University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Open source BSD License. See code for licensing details. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 576 540 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 110 608 809 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 90, C, C++, Python, Perl, BASH Computer: Linux/UNIX workstations or clusters Operating system: Tested on a variety of Linux distributions in parallel and serial as well as AIX and Mac OSX RAM: (50–2000) MB per CPU (Highly dependent on system size) Classification: 7.2, 7.3, 16.2, 18 External routines: BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, ScaLAPACK (optional), MPI (optional). All available under open-source licenses. Nature of problem: The excited state properties of materials involve the addition or subtraction of electrons as well as the optical excitations of electron–hole pairs. The excited particles interact strongly with other electrons in a material system. This interaction affects the electronic energies, wavefunctions and lifetimes. It is well known that ground-state theories, such as standard methods based on density-functional theory, fail to correctly capture this physics. Solution method: We construct and solve the Dysonʼs equation for the quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions within the GW approximation for the electron self-energy. We additionally construct and solve the Bethe–Salpeter equation for the correlated electron–hole (exciton) wavefunctions and excitation energies. Restrictions: The material size is limited in practice by the computational resources available. Materials with up to 500 atoms per periodic cell can be studied on large HPCs. Additional comments: The distribution file for this program is approximately 110 Mbytes and therefore is not delivered directly when download or E-mail is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. Running time: 1–1000 minutes (depending greatly on system size and processor number)."

To capture excitonic effects within a linear-response TDDFT framework requires using exchange–correlation (xc) kernels with a proper long-range behavior, which can be efficiently modeled with a class of so-called long-range corrected xc kernels. While attractive from a computational standpoint, these xc kernels have their limitations and require judicious use. We review the pros and cons of various xc kernels in the literature, and discuss an empirical scaling approach to obtain accurate exciton binding energies with TDDFT. We also discuss generalized TDDFT approaches for excitons using hybrid functionals.}

abstract = {The quadratic Strak effect on the AF, AL and I3 exciton lines was observed at 1.8 K in the absorption spectra for MIS structures with CdS. Impact ionization of free and bound excitons by free carriers in an electric field in CdS crystals with ohmic contact were investigated in the spectrum of luminescence. A theoretical analysis of the results has made it possible to identify the mechanisms of relaxation of high-energy electrons predominating in CdS at low temperatures.}

abstract = {Abstract An investigation is made of the energy spectra of A and B excitons in CdS by measuring the transmission and reflectivity of very thin highly perfect crystals at 1.8 K. The excited states of both series follow hydrogen-like series in a good approximation yielding different Rydberg's R = (28 ± 0.4) and R = (31.3 ± 0.4) meV, whereas the ground states are shifted in opposite direction with respect to the series, δE = −2.2, δE = +0.5 meV, resulting in exciton binding energies E = 30.2 and E = 30.8 meV, which are different from the corresponding Rydberg energies. This effect could not be attributed to a single perturbation acting on the ground state in different ways. Moreover, oscillator strengths are determined. A discussion is given in terms of the quasi-cubic model. For CdSe, the exciton-LO-phonon interaction is investigated using a line-shape analysis of the absorption lines at different temperatures. Analogous to other II–VI compounds, at higher temperatures (T > 77 K) this interaction is the dominate one for the exciton absorption spectra.},

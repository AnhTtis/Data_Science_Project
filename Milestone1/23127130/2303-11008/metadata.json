    "abstract": "Effective scaffolds for bone tissue-engineering are those that combine adequate mechanical and chemical performance with osseointegrative, angiogenetic and anti-bacterial modes of bioactivity. To address these requirements via a combined approach, we additively manufactured square strut scaffolds by robocasting precipitation-derived strontium/copper co-substituted diopside. Microstructure, mechanical performance, bioactivity, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity were examined. The results show that the presence of strontium and copper in the diopside lattice reduces the grain size and increases the density of the ceramics. The compressive strength, hardness, and fracture toughness of the diopside showed improvement, attributed to a finer microstructure and improved sintering. Scaffolds had excellent compressive strength with a high porosity (68 to 72 %), which is attributed to the structure of the stacked square struts. All materials showed good in vitro bioactivity and favorable proliferation of osteogenic sarcoma cells, while strontium and copper co-doped materials exhibited the strongest anti-Escherichia coli activity. We show that across multiple indicators this system offers pathways towards high-performance bone substitutes.",

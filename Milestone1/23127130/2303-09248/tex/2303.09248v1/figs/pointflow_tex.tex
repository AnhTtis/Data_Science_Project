        \textbf{Anchored voxel generation for occupancy refinement leveraging the predicted depth based on PointFlow.}  % this figure should be anchored feature illustration based on point-flow, what we are seeing here is simply point flow thus misleading people about the over-claim issue...
        An example of occupancy refinement happening on the middle row of the $3\times6\times3$ FBV is shown with geometrically valid voxel highlighted in green. The initial depth prediction is back-projected into FBV and displaced by trilinear interpolation on all depth points, in the range of 6 additional hypothesis points for each depth point. Anchored voxels are extracted from depth points and further serve as a geometrical prior for the occupancy refinement. The voxels of the top row are set as half transparent for clarity.

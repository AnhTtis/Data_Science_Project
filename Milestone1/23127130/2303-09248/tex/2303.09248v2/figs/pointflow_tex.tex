        An example of occupancy refinement happening on the middle row of a $3\times6\times3$ FBV is shown with geometrically valid voxel highlighted in green. The initial depth prediction is back-projected into FBV and displaced by trilinear interpolation on all depth points, in the range of 6 additional hypothesis points for each depth point. The voxels on the top are set as half transparent for clarity.

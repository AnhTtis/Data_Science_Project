	\caption{\textbf{Qualitative 3D semantic segmentation results on ScanNet.} Our method consistently outperforms baseline models and sometimes even surpasses the ground-truth labeling, e.g., in the bottom row, the photo-printed curtain above the bed is correctly recognized as ``curtain'' and ``picture'', whereas the ground truth mistakes it as ``other furniture''.}

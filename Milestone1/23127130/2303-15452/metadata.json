    "abstract": "The radiation environment over the African continent, at aviation altitudes, remains mostly uncharacterized and unregulated. In this paper we present initial measurements made by a newly developed active dosimeter on-board long-haul flights between South Africa and Germany. Based on these initial tests, we believe that this low-cost and open-source dosimeter is suitable for continued operation over the Africa continent and can provide valuable long-term measurements to test dosimteric models and inform aviation policy",

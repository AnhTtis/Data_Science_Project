    "abstract": "Associating the presence of atomic vacancies to excited-state transport phenomena in two dimensional semiconductors is of emerging interest, and demands detailed understanding of the involved exciton transitions. Here we study the effect of such defects on the electronic and optical properties of WS$_2$-graphene and MoS$_2$-graphene van der Waals heterobilayers by employing many-body perturbation theory. We find that the combination of chalcogen defects and graphene adsorption onto the transition metal dichalcogenide layer can radically alter the optical properties of the heterobilayer, due to a combination of dielectric screening, the impact of the missing chalcogen atoms in the intralayer and interlayer optical transitions, and the different nature of each layer. By analyzing the intrinsic radiative rates of the most stable subgap excitonic features, we find that while the presence of defects introduces low-lying optical transitions, resulting in excitons with larger oscillator strength, it also decreases the optical response associated to the pristine-like transition-metal dichalcogenide intralayer excitons. Our findings relate excitonic features with interface design for defect engineering in photovoltaic and transport applications.",

We show that an ensemble of resonant atoms embedded in the center of a planar cavity can be collectively excited by synchrotron radiation into a purely superradiant state. The collective coupling of the atoms via the radiation field leads to a substantial radiative shift of the transition energy, the collective Lamb shift. We simultaneously measured the temporal evolution of the superradiant decay and the collective Lamb shift of resonant 57Fe nuclei excited with 14.4{\textendash}kilo{\textendash}electron volt synchrotron radiation. Our experimental technique provides a simple method for spectroscopic analysis of the superradiant emission.},

We suggest reviving intensity interferometry, which requires hardware which is many orders of magnitude less accurate, at the cost of more limited sensitivity. We present an algorithm to use the very high redundancy of a uniform linear array to increase the sensitivity of the instrument by more than a 100-fold. When using an array of 100 elements, each almost 100 m in diameter, and conservative technological improvements, we can achieve a limiting magnitude of about mb= 14.4. Digitization, storage, and offline processing of all the data will also enable interferometric image reconstruction from a single observation run, and application of various algorithms at any later time. Coronagraphy, selectively suppressing only the large-scale structure of the source, can be achieved by specific aperture shapes. We conclude that after three decades of abandonment optical intensity interferometry deserves another review.}},

A new idea we recently introduced, very high redundancy, alleviates this problem. It enables the relatively simple construction (∼1 cm mechanical precision) of a ground-based astronomical facility able to transform a two-dimensional field of point-like sources to a three-dimensional distribution of microarcsec resolved systems, each imaged in several optical bands. Each system will also have its high-resolution residual timing, high-quality (inside each band) spectra and light curve, emergent flux, effective temperature, polarization effects and perhaps some thermodynamic properties, all directly measured. All the above attributes can be measured in a single observation run of such a dedicated facility.

  abstract = {{The original intensity interferometers were instruments built in the 1950s and 1960s by Hanbury Brown and collaborators, achieving milliarcsec resolutions in visible light without optical-quality mirrors. They exploited a then-novel physical effect, nowadays known as HBT correlation after the experiments of Hanbury Brown and Twiss, and considered fundamental in quantum optics. Now a new generation of intensity interferometers is being designed, raising the possibility of measuring intensity correlations with three or more detectors. Quantum optics predicts two interesting features in many-detector HBT: (i) the signal contains spatial information about the source (such as the bispectrum or closure phase) not present in standard HBT and (ii) correlation increases combinatorially with the number of detectors. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) depends crucially on the number of photons – in practice always ≪1 – detected per coherence time. A simple SNR formula is derived for thermal sources, indicating that three-detector HBT is feasible for bright stars. The many-detector enhancement of HBT would be much more difficult to measure, but seems plausible for bright masers.}},

  abstract = {With its unprecedented light-collecting area for night-sky observations, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) holds great potential for also optical stellar astronomy, in particular as a multi-element intensity interferometer for realizing imaging with sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution. Such an order-of-magnitude increase of the spatial resolution achieved in optical astronomy will reveal the surfaces of rotationally flattened stars with structures in their circumstellar disks and winds, or the gas flows between close binaries. Image reconstruction is feasible from the second-order coherence of light, measured as the temporal correlations of arrival times between photons recorded in different telescopes. This technique (once pioneered by Hanbury Brown and Twiss) connects telescopes only with electronic signals and is practically insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and to imperfections in telescope optics. Detector and telescope requirements are very similar to those for imaging air Cherenkov observatories, the main difference being the signal processing (calculating cross correlations between single camera pixels in pairs of telescopes). Observations of brighter stars are not limited by sky brightness, permitting efficient CTA use during also bright-Moon periods. While other concepts have been proposed to realize kilometer-scale optical interferometers of conventional amplitude (phase-) type, both in space and on the ground, their complexity places them much further into the future than CTA, which thus could become the first kilometer-scale optical imager in astronomy.},

Tuning the stellar parameters of P Cyg and its H α linear diameter, we estimate the distance of P Cyg as 1.56 ± 0.25 kpc, which is compatible within 1σ with 1.36 ± 0.24 kpc reported by the Gaia DR2 catalogue of parallaxes recently published. Both the values are significantly smaller than the canonic value of 1.80 ± 0.10 kpc usually adopted in literature. Our method used to calibrate the distance of P Cyg can apply to very massive and luminous stars both in our Galaxy and neighbouring galaxies, and can improve the so-called wind momentum–luminosity relation that potentially applies to calibrate cosmological candles in the local Universe.}},

One of the promises of optical intensity interferometry is its independence from atmospherically induced phase fluctuations. By performing narrow-band spectral filtering on sunlight and conducting temporal intensity interferometry using actively quenched avalanche photodiodes, the Solar g(2)(τ) signature was directly measured. We observe an averaged photon bunching signal of g(2)(τ) = 1.693 ± 0.003 from the Sun, consistently throughout the day despite fluctuating weather conditions, cloud cover and elevation angle. This demonstrates the robustness of the intensity interferometry technique against atmospheric turbulence and opto-mechanical instabilities, and the feasibility to implement measurement schemes with both large baselines and long integration times.}},

As a light source we use a green LED to simulate starlight. The LED has proven to be a compact high-power source of stochastic light with a special advantage of a small emission area, which favours spatial coherence. Using single-photon correlations, we detect a bunching signal in the second-order correlation function with a coherence time of \&lt;1ps and an amplitude of \&lt;4⋅10{\textminus}4 and describe signal and background quantitatively for a 40 hours measurement.

Of particular interest is the possibility of model-independent image recovery afforded by the good (u, v)-plane coverage of these arrays, as well as recent developments in phase retrieval techniques. The capabilities of these instruments used as SII receivers have already been explored for simple stellar objects, and here the focus is on reconstructing stellar images with non-uniform radiance distributions.

Twiss demonstrated another technique that probes quantum-mechanical correlations in the electromagnetic field. Splitting an incoherent light beam, they found that photon detections in the two daughter beams were correlated: the photons were bunching together. This corresponds to a correlation in the intensity of light in the two beams, which Hanbury-Brown and Twiss suggested could be used to infer the angular size of distant stars. Physicists now rely on the effect to probe the quantum character of complex light sources. [Obituary of Robert Hanbury Brown: Nature 416, 34 (2002)]},

However, with available detector bandwidths, this bunching signal is difficult to observe directly. We present an experimental technique to increase the photon bunching signal in blackbody radiation via spectral filtering of the light source. Our measurements reveal strong temporal photon bunching from blackbody radiation, including the Sun. This technique allows for an absolute measurement of the photon bunching signature g(2)(0), and thereby a direct statement on the statistical nature of a light source. Such filtering techniques may help revive the interest in intensity interferometry as a tool in astronomy.},

The angular size of most stars is of the order of one milliarcsecond or less, and to spatially resolve stellar disks and features at this scale requires an optical interferometer using an array of telescopes with baselines on the order of hundreds of metres. We report on the implementation of a stellar intensity interferometry system developed for the four VERITAS imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The system was used to measure the angular diameter of the two sub-milliarcsecond stars $\beta$ Canis Majoris and ϵ Orionis with a precision of greater than 5{\%}. The system uses an offline approach in which starlight intensity fluctuations that are recorded at each telescope are correlated post observation. The technique can be readily scaled onto tens to hundreds of telescopes, providing a capability that has proven technically challenging to the current generation of optical amplitude interferometry observatories. This work demonstrates the feasibility of performing astrophysical measurements using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays as intensity interferometers and shows the promise for integrating an intensity interferometry system within future observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array.},

The light was collected at the focal plane of a 1-m optical telescope, transported by a multi-mode optical fibre, split into two avalanche photodiodes and correlated digitally in real time. For total exposure times of a few hours, we obtained contrast values around 2 × 10−3, in agreement with the expectation for chaotic sources, given the optical and electronic bandwidths of our set-up. Comparing our results with the measurement of Hanbury Brown et al. for α CMi, we argue for the timely opportunity to extend our experiments to measuring the spatial correlation function over existing and/or foreseen arrays of optical telescopes diluted over several kilometres. This would enable microarcsec long-baseline interferometry in the optical, especially in the visible wavelengths, with a limiting magnitude of 10.}},

  abstract = {It is shown by a quantum-mechanical treatment that the emission times of photoelectrons at different points illuminated by a plane wave of light are partially correlated, and identical results are obtained by a classical theory in which the photocathode is regarded as a square-law detector of suitable conversion efficiency. It is argued that the phenomenon exemplifies the wave rather than the particle aspect of light and that it may most easily be interpreted as a correlation between the intensity fluctuations at different points on a wavefront which arise because of interference between different frequency components of the light. From the point of view of the corpuscular picture the interpretation is much less straight­forward but it is shown that the correlation is directly related to the so-called bunching of photons which arises because light quanta are mutually indistinguishable and obey Bose-Einstein statistics. However, it is stressed that the use of the photon concept before the light energy is actually detected is highly misleading since, in an interference experiment, the electromagnetic field behaves in a manner which cannot be explained in terms of classical particles. The quantitative predictions of the theory have been confirmed by laboratory experi­ments and the phenomenon has been used, in an interferometer, to measure the apparent angular diameter of Sirius: these results, together with further applications to astronomy, will be discussed in detail in later papers. It is shown that the classical and quantum treatments give identical results when applied to find the fluctuations in the photoemission current produced by a single light beam, and the connexion between these fluctuations and the correlation between photons in coherent beams is pointed out. The results given here are in full agreement with those obtained by Kahn from an analysis based on quantum statistics: however, they differ from those derived on thermodynamical grounds by Fellgett and by Clark Jones and the reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.},

Here we discuss inherent sources of noise affecting IDI and derive a model to estimate the dependence of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the photon counts per pixel, the temporal coherence (or number of modes), and the shape of the imaged object. Simulations in two- and three-dimensions have been performed to validate the predictions of the model. We find that contrary to coherent imaging methods, higher intensities and higher detected counts do not always correspond to a larger SNR. Also, larger and more complex objects generally yield a poorer SNR despite the higher measured counts. The framework developed here should be a valuable guide to future experimental design.},

  abstract = {Incoherent diffractive imaging (IDI) promises structural analysis with atomic resolution based on intensity interferometry of pulsed X-ray fluorescence emission. However, its experimental realization is still pending and a comprehensive theory of contrast formation has not been established to date. Explicit expressions are derived for the equal-pulse two-point intensity correlations, as the principal measured quantity of IDI, with full control of the prefactors, based on a simple model of stochastic fluorescence emission. The model considers the photon detection statistics, the finite temporal coherence of the individual emissions, as well as the geometry of the scattering volume. The implications are interpreted in view of the most relevant quantities, including the fluorescence lifetime, the excitation pulse, as well as the extent of the scattering volume and pixel size. Importantly, the spatiotemporal overlap between any two emissions in the sample can be identified as a crucial factor limiting the contrast and its dependency on the sample size can be derived. The paper gives rigorous estimates for the optimum sample size, the maximum photon yield and the expected signal-to-noise ratio under optimal conditions. Based on these estimates, the feasibility of IDI experiments for plausible experimental parameters is discussed. It is shown in particular that the mean number of photons per detector pixel which can be achieved with X-ray fluorescence is severely limited and as a consequence imposes restrictive constraints on possible applications.},

  abstract  = {Near-infrared interferometers have recently imaged a number of rapidly rotating A-type stars, finding levels of gravity darkening inconsistent with theoretical expectations. Here, we present new imaging of both a cooler star β Cas (F2IV) and a hotter one α Leo (B7V) using the CHARA array and the MIRC instrument at the H band. Adopting a solid-body rotation model with a simple gravity darkening prescription, we modeled the stellar geometric properties and surface temperature distributions, confirming that both stars are rapidly rotating and show gravity darkening anomalies. We estimate the masses and ages of these rapid rotators on L–Rpol and H-R diagrams constructed for non-rotating stars by tracking their non-rotating equivalents. The unexpected fast rotation of the evolved sub-giant β Cas offers a unique test of the stellar core–envelope coupling, revealing quite efficient coupling over the past ∼0.5 Gyr. Lastly, we summarize all our interferometric determinations of the gravity darkening coefficient for rapid rotators, finding that none match the expectations from the widely used von Zeipel gravity darkening laws. Since the conditions of the von Zeipel law are known to be violated for rapidly rotating stars, we recommend using the empirically derived β = 0.19 for such stars with radiation-dominated envelopes. Furthermore, we note that no paradigm exists for self-consistently modeling heavily gravity-darkened stars that show hot radiative poles with cool convective equators.},

The interferometer consisted of a pair of 6.5 m telescopes (30 m2) with relatively crude optics, similar to those currently in use as Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes (ACTs). We explore the possibility of implementing a modern intensity interferometer on an ACT array. Developments in fast digital signal processing technology now make such a system relatively easy to implement, and provide improved sensitivity. Allowing measurements at short wavelengths (<400 nm), with long baselines (>100 m), which are still challenging for Michelson interferometers, present ACT arrays could be used to probe angular structures as small as ~0.2 mas and smaller, with large array projects already being discussed. This would provide measurements of stellar diameters, binary systems, circumstellar environments, and possibly stellar surface features. ACT arrays could be used as intensity interferometers during bright moon periods, providing valuable scientific output for little expense and no impact on the γ-ray observing schedule.},

We pause both to reflect on decades of immense progress in the field as well as to prepare for a new generation of large interferometers just now being commissioned (most notably, the CHARA, Keck and VLT Interferometers). First, this review summarizes the basic principles behind stellar interferometry needed by the lay-physicist and general astronomer to understand the scientific potential as well as technical challenges of interferometry. Next, the basic design principles of practical interferometers are discussed, using the experience of past and existing facilities to illustrate important points. Here there is significant discussion of current trends in the field, including the new facilities under construction and advanced technologies being debuted. This decade has seen the influence of stellar interferometry extend beyond classical regimes of stellar diameters and binary orbits to new areas such as mapping the accretion discs around young stars, novel calibration of the cepheid period-luminosity relation, and imaging of stellar surfaces. The third section is devoted to the major scientific results from interferometry, grouped into natural categories reflecting these current developments. Lastly, I consider the future of interferometry, highlighting the kinds of new science promised by the interferometers coming on-line in the next few years. I also discuss the longer-term future of optical interferometry, including the prospects for space interferometry and the possibilities of large-scale ground-based projects. Critical technological developments are still needed to make these projects attractive and affordable.},

  abstract  = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 μas, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6× better than in previous studies. The central object mass is , where the fractional statistical error of 1.5% is nearly independent from R0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R0 = 8.33 ± 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 ±  0.06) × 106(R0/8 kpc)2.19M☉. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

  abstract  = {In the past decade, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have gradually become an indispensable part of any demanding quantum optics experiment. Until now, most SNSPDs have been coupled to single-mode fibers. SNSPDs coupled to multimode fibers have shown promising efficiencies but have yet to achieve high time resolution. For a number of applications ranging from quantum nano-photonics to bio-optics, high efficiency and high time resolution are desired at the same time. In this paper, we demonstrate the role of polarization on the efficiency of multimode-fiber-coupled detectors and fabricated high-performance 20 {\textmu}m, 25 {\textmu}m, and 50 {\textmu}m diameter detectors targeted for visible, near-infrared, and telecom wavelengths. A custom-built setup was used to simulate realistic experiments with randomized modes in the fiber. We achieved over 80\% system efficiency and \$ \{\{\textblackslash\}lt\} \{20\}\{\textblackslash\};\{\{\textblackslash\}rm ps\}\$\&lt;20ps timing jitter for 20 {\textmu}m SNSPDs. Also, we realized 70\% system efficiency and \$ \{\{\textblackslash\}lt\} \{20\}\{\textblackslash\};\{\{\textblackslash\}rm ps\}\$\&lt;20ps timing jitter for 50 {\textmu}m SNSPDs. The high-efficiency multimode-fiber-coupled SNSPDs with unparalleled time resolution will benefit various quantum optics experiments and applications in the future.},

Using two marginally resolved stars (α Lyr and β Ori) with R magnitudes of 0.01 and 0.13, respectively, we demonstrate that 4-h correlation exposures provide reliable visibilities, whilst a significant loss of contrast is found on α Aur, in agreement with its binary-star nature.}},

  abstract = {{Stellar intensity interferometry is a technique based on the measurement of the second-order spatial correlation of the light emitted from a star. The physical information provided by these measurements is the angular size and structure of the emitting source. A worldwide effort is presently underway to implement stellar intensity interferometry on telescopes separated by long baselines and on future arrays of Cherenkov telescopes. We describe an experiment of this type, realized at the Asiago Observatory (Italy), in which we performed for the first time measurements of the correlation counting photon coincidences in post-processing by means of a single photon software correlator and exploiting entirely the quantum properties of the light emitted from a star. We successfully detected the temporal correlation of Vega at zero baseline and performed a measurement of the correlation on a projected baseline of ∼2 km. The average discrete degree of coherence at zero baseline for Vega is \\$\\lt g^\\{(2)\\} \\gt \\, = 1.0034 \\pm 0.0008\\$, providing a detection with a signal-to-noise ratio S/N ≳ 4. No correlation is detected over the km baseline. The measurements are consistent with the expected degree of spatial coherence for a source with the 3.3 mas angular diameter of Vega. The experience gained with the Asiago experiment will serve for future implementations of stellar intensity interferometry on long-baseline arrays of Cherenkov telescopes.}},

abstract = {Astronomical imaging can be broadly classified into two types. The first type is amplitude interferometry, which includes conventional optical telescopes and very large baseline interferometry (VLBI). The second type is intensity interferometry, which relies on Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type measurements. At optical frequencies, where direct phase measurements are impossible, amplitude interferometry has an effective numerical aperture that is limited by the distance from which photons can coherently interfere. Intensity interferometry, on the other hand, correlates only photon fluxes and can thus support much larger numerical apertures, but suffers from a reduced signal due to the low average photon number per mode in thermal light. It has hitherto not been clear which method is superior under realistic conditions. Here, we give a comparative analysis of the performance of amplitude and intensity interferometry, and we relate this to the fundamental resolution limit that can be achieved in any physical measurement. Using the benchmark problem of determining the separation between two distant thermal point sources, e.g., two adjacent stars, we give a short tutorial on optimal estimation theory and apply it to stellar interferometry. We find that for very small angular separations the large baseline achievable in intensity interferometry can more than compensate for the reduced signal strength. We also explore options for practical implementations of very large baseline intensity interferometry (VLBII).}}

    abstract = "{In this paper, we report on spatial intensity interferometry measurements within the  Hα line on two stars: the Luminous Blue Variable supergiant P Cygni and the late-type B supergiant Rigel. The experimental setup was upgraded to allow simultaneous measurement of two polarization channels, instead of one in our previous setup, and the zero baseline correlation function on-sky to validate independent estimates obtained from the stellar spectrum and the instrumental spectral throughput. Combined with simultaneous spectra measurements and based on radiative transfer models calculated with the code CMFGEN, we were able to fit our measured visibility curves to extract the stellar distances. Our distance determinations for both P Cygni (1.61 ± 0.18 kpc) and Rigel (0.26 ± 0.02 kpc) agree very well with the values provided by astrometry with the Gaia and Hipparcos missions, respectively. This result for Rigel was obtained by adopting a stellar luminosity of L⋆ = 123 000 L⊙, which is reported in the literature as being consistent with the Hipparcos distance to Rigel. However, due to the lack of consensus on Rigel’s luminosity, we also explore how the adoption of the stellar luminosity in our models affects our distance determination for Rigel. In conclusion, we support, in an independent way, the distance to Rigel as the one provided by the Hipparcos mission, when taking the luminosity of 123 000 L⊙ at face value. This study is the first successful step towards extending the application of the Wind Momentum Luminosity Relation method for distance calibration from an LBV supergiant to a more normal late-type B supergiant.}",

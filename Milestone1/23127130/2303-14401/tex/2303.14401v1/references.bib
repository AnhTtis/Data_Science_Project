 abstract = {The summarization of large quantities of multivariate data by clusters, undefined a priori, is increasingly practiced, often irrelevantly and unjustifiably. This paper attempts to survey the burgeoning bibliography, restricting itself to published, freely available, references of known provenance. A plethora of definitions of similarity and of cluster are presented. The principles, but not details of implementation, of the many empirical classification techniques currently in use are discussed, and limitations and short-comings in their development and practice are pointed out. Methods based on well-defined mathematical formulations of the problem are emphasized, and other ways of summarizing data are suggested as alternatives to classification. The growing tendency to regard numerical taxonomy as a satisfactory alternative to clear thinking is condemned.},

abstract="Between 1936 and 1940 Fisher published four articles on statistical discriminant analysis, in the first of which [CP 138] he described and applied the linear discriminant function. Prior to Fisher the main emphasis of research in this, area was on measures of difference between populations based on multiple measurements. In this presentation, I shall briefly summarize the early work from Karl Pearson up to Mahalanobis, and then describe the major contributions associated with Fisher. These include the derivation of the linear discriminant function and its relationship to regression in the two-sample case, extensions to s populations for s 003E 2, and a test of significance associated with the linear discriminant function.",

abstract = {The sigmoid function is very widely used as a neuron activation function in artificial neural networks, which makes its attributes a matter of some interest. This paper presents some general results on the derivatives of the sigmoid. These results relate the coefficients of various derivatives to standard number sequences from combinatorial theory, and thus provide a standard efficient way of calculating these derivatives. Such derivatives can be used in approximating the effect of input perturbations on the output of single neurons and could also be useful in statistical modeling applications.},

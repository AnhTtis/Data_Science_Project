\begin{abstract}
The polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis is a problem that can be leveraged using prognostication based learning procedures. Many implementations of PCOS can be seen with Machine Learning but the algorithms have certain limitations in utilizing the processing power graphical processing units. The simple machine learning algorithms can be improved with advanced frameworks using Deep Learning. The Linear Discriminant Analysis is a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm for classification that can be boosted in terms of performance using deep learning with Deep LDA, a transformed version of the traditional LDA. In this result oriented paper we present the Deep LDA implementation with a variation for prognostication of PCOS.

\section{Conclusion}
The idea of entire paper revolves around an experimentation that can be performed for polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis problem. We proved a point that simple machine learning algorithms can be leveraged using deep learning for efficient performance based inclination. The Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis idea was proven in this paper. We also introduced some of our personal variations in implementation and they turned out to be effective from the results section of the paper. The paper can definitely sum up many lost ideas into practical implementation and enforce many young researchers for better development perspective.

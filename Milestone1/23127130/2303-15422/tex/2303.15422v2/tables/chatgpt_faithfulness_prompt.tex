   Given a keyphrase with the corresponding document, rate its faithfulness on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 for not faithful at all and 5 for perfectly faithful). If a keyphrase is irrelevant, i.e., not actually discussed by the document, then it should receive a low faithfulness score. Abbreviations may be treated as faithful phrases as long as they are valid. [digit] symbols may also be treated as faithful. Note that phrases appear as a subtring of the text can be an unfaithful keyphrase, and that phrases absent from the text can be perfectly faithful. You may use partial scores (decimals). Only output score. Do not output anything else. \\ \\

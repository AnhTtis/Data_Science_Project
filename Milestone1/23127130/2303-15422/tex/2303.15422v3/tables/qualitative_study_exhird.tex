    \textbf{Title:} yet another write optimized dbms layer for flash based solid state storage . \\
    \textbf{Abstract:} flash based solid state storage ( flashsss ) has write oriented problems such as low write throughput , and limited life time . especially , flashssds have a characteristic vulnerable to random writes , due to its control logic utilizing parallelism between the flash memory chips . in this paper , we present a write optimized layer of dbmss to address the write oriented problems of flashsss in on line transaction processing environments . the layer consists of a write optimized buffer , a corresponding log space , and an in memory mapping table , closely associated with a novel logging scheme called incremental logging ( icl ) . the icl scheme enables dbmss to reduce page writes at the least expense of additional page reads , while replacing random writes into sequential writes . through experiments , our approach demonstrated up to an order of magnitude performance enhancement in i o processing time compared to the original dbms , increasing the longevity of flashsss by approximately a factor of two . \\

    \textbf{Title:} bicepstrum based blind identification of the acoustic emission ( ae ) signal in precision turning . \\
    \textbf{Abstract:} it is believed that the acoustic emissions ( ae ) signal contains potentially valuable information for monitoring precision cutting processes , as well as to be employed as a control feedback signal . however , ae stress waves produced in the cutting zone are distorted by the transmission path and the measurement systems . in this article , a bicepstrum based blind system identification technique is proposed as a valid tool for estimating both , transmission path and sensor impulse response . assumptions under which application of bicepstrum is valid are discussed and diamond turning experiments are presented , which demonstrate the feasibility of employing bicepstrum for ae blind identification . \\

    "abstract": "In the evaluation of the half-life of the neutrinoless double-$β$ decay ($0νββ$) of a doubly closed-subshell nucleus $^{96}$Zr, the structure of the nucleus $^{96}$Mo is essentially important. The $α$-clustering aspects of $^{96}$Mo are investigated for the first time. By studying the nuclear rainbows in $α$ scattering from $^{92}$Zr at high energies and the characteristic structure of the excitation functions at the extreme backward angle at the low-energy region, the interaction potential between the $α$ particle and the $^{92}$Zr nucleus is determined well in the double folding model. The validity of the double folding model was reinforced by studying $α$ scattering from neighboring nuclei $^{90}$Zr, $^{91}$Zr, and $^{94}$Zr. The double-folding-model calculations reproduced well all the observed angular distributions over a wide range of incident energies and the characteristic excitation functions. By using the obtained potential the $α$ +$^{92}$Zr cluster structure of $^{96}$Mo is investigated in the spirit of a unified description of scattering and structure. The existence of the second-higher nodal band states with the $α$+ $^{92}$Zr cluster structure, in which two more nodes are excited in the relative motion compared with the ground band, is demonstrated. The calculation reproduces well the ground-band states of $^{96}$Mo in agreement with experiment. The experimental $B(E2)$ value of the transition in the ground band is also reproduced well. The effect of $α$ clustering in $^{96}$Mo on the the half-life of the $0νββ$ double-$β$ decay of $^{96}$Zr is discussed.",

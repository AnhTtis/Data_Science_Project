\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-3pt}

This work proposes and evaluates \netName, an \hongyi{sequence} model that plans and refines a trajectory through energy minimization. The energy-minimization is done iteratively - where actions are sequentially along a trajectory. \hongyi{Our current approach is limited to discrete spaces -- relaxing this using approaches such as discrete binning~\citep{janner2021tt} would further be interesting.}

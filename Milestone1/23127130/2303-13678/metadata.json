    "abstract": "If a flat, horizontal, plate settles onto a flat surface, it is known that the gap $h$ decreases with time $t$ as a power-law: $h\\sim t^{-1/2}$. We consider what happens if the plate is not initially horizontal, and/or the centre of mass is not symmetrically positioned: does one edge contact the surface in finite time, or does the plate approach the horizontal without making contact? The dynamics of this system is analysed and shown to be remarkably complex.",

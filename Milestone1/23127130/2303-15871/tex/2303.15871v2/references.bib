abstract = {Barrier functions (also called certificates) have been an important tool for the verification of hybrid systems, and have also played important roles in optimization and multi-objective control. The extension of a barrier function to a controlled system results in a control barrier function. This can be thought of as being analogous to how Sontag extended Lyapunov functions to control Lypaunov functions in order to enable controller synthesis for stabilization tasks. A control barrier function enables controller synthesis for safety requirements specified by forward invariance of a set using a Lyapunov-like condition. This paper develops several important extensions to the notion of a control barrier function. The first involves robustness under perturbations to the vector field defining the system. Input-to-State stability conditions are given that provide for forward invariance, when disturbances are present, of a “relaxation” of set rendered invariant without disturbances. A control barrier function can be combined with a control Lyapunov function in a quadratic program to achieve a control objective subject to safety guarantees. The second result of the paper gives conditions for the control law obtained by solving the quadratic program to be Lipschitz continuous and therefore to gives rise to well-defined solutions of the resulting closed-loop system.}

This problem appears in several diverse fields including robotics, air vehicles, underwater vehicles and computer animation. Most of the existing literature on collision prediction assumes objects to be modelled as spheres. While the conservative spherical bounding box is valid in many cases, in many other cases, where objects operate in close proximity, a less conservative approach, that allows objects to be modelled using analytic surfaces that closely mimic the shape of the object, is more desirable. In this paper, a collision cone approach (previously developed only for objects moving on a plane) is used to determine collision between objects, moving in 3-D space, whose shapes can be modelled by general quadric surfaces. Exact collision conditions for such quadric surfaces are obtained and used to derive dynamic inversion based avoidance strategies.},

  abstract = { In this paper, a hybrid missile guidance algorithm is proposed for planar engagement scenarios. The method combines nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with a collision cone approach, and enables the guidance algorithm to achieve interception, while ensuring that the impact angle lies in a predefined range. The guidance scheme comprises two components: 1) point-mass-based NMPC and 2) collision-cone-based NMPC. The point-mass-based NMPC is employed when the distance between the missile and the target is large, and when this distance falls below a threshold, the algorithm switches to a collision-cone-based NMPC. Connections between the impact angle and the collision cone are theoretically established, and these are used in the collision-cone-based NMPC. The NMPC problems are formulated as quadratic programs that include appropriate constraints on the states and inputs, while not requiring target acceleration information. These quadratic programs are shown to be strictly convex. Detailed simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }

    abstract = { This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time.The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories.The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario. }

ABSTRACT = {Path planning algorithms are used by mobile robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous cars in order to identify safe, efficient, collision-free, and least-cost travel paths from an origin to a destination. Choosing an appropriate path planning algorithm helps to ensure safe and effective point-to-point navigation, and the optimal algorithm depends on the robot geometry as well as the computing constraints, including static/holonomic and dynamic/non-holonomically-constrained systems, and requires a comprehensive understanding of contemporary solutions. The goal of this paper is to help novice practitioners gain an awareness of the classes of path planning algorithms used today and to understand their potential use cases—particularly within automated or unmanned systems. To that end, we provide broad, rather than deep, coverage of key and foundational algorithms, with popular algorithms and variants considered in the context of different robotic systems. The definitions, summaries, and comparisons are relevant to novice robotics engineers and embedded system developers seeking a primer of available algorithms.},

However, the method is valid only for time-invariant environments; we cannot apply the method to a moving obstacle avoidance problem of a vehicle. In fact, the time-varying state constraint problem is a difficult problem. In this paper, we consider a time-invariant graph space for a time-varying state space. Then, we propose a time-varying CBF and human assist control based on the time-varying CBF for given time-varying environments. Moreover, we propose environment-adaptive human assist control for unknown environments. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by computer simulation.}

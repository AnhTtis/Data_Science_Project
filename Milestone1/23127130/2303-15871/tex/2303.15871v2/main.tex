\begin{abstract}
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), specifically quadrotors, have revolutionized various industries with their maneuverability and versatility, but their safe operation in dynamic environments heavily relies on effective collision avoidance techniques. This paper introduces a novel technique for safely navigating a quadrotor along a desired route while avoiding kinematic obstacles. We propose a new constraint formulation that employs control barrier functions (CBFs) and collision cones to ensure that the relative velocity between the quadrotor and the obstacle always avoids a cone of vectors that may lead to a collision. By showing that the proposed constraint is a valid CBF for quadrotors, we are able to leverage its real-time implementation via Quadratic Programs (QPs), called the CBF-QPs. Validation includes PyBullet simulations and hardware experiments on Crazyflie 2.1, demonstrating effectiveness in static and moving obstacle scenarios. Comparative analysis with literature, especially higher order CBF-QPs, highlights the proposed approach's less conservative nature.

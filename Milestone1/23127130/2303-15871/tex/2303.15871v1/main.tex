\begin{abstract}
 % In this paper, we propose a method that allows a highly dynamic system like quadrotor to follow a set path while avoiding highly kinematic obstacles (of various sizes) with safety guarantees. The safe region is constructed using concepts of control barrier functions (CBF) and collision cone while explicitly considering the nonlinear underactuated dynamics of the quadrotor. We also compare the performance of this controller with the state of the art Higher Order CBF based controller. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a quadrotor in simulation with static and moving obstacles of various sizes.
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), specifically quadrotors, have revolutionized various industries with their maneuverability and versatility, but their safe operation in dynamic environments heavily relies on effective collision avoidance techniques. 
% To this end, this paper presents a novel approach for enabling a quadrotor to navigate a desired route while avoiding kinematic obstacles with safety guarantees. The proposed technique incorporates control barrier functions by using the concept of collision cones. The main idea behind the collision cones (CC) is to realize a constraint inequality that ensures that the velocity of the quadrotor and the obstacle are always pointing away from each other. In other words, the proposed constraint ensures that the relative velocity always avoids assuming a cone of vectors (set of possible directions leading to collision). We formally show that for the quadrotor model, this constraint inequality is a valid control barrier function (CBF). We incorporate a real-time controller by using this CBF, called the CBF-QP and demonstrate collision avoidance in a simulated environment. 
This paper introduces a novel technique for safely navigating a quadrotor along a desired route while avoiding kinematic obstacles. The proposed approach employs control barrier functions and utilizes collision cones to ensure that the quadrotor's velocity and the obstacle's velocity always point away from each other. In particular, we propose a new constraint formulation that ensures that the relative velocity between the quadrotor and the obstacle always avoids a cone of vectors that may lead to a collision. 
By showing that the proposed constraint is a valid control barrier function (CBFs) for quadrotors, we are able to leverage on its real-time implementation via Quadratic Programs (QPs), called the CBF-QPs.
We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CBF-QPs by demonstrating collision avoidance with moving obstacles under multiple scenarios. This is shown in the pybullet simulator.
% We validate the proposed approach by demonstrating its effectiveness through the CBF-QP real-time controller in a simulated environment. 
Furthermore we compare the proposed approach with CBF-QPs shown in literature, especially the well-known higher order CBF-QPs (HO-CBF-QPs), where in we show that it is more conservative compared to the proposed approach. This comparison also shown in simulation in detail.

% The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated by comparing it to the existing state-of-the-art CBF formulations including the Higher Order CBFs. The approach is then demonstrated by implementing it on a quadrotor in a simulated environment with stationary and non-stationary obstacles of varying shapes and sizes, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.
% In this paper, we propose a novel Quadratic Program (QP) based control approach for quadrotor to navigate a cluttered environment, avoiding a range of kinematic obstacles safely. By incorporating concepts such as control barrier functions (CBF) \& collision cones and accounting for the nonlinear underactuated dynamics of the quadrotor, we can construct a safe region, which allows us to tackle these challenges. We assess the efficacy of our controller by comparing it to the state of the art  Higher Order CBF based controller. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach by implementing it on a quadrotor in a simulated environment featuring obstacles of varying shapes, both stationary and nonstationary and showing its robustness in multiple obstacle environments.

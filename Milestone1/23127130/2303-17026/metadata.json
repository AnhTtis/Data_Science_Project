    "abstract": "The production of $Υ$(2S) and $Υ$(3S) mesons in lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions is studied in their dimuon decay channel using the CMS detector at the LHC. The $Υ$(3S) meson is observed for the first time in PbPb collisions, with a significance above five standard deviations. The ratios of yields measured in PbPb and pp collisions are reported for both the $Υ$(2S) and $Υ$(3S) mesons, as functions of transverse momentum and PbPb collision centrality. These ratios, when appropriately scaled, are significantly less than unity, indicating a suppression of $Υ$ yields in PbPb collisions. This suppression increases from peripheral to central PbPb collisions. Furthermore, the suppression is stronger for $Υ$(3S) mesons compared to $Υ$(2S) mesons, extending the pattern of sequential suppression of quarkonium states in nuclear collisions previously seen for the $ψ$/J, $ψ$(2S), $Υ$(1S), and $Υ$(2S) mesons.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by a question of Baldi-Klingler-Ullmo, we provide a general sufficient criterion for the existence and analytic density of typical Hodge loci associated to a polarizable $\\mathbb{Z}$-variation of Hodge structures $\\mathbb{V}$. Our criterion reproves the existing results in the literature on density of Noether-Lefschetz loci. It also applies to understand Hodge loci of subvarieties of $\\mathcal{A}_g$ . For instance, we prove that for $g \\geq 4$, if a subvariety $S$ of $\\mathcal{A}_g$ has dimension at least $g$ then it has an analytically dense typical Hodge locus. This applies for example to the Torelli locus of $\\mathcal{A}_g$",

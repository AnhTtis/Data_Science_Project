    "abstract": "Let $A$ be an Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring. Enomoto conjectured that a self-orthogonal $A$-module has finite projective dimension. We prove this conjecture for $A$ having the property that every indecomposable non-projective maximal Cohen-Macaulay module is periodic. This answers a question of Enomoto and shows the conjecture for monomial quiver algebras and hypersurface rings.",

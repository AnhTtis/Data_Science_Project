% \section{The GC distribution in NGC 1052}
% \label{sec:appendixA}

% In Fig. \ref{fig:GC_dist}, we show the positions of every GC candidate selected according to the criteria described in Section \ref{sec:GC}.

The black ellipse is the half-light radius found for the total GC distribution of the central galaxy, NGC 1052. Blue and red ellipses are the half-light radius for the blue and red GC distribution respectively. All points are overplotted in the combined CFHT $g$ ban image of the group NGC 1052.}

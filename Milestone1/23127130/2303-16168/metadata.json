    "abstract": "We present a new catalogue of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Galaxy. The catalogue contains source names, coordinates, source types, fluxes, distances, system parameters, and other characteristic properties of 349 LMXBs, including systems that have been newly discovered or reclassified since the most recently reported LMXB catalogues. The aim of this catalogue is to provide a list of all currently known Galactic objects identified as LMXBs with some basic information on each system (including X-ray and optical/IR properties where possible). Literature published before May 2023 has been taken into account where possible when compiling this information. References for all reported properties as well as object-finding charts in several energy bands are provided as part of the catalogue. We plan to update the catalogue regularly, in particular to reflect new objects discovered in the ongoing large-scale surveys such as Gaia and eROSITA.",

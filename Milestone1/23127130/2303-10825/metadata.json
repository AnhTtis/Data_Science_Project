    "abstract": "TenCirChem is an open-source Python library for simulating variational quantum algorithms for quantum computational chemistry. Its easy-to-use high-level interface enables users to optimize molecular energies or study quantum dynamics in only a few lines of code, while still allowing for a high degree of flexibility and customizability. By making use of compact representations of quantum states and excitation operators, efficient quantum circuits for fermionic excitations, and the powerful TensorCircuit software framework, TenCirChem displays high performance in simulating both noiseless and noisy quantum circuits, even when large numbers of qubits and tunable parameters are involved. As an example, we use it to compute the potential energy surface of water with 6-31G(d) basis set and (8e, 17o) active space using a quantum circuit ansatz of 34 qubits with 565 independent parameters, and achieve an equilibrium bond length error to 0.01 angstrom with respect to experiments.",

    \caption{\textbf{The content-based video and music matching system.} For training, we collect several pieces of music and several videos using the same background music. Hence, one music matches several videos. 
    In testing, \closesetname{} set (existing music in training) can be addressed as classifying a video to a set of music identities. The \opensetname{} set (new music unseen in training) can be viewed as performing video verification by comparing the similarity between the video and the new music identities.}
    %We define the \closesetname{} set of testing as the music that exists in the training set; the \opensetname{} set of testing as the music that is new from the training set.

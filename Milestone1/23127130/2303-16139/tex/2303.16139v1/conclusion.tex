\section{Conclusion}

%We have shown that it is possible to run a DBO system in the cloud with very low latency and high throughput. Tail latency (p999) is high but there is still room for improvement; our CES and RB  software implementations use a single thread to handle RX/TX and we use standard VMs (no single tenancy guarantees) which can experience interference (on-host multi-tenancy) and strict network bandwidth/rate limitations.
In this paper we have presented DBO, a practical system to ensure fairness in the cloud for speed traders. DBO is incrementally deployable and achieves guaranteed fairness and low latency while still operating at high transaction rates.

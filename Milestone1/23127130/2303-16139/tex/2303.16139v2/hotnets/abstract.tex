%\pg{Work in progress} Despite significant advancements in cloud computing technology in recent years, some workloads remain unsuitable for the cloud.
%Currently, financial market infrastructure is housed in on-premise data centers. There are several reasons that encourage the move of important financial market services to the public cloud, including elastic resource scalability and significant cost savings. Moving the financial ecosystem to the cloud, on the other hand, necessitates overcoming considerable difficulties and potentially adopting a new operational paradigm. 
%The  operation of modern financial exchange servers relies on predictably equal and low latency for all market transactions: cloud networks, however, were not initially designed to retain such features, particularly affecting fairness for all market participants.

%In this paper, we attempt to solve the problem of unfairness that stems from the lack of determinism in contemporary cloud networks. We show that predictable %latency is not necessary to achieve fairness, and we present a few scalable strategies that yield \im{good, perfect, satisfactory} fairness while incrementally %deployable in contemporary cloud environments. Our system outperforms the current state-of-the-art in simulation \im{by XX\%} while at the same time avoiding %critical limitations.  \pg{I dont like the last two lines can we just leave it at we explore the use of logical clocks for fairness.} 

%In this paper, we consider the problem of supporting modern financial exchange services on the cloud premises. Important financial exchange services rely on predictable, equal latency from the servers to the participants for fairness. Contemporary cloud networks, however, are unable to offer such property, as they were not originally designed for this purpose. We attempt to tackle the problem of unfairness that stems from the lack of determinism in contemporary cloud networks. We argue that predictable latency is not necessary to achieve fairness, and we propose a novel approach that is deployable in contemporary cloud environments. We evaluate our approach in simulation and we show how it is feasible to achieve fairness even under unbounded and fluctuating network latency.  Our approach avoids limitations of state-of-the-art and outperforms it.% by a factor of X\%.

Existing cloud networks, however, are unable to offer such property, as they were not originally designed for this purpose. We attempt to tackle the problem of unfairness that stems from the lack of determinism in cloud networks. We argue that predictable or bounded latency is not necessary to achieve fairness. Inspired by the use of logical clocks in distributed systems, we propose a new approach that is deployable in contemporary cloud environments. We evaluate our approach in simulation and show that it is feasible to achieve fairness under highly variable network latency. Our approach avoids limitations of state-of-the-art and outperforms it.}

We attempt to tackle the problem of unfairness that stems from the lack of determinism in cloud networks. We argue that predictable or bounded latency is not necessary to achieve fairness. Inspired by the use of logical clocks in distributed systems, we propose a new approach that instead corrects for differences in latency to the participants for fairness. We evaluate our approach in simulation and show that it is feasible to achieve fairness under highly variable network latency. Our approach is deployable in contemporary cloud environments; it avoids limitations of state-of-the-art and outperforms it.}

\section{Conclusion}
%This paper proposes a new architecture for Cloud-hosted Financial Exchanges that can provide response-time fairness, i.e. market participants that respond faster to market data are serviced first. Our system overcomes variation in link latencies and lack of accurate clock sync in the cloud through a new technique called Delivery Clocks,  which enables an ordering (DBO) with  strong fairness properties. Our scheme outperforms prior proposals that are based on enabling accurate time sync in the cloud. Although we have demonstrated the benefits of DBO in the context of a financial exchange, we note that delivery clocks will also benefit other cloud-hosted applications, such as multi-player games and ad exchanges. 
%This paper proposes a new approach for achieving response-time fairness in cloud-hosted exchanges. We introduce logical "Delivery Clocks" and show how they can be used to order trades fairly with high probability even when network latency is highly variable and clocks in the network are not synchronized. Further, while we focus on fairness for financial exchanges, our approach is general and applicable for providing fairness in many other settings such as multi-player cloud gaming and advertisement exchanges.

%This paper proposes a new approach for achieving response-time fairness in cloud-hosted financial  exchanges. We presented the concept of logical "Delivery Clocks" and showed how they can be used to order trades fairly with high probability at the presence of highly variable network latency, without requiring clock synchronization. Further, although we focussed on fairness for financial exchanges, our approach is general and suitable for providing fairness in various other settings such as multi-player cloud gaming and advertisement exchanges.

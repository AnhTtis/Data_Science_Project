%OLD ABSTRACT
In this paper, we consider the problem of hosting financial exchanges in the cloud. 
%supporting modern financial exchange services on the cloud premises.
Financial exchanges require predictable, equal latency to all market participants to ensure fairness for various tasks, such as high speed trading.
%Important exchange services rely on predictable, equal latency from the servers to the participants for fair competition. 
However, it is extremely difficult to ensure equal latency to all market participants in existing cloud deployments, because of various reasons, such as congestion, and unequal network paths. 
%Existing cloud networks, however, are unable to offer such property, as they were not originally designed for this purpose. 
In this paper, we address the unfairness that stems from lack of determinism in cloud networks.
%We tackle the problem of unfairness that stems from the lack of determinism in cloud networks. 
We argue that predictable or bounded latency is not necessary to achieve  fairness. Inspired by the use of logical clocks in distributed systems, we present Delivery Based Ordering (DBO), a new approach that ensures fairness by instead correcting for differences in latency to the participants. We evaluate DBO both in our hardware test bed and in a public cloud deployment and demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve guaranteed fairness and sub-100\textmu s latency while operating at high transaction rates. %DBO is incrementally deployable in today's cloud environments.%; it avoids limitations of state-of-the-art and outperforms it.

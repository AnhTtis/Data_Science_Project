    "abstract": "Let $X$ denote a random vector having a Bingham distribution on ${\\mathcal{S}}^{d-1}$, the unit sphere centered at the origin in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$. With $Σ$ denoting the symmetric matrix parameter of the distribution, let $Ψ(Σ)$ be the corresponding normalizing constant of the distribution. We derive for $Ψ(Σ)$ and its first-order partial derivatives complete asymptotic expansions as $d \\to \\infty$. These expansions are obtained under the growth condition that $\\|Σ\\|$, the Frobenius norm of $Σ$, satisfies $\\|Σ\\| = O(d^{r/2})$, where $0 \\le r < 1$. As a consequence, we obtain for the covariance matrix of $X$ an asymptotic expansion up to terms of arbitrary degree in $Σ$.",

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Current OOD robustness certification relies on external discriminators or loose certification mechanisms~\cite{prood}.
We propose an alternative using randomized smoothing~\cite{randomized_smoothing} for $\ell_2$-norm certificates, applicable to any classifier without specific requirements or training.
In comparison with previously proposed $\ell_\infty$-norm GAUC, standard approaches for OOD detection show non-zero results for guaranteed $\ell_2$-norm AUC and AUPR.
Unfortunately, a large number of samples derived around the input must be propagated through the network, increasing computational costs.
Additionally, we propose a method combining three techniques: diffusion denoising for noise removal, an OOD detection method, and a certified binary discriminator. 
This combination improves OOD robustness detection by around 13\%/5\% on CIFAR10/100 datasets compared to earlier approaches.

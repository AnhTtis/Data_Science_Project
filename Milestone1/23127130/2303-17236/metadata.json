    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the inverse problem of vibro-acoustography, a technique for enhancing ultrasound imaging by making use of nonlinear effects. It amounts to determining two spatially variable coefficients in a system of PDEs describing propagation of two directed sound beams and the wave resulting from their nonlinear interaction. To justify the use of Newton's method for solving this inverse problem, on one hand we verify well-definedeness and differentiability of the forward operator corresponding to two versions of the PDE model; on the other hand we consider an all-at-once formulation of the inverse problem and prove convergence of Newton's method for its solution.",

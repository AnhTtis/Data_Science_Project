    "abstract": "As documented by textbooks, the teaching of electromagnetic induction in university and high school courses is primarily based on what Feynman labeled as the ``flux rule'', downgrading it from the status of physical law. However, Maxwell derived a ``general law of electromagnetic induction'' in which the vector potential plays a fundamental role. A modern reformulation of Maxwell's law can be easily obtained by defining the induced electromotive force as $\\oint_l (\\vec E +\\vec v_c\\times \\vec B)\\cdot\\vec{dl}$, where $\\vec v_c$ is the velocity of the positive charges which, by convention, are the current carriers. Maxwell did not possess a model for the electric current. Therefore, in his law, he took $\\vec v_c$ to be the velocity of the circuit element containing the charges. This paper aims to show that the modern reformulation of Maxwell's law governs electromagnetic induction and that the ``flux rule'' is not a physical law but only a calculation shortcut that does not always yield the correct predictions. The paper also tries to understand why Maxwell's law has been ignored, and how the ``flux rule'' has taken root. Finally, a section is dedicated to teaching this modern reformulation of Maxwell's law in high schools and elementary physics courses.",

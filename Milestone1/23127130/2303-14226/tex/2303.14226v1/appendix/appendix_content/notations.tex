\section{Notations}
\label{sec:notations}
The notation $O_p$ is a probabilistic version of big-$O$ notation. Formally, for any sequence of random vectors $X_n$, $X_n$ = $O_p(\gamma_n)$ if, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists constants $c_\epsilon$ and $n_\epsilon$ such that $\mathbb{P}(\lVert X_n \rVert_2 \geq c_\epsilon\gamma_n) \leq \epsilon$ for every $n \geq n_\epsilon$. Equivalently, we say that $X_n/\gamma_n$ is “uniformly tight” or “bounded in probability”. Similarly, we define $\tilde{O_p}(\gamma_n)$ which suppresses dependence on logarithmic terms. For all the proofs, we suppress the conditioning on $\mathcal{A}$ for ease of notation.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this work, we formulate a causal inference framework for combinatorial interventions, a setting that is ubiquitous in practice. 
%
We propose a model that imposes both unit-specific structure, and latent similarity across units.  
%
Next, we propose an estimation procedure, \method~,that is able to leverage the strengths of this models, and establish finite-sample consistency in an observational setting. 
%
Further, we provide an experimental design mechanism for inferring all $N \times 2^p$ potential outcomes using \method. 
%
Our work naturally suggests directions for future work such as extending \method~to permutations (i.e., rankings).

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {TianQin is a proposal for a space-borne detector of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies. The experiment relies on a constellation of three drag-free spacecraft orbiting the Earth. Inter-spacecraft laser interferometry is used to monitor the distances between the test masses. The experiment is designed to be capable of detecting a signal with high confidence from a single source of gravitational waves within a few months of observing time. We describe the preliminary mission concept for TianQin, including the candidate source and experimental designs. We present estimates for the major constituents of the experiment’s error budget and discuss the project’s overall feasibility. Given the current level of technological readiness, we expect TianQin to be flown in the second half of the next decade.}

journal = {Communications in Theoretical Physics},
abstract = {Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the most important sources for future spaceborne gravitational wave detectors. In this kind of system, compact objects usually orbit around central supermassive black holes on complicated trajectories. Usually, these trajectories are approximated as the geodesics of Kerr space-times, and orbital evolution is simulated with the help of the adiabatic approximation. However, this approach omits the influence of the compact object on its background. In this paper, using the effective one-body formalism, we analytically calculate the trajectory of a nonspinning compact object around a massive Kerr black hole in an equatorial eccentric orbit (omitting the orbital inclination) and express the fundamental orbital frequencies in explicit forms. Our formalism includes the first-order corrections for the mass ratio in the conservative orbital motion. Furthermore, we insert the mass-ratio-related terms into the first post-Newtonian energy fluxes. By calculating the gravitational waves using the Teukolsky equations, we quantitatively reveal the influence of the mass of the compact object on the data analysis. We find that the shrinking of geodesic motion by taking small objects as test particles may not be appropriate for the detection of EMRIs.}

title = {PREDICTING THE DIRECTION OF THE FINAL SPIN FROM THE COALESCENCE OF TWO BLACK HOLES},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Knowledge of the spin of the black hole resulting from the merger of a generic black-hole binary is of great importance for studying the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes. Several attempts have been made to model the spin via simple expressions exploiting the results of numerical-relativity simulations. While these expressions are in reasonable agreement with the simulations, they neglect the precession of the binary's orbital plane, and cannot therefore be applied directly—i.e., without evolving the system to small separations using post-Newtonian theory—to binaries with separations larger than a few hundred gravitational radii. While not a problem in principle, this may be impractical if the formulas are employed in cosmological merger trees or N-body simulations, which provide the spins and angular momentum of the two black holes when their separation is of hundreds or thousands of gravitational radii. The formula that we propose is instead built on improved assumptions and gives, for any separation, a very accurate prediction both for the norm of the final spin and for its direction. By comparing with the numerical data, we also show that the final-spin direction is very accurately aligned with the binary's total angular momentum at large separation. Hence, observations of the final-spin direction (e.g., via a jet) can provide information on the binary's orbital plane at large separations and could be relevant, for instance, for studying X-shaped radio sources.}

title = {Accumulating Errors in Tests of General Relativity with Gravitational Waves: Overlapping Signals and Inaccurate Waveforms},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences provide powerful tests of general relativity (GR), but systematic errors in data analysis could lead to incorrect scientific conclusions. This issue is especially serious in the third-generation GW detectors in which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is high and the number of detections is large. In this work, we investigate the impacts of overlapping signals and inaccurate waveform models on tests of GR. We simulate mock catalogs for Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and perform parametric tests of GR using waveform models with different levels of inaccuracy. We find that the systematic error in non-GR parameter estimates could accumulate toward a false deviation from GR when combining results from multiple events, although a Bayesian model selection analysis may not favor a deviation. Waveform inaccuracies contribute most to the systematic errors, but multiple overlapping signals could magnify the effects of systematics owing to the incorrect removal of signals. We also point out that testing GR using selected “golden binaries” with high S/N is even more vulnerable to false deviations from GR. The problem of error accumulation is universal; we emphasize that it must be addressed to fully exploit the data from third-generation GW detectors and that further investigations, particularly in waveform accuracy, will be essential.}

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {The coalescence of a stellar-mass compact object together with an intermediate-mass black hole, also known as an intermediate-mass-ratio inspiral, is usually not expected to be a viable gravitational wave source for the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors, due to the generally lower frequency of such a source. In this paper, we adopt the effective-one-body formalism as the equation of motion, and obtain the accurately calculated gravitational waveforms by solving the Teukolsky equation using the frequency-domain method. We point out that high frequency modes of gravitational waves can be excited by large eccentricities of intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals. These high frequency modes can extend to more than 10 Hz, and enter the designed sensitive band of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We propose that such kinds of highly eccentric intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals could be feasible sources and potentially observable by the ground-based gravitational wave detectors, like the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.}

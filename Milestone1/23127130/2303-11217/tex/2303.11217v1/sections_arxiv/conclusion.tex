We proposed PnP-HVAE, a method using hierarchical variational autoencoders as a prior to solve image inverse problems.
Motivated by an alternate optimization scheme, PnP-HVAE exploits the encoder of the HVAE to avoid backpropagating through the generative network. 
We derived sufficient conditions on the HVAE model to guarantee the convergence of the algorithm. We have verified empirically that PnP-HVAE satisfies those conditions.
By jointly optimizing over the image and the latent space, PnP-HVAE  produces realistic results that are more consistent with the observation than GAN inversion  on a specialized dataset.
PnP-HVAE can also restore natural images of any size  using our PatchVDVAE model trained on natural images patches.

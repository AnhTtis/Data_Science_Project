We showed in section~\ref{sec:convergence} that PnP-HVAE converges to a fixed point under the assumption that $\x \rightarrow \HVAE(\x, \tau)$ is contractive. If this condition is met, the sequence of $u_k$ defined by $u_{k+1} = HVAE(u_k, \tau)$ should converge to a fixed point.
Figure ~\ref{fig:fixed} presents the \textbf{evolution of a fixed point iteration} $u_{k+1} = HVAE(u_k, \tau)$. 
 The image is smoothened over the iterations, and finally converges to a piececewise constant image. We used patchVDVAE for this experiment.

    "abstract": "In this note, we characterize when the Vietoris space of compact subsets of a given space has the Hurewicz property in terms of a selection principle on the given space itself using $k$-covers and the notion of groupability introduced by Kočinac and Scheepers. We comment that the same technique establishes another equivalent condition to a space being Hurewicz in each of its finite powers. We end with some characterizations involving spaces of continuous functions.",

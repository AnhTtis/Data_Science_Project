    "abstract": "The divergence of a group is a quasi-isometry invariant defined in terms of pairs of points and lengths of paths avoiding a suitable ball around the identity. In this paper we study \"random divergence'', meaning the divergence at two points chosen according to independent random walks or Markov chains; the Markov chains version can be turned into a quasi-isometry invariant. We show that in many cases, such as for relatively hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups, and right-angled Artin groups, the divergence at two randomly chosen points is with high probability equivalent to the divergence of the group. That is, generic points realise the largest possible divergence.",

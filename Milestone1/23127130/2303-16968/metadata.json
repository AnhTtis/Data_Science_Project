    "abstract": "In this paper, we find criteria for when cyclic cubic and cyclic quartic fields have well-rounded ideal lattices. We show that every cyclic cubic field has at least one well-rounded ideal. We also prove that there exist families of cyclic quartic fields which have well-rounded ideals and explicitly construct their minimal bases. In addition, for a given prime number $p$, if a cyclic quartic field has a unique prime ideal above $p$, then we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for that ideal to be well-rounded. Moreover, in cyclic quartic fields, we provide the prime decomposition of all odd prime numbers and construct an explicit integral basis for every prime ideal.",

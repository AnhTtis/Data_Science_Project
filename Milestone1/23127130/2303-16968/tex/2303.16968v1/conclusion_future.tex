This paper investigates WR ideals of cyclic and quartic fields. We show that all cyclic cubic fields have WR ideals. Moreover, we present families of cyclic cubic and quartic fields of which WR ideal lattices exist and also  construct explicit 
 minimal bases of these WR ideals.  

We observe that all WR ideals obtained from our experiment have norms dividing the discriminant of the field if the discriminant is odd.  Therefore, we form the following conjecture.

\textbf{Conjecture:} Let $F$ be a  cyclic cubic  or cyclic quartic field with odd discriminant. If a primitive integral ideal $I$ of $F$ is WR, then $N(I)$  divides the discriminant of $F$.  

If this conjecture holds then there are only finitely many WR ideals from these fields.

 

Note that this conjecture agrees with the observation in \cite{FHLPSW13} for real quadratic fields, and it was later proved for these fields \cite{S20}. In addition, for a cyclic quartic field $F$ of odd discriminant, the conjecture holds for the case when the ideal $I$ of $F$ is the unique prime ideal above a prime number as a result of Theorem \ref{thm:main6}.

We also remark that the conjecture does not hold for cyclic quartic fields of even discriminant. That is, there exist cyclic quartic fields with even discriminant which have WR ideals of norms that do not divide the field discriminant. For example, the cyclic quartic field $F$ define by $(a,b,c,d=(1,2,1,5)$ has WR ideals with norms 484, 2420, 3364, and 3844 which do not divide $\Delta_F=2000$. Another remark is that this is the only case  in which a prime ideal above $2$ is WR by Proposition \ref{prop:ideal_2_WR}.

Our future research will investigate the above conjecture and WR ideals of other number fields.

\section{Additional Metrics on $\pS$}
\label{app:additional_metrics}

\paragraph{The Kendall Tau} is the metric used all along the main part of the paper, the proportion of misordered pairs,
\begin{align*}
    d_{\tau}(\sigma, \nu) = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i<j}\indicator{\sigma(i)<\sigma(j)}\indicator{\nu(i) > \nu(j)}\,.
\end{align*}
The Kemeny consensus is the median associated with the Kendall Tau metric.

\paragraph{The Spearman Rho} is a normalized quadratic distance between the rank vectors,
\begin{align}
    d_{\tau}(\sigma, \nu) = \frac{6}{n(n^2-1)}\sum_{i}\left(\nu(i) - \sigma(i)\right)^2\,.
\end{align}
The Borda count is the median associated with the Spearman Rho (\emph{e.g.} see \citet{calauzenes2013}).

\paragraph{The Spearman footrule} is a absolute value distance between the rank vectors,
\begin{align}
    d_{\tau}(\sigma, \nu) = \sum_{i}\left|\nu(i) - \sigma(i)\right|\,.
\end{align}

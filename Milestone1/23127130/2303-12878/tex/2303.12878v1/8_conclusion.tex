\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we developed a framework to study robustness in ranks: we defined breakdown functions for rankings, extended it to bucket rankings, and created an optimization algorithm to approximate its value in practice. We developed our Downward Merge statistic as a plug-in to the classical Kemeny's median to provide, as confirmed by our experiments, not only an improved robustness but also a better compromise between centrality and robustness. We ensured our Downward Merge algorithm is scalable to practical settings, but the evaluation of the breakdown function remains challenging because of the use of the Total-Variation distance as a metric for the budget constraint. The definition and study of further scalable approximations of the breakdown function are left for future work.

%In this paper, we defined the notion of robustness in rankings by extending the classical notion of breakdown points from the multivariate case. We tackled the problem of \textit{Robust Consensus Ranking} to summarize ranking distribution with statistics that are not only precise (in terms of centrality) but also robust (in terms of breakdown function). To do so, we studied the interest of bucket orders for robustness purposes, extended and analyzed the relevant notions to such objects (distances, breakdown function). We developed a scalable robust statistic called the Downward Merge statistic and an optimization method to provide a good empirical approximation for the breakdown function. We showed through illustrative experiments that, contrary to the classical medians, our statistic is robust and central.

\section{Notation for Appendix}
\label{app:notation}
For the sake of clarity of the proofs, we switch to matrix notation in the appendix.
%Its worth noting the direct implementation of the formulations below should be avoided since the factorial cardinality of the permutation space makes it impratical for medioum size problems. Instead more efficient one versions are proposed in the main paper, which should be used in practical applications. 
We fix an arbitrary indexation $\{\sigma^{(1)}, \dots, \sigma^{(n!)}\}$ of $\pS$. Using this indexation, given a metric $d$ on $\pS$, we can defined the (symmetric) metric matrix $D = (d(\sigma^{(i)},\sigma^{(j)}))_{i,j\in[n!]}$. Identifying a ranking $\sigma$ with its corresponding basis vector $\be_i$ s.t. $\sigma = \sigma^{(i)}$, we write for two rankings $\sigma, \sigma', \nu\in\pS$,
\begin{align}
    \nu^\top D \sigma := d(\nu, \sigma) ~~~~~~~\text{or}~~~~~~~ \nu^\top D (\sigma - \sigma') := d(\nu, \sigma) - d(\nu, \sigma')
\end{align}
Further, a distribution $p\in\cM_+^1(\pS)$ on permutation can now be seen as a $n!$-dimensional vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n!}$. This allows to write, for $p\in\distribs$, $\sigma\in\pS$,
\begin{align}
    p^\top D\sigma := \lE_{\Sigma\sim p}[d(\Sigma,\sigma)]
\end{align}

@inproceedings{Davies2011, abstract = {We prove that it is NP-hard for a coalition of two manipulators to compute how to manipulate the Borda voting rule. This resolves one of the last open problems in the computational complexity of manipulating common voting rules. Because of this NP-hardness, we treat computing a manipulation as an approximation problem where we try to minimize the number of manipulators. Based on ideas from bin packing and multiprocessor scheduling, we propose two new approximation methods to compute manipulations of the Borda rule. Experiments show that these methods significantly outperform the previous best known existing approximation method. We are able to find optimal manipulations in almost all the randomly generated elections tested. Our results suggest that, whilst computing a manipulation of the Borda rule by a coalition is NP-hard, computational complexity may provide only a weak barrier against manipulation in practice.},

Emphasis is placed on the need for fast and accurate numerical algorithms, and it discusses some of the basic methodologies for transformation, data base handling and graphics treatment. The third part focuses on statistical methodology. Special attention is given to smoothing, iterative procedures, simulation and visualization of multivariate data. Finally a set of selected applications like Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Finance and Network Intrusion Detection highlight the usefulness of computational statistics.}, author = {Felix Brandt and Vincent Conitzer and Ulle Endriss and Jérôme Lang and Ariel D.

  abstract = 	 {Whereas most dimensionality reduction techniques (\textit{e.g.} PCA, ICA, NMF) for multivariate data essentially rely on linear algebra to a certain extent, summarizing ranking data, viewed as realizations of a random permutation $\Sigma$ on a set of items indexed by $i\in \{1,\ldots,;{n}\}$,  is a great statistical challenge, due to the absence of vector space structure for the set of permutations $\mathfrak{S}_n$. It is the goal of this article to develop an original framework for possibly reducing the number of parameters required to describe the distribution of a statistical population composed of rankings/permutations, on the premise that the collection of items under study can be partitioned into subsets/buckets, such that, with high probability, items in a certain bucket are either all ranked higher or else all ranked lower than items in another bucket. In this context, $\Sigma$’s distribution can be hopefully represented in a sparse manner by a \textit{bucket distribution}, \textit{i.e.} a bucket ordering plus the ranking distributions within each bucket. More precisely, we introduce a dedicated distortion measure, based on a mass transportation metric, in order to quantify the accuracy of such representations. The performance of buckets minimizing an empirical version of the distortion is investigated through a rate bound analysis. Complexity penalization techniques are also considered to select the shape of a bucket order with minimum expected distortion. Beyond theoretical concepts and results, numerical experiments on real ranking data are displayed in order to provide empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach promoted.}

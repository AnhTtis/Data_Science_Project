    "abstract": "We further develop the paraconsistent Gödel modal logic. In this paper, we consider its version endowed with Kripke semantics on $[0,1]$-valued frames with two fuzzy relations $R^+$ and $R^-$ (degrees of trust in assertions and denials) and two valuations $v_1$ and $v_2$ (support of truth and support of falsity) linked with a De Morgan negation $\\neg$.\n  We demonstrate that it \\emph{does not} extend Gödel modal logic and that $\\Box$ and $\\lozenge$ are not interdefinable. We also show that several important classes of frames are $\\birelKGsquare$ definable (in particular, crisp, mono-relational, and finitely branching). For $\\birelKGsquare$ over finitely branching frames, we create a sound and complete constraint tableaux calculus and a decision procedure based upon it. Using the decision procedure we show that $\\birelKGsquare$ satisfiability and validity are in PSPACE.",

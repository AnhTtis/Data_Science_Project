    "abstract": "We develop a topological classification of non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians that depend on momentum and frequency. Such effective Hamiltonians are in one-to-one correspondence to single-particle Green's functions of systems that satisfy translational invariance in space and time but may be interacting or open. We employ K-theory, which for the special case of noninteracting systems leads to the well-known tenfold-way topological classification of insulators and fully gapped superconductors. Relevant theorems for K-groups are reformulated and proven in the more transparent language of Hamiltonians instead of vector bundles. We obtain 54 symmetry classes for frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians satisfying anti-unitary symmetries. Employing dimensional reduction, the group structure for all these classes is calculated. This classification leads to a group structure with one component from the momentum dependence, which corresponds to the non-Hermitian generalization of topological insulators and superconductors, and two additional parts resulting from the frequency dependence. These parts describe winding of the effective Hamiltonian in the frequency direction and in combined momentum-frequency space.",

    "abstract": "We study the potential of the future Higgs factories, including the ILC, CEPC, and FCC-ee with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 240-250 GeV on discovering axion-like particles (ALPs) through various production channels in the leptonic final states, $e^+e^- \\to f\\bar{f} a$, where $f=e,μ,ν$. We show that the $e^+e^- \\to e^+e^- a$ with $a \\to γγ$ provides the best bounds for the $g_{aγγ}$ and $g_{aZZ}$ couplings, while $e^+e^- \\to ν\\barνa$, with $a \\to γγ$ offers the best bounds for the $g_{aZZ}$ and $g_{aZγ}$ couplings. The $e^+e^- \\to μ^+μ^- a$ with $ a \\to γγ$ provides intermediate sensitivity to the $g_{aZZ}$ coupling. Our estimates of the bounds for the $g_{aγγ}$, $g_{aZγ}$, and $g_{aZZ}$ couplings as a function of ALP mass ($M_a$) ranging from 0.1 GeV to 100 GeV provide valuable insights for future experiments aiming to detect ALPs. We find that $g_{aγγ}$ around $1.5\\times10^{-4}~\\rm GeV^{-1}$ for $M_a = 0.1-6$ GeV is currently not ruled out by any other experiments.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is no new concept in the high energy physics community, in fact, many ML techniques have been employed since the early 80's to deal with a broad spectrum of physics problems. In this paper, we present a novel technique to separate electrons from pions in the Gas Electron Multiplier Transition Radiation Detector (GEM TRD) using deep learning. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained on the Monte Carlo data simulated using the ATHENA-based detector and simulation framework for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) experiment. The ANN model does a good job of separating electrons from pions.",

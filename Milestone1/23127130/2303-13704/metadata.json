    "abstract": "The recent discovered kagome superconductors provide a good platform for studying intertwined orders and novel states such as topology, superconductor, charge density wave, et al. The interplay of these orders may spontaneously break the rotational symmetry, and induce exotic phenomena such as nematicity, or even nematic superconductor. Here we report a two-fold rotational symmetric superconductivity of thin-film RbV3Sb5 in response to a direction-dependent in-plane magnetic fields, in contrast to the six-fold structural symmetry of the crystal lattice. The two-fold symmetry was evidenced by the magnetoresistance transport experiments, critical magnetic field measurements and the anisotropic superconducting gap. With different configuration, we further observed the six-fold symmetry superimposed on the two-fold symmetry near the boundary between normal states and superconducting states. Our results present the correlation-driven symmetry breaking and highlight the promising platform to study the intertwined orders such as unconventional superconductivity in this correlated kagome family.",

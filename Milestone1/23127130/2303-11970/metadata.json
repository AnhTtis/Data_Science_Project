    "abstract": "We derive a sufficient condition guaranteeing that a singularly perturbed linear time-varying system is strongly monotone with respect to a matrix cone $C$ of rank $k$. This implies that the singularly perturbed system inherits the asymptotic properties of systems that are strongly monotone with respect to $C$, which include convergence to the set of equilibria when $k=1$, and a Poincaré-Bendixson property when $k=2$. We extend this result to singularly perturbed nonlinear systems with a compact and convex state-space. We demonstrate our theoretical results using a simple numerical example.",

    "abstract": "Recent no-go theorems have ruled out four-dimensional classical de Sitter vacua in heterotic string theory. On the other hand, the absence of a well-defined Wilsonian effective action and other related phenomena also appear to rule out such time-dependent vacua with de Sitter isometries, even in the presence of quantum corrections. In this note, we argue that a four-dimensional de Sitter space can still exist in SO(32) heterotic string theory as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, i.e. as a coherent state, over a supersymmetric Minkowski background, albeit within a finite temporal domain. Borel resummation and resurgence play a crucial role in constructing such a state in the Hilbert space of heterotic theory governed entirely by the IR degrees of freedom.",

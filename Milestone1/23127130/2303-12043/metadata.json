    "abstract": "We consider axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equations in three and higher dimensions, of generalized anti-parallel-vortex-tube-pair-type: the initial scalar vorticity has a sign in the half-space, is odd under reflection across the plane, is bounded and decays sufficiently rapidly at the axis and at spatial infinity. We prove lower bounds on the growth of such solutions in all dimensions, improving a lower bound proved by Choi and Jeong arXiv:2110.09079 in three dimensions.",

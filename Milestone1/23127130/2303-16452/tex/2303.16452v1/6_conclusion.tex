\section{Conclusion}
% In this work, we show the FIM protein sequence design framework via pLMs and propose a new protein language model, ProtFIM, which is specialized for the framework. By evaluating various models via our proposed new evaluation scheme, SEIFER, ProtFIM performs FIM protein sequence design efficiently compared to existing pLMs. Additional analysis and visualization also prove that ProtFIM is a promising tool for practical protein engineering such as fitness prediction and sequence optimization. 


In this work, we have empirically verified the weakness of the existing AR PLMs and the effectiveness of infilling modeling in real-world protein engineering. Through our proposed new evaluation scheme, SEIFER, we show that a new type of protein language model, ProtFIM, performs protein middle sequence design efficiently compared to existing pLMs. Additional analysis and visualization also prove that ProtFIM is a promising tool for practical protein engineering such as fitness prediction and sequence optimization.

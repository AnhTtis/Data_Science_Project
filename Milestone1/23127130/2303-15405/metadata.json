    "abstract": "The jump unravelling of a quantum master equation decomposes the dynamics of an open quantum system into abrupt jumps, interspersed by periods of coherent dynamics where no jumps occur. Simulating these jump trajectories is computationally expensive, as it requires very small time steps to ensure convergence. This computational challenge is aggravated in regimes where the coherent, Hamiltonian dynamics are fast compared to the dissipative dynamics responsible for the jumps. Here, we present a quantum version of the Gillespie algorithm that bypasses this issue by directly constructing the waiting time distribution for the next jump to occur. In effect, this avoids the need for timestep discretisation altogether, instead evolving the system continuously from one jump to the next. We describe the algorithm in detail and discuss relevant limiting cases. To illustrate it we include four example applications of increasing physical complexity. These additionally serve to compare the performance of the algorithm to alternative approaches -- namely, the widely-used routines contained in the powerful Python library QuTip. We find significant gains in efficiency for our algorithm and discuss in which regimes these are most pronounced. Publicly available implementations of our code are provided in Julia and Mathematica.",

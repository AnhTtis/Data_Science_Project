    "abstract": "In this work, we report a confocal laser induced fluorescence (LIF) configuration, which allows for high spatial resolution measurements of plasma properties in plasma setups and sources with a limited optical access. The proposed LIF configuration utilizes a ring-shaped laser beam generated by a pair of diffractive axicons. LIF signal is collected along the main optical axis within the ring region. It is shown experimentally that at the focal distance of 300 mm, the spatial resolution of approximately 5.3 mm can be achieved. More than that, theoretical estimations predict the possibility of achieving ~1 mm resolution at the same focal distance by adjusting laser beam parameters. This is approaching the localization accuracy of conventional LIF collection methods (with crossing laser beam injection and fluorescence collection optical paths). Measurements of the ion velocity distribution function in an argon plasma using both the confocal LIF with ring shaped laser beam and conventional LIF demonstrate a satisfactory agreement. The proposed LIF setup has potential applications for diagnostics in various plasma processing equipment, and plasma sources such as hollow cathodes, microplasmas, electric propulsion, etc.",

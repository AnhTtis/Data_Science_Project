    "abstract": "The polarization of $Λ$ and $\\barΛ$ hyperons along the beam direction has been measured relative to the second and third harmonic event planes in isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The second harmonic results follow the emission angle dependence as expected due to elliptic flow, similar to that observed in Au+Au collisions. The polarization relative to the third harmonic event plane, measured for the first time, deviates from zero with 4.8$σ$ significance in 20-60\\% centrality for $1.1<p_T<6.0$ GeV/$c$ and exhibits a similar dependence on the emission angle. These results indicate the formation of a complex vortical structure in the system that follows higher harmonic anisotropic flow originating from the initial density fluctuations. The amplitudes of the sine modulation for the second and third harmonic results are comparable in magnitude, increase from central to peripheral collisions, and show a mild $p_T$ dependence. While the centrality dependence, except in peripheral collisions, is qualitatively consistent with hydrodynamic model calculations including thermal vorticity and shear contributions, the shape of the $p_T$ dependence is very different. Comparison to previous measurements at RHIC and the LHC for the second-order harmonic results shows little dependence on the collision system size and collision energy.",

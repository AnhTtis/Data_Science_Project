	%The goal of process discovery is to unravel a process model from an event log such that the discovered model describes the system well. Rediscoverability is a property stating that a process discovery algorithm is able to return a process model that is behaviorally equivalent to the original system. Only very few algorithms guarantee this property. Additionally, most process discovery algorithms assume systems to execute a single process. However, often a system executes multiple interacting processes simultaneously.
%
	%In this paper, we study typed Jackson nets, a natural extension of process trees, that are able to model such interacting processes by manipulating identifiers representing objects in a system. We also show that typed Jackson nets have a special property: reconstructability. This property states that if a typed Jackson net is deconstructed into its processes and their interactions, their composition yields a model that is bisimilar to the original net. We show that this property can be exhibited to develop a process discovery framework that guarantees rediscoverability of a model with interacting processes.

A process discovery algorithm aims to construct a model from data generated by historical system executions such that the model describes the system well.
Consequently, one desired property of a process discovery algorithm is \emph{rediscoverability}, which ensures that the algorithm can construct a model that is behaviorally equivalent to the original system.
A system often simultaneously executes multiple processes that interact through object manipulations.
This paper presents a framework for developing process discovery algorithms for constructing models that describe interacting processes based on typed Jackson Nets that use identifiers to refer to the objects they manipulate.
Typed Jackson Nets enjoy the \emph{reconstructability} property which states that the composition of the processes and the interactions of a decomposed typed Jackson Net yields a model that is bisimilar to the original system.
We exploit this property to demonstrate that if a process discovery algorithm ensures rediscoverability, the system of interacting processes is rediscoverable.

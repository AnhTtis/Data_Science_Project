    "abstract": "A process discovery algorithm aims to construct a model from data generated by historical system executions such that the model describes the system well. Consequently, one desired property of a process discovery algorithm is rediscoverability, which ensures that the algorithm can construct a model that is behaviorally equivalent to the original system. A system often simultaneously executes multiple processes that interact through object manipulations. This paper presents a framework for developing process discovery algorithms for constructing models that describe interacting processes based on typed Jackson Nets that use identifiers to refer to the objects they manipulate. Typed Jackson Nets enjoy the reconstructability property which states that the composition of the processes and the interactions of a decomposed typed Jackson Net yields a model that is bisimilar to the original system. We exploit this property to demonstrate that if a process discovery algorithm ensures rediscoverability, the system of interacting processes is rediscoverable.",

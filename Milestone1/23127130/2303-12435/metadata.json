    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to revisit the proof of the Gearhart-Prüss-Huang-Greiner theorem for a semigroup $S(t)$, following the general idea of the proofs that we have seen in the literature and to get an explicit estimate on the operator norm of $S(t)$ in terms of bounds on the resolvent of the generator. In \\cite{HelSj} by the first two authors, this was done and some applications in semiclassical analysis were given. Some of these results have been subsequently published in two books written by the two first authors \\cite{He1,Sj2}. A second work \\cite{HeSj21} by the first two authors presents new improvements partially motivated by a paper of D. Wei \\cite{W}.\n  In this third paper, we continue the discussion on whether the aforementioned results are optimal, and whether one can improve these results through iteration. Numerical computations will illustrate some of the abstract results.",

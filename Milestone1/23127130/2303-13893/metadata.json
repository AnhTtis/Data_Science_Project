    "abstract": "The classical van der Waals equation, applied to one or two mixing fluids, and the Helmholtz (free) energy function $A$ yield, for fixed temperature $T$, a curve in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (one fluid) or a surface in 3-space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (binary fluid). A line tangent to this curve in two places (bitangent line), or a set of planes tangent to this surface in two places (bitangent planes) have a thermodynamic significance which is well documented in the classical literature. Points of contact of bitangent planes trace `binodal curves' on the surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The study of these bitangents is also classical, starting with D.J. Korteweg and J.D. van der Waals at the end of the $19^{\\rm th}$ century, but continuing into modern times. In this paper we give a summary of the thermodynamic background and of other mathematical investigations and then present a new mathematical approach which classifies a wide range of situations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ where bitangents occur. In particular, we are able to justify many of the details in diagrams of binodal curves observed by Korteweg and others, using techniques from singularity theory.",

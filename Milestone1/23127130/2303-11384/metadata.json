    "abstract": "This study employs classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT) to investigate the adsorption isotherms and structural information of H2 and CH4 fluids inside MOF-5. The results indicate that the adsorption of both fluids is highly dependent on the fluid temperature and the shape of the MOF-5 structure. Specifically, the CH4 molecules exhibit stronger interactions with the MOF-5 framework, resulting in a greater adsorbed quantity compared to H2. Additionally, the cDFT calculations reveal that the adsorption process is influenced by the fluid-fluid spatial correlations between the fluid molecules and the external potential produced by the MOF-5 solid atoms. These findings are supported by comparison with experimental data and the structure factor of the adsorbed fluid inside the MOF-5. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the adsorption mechanism of H2 and CH4 in MOF-5, emphasizing the importance of considering the structural properties of the adsorbed fluids in MOFs for predicting and designing their gas storage capacity.",

abstract = {If the potential for a boom in the global hydrogen economy is realized, there will be an increase in the need for accurate hydrogen thermodynamic property standards. Based on current and anticipated needs, new fundamental equations of state for parahydrogen, normal hydrogen, and orthohydrogen were developed to replace the existing property models. To accurately predict thermophysical properties near the critical region and in liquid states, the quantum law of corresponding states was applied to improve the normal hydrogen and orthohydrogen formulations in the absence of available experimental data. All three equations of state have the same maximum pressure of 2000 MPa and upper temperature limit of 1000 K. Uncertainty estimates in this paper can be considered to be estimates of a combined expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 for primary data sets. The uncertainty in density is 0.04% in the region between 250 and 450 K and at pressures up to 300 MPa. The uncertainties of vapor pressures and saturated liquid densities vary from 0.1% to 0.2%. Heat capacities are generally estimated to be accurate to within 1%, while speed-of-sound values are accurate to within 0.5% below 100 MPa. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce on behalf of the United States.},

abstract = {This work reviews the data on thermodynamic properties of methane which were available up to the middle of 1991 and presents a new equation of state in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. A new strategy for optimizing the structure of empirical thermodynamic correlation equations was used to determine the functional form of the equation. The Helmholtz function containing 40 fitted coefficients was fitted to selected experimental data of the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single phase (p$\rho$ T) and (b) of the liquid‐vapor saturation curve ( p s $\rho$ ' $\rho$ ‘ ) including the Maxwell criterion, (c) speed of sound w, (d) isochoric heat capacity c v , (e) isobaric heat capacity c p , (f) difference of enthalpy $\Delta$ h, and (g) second virial coefficient B. Independent equations are also included for the vapor pressure, the saturated liquid and vapor densities, the isobaric ideal gas heat capacity and the melting pressure as functions of temperature. Tables for the thermodynamic properties of methane from 90 K to 620 K for pressures up to 1000 MPa are presented. For the density, uncertainties of ±0.03% for pressures below 12 MPa and temperatures below 350 K and ±0.03% to ±0.15% for higher pressures and temperatures are estimated. For the speed of sound, the uncertainty ranges from ±0.03% to ±0.3% depending on temperature and pressure. Heat capacities may be generally calculated within an uncertainty of ±1%. To verify the accuracy of the new formulation, the calculated property values are compared with selected experimental results and existing equations of state for methane. The new equation of state corresponds to the new International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS‐90) and is extrapolable up to pressures of 20000 MPa.},

abstract = {A new set of united-atom Lennard-Jones interaction parameters for n-alkanes is proposed from fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methane to dodecane using three united-atom force fields: OPLS [Jorgensen, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984, 106, 813], SKS [Siepmann, et al. Nature 1993, 365, 330], and TraPPE. Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of-state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that are either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

abstract = {A correlation is presented for the thermodynamic properties of pure fluids containing small or large molecules. The residual Helmholtz energy is given in terms of perturbed‐hard‐chain (PHC) theory, extended to polar fluids with a multipolar expansion. The novel feature of this correlation is a separation of the Helmholtz energy into low‐density and high‐density contributions. The low‐density contribution follows from a virial expansion and the high‐density contribution from a perturbation expansion. For intermediate densities, a continuous function is used to interpolate between the two density limits. This modification of PHC theory improves agreement with experimental second virial coefficients, vapor pressures, and saturated liquid densities. Since all molecular parameters used here have a well‐defined physical significance, they can be reliably estimated for high‐molecular‐weight‐fluids where experimental data are scarce. More important, separation into low‐density and high‐density contributions allows separate mixing rules for each density region; this flexibility in mixing rules significantly improves representation of mixture properties, as discussed in Part II.

This leads to an expansion in inverse powers of the temperature. The first-order term is evaluated exactly (except for the approximation of using the Percus-Yevick expression for the hard-sphere radial distribution function). Two slightly different approximations for the second-order term are given and shown to lead to similar results. With first- and second-order terms included, the calculated equation of state is in excellent agreement with quasiexperimental Monte Carlo and molecular-dynamics results at all temperatures including the lowest temperatures for which such calculations have been made, far below the critical temperature and at liquid densities. The reasons for this good agreement, particularly at high densities, are discussed in terms of a novel formulation of the perturbation theory, and the implications of the results for fluids with more realistic potential functions are considered.},

abstract = {We present an alternative derivation of the dynamical density functional theory for the one-body density profile of a classical fluid developed by Marconi and Tarazona [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 8032 (1999)]. Our derivation elucidates further some of the physical assumptions inherent in the theory and shows that it is not restricted to fluids composed of particles interacting solely via pair potentials; rather it applies to general, multibody interactions. The starting point for our derivation is the Smoluchowski equation and the theory is therefore one for Brownian particles and as such is applicable to colloidal fluids. In the second part of this paper we use the dynamical density functional theory to derive a theory for spinodal decomposition that is applicable at both early and intermediate times. For early stages of spinodal decomposition our nonlinear theory is equivalent to the (generalized) linear Cahn-Hilliard theory, but for later times it incorporates coupling between different Fourier components of the density fluctuations (modes) and therefore goes beyond Cahn-Hilliard theory. We describe the results of calculations for a model (Yukawa) fluid which show that the coupling leads to the growth of a second maximum in the density fluctuations, at a wave number larger than that of the main peak.},

For an arbitrary potential function a modified potential is defined involving three parameters, namely a hard-sphere diameter, an inverse-steepness parameter for the repulsive region, and a depth parameter for the attractive region. When the latter parameters are zero, the modified potential becomes the hard-sphere potential; when they are one, it becomes the original potential. The configuration integral is expanded in a double-power series in the inverse-steepness and depth parameters, the hard-sphere diameter being chosen so that the first-order term in the inverse-steepness parameter is zero. The first-order term in the depth parameter is evaluated essentially exactly and the second-order term approximately: other second-order terms and all higher-order terms are neglected. The resulting equation of state is in good agreement with molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo results, and experimental data for argon at all temperatures and densities relevant for fluids.},

abstract = {A novel weighted density functional theory (WDFT) for an inhomogeneous 12-6 Lennard-Jones fluid is proposed based on the modified fundamental measure theory for repulsive contribution, the mean-field approximation for attractive contribution, and the first-order mean-spherical approximation with a weighted density for correlation contribution. Extensive comparisons of the theoretical results with molecular simulation and experimental data indicate that the new WDFT yields accurate density profiles, adsorption isotherms, fluid-solid interfacial tensions, as well as disjoining potentials and pressures of simple gases such as argon, nitrogen, methane, ethane, and neon confined in slitlike pores or near graphitic solid surfaces. The present WDFT performs better than the nonlocal density functional theory, which is frequently used in the study of adsorption on porous materials. Since the proposed theory possesses a good dimensional crossover and is able to correctly reduce to two-dimensional case, it performs very well even in very narrow pores. In addition, the present WDFT reproduces very well the supercritical fluid-solid interfacial tensions, whereas the theory of Sweatman underestimates them at high bulk densities. The present WDFT predicts that the increase in the fluid-wall attraction may change the sign of the interfacial tension and hence may make the wall from "phobic" to "philic" with respect to the fluid. The new WDFT is computationally as simple and efficient as the mean-field theory and avoids the second-order direct correlation function as an input. It provides a universal way to construct the excess Helmholtz free-energy functional for inhomogeneous fluids such as Yukawa, square-well, and Sutherland fluids. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Nuclear symmetry and rotational effects are incorporated in the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm. The scheme is employed in a study of the (para-D 2)3(ortho-D2)10 and (para-D 2)13 clusters in the 1-3 K temperature range. In the (para-D2)3(ortho-D2)10 cluster at 1 K, the three J=1 molecules form a "cluster within cluster," held together by the anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. At 3 K the three molecule J=1 cluster is dissolved within the (D2)13 cluster. The orientational structure of the (para-D2)13 cluster at 1 K is composed of two distinct distorted-T pair configurations of neighboring J=1 molecules. Upon heating to 3 K the orientational structure changes, and a clear separation between the two pair geometries is no longer obtained. Moreover at 3 K thermal distortion of the cluster structure from icosahedral relaxes the extent of orientational frustration of the system, and thus contributes to the lowering of the rotational energy. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We report the parameters for a new generic force field, DREIDING, that we find useful for predicting structures and dynamics of organic, biological, and main-group inorganic molecules. The philosophy in DREIDING is to use general force constants and geometry parameters based on simple hybridization considerations rather than individual force constants and geometric parameters that depend on the particular combination of atoms involved in the bond, angle, or torsion terms. Thus all bond distances are derived from atomic radii, and there is only one force constant each for bonds, angles, and inversions and only six different values for torsional barriers. Parameters are defined for all possible combinations of atoms and new atoms can be added to the force field rather simply. This paper reports the parameters for the "nonmetallic" main-group elements (B, C, N, O, F columns for the C, Si, Ge, and Sn rows) plus H and a few metals (Na, Ca, Zn, Fe). The accuracy of the DREIDING force field is tested by comparing with (i) 76 accurately determined crystal structures of organic compounds involving H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, and Br, (ii) rotational barriers of a number of molecules, and (iii) relative conformational energies and barriers of a number of molecules. We find excellent results for these systems. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Chemical Society.},

In this report, we elucidate the desired characteristics of an optimal adsorbent for gas storage. The U.S. Department of Energy has outlined several requirements that adsorbents must fulfill for natural gas to become economically viable, with a key criterion being the amount adsorbed at 35 bar. We explore the adsorption characteristics of novel metal-organic materials (IRMOFs and molecular squares) and contrast them with the characteristics of two zeolites, MCM-41, and different carbon nanotubes. Using molecular simulations, we uncover the complex interplay of the factors influencing methane adsorption, especially the surface area, the capacity or free volume, the strength of the energetic interaction, and the pore size distribution. We also explain the extraordinary adsorption properties of IRMOF materials and propose new, not yet synthesized IRMOF structures with adsorption characteristics that are predicted to exceed the best experimental results to date by up to 36%.},

@article{Fu2015,
abstract = {Classical density functional theory (DFT) has been routinely used for the characterization of pore size distribution and specific surface area of porous materials by gas physisorption. However, its application to large-scale screening of materials for gas storage has been largely unexplored because it is commonly believed that the DFT calculations are applicable only to one-dimensional systems and highly sensitive to the approximations introduced in the free-energy functionals. In this work, we have investigated four representative versions of nonlocal density functionals for predicting H2 adsorption using both the slit pore model and a large library of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under a broad range of temperatures and pressures. The four versions of DFT share a common functional from the modified fundamental measure theory to account for the molecular excluded volume effects while differing in their approximations to represent the intermolecular attractions, viz., mean-field approximation, two versions of weighted-density approximations (WDA), and the quadratic functional expansion method. We have tested these functionals by extensive comparison with Monte Carlo simulation data for H2 adsorption at conditions of practical interest. Overall all four versions of DFT are reasonably accurate in comparison with the simulation results. While the density expansion method performs rather well at the DOE target condition for hydrogen storage, the WDA methods are found most accurate at low temperature, a condition typically used in materials characterization. In addition to rapid prediction of the adsorption isotherms, DFT is able to generate molecular density profiles revealing microscopic details such as favorable adsorption sites. From a computational perspective, the DFT calculation is at least 1 order of magnitude faster than conventional simulation methods, promising for large-scale screening of nanostructured materials for gas storage.},

Furthermore, the macroscopic separation behaviors of the MOF materials are elucidated at a molecular level to give insight into the underlying mechanisms.

Previous Monte Carlo computer simulations of gas adsorption by MOFs have made several questionable approximations regarding framework-framework and framework-adsorbate interactions: potential parameters from general force fields have been used, and framework atoms were fixed at their crystallographic coordinates (rigid framework). We assess the validity of these approximations with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for a well-known Zn-based MOF (IRMOF-1), using potential parameters specifically derived for IRMOF-1. Our approach is validated by comparison with experimental results for hydrogen and xenon adsorption at room temperature. The effects of framework flexibility on the adsorption of noble gases and hydrogen are described, as well as the selectivity of IRMOF-1 for xenon versus other noble gases. At both low temperature (78 K) and room temperature, little difference in gas adsorption is seen between the rigid and flexible force fields. Experimental trends of noble gas inflation curves are also matched by the simulation results. Additionally, we show that IRMOF-1 selectively adsorbs Xe atoms in Xe/Kr and Xe/Ar mixtures, and this preference correlates with the trend in van der Waals parameters for the adsorbate atoms. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

Although hundreds of different MOF structures have been synthesized in powder form, little is currently known about the potential performance of MOFs for membrane-based separations. We have used atomistic calculations to predict the performance of a MOF membrane for separation of various gas mixtures in order to provide information for material selection in membrane design. Specifically, we investigated the performance of MOF-5 as a membrane for separation of CO 2/CH 4, CO 2/H 2, CO 2/N 2, CH 4/H 2, N 2/H 2, and N 2/CH 4 mixtures at room temperature. In every case, mixture effects play a crucial role in determining the membrane performance. Although the membrane selectivities predicted for MOF-5 are not large for the mixtures we studied, our result suggest that atomistic simulations will be a useful tool for considering the large number of MOF crystal structures that are known in order to seek membrane materials with more desirable characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel microporous materials with large surface areas, porosities, and thermal stabilities. Even though many thousand MOFs have been identified, few MOF materials have been evaluated for gas mixtures separations and fuel gas storage. In this work, using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated adsorption isotherms of pure and binary mixtures of hydrogen-methane in two large surface area MOFs (MOF-5 and MOF-177), two catenated MOFs (IRMOF-11 and MOF-14), and a high affinity open metal site MOF with strong Zn$\sigma$+-O$\sigma$- dipoles on the surface that create strong energetic interaction with the adsorbates (MOF-74). The pure and mixture adsorption isotherms were calculated at 298 K and up to pressures of approximately 80 bar. The results of this study indicate that separation of hydrogen from methane in these materials would be successful, since hydrogen in a 50% bulk mixture at low pressures has selectivities on the order of 25 for MOF-74, 20 for IRMOF-11, and 18 for MOF-14, compared to low selectivities values on the order of 5 for the two large surface area MOFs, MOF-5 and MOF-177. From this study, we also found that MOF-74 has a large methane storage capacity of 170 cm3 (STP)/cm3 at 298 K and 35 atm, close to the 180 cm3 (STP)/cm3 DOE target for practical methane storage.

The force fields describing the weak interactions between the gas molecules and ZIFs in GCMC simulations are based on ab initio MP2 level of theory aimed at accurately describing the London dispersions. We report the total and excess gas uptakes up to 100 bar at 77 and 300 K. Our results unravel the interplay between the uptake amount, pore volume, guest molecule size, temperature, chlorine functional group, and isosteric heat of adsorption in ZIFs. We found that while the uptake capacity of ZIF-100 outperforms ZIF-95 for small molecules (H 2), ZIF-95 offers a superior adsorption capacity for large molecules (CH4). Moderately sized molecules (N2) exhibit a more complex uptake behavior depending on the temperature.

abstract = {Considerable progress has been made recently in the use of nanoporous materials for hydrogen storage. In this article, the current status of the field and future challenges are discussed, ranging from important open fundamental questions, such as the density and volume of the adsorbed phase and its relationship to overall storage capacity, to the development of new functional materials and complete storage system design. With regard to fundamentals, the use of neutron scattering to study adsorbed H2, suitable adsorption isotherm equations, and the accurate computational modelling and simulation of H2 adsorption are discussed. The new materials covered include flexible metal–organic frameworks, core–shell materials, and porous organic cage compounds. The article concludes with a discussion of the experimental investigation of real adsorptive hydrogen storage tanks, the improvement in the thermal conductivity of storage beds, and new storage system concepts and designs.},

@article{Buch1993,
abstract = {This study demonstrates preferential adsorption of ortho-H2 with respect to para-H2 on the surface of amorphous ice exposed to normal H2 at 12 K. The experimental part of the study focuses on the time dependence of Fourier-transform infrared bands of ortho-H2 and para-H2 adsorbate and of dangling-OD bonds. In the spectrum of the newly formed adsorbate over-layer (before the ortho-to-para relaxation takes place) only the ortho-H2 IR band is visible, identifying the initial para-H2 content as less than 10%. In the computational part, H 2 adsorption is modeled on an amorphous cluster (H2O) 450. The computational study consists of the diffusion Monte Carlo investigation of isolated H2 states on the surface, and of path integral Monte Carlo simulation of the adsorbate overlayer. Nuclear symmetry effects are incorporated approximately in the path integral Monte Carlo simulation, which is carried out in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble. The calculated percentage of para-H2 in the adsorbate layer is 7%, corresponding to a factor ∼4 depletion with respect to the normal-H2 gas phase. The para depletion on the surface is due to excess binding energy of ortho-H2 with respect to para-H2 that originates from the anisotropy of the gas-surface potential. Para-H 2 is bound to the surface via the spherically symmetric part of the potential, while ortho-H2 has extra binding energy from the anisotropic part. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Physics.},

Accompanying this applied focus has been a recognition of the need to engender MOFs with mechanical, thermal and/or chemical stability. Chemical stability in acidic, basic and neutral aqueous solutions is important. Advances over recent years have made it possible to design MOFs that possess different combinations of mechanical, thermal and chemical stability. Here, we review these advances and the associated design principles and synthesis strategies. We focus on how these advances may render MOFs effective as heterogeneous catalysts, both in chemically harsh condensed phases and in thermally challenging conditions relevant to gas-phase reactions. Finally, we briefly discuss future directions of study for the production of highly stable MOFs.},

abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous materials with potential applications in gas storage, separations, catalysis, and chemical sensing. Despite numerous advantages, applications of many MOFs are ultimately limited by their stability under harsh conditions. Herein, the recent advances in the field of stable MOFs, covering the fundamental mechanisms of MOF stability, design, and synthesis of stable MOF architectures, and their latest applications are reviewed. First, key factors that affect MOF stability under certain chemical environments are introduced to guide the design of robust structures. This is followed by a short review of synthetic strategies of stable MOFs including modulated synthesis and postsynthetic modifications. Based on the fundamentals of MOF stability, stable MOFs are classified into two categories: high-valency metal–carboxylate frameworks and low-valency metal–azolate frameworks. Along this line, some representative stable MOFs are introduced, their structures are described, and their properties are briefly discussed. The expanded applications of stable MOFs in Lewis/Br{\o}nsted acid catalysis, redox catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, gas storage, and sensing are highlighted. Overall, this review is expected to guide the design of stable MOFs by providing insights into existing structures, which could lead to the discovery and development of more advanced functional materials.},

Their narrow pore windows and nearly unlimited structural and chemical features have made these materials of significant interest for membrane-based gas separations. In this comprehensive review, we discuss opportunities and challenges related to the formation of pure MOF films and mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). Common and emerging separation applications are identified, and membrane transport theory for MOFs is described and contextualized relative to the governing principles that describe transport in polymers. Additionally, cross-cutting research opportunities using advanced metrologies and computational techniques are reviewed. To quantify membrane performance, we introduce a simple membrane performance score that has been tabulated for all of the literature data compiled in this review. These data are reported on upper bound plots, revealing classes of MOF materials that consistently demonstrate promising separation performance. Recommendations are provided with the intent of identifying the most promising materials and directions for the field in terms of fundamental science and eventual deployment of MOF materials for commercial membrane-based gas separations.},

abstract = {Membrane technology is attractive for natural gas separation (removing CO2, H2O, and hydrocarbons from CH4) because of membranes' low energy consumption and small environmental footprint. Compared to polymeric membranes, microporous inorganic membranes such as silicoaluminophosphate-34 (SAPO-34) membrane can retain their separation performance under conditions close to industrial requirements. However, moisture and hydrocarbons in natural gas can be strongly adsorbed in the pores of those membranes, thereby reducing the membrane separation performance. Herein, we report the fabrication of a polycrystalline MIL-160 membrane on an Al2O3 substrate by in situ hydrothermal synthesis. The MIL-160 membrane with a thickness of ca. 3 $\mu$m shows a remarkable molecular sieving effect in gas separation. Besides, the pore size and environment of the MIL-160 membrane can be precisely controlled using reticular chemistry by regulating the size and functionality of the ligand. Interestingly, the more polar fluorine-functionalized multivariate MIL-160/CAU-10-F membrane exhibits a 10.7% increase in selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation and a 31.2% increase in CO2 permeance compared to those of the MIL-160 membrane. In addition, hydrophobic MIL-160 membranes and MIL-160/CAU-10-F membranes are more resistant to water vapor and hydrocarbons than the hydrophilic SAPO-34 membranes.},

abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most promising porous adsorbents for methane storage; however, the highest reported storage capacities of about 270 cm3 (STP) cm-3 at 298 K and 65 bar are still much lower than the new US Department of Energy (DOE) target of 350 cm3 (STP) cm-3. Furthermore, it is very difficult to reach the DOE targets for volumetric (350 cm3 [STP] cm-3) and gravimetric (0.5 g [CH4]/g) storage capacities simultaneously for a single MOF. This review systematically evaluates and compares the methane storage capacities of reported MOFs at both 298 and 270 K. We found that slightly reducing the storage temperature to 270 K can significantly improve both the volumetric and gravimetric uptake. Our discoveries highlight that two unique MOFs, NU-111 and MOF-177 (which have high pore volumes of 2.09 and 1.89 cm3 g-1, respectively), not only have very high gravimetric capacities of 0.5 and 0.43 g/g, respectively, but also exhibit the highest working capacities ever reported: 239 and 230 cm3 (STP) cm-3, respectively. In addition, a usable empirical equation for predicting methane storage capacities (at 270 K and 65 bar) and some engineering strategies for thermal management are discussed.},

@article{Li2018,
abstract = {Gas storage and separation are closely associated with the alleviation of greenhouse effect, the widespread use of clean energy, the control of toxic gases, and various other aspects in human society. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in gas storage and separation using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition to summarizing the gas uptakes of some benchmark MOFs, we emphasize on the desired chemical properties of MOFs for different gas storage/separation scenarios. Greenhouse gases (CO2), energy-related gases (H2 and CH4), and toxic gases (CO and NH3) are covered in the review.},

@article{Reatto1986,
abstract = {First, we demonstrate that careful simulations of fluids have enough accuracy that the resulting radial distribution function can be used to test inversion methods. Second, we introduce a method which allows extraction of the pair interaction starting from structural data for simple liquids even under triple-point condition. The method is an iterative predictor-corrector method in which the predictor is the modified hypernetted-chain equation and the corrector is simulation. We have verified the convergence of the method for the Lennard-Jones fluid and for a model potential for aluminum. We find that other methods of inversion give unreliable results. As a first application of our method we have inverted the experimental structural data of Na at 100°C. {\textcopyright} 1986 The American Physical Society.},

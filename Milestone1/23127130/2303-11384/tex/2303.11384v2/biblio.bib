The calculated phase diagram is compared with the phase diagrams for the LJ fluid predicted by the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulation, and by the Percus-Yevick (PY) and reference hypernetted chain (RHNC) theories. The accuracy of the MSA is comparable with the accuracy of the PY approximation. Although the MSA is less accurate than the RHNC approximation, it has an important advantage of being solvable along the whole liquid-gas coexistence curve, including the vicinity of the critical point. {\textcopyright} 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {In addition to surface adsorption, hydrogen molecules stored as liquid-like gas at low temperature in zeolites (Na-X, Ca-X, Mg-X) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF-5, MOF-205) were observed using an in situ neutron diffraction experiment. In situ neutron diffraction data indicate that hydrogen molecules form a loosely bound state at 50 K, which is above the critical temperature of hydrogen; the position and broad shapes of the diffraction patterns are very similar to those of liquid hydrogen (D2). However, this new state of hydrogen (D2) cannot be in liquid phases because the critical temperature (Tc = 38.34 K) is much less than 50 K. As a contrastive study, the same measurements were carried out with other types of zeolite (ZSM-5) and MOF (HKUST-1), but no broad diffraction patterns were observed. According to Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations on the three model systems of Na-X, HKUST-1, and MOF-205 (six steps of hydrogen loading at 50 K), the origin of the broad peaks is attributed to the short-range ordering (SRO) of the hydrogen molecules which are not tightly bound to the adsorbents. The necessary conditions for the existence of the SRO can be stated as follows: There should be enough interaction potential wells (adsorption sites) that are connected with each other through shallow potential bridges. These potential bridges result from an appropriate superposition of the crystal fields in hydrogen-adsorbed systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This focus article examines SAXS as a tool to probe the microstructure of nanoporous materials. We seek to educate the reader on scattering instrumentation and requisite scattering theory pertinent to nanoporous materials, and describe analytical models used to fit SAXS data, to elucidate the microstructure of these nanoporous materials including their morphological features such as the pore size distribution, pore curvature, and specific surface area. Finally, we fit and compare the aforementioned models to real scattering data of nanoporous gold synthesized in our laboratory. The models yield realistic material parameters for the nanoporous gold morphology, in agreement with electron micrograph images. In addition, we have investigated the scattering patterns and characteristic electron micrographs of nanoporous copper and nanoporous antimony also synthesized in our laboratory. The models discussed in this paper do not yield realistic material parameters for specific nanoporous copper and nanoporous antimony morphologies, however. This could be the subject of follow-up work.},

@article{Ting2015,
abstract = {(Graph Presented). Here we report direct physical evidence that confinement of molecular hydrogen (H<inf>2</inf>) in an optimized nanoporous carbon results in accumulation of hydrogen with characteristics commensurate with solid H<inf>2</inf> at temperatures up to 67 K above the liquid-vapor critical temperature of bulk H<inf>2</inf>. This extreme densification is attributed to confinement of H<inf>2</inf> molecules in the optimally sized micropores, and occurs at pressures as low as 0.02 MPa. The quantities of contained, solid-like H<inf>2</inf> increased with pressure and were directly evaluated using in situ inelastic neutron scattering and confirmed by analysis of gas sorption isotherms. The demonstration of the existence of solid-like H<inf>2</inf> challenges the existing assumption that supercritical hydrogen confined in nanopores has an upper limit of liquid H<inf>2</inf> density. Thus, this insight offers opportunities for the development of more accurate models for the evaluation and design of nanoporous materials for high capacity adsorptive hydrogen storage.},

The formula of CDFT is based on modified fundamental measure theory (MFMT) and mean field approximation (MFA). The accuracy of the theory has been examined by simulations, and it has been implemented into a high-throughput screening of CH4/H2 separation materials. A total of 1200 MOFs have been examined, with selectivity ranging from 70 to 220 depending on the temperature, pressure and bulk CH4/H2 ratio, which is much higher than that of real MOFs. A set of promising CH4/H2 separation MOFs has been identified. According to the analysis of the isotherm and density profile, a MOF material with a pore size that can accommodate only one CH4 molecule seems to be the best for CH4/H2 separation.},

abstract = {We consider the thermodynamics of adsorption of gases in porous solids from both the perspective of absolute properties which appear naturally in theoretical studies and that of excess properties which are measured in experiments. Our thermodynamic description starts by treating the gas (or gas mixture) plus porous solid system as a mixture to which we can apply solution thermodynamics. We show that equations for the absolute thermodynamic properties for adsorption in rigid porous materials do not require an explicit reference to the pressure of the fluid confined in the porous material. We discuss how to relate absolute properties to excess properties by using an estimate of the helium void volume. We illustrate the thermodynamic formalism with calculations for a simple thermodynamic model in which the Langmuir equation is used to describe the absolute adsorption isotherm and the ideal gas equation of state is used for the bulk properties. The simplified model explains the apparently anomalous behavior of the thermodynamic functions for adsorption at high pressure up to 1000 bar.},

abstract = {Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to explore the adsorption behavior of methane, ethane, ethylene, and carbon dioxide in isoreticular metal-organic frameworks, IRMOF-1, noninterpenetrated IRMOF-8, and interpenetrated IRMOF-8. The simulated isotherms are compared with experimentally measured isotherms, when available, and a good agreement is observed. In the case of IRMOF-8, the agreement is much better for the interpenetrated model than for the noninterpenetrated model, suggesting that the experimental data was obtained on an essentially interpenetrated structure. Simulations show that carbon dioxide is preferentially adsorbed over methane, and a selective adsorption at low pressures of ethane over ethylene, especially in the case of IRMOF-8, confirm recent experimental results. Analysis of simulation results on both the interpenetrated and the noninterpenetrated structures shows that interpenetration is responsible for the higher adsorbed amounts of ethane at low pressures (<100 kPa) and for the interesting selectivity for ethane in ethane/ethylene binary mixtures. Van der Waals interactions seem to be enhanced in the interpenetrated structure, favoring ethane adsorption. This indicates that interpenetrated MOF structures may be of interest for the separation of small gas molecules.},

This is the largest number of MOFs screened in the literature for these two gas separations. We first compared simulated gas adsorption data with the experimental measurements to validate the accuracy of our computational approach. Molecular simulations were then used to estimate adsorption selectivity, working capacity and sorbent selection parameter of MOFs for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H6/CH4 separations. Results showed that there is a significant number of MOFs predicted to exhibit significantly higher adsorption selectivities and working capacities compared to zeolites. Membrane selectivities of MOFs that show the highest adsorption selectivities were also calculated and compared with selectivities and gas permeabilities of zeolite and polymer membranes. Results show that MOFs can be strong alternatives to traditional membranes for C2H6/C2H4 separations.},

abstract = {If the potential for a boom in the global hydrogen economy is realized, there will be an increase in the need for accurate hydrogen thermodynamic property standards. Based on current and anticipated needs, new fundamental equations of state for parahydrogen, normal hydrogen, and orthohydrogen were developed to replace the existing property models. To accurately predict thermophysical properties near the critical region and in liquid states, the quantum law of corresponding states was applied to improve the normal hydrogen and orthohydrogen formulations in the absence of available experimental data. All three equations of state have the same maximum pressure of 2000 MPa and upper temperature limit of 1000 K. Uncertainty estimates in this paper can be considered to be estimates of a combined expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 for primary data sets. The uncertainty in density is 0.04% in the region between 250 and 450 K and at pressures up to 300 MPa. The uncertainties of vapor pressures and saturated liquid densities vary from 0.1% to 0.2%. Heat capacities are generally estimated to be accurate to within 1%, while speed-of-sound values are accurate to within 0.5% below 100 MPa. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce on behalf of the United States.},

abstract = {This work reviews the data on thermodynamic properties of methane which were available up to the middle of 1991 and presents a new equation of state in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. A new strategy for optimizing the structure of empirical thermodynamic correlation equations was used to determine the functional form of the equation. The Helmholtz function containing 40 fitted coefficients was fitted to selected experimental data of the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single phase (p$\rho$ T) and (b) of the liquid‐vapor saturation curve ( p s $\rho$ ' $\rho$ ‘ ) including the Maxwell criterion, (c) speed of sound w, (d) isochoric heat capacity c v , (e) isobaric heat capacity c p , (f) difference of enthalpy $\Delta$ h, and (g) second virial coefficient B. Independent equations are also included for the vapor pressure, the saturated liquid and vapor densities, the isobaric ideal gas heat capacity and the melting pressure as functions of temperature. Tables for the thermodynamic properties of methane from 90 K to 620 K for pressures up to 1000 MPa are presented. For the density, uncertainties of ±0.03% for pressures below 12 MPa and temperatures below 350 K and ±0.03% to ±0.15% for higher pressures and temperatures are estimated. For the speed of sound, the uncertainty ranges from ±0.03% to ±0.3% depending on temperature and pressure. Heat capacities may be generally calculated within an uncertainty of ±1%. To verify the accuracy of the new formulation, the calculated property values are compared with selected experimental results and existing equations of state for methane. The new equation of state corresponds to the new International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS‐90) and is extrapolable up to pressures of 20000 MPa.},

abstract = {A new set of united-atom Lennard-Jones interaction parameters for n-alkanes is proposed from fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methane to dodecane using three united-atom force fields: OPLS [Jorgensen, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984, 106, 813], SKS [Siepmann, et al. Nature 1993, 365, 330], and TraPPE. Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of-state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that are either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

The hydrogen adsorption isotherms at room temperature were predicted by following the Langmuir adsorption model using the calculated constants S and K. The simulation results were in good agreement with experimental data as well as the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation results reported in the literature. The simulations of nanotube bundle configurations suggest that the gravimetric hydrogen adsorption increases with internanotube gap size. It may be attributed to favorable hydrogen-nanotube interactions outside the nanotubes. The effect of alkali doping on hydrogen adsorption was studied by incorporating K+ or Li+ ions into nanotube arrays using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results on hydrogen adsorption isotherms indicate hydrogen adsorption of 3.95 wt% for K-doping, and 4.21 wt% for Li-doping, in reasonable agreement with the experimental results obtained at 100 atm and room temperature. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Further calculations for MOFs with unsaturated metal sites reveal a shortcoming of the simulation technique, as the interaction of hydrogen with these sites is not adequately represented by the potential model.

abstract = {A correlation is presented for the thermodynamic properties of pure fluids containing small or large molecules. The residual Helmholtz energy is given in terms of perturbed‐hard‐chain (PHC) theory, extended to polar fluids with a multipolar expansion. The novel feature of this correlation is a separation of the Helmholtz energy into low‐density and high‐density contributions. The low‐density contribution follows from a virial expansion and the high‐density contribution from a perturbation expansion. For intermediate densities, a continuous function is used to interpolate between the two density limits. This modification of PHC theory improves agreement with experimental second virial coefficients, vapor pressures, and saturated liquid densities. Since all molecular parameters used here have a well‐defined physical significance, they can be reliably estimated for high‐molecular‐weight‐fluids where experimental data are scarce. More important, separation into low‐density and high‐density contributions allows separate mixing rules for each density region; this flexibility in mixing rules significantly improves representation of mixture properties, as discussed in Part II.

Two slightly different approximations for the second-order term are given and shown to lead to similar results. With first- and second-order terms included, the calculated equation of state is in excellent agreement with quasiexperimental Monte Carlo and molecular-dynamics results at all temperatures including the lowest temperatures for which such calculations have been made, far below the critical temperature and at liquid densities. The reasons for this good agreement, particularly at high densities, are discussed in terms of a novel formulation of the perturbation theory, and the implications of the results for fluids with more realistic potential functions are considered.},

abstract = {We present an alternative derivation of the dynamical density functional theory for the one-body density profile of a classical fluid developed by Marconi and Tarazona [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 8032 (1999)]. Our derivation elucidates further some of the physical assumptions inherent in the theory and shows that it is not restricted to fluids composed of particles interacting solely via pair potentials; rather it applies to general, multibody interactions. The starting point for our derivation is the Smoluchowski equation and the theory is therefore one for Brownian particles and as such is applicable to colloidal fluids. In the second part of this paper we use the dynamical density functional theory to derive a theory for spinodal decomposition that is applicable at both early and intermediate times. For early stages of spinodal decomposition our nonlinear theory is equivalent to the (generalized) linear Cahn-Hilliard theory, but for later times it incorporates coupling between different Fourier components of the density fluctuations (modes) and therefore goes beyond Cahn-Hilliard theory. We describe the results of calculations for a model (Yukawa) fluid which show that the coupling leads to the growth of a second maximum in the density fluctuations, at a wave number larger than that of the main peak.},

abstract = {The perturbation theory previously shown to give good results for the equation of state of a square-well fluid at liquid densities and temperatures is applied to more realistic potentials with soft repulsion, in particular the 6:12 potential. For an arbitrary potential function a modified potential is defined involving three parameters, namely a hard-sphere diameter, an inverse-steepness parameter for the repulsive region, and a depth parameter for the attractive region. When the latter parameters are zero, the modified potential becomes the hard-sphere potential; when they are one, it becomes the original potential. The configuration integral is expanded in a double-power series in the inverse-steepness and depth parameters, the hard-sphere diameter being chosen so that the first-order term in the inverse-steepness parameter is zero. The first-order term in the depth parameter is evaluated essentially exactly and the second-order term approximately: other second-order terms and all higher-order terms are neglected. The resulting equation of state is in good agreement with molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo results, and experimental data for argon at all temperatures and densities relevant for fluids.},

abstract = {A new density functional theory (DFT) for an inhomogeneous 12-6 Lennard-Jones fluid is proposed based on the modified fundamental measure theory for repulsive interaction and a weighted density functional for attractive interaction. The Helmholtz free energy functional for the attractive part is constructed using the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state with a mean-field weight function. Comparisons of the theoretical results with molecular simulation data suggest that the new DFT yields accurate bulk surface tension, density distributions, adsorption-desorption isotherms, pore pressures, and capillary phase transitions for the Lennard-Jones fluid confined in slitlike pores with different widths and solid-fluid interactions. The new DFT reproduces well the vapor-liquid critical temperatures of the confined Lennard-Jones fluid, whereas the mean-field theory always overestimates the critical temperatures. Because the new DFT is computationally as simple and efficient as the mean-field theory, it will provide a good reference for further development of a statistical-thermodynamic theory of complex fluid under both homogeneous and inhomogeneous conditions when disperse force has to be considered. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Previously, it has been shown that the direct correlation function for a Lennard-Jones fluid could be modeled by a sum of that for hard-spheres, a mean-field tail, and a simple linear correction in the core region constructed so as to reproduce the (known) bulk equation of state of the fluid [Lutsko, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 054701 (2007)]. Here, this model is combined with ideas from the fundamental measure theory to construct a density functional theory for the free energy. The theory is shown to accurately describe a range of inhomogeneous conditions including the liquid vapor interface, the fluid in contact with a hard wall, and a fluid confined in a slit pore. The theory gives quantitatively accurate predictions for the surface tension, including its dependence on the potential cutoff. It also obeys two important exact conditions: That relating the direct correlation function to the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to density and the wall theorem. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Yu2009,
abstract = {A novel weighted density functional theory (WDFT) for an inhomogeneous 12-6 Lennard-Jones fluid is proposed based on the modified fundamental measure theory for repulsive contribution, the mean-field approximation for attractive contribution, and the first-order mean-spherical approximation with a weighted density for correlation contribution. Extensive comparisons of the theoretical results with molecular simulation and experimental data indicate that the new WDFT yields accurate density profiles, adsorption isotherms, fluid-solid interfacial tensions, as well as disjoining potentials and pressures of simple gases such as argon, nitrogen, methane, ethane, and neon confined in slitlike pores or near graphitic solid surfaces. The present WDFT performs better than the nonlocal density functional theory, which is frequently used in the study of adsorption on porous materials. Since the proposed theory possesses a good dimensional crossover and is able to correctly reduce to two-dimensional case, it performs very well even in very narrow pores. In addition, the present WDFT reproduces very well the supercritical fluid-solid interfacial tensions, whereas the theory of Sweatman underestimates them at high bulk densities. The present WDFT predicts that the increase in the fluid-wall attraction may change the sign of the interfacial tension and hence may make the wall from "phobic" to "philic" with respect to the fluid. The new WDFT is computationally as simple and efficient as the mean-field theory and avoids the second-order direct correlation function as an input. It provides a universal way to construct the excess Helmholtz free-energy functional for inhomogeneous fluids such as Yukawa, square-well, and Sutherland fluids. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A recently suggested computational scheme [Buch and Devlin, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 4195 (1993)] is extended to describe orientational phenomena in systems containing assemblies of odd-J and even-J hydrogen and deuterium molecules. Nuclear symmetry and rotational effects are incorporated in the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm. The scheme is employed in a study of the (para-D 2)3(ortho-D2)10 and (para-D 2)13 clusters in the 1-3 K temperature range. In the (para-D2)3(ortho-D2)10 cluster at 1 K, the three J=1 molecules form a "cluster within cluster," held together by the anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. At 3 K the three molecule J=1 cluster is dissolved within the (D2)13 cluster. The orientational structure of the (para-D2)13 cluster at 1 K is composed of two distinct distorted-T pair configurations of neighboring J=1 molecules. Upon heating to 3 K the orientational structure changes, and a clear separation between the two pair geometries is no longer obtained. Moreover at 3 K thermal distortion of the cluster structure from icosahedral relaxes the extent of orientational frustration of the system, and thus contributes to the lowering of the rotational energy. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Mayo1990,
abstract = {We report the parameters for a new generic force field, DREIDING, that we find useful for predicting structures and dynamics of organic, biological, and main-group inorganic molecules. The philosophy in DREIDING is to use general force constants and geometry parameters based on simple hybridization considerations rather than individual force constants and geometric parameters that depend on the particular combination of atoms involved in the bond, angle, or torsion terms. Thus all bond distances are derived from atomic radii, and there is only one force constant each for bonds, angles, and inversions and only six different values for torsional barriers. Parameters are defined for all possible combinations of atoms and new atoms can be added to the force field rather simply. This paper reports the parameters for the "nonmetallic" main-group elements (B, C, N, O, F columns for the C, Si, Ge, and Sn rows) plus H and a few metals (Na, Ca, Zn, Fe). The accuracy of the DREIDING force field is tested by comparing with (i) 76 accurately determined crystal structures of organic compounds involving H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, and Br, (ii) rotational barriers of a number of molecules, and (iii) relative conformational energies and barriers of a number of molecules. We find excellent results for these systems. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Chemical Society.},

We explore the adsorption characteristics of novel metal-organic materials (IRMOFs and molecular squares) and contrast them with the characteristics of two zeolites, MCM-41, and different carbon nanotubes. Using molecular simulations, we uncover the complex interplay of the factors influencing methane adsorption, especially the surface area, the capacity or free volume, the strength of the energetic interaction, and the pore size distribution. We also explain the extraordinary adsorption properties of IRMOF materials and propose new, not yet synthesized IRMOF structures with adsorption characteristics that are predicted to exceed the best experimental results to date by up to 36%.},

The energy depth of the surface-particle potential, $\epsilon$w, is the free molecular parameter that can be obtained by fitting to experimental data of adsorption isotherms.

Mixture adsorption is investigated for the methane/ethane and methane/n-butane binary systems. Excellent agreement between PC-SAFT DFT and GCMC is obtained for all adsorption isotherms up to pressures of 50 bar. The cDFT formalism accurately predicts the selective accumulation of longer hydrocarbons for binary mixtures in the considered COFs. This application shows substantial predictive power of PC-SAFT DFT solved in three-dimensional geometries and the results suggest the method can in the future also be applied for efficient optimization of force field parameters or of structural properties of the porous material based on an analytical theory as opposed to a stochastic simulation.},

abstract = {Sorption of gases in micro- and mesoporous materials is typically interpreted on the basis of idealized structural models where real structure effects such as defects and disorder are absent. For covalent organic frameworks (COFs) significant discrepancies between measured and simulated adsorption isotherms are often reported but rarely traced back to their origins. This is because little is known about the real structure of COFs and its effect on the sorption properties of these materials. In the present work molecular simulations are used to obtain adsorption isotherms of argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the COF-LZU1 at various temperatures. The (perfect) model COF has a BET surface that is higher than the experimental BET surface by a factor of approximately 1.33, suggesting defects or inclusions are present in the real structure. We find that the saturation adsorption loading of small gaseous species in COF-LZU1, as determined from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, is also higher by approximately the same factor compared to the experimental saturation loading. The influence of interlayer slipping on the shape of the adsorption isotherm and the adsorption capacity is studied. Comparison between simulation and experiment at lower loadings suggests the layers to be shifted instead of perfectly eclipsed. The sensitivity of the adsorption isotherms in this regime towards the underlying framework topology shows that real structure effects have significant influence on the gas uptake. Accounting for layer slipping is important to applications such as catalysis, gas storage and separation.},

@article{Fu2015,
abstract = {Classical density functional theory (DFT) has been routinely used for the characterization of pore size distribution and specific surface area of porous materials by gas physisorption. However, its application to large-scale screening of materials for gas storage has been largely unexplored because it is commonly believed that the DFT calculations are applicable only to one-dimensional systems and highly sensitive to the approximations introduced in the free-energy functionals. In this work, we have investigated four representative versions of nonlocal density functionals for predicting H2 adsorption using both the slit pore model and a large library of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under a broad range of temperatures and pressures. The four versions of DFT share a common functional from the modified fundamental measure theory to account for the molecular excluded volume effects while differing in their approximations to represent the intermolecular attractions, viz., mean-field approximation, two versions of weighted-density approximations (WDA), and the quadratic functional expansion method. We have tested these functionals by extensive comparison with Monte Carlo simulation data for H2 adsorption at conditions of practical interest. Overall all four versions of DFT are reasonably accurate in comparison with the simulation results. While the density expansion method performs rather well at the DOE target condition for hydrogen storage, the WDA methods are found most accurate at low temperature, a condition typically used in materials characterization. In addition to rapid prediction of the adsorption isotherms, DFT is able to generate molecular density profiles revealing microscopic details such as favorable adsorption sites. From a computational perspective, the DFT calculation is at least 1 order of magnitude faster than conventional simulation methods, promising for large-scale screening of nanostructured materials for gas storage.},

Furthermore, the macroscopic separation behaviors of the MOF materials are elucidated at a molecular level to give insight into the underlying mechanisms.

abstract = {The gas storage capacity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is well-known and has been investigated using both experimental and computational methods. Previous Monte Carlo computer simulations of gas adsorption by MOFs have made several questionable approximations regarding framework-framework and framework-adsorbate interactions: potential parameters from general force fields have been used, and framework atoms were fixed at their crystallographic coordinates (rigid framework). We assess the validity of these approximations with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for a well-known Zn-based MOF (IRMOF-1), using potential parameters specifically derived for IRMOF-1. Our approach is validated by comparison with experimental results for hydrogen and xenon adsorption at room temperature. The effects of framework flexibility on the adsorption of noble gases and hydrogen are described, as well as the selectivity of IRMOF-1 for xenon versus other noble gases. At both low temperature (78 K) and room temperature, little difference in gas adsorption is seen between the rigid and flexible force fields. Experimental trends of noble gas inflation curves are also matched by the simulation results. Additionally, we show that IRMOF-1 selectively adsorbs Xe atoms in Xe/Kr and Xe/Ar mixtures, and this preference correlates with the trend in van der Waals parameters for the adsorbate atoms. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a fascinating alternative to more traditional nanoporous materials. Although hundreds of different MOF structures have been synthesized in powder form, little is currently known about the potential performance of MOFs for membrane-based separations. We have used atomistic calculations to predict the performance of a MOF membrane for separation of various gas mixtures in order to provide information for material selection in membrane design. Specifically, we investigated the performance of MOF-5 as a membrane for separation of CO 2/CH 4, CO 2/H 2, CO 2/N 2, CH 4/H 2, N 2/H 2, and N 2/CH 4 mixtures at room temperature. In every case, mixture effects play a crucial role in determining the membrane performance. Although the membrane selectivities predicted for MOF-5 are not large for the mixtures we studied, our result suggest that atomistic simulations will be a useful tool for considering the large number of MOF crystal structures that are known in order to seek membrane materials with more desirable characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel microporous materials with large surface areas, porosities, and thermal stabilities. Even though many thousand MOFs have been identified, few MOF materials have been evaluated for gas mixtures separations and fuel gas storage. In this work, using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated adsorption isotherms of pure and binary mixtures of hydrogen-methane in two large surface area MOFs (MOF-5 and MOF-177), two catenated MOFs (IRMOF-11 and MOF-14), and a high affinity open metal site MOF with strong Zn$\sigma$+-O$\sigma$- dipoles on the surface that create strong energetic interaction with the adsorbates (MOF-74). The pure and mixture adsorption isotherms were calculated at 298 K and up to pressures of approximately 80 bar. The results of this study indicate that separation of hydrogen from methane in these materials would be successful, since hydrogen in a 50% bulk mixture at low pressures has selectivities on the order of 25 for MOF-74, 20 for IRMOF-11, and 18 for MOF-14, compared to low selectivities values on the order of 5 for the two large surface area MOFs, MOF-5 and MOF-177. From this study, we also found that MOF-74 has a large methane storage capacity of 170 cm3 (STP)/cm3 at 298 K and 35 atm, close to the 180 cm3 (STP)/cm3 DOE target for practical methane storage.

The force fields describing the weak interactions between the gas molecules and ZIFs in GCMC simulations are based on ab initio MP2 level of theory aimed at accurately describing the London dispersions. We report the total and excess gas uptakes up to 100 bar at 77 and 300 K. Our results unravel the interplay between the uptake amount, pore volume, guest molecule size, temperature, chlorine functional group, and isosteric heat of adsorption in ZIFs. We found that while the uptake capacity of ZIF-100 outperforms ZIF-95 for small molecules (H 2), ZIF-95 offers a superior adsorption capacity for large molecules (CH4). Moderately sized molecules (N2) exhibit a more complex uptake behavior depending on the temperature. Furthermore, we show that the induced dipole interactions, such as those caused by -Cl functional groups, play a vital role on gas adsorption behaviors.

abstract = {This study demonstrates preferential adsorption of ortho-H2 with respect to para-H2 on the surface of amorphous ice exposed to normal H2 at 12 K. The experimental part of the study focuses on the time dependence of Fourier-transform infrared bands of ortho-H2 and para-H2 adsorbate and of dangling-OD bonds. In the spectrum of the newly formed adsorbate over-layer (before the ortho-to-para relaxation takes place) only the ortho-H2 IR band is visible, identifying the initial para-H2 content as less than 10%. In the computational part, H 2 adsorption is modeled on an amorphous cluster (H2O) 450. The computational study consists of the diffusion Monte Carlo investigation of isolated H2 states on the surface, and of path integral Monte Carlo simulation of the adsorbate overlayer. Nuclear symmetry effects are incorporated approximately in the path integral Monte Carlo simulation, which is carried out in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble. The calculated percentage of para-H2 in the adsorbate layer is 7%, corresponding to a factor ∼4 depletion with respect to the normal-H2 gas phase. The para depletion on the surface is due to excess binding energy of ortho-H2 with respect to para-H2 that originates from the anisotropy of the gas-surface potential. Para-H 2 is bound to the surface via the spherically symmetric part of the potential, while ortho-H2 has extra binding energy from the anisotropic part. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The classical Density functional theory (DFT) has become a powerful tool to describe the microscopic structure of fluids as the radial distribution function. One of its particular capabilities is to express the thermodynamic properties of those fluids even under the influence of external potentials, such as fluid-solid interaction. However, good models for the Helmholtz free-energy functionals are necessary to improve the results. In this work, we present a self-consistent thermodynamic perturbation theory for the excess Helmholtz free-energy from the DFT applied to hard-core fluids. The new perturbation theory is solved self-consistently without any closure relation to solving the Ornstein-Zernike equation explicitly. We compare the performance of our self-consistent perturbation theory with the results obtained with the well-known second-order Barker-Henderson perturbation theory for the hard-core Yukawa and square-well fluids. Moreover, we propose two versions of the DFT to describe the perturbative contribution: one based on the weighted density approximation theory and another from a modified mean-field theory. The present results confirm the modified mean-field theory as a better option to calculate the thermodynamic and structural properties of hard-core fluids},

Accompanying this applied focus has been a recognition of the need to engender MOFs with mechanical, thermal and/or chemical stability. Chemical stability in acidic, basic and neutral aqueous solutions is important. Advances over recent years have made it possible to design MOFs that possess different combinations of mechanical, thermal and chemical stability. Here, we review these advances and the associated design principles and synthesis strategies. We focus on how these advances may render MOFs effective as heterogeneous catalysts, both in chemically harsh condensed phases and in thermally challenging conditions relevant to gas-phase reactions. Finally, we briefly discuss future directions of study for the production of highly stable MOFs.},

Metal-organic framework (MOF-5), a prototype of a new class of porous materials and one that is constructed from octahedral Zn-O-C clusters and benzene links, was used to demonstrate that its three-dimensional porous system can be functionalized with the organic groups –Br, –NH 2 , –OC 3 H 7 , –OC 5 H 11 , –C 2 H 4 , and –C 4 H 4 and that its pore size can be expanded with the long molecular struts biphenyl, tetrahydropyrene, pyrene, and terphenyl. We synthesized an isoreticular series (one that has the same framework topology) of 16 highly crystalline materials whose open space represented up to 91.1% of the crystal volume, as well as homogeneous periodic pores that can be incrementally varied from 3.8 to 28.8 angstroms. One member of this series exhibited a high capacity for methane storage (240 cubic centimeters at standard temperature and pressure per gram at 36 atmospheres and ambient temperature), and others the lowest densities (0.41 to 0.21 gram per cubic centimeter) for a crystalline material at room temperature.},

It has been successfully applied to the\ndescription of simple (``atomic'') three-dimensional {(3D)} fluids\nin the bulk and in slitlike pores, and has been extended to molecular\nfluids. However, this functional was unsuitable for fluids in narrow\ncylindrical pores, and was inadequate for describing the solid.

abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous materials with potential applications in gas storage, separations, catalysis, and chemical sensing. Despite numerous advantages, applications of many MOFs are ultimately limited by their stability under harsh conditions. Herein, the recent advances in the field of stable MOFs, covering the fundamental mechanisms of MOF stability, design, and synthesis of stable MOF architectures, and their latest applications are reviewed. First, key factors that affect MOF stability under certain chemical environments are introduced to guide the design of robust structures. This is followed by a short review of synthetic strategies of stable MOFs including modulated synthesis and postsynthetic modifications. Based on the fundamentals of MOF stability, stable MOFs are classified into two categories: high-valency metal–carboxylate frameworks and low-valency metal–azolate frameworks. Along this line, some representative stable MOFs are introduced, their structures are described, and their properties are briefly discussed. The expanded applications of stable MOFs in Lewis/Br{\o}nsted acid catalysis, redox catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, gas storage, and sensing are highlighted. Overall, this review is expected to guide the design of stable MOFs by providing insights into existing structures, which could lead to the discovery and development of more advanced functional materials.},

Their narrow pore windows and nearly unlimited structural and chemical features have made these materials of significant interest for membrane-based gas separations. In this comprehensive review, we discuss opportunities and challenges related to the formation of pure MOF films and mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). Common and emerging separation applications are identified, and membrane transport theory for MOFs is described and contextualized relative to the governing principles that describe transport in polymers. Additionally, cross-cutting research opportunities using advanced metrologies and computational techniques are reviewed. To quantify membrane performance, we introduce a simple membrane performance score that has been tabulated for all of the literature data compiled in this review. These data are reported on upper bound plots, revealing classes of MOF materials that consistently demonstrate promising separation performance. Recommendations are provided with the intent of identifying the most promising materials and directions for the field in terms of fundamental science and eventual deployment of MOF materials for commercial membrane-based gas separations.},

abstract = {Membrane technology is attractive for natural gas separation (removing CO2, H2O, and hydrocarbons from CH4) because of membranes' low energy consumption and small environmental footprint. Compared to polymeric membranes, microporous inorganic membranes such as silicoaluminophosphate-34 (SAPO-34) membrane can retain their separation performance under conditions close to industrial requirements. However, moisture and hydrocarbons in natural gas can be strongly adsorbed in the pores of those membranes, thereby reducing the membrane separation performance. Herein, we report the fabrication of a polycrystalline MIL-160 membrane on an Al2O3 substrate by in situ hydrothermal synthesis. The MIL-160 membrane with a thickness of ca. 3 $\mu$m shows a remarkable molecular sieving effect in gas separation. Besides, the pore size and environment of the MIL-160 membrane can be precisely controlled using reticular chemistry by regulating the size and functionality of the ligand. Interestingly, the more polar fluorine-functionalized multivariate MIL-160/CAU-10-F membrane exhibits a 10.7% increase in selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation and a 31.2% increase in CO2 permeance compared to those of the MIL-160 membrane. In addition, hydrophobic MIL-160 membranes and MIL-160/CAU-10-F membranes are more resistant to water vapor and hydrocarbons than the hydrophilic SAPO-34 membranes.},

abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most promising porous adsorbents for methane storage; however, the highest reported storage capacities of about 270 cm3 (STP) cm-3 at 298 K and 65 bar are still much lower than the new US Department of Energy (DOE) target of 350 cm3 (STP) cm-3. Furthermore, it is very difficult to reach the DOE targets for volumetric (350 cm3 [STP] cm-3) and gravimetric (0.5 g [CH4]/g) storage capacities simultaneously for a single MOF. This review systematically evaluates and compares the methane storage capacities of reported MOFs at both 298 and 270 K. We found that slightly reducing the storage temperature to 270 K can significantly improve both the volumetric and gravimetric uptake. Our discoveries highlight that two unique MOFs, NU-111 and MOF-177 (which have high pore volumes of 2.09 and 1.89 cm3 g-1, respectively), not only have very high gravimetric capacities of 0.5 and 0.43 g/g, respectively, but also exhibit the highest working capacities ever reported: 239 and 230 cm3 (STP) cm-3, respectively. In addition, a usable empirical equation for predicting methane storage capacities (at 270 K and 65 bar) and some engineering strategies for thermal management are discussed.},

In addition to summarizing the gas uptakes of some benchmark MOFs, we emphasize on the desired chemical properties of MOFs for different gas storage/separation scenarios. Greenhouse gases (CO2), energy-related gases (H2 and CH4), and toxic gases (CO and NH3) are covered in the review.},

@article{Reatto1986,
abstract = {First, we demonstrate that careful simulations of fluids have enough accuracy that the resulting radial distribution function can be used to test inversion methods. Second, we introduce a method which allows extraction of the pair interaction starting from structural data for simple liquids even under triple-point condition. The method is an iterative predictor-corrector method in which the predictor is the modified hypernetted-chain equation and the corrector is simulation. We have verified the convergence of the method for the Lennard-Jones fluid and for a model potential for aluminum. We find that other methods of inversion give unreliable results. As a first application of our method we have inverted the experimental structural data of Na at 100°C. {\textcopyright} 1986 The American Physical Society.},

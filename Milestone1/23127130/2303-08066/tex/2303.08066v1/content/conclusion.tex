\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we investigate the bandwidth control problem in the hierarchical storage system. We design and implement a learning-aided cooperative control policy \Pascal{}, which regards the problem as a pressure balancing problem. Our evaluation shows that \Pascal{} can effectively decrease the throughput jitter and tail latency of the system, and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level. \Pascal{} is expected to be fully deployed in our commercial hierarchical storage product.

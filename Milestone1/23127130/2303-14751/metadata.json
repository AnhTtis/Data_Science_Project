    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose matrix-scaled consensus algorithms for linear dynamical agents interacting over an undirected network. These algorithms are designed to make the state vectors of all agents to asymptotically agree up to some matrix scaling weights. First, the matrix scaled Laplacian and its algebraic properties are examined. Second, we propose matrix-scaled consensus algorithms for networks of single integrators with or without constant parametric uncertainties. Third, observer-based matrix-scaled consensus algorithms for homogeneous or heterogeneous linear agents are designed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are asserted by rigorous mathematical analysis and supported by numerical simulations.",

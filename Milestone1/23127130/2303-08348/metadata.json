    "abstract": "In this paper, we study teacher-student learning from the perspective of data initialization and propose a novel algorithm called Active Teacher(Source code are available at: \\url{https://github.com/HunterJ-Lin/ActiveTeacher}) for semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). Active Teacher extends the teacher-student framework to an iterative version, where the label set is partially initialized and gradually augmented by evaluating three key factors of unlabeled examples, including difficulty, information and diversity. With this design, Active Teacher can maximize the effect of limited label information while improving the quality of pseudo-labels. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark and compare Active Teacher with a set of recently proposed SSOD methods. The experimental results not only validate the superior performance gain of Active Teacher over the compared methods, but also show that it enables the baseline network, ie, Faster-RCNN, to achieve 100% supervised performance with much less label expenditure, ie 40% labeled examples on MS-COCO. More importantly, we believe that the experimental analyses in this paper can provide useful empirical knowledge for data annotation in practical applications.",

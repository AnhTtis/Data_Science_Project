\captionof{figure}{Probabilistically correct object pose estimation. Given (a) an input image and heatmap detections of the object semantic keypoints, our method first \emph{conformalizes} the heatmaps into (b) circular or elliptical prediction sets that \emph{guarantee} probabilistic coverage of the groundtruth keypoints (\eg, $90\%$). Our method then propagates the uncertainty in the keypoints to the object pose, forming (c) a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (\purse) that contains the groundtruth pose with the same probability. 
% The \purse, however, is a nonconvex subset of $\SEthree$ governed by polynomial inequalities. 
We develop RANdom SAmple averaGing (\ransag) to sample from {\purse} and generate (d) an average pose, and apply semidefinite relaxation to compute (e) worst-case error bounds: the blue duck attains the worst rotation error \wrt the (average pose) yellow duck; the red duck attains the worst translation error.

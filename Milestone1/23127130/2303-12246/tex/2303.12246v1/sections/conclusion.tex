We applied inductive conformal prediction to conformalize heatmap predictions as circular or elliptical prediction sets that guarantee probabilistic coverage of the groundtruth keypoints, propagated the uncertainty in keypoints to the object pose to form a {\purse}, designed {\ransag} to sample from {\purse} and compute an average pose, and used SDP relaxations to bound worst-case estimation errors. We validated our theory on the LineMOD Occlusion dataset. Future research will investigate better nonconformity functions,
%  to tighten the prediction sets, 
 and applications to other vision problems.
% We applied inductive conformal prediction for statistically guaranteed keypoint detection. Given a heuristic heatmap, we design three nonconformity functions and calibrate the heatmap into a circular or elliptical prediction set that guarantees coverage of the true keypoint location with a user-specified probability. We demonstrate validity, tightness, and adaptiveness of the prediction sets on {\lmo}. 
% Future work will (i) apply inductive conformal prediction to other heuristic detectors such PVNet~\cite{peng19cvpr-pvnet}, and (ii) investigate algorithms to better leverage the guaranteed prediction sets for pose estimation.

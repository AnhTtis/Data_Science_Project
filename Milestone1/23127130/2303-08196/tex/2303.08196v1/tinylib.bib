  ABSTRACT = {Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required.In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems.The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places: mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables); exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12); Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2); confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2); hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2); elliptic integrals \{9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions \{3); Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13); combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11); probability functions (ll); scales of notation (6); miscellaneous functions (9); Laplace transforms (2); and others.Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over100 figures illustrate the text.In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem solving, experimentation and field work. This low-cost edition contains every page of the original government publication.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  ABSTRACT = {We show that a Fourier expansion of the exponential multiplier yields an exponential series that can compute high-accuracy values of the complex error function in a rapid algorithm. Numerical error analysis and computational test reveal that with essentially higher accuracy it is as fast as FFT-based Weideman’s algorithm at a regular size of the input array and considerably faster at an extended size of the input array. As this exponential series approximation is based only on elementary functions, the algorithm can be implemented utilizing freely available functions from the standard libraries of most programming languages. Due to its simplicity, rapidness, high-accuracy and coverage of the entire complex plane, the algorithm is efficient and practically convenient in numerical methods related to the spectral line broadening and other applications requiring error-function evaluation over extended input arrays.},

  ABSTRACT = {We develop a structural risk‐neutral model for energy market modifying along several directions the approach introduced in Aïd et al. In particular, a scarcity function is introduced to allow important deviations of the spot price from the marginal fuel price, producing price spikes. We focus on pricing and hedging electricity derivatives. The hedging instruments are forward contracts on fuels and electricity. The presence of production capacities and electricity demand makes such a market incomplete. We follow a local risk minimization approach to price and hedge energy derivatives. Despite the richness of information included in the spot model, we obtain closed‐form formulae for futures prices and semiexplicit formulae for spread options and European options on electricity forward contracts. An analysis of the electricity price risk premium is provided showing the contribution of demand and capacity to the futures prices. We show that when far from delivery, electricity futures behave like a basket of futures on fuels.},

  ABSTRACT = {A clear, practical and self-contained presentation of the methods of asymptotics and perturbation theory for obtaining approximate analytical solutions to differential and difference equations. Aimed at teaching the most useful insights in approaching new problems, the text avoids special methods and tricks that only work for particular problems. Intended for graduates and advanced undergraduates, it assumes only a limited familiarity with differential equations and complex variables. The presentation begins with a review of differential and difference equations, then develops local asymptotic methods for such equations, and explains perturbation and summation theory before concluding with an exposition of global asymptotic methods. Emphasizing applications, the discussion stresses care rather than rigor and relies on many well-chosen examples to teach readers how an applied mathematician tackles problems. There are 190 computer-generated plots and tables comparing approximate and exact solutions, over 600 problems of varying levels of difficulty, and an appendix summarizing the properties of special functions.},

  ABSTRACT = {For effective GPU-based Monte Carlo transport simulations, algorithms must be optimized with respect to the single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) paradigm. Commonly used free gas elastic scattering algorithms, such as Doppler-broadening rejection correction (DBRC) involve rejection sampling with low sampling efficiency, leading to GPU thread divergence. This paper proposes a new rejection-free algorithm based on the windowed multipole cross section representation. This method was prototyped and validated against DBRC on the CPU, and preliminary CPU timing results indicate that it could out-perform DBRC on the GPU. Future work will involve implementation and performance testing on the GPU using full-core reactor problems.},

@ARTICLE{choiRelativeSpeedTabulation2021,
  ABSTRACT = {A target velocity sampling method named the Relative Speed Tabulation (RST) is proposed for the efficient treatment of resonance elastic scattering in the Monte Carlo simulation utilizing graphics processing units (GPU). The RST method samples the relative speed between a neutron and a target nucleus by employing pretabulated probabilities of relative speeds. The target velocity is then determined from the sampled relative velocity and the neutron speed. The motivation was to avoid the rejection process of the Doppler Broadening Rejection Correction (DBRC) method, which can incur a significant reduction in the parallel performance of vector processors, such as GPUs, due to its largely varying rejection rates. The RST can also overcome the weakness of large variance of the Weight Correction Method (WCM), which would involve drastic changes in neutron weights. The verification results obtained for the Mosteller benchmark problems demonstrate that the RST is equivalent to the DBRC in accuracy, while the calculation speed remains at the same level of the WCM.},

@ARTICLE{choiOptimizationNeutronTracking2021,
  ABSTRACT = {The implementation and optimization strategies of the neutron tracking algorithms in the GPU-based continuous-energy Monte Carlo (MC) code PRAGMA are presented. The strategies consist of 1) a mixed precision technique, 2) an event-based tracking algorithm, 3) the history-based tracking algorithm improved for GPUs by imposing transition limits, 4) the region partitioning and energy sort schemes to vectorize macroscopic cross section calculations, 5) the unionized grid method improved by a linear hashing scheme, and 6) the GPU-specific implementation techniques such as the use of built-in vector types and an array-based race-free bank algorithm utilizing GPU atomic addition. The developed algorithms and strategies are examined for pin cell and full-core problems consisting of fresh and depleted fuels. PRAGMA turned out to be especially efficient in depleted fuel calculation; PRAGMA effectively overcame the performance drop in the depleted fuel calculation by vectorized cross section calculation. In the full-core calculations PRAGMA also rendered outstanding performance; calculations employing 11.5 billion histories and 20 consumer-grade GPUs could be finished within 15~min for a 3D APR1400 fresh core problem, and within half an hour for a mock-up depleted core problem.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an in-depth analysis on the accuracy and performance of the windowed multipole Doppler broadening method. The basic theory behind cross section data is described, along with the basic multipole formalism followed by the approximations leading to windowed multipole method and the algorithm used to efficiently evaluate Doppler broadened cross sections. The method is tested by simulating the BEAVRS benchmark with a windowed multipole library composed of 70 nuclides. Accuracy of the method is demonstrated on a single assembly case where total neutron production rates and U238 capture rates compare within 0.1\% to ACE format files at the same temperature. With regards to performance, clock cycle counts and cache misses were measured for single temperature ACE table lookup and for windowed multipole. The windowed multipole method was found to require 39.6\% more clock cycles to evaluate, translating to a 7.9\% performance loss overall. However, the algorithm has significantly better last-level cache performance, with 3 fewer misses per evaluation, or a 65\% reduction in last-level misses. This is due to the small memory footprint of the windowed multipole method and better memory access pattern of the algorithm.},

An exact scattering kernel is formulated and implemented in a newly developed Monte Carlo code, MCSD (Monte Carlo slowing down), which solves a neutron slowing down in an infinite homogeneous medium and is used to generate resonance integral data used in the CASMO-5 lattice physics code. It is shown that the exact scattering kernel increases LWR Doppler coefficients by ∼10\% relative to the traditional assumption of asymptotic elastic downscatter for 238U resonances. These resonance modeling improvements are shown to decrease hot full power eigenvalues by ∼200 pcm for LWRs and ∼450pcm for NGNPs.},

  ABSTRACT = {In order to investigate the impact of resonance elastic scattering models on the Doppler reactivity effect, the exact and the constant cross section models with the thermal motion of target nucleus were newly implemented into the MVP-2 continuous-energy Monte Carlo code with and without consideration of energy-dependent resonance cross section, respectively, and the UO2 pin-cell Doppler reactivity benchmark calculations were carried out with the modified code and the JENDL-3.3 library. The present study has revealed that the exact model gives more negative Doppler reactivity coefficients by 7–11\% than the conventional asymptotic model, while the constant cross section model gives slightly less negative coefficients than the conventional asymptotic model. Furthermore, it has been found that the impact of resonance elastic scattering models is considerably large around the resonances where elastic scattering has relatively high contribution, whereas capture-dominant resonances have no significant impacts of the models on the Doppler reactivity coefficients.},

  ABSTRACT = {We derive a probability distribution for the possible number of iterations required for a SIMT (single instruction multiple thread) program using rejection sampling to finish creating a sample across all threads. This distribution is found to match a recently proposed distribution from Chakraborty and Gupta (in: Communications in statistics: theory and methods, 2015) that was shown as a good approximation of certain datasets. This work demonstrates an exact application of this distribution. The distribution can be used to evaluate the relative merit of some sampling methods on the GPU without resort to numerical tests. The distribution reduces to the expected geometric distribution in the single thread per warp limit. A simplified formula to approximate the expected number of iterations required to obtain rejection iteration samples is provided. With this new result, a simple, efficient layout for assigning sampling tasks to threads on a GPU is found as a function of the rejection probability without recourse to more complicated rejection sampling methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Accurate yet efficient computation of the Voigt and complex error function is a challenge since decades in astrophysics and other areas of physics. Rational approximations have attracted considerable attention and are used in many codes, often in combination with other techniques. The 12-term code ‘cpf12’ of Humlíček achieves an accuracy of five to six significant digits throughout the entire complex plane. Here we generalize this algorithm to a larger (even) number of terms. The n~=~16 approximation has a relative accuracy better than 10−5 for almost the entire complex plane except for very small imaginary values of the argument even without the correction term required for the cpf12 algorithm. With 20 terms the accuracy is better than 10−6. In addition to the accuracy assessment we discuss methods for optimization and propose a combination of the 16-term approximation with the asymptotic approximation of the w4 code of Humlíček for high efficiency.},

@ARTICLE{trumbullEffectsApplyingDoppler2013,
  ABSTRACT = {The classical treatment for determining the scattering neutron energy and angle given epithermal scattering from heavy nuclides is to sample the target nuclei velocity using the Maxwellian ideal gas law while assuming a constant scattering cross section. This treatment has been shown to be inadequate to capture the upscattering effects from certain heavy nuclides with strong epithermal scattering resonances, e.g., 238U. A method to correctly account for the resonance scattering effects has been implemented in the MC21 Monte Carlo code. The method is based on the Doppler Broadening Rejection Correction (DBRC) method and also allows for the use of weight adjustment in lieu of rejection sampling. Whereas previous work has focused on applying the resonance scattering correction to 238U only, the MC21 implementation applies the rejection correction more broadly, including all uranium and plutonium isotopes in the models analyzed. This work demonstrates the effect of applying the DBRC to both LEU and MOX pin cell depletions on eigenvalue and nuclide inventories as a function of burn-up. As compared to a reference case lacking any resonance scattering correction, the effect on uranium and plutonium inventories is significant when applying the DBRC. In the case of the MOX fuel system, significant differences in the plutonium concentrations are also seen when DBRC is limited to just the 238U, suggesting that the DBRC method should be applied more broadly.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a new stochastic method for taking the effect of thermal motion into account on the fly in a Monte Carlo neutron transport calculation. The method is based on explicit treatment of the motion of target nuclei at collision sites and, consequently, requires simply cross sections at a temperature of 0 K regardless of the number of temperatures in the problem geometry. It utilizes rejection sampling techniques to manage the fact that total cross sections become distributed quantities. The method has a novel capability of accurately modeling continuous temperature distributions.The new stochastic method is verified using a simple test program, which compares its results to an analytical reference solution based on NJOY-broadened cross sections. Future implementation to Monte Carlo reactor physics code Serpent is also discussed shortly.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent works have pointed out some relevant shortcomings of the so called ‘Sampling of the Velocity of the Target nucleus’ (SVT) algorithm, which is currently used in most Monte Carlo codes for the Doppler broadening of the elastic scattering kernel. To overcome these limitations, which affect resonant nuclei such as 238U, and whose consequences in pincell criticality calculations can amount to a drop of several hundred pcm, the Doppler Broadening Rejection Correction (DBRC) and the Weight Correction Method (WCM) have been proposed. In this work, we illustrate the implementation of DBRC and WCM in the Tripoli-4® Monte Carlo code. Several validation tests are discussed, and the impact of using DBRC or WMC to replace SVT is analyzed in detail in static as well as burnup calculations for UOX and MOX pincells, and in a PWR full-core simulation.},

  abstract = {Nuclear cross sections are basic inputs to any nuclear computation. Campaigns of experiments are fitted with the parametric R-matrix model of quantum nuclear interactions, and the resulting cross sections are documented—both pointwise and as resonance parameters (with uncertainties)—in standard evaluated nuclear data libraries (ENDF, JEFF, BROND, JENDL, CENDL, TENDL): these constitute our common knowledge of fundamental low-energy nuclear cross sections. In the past decade, a collaborative effort has been deployed to establish a new nuclear cross-section library format—the Windowed Multipole Library—with the goal of considerably reducing the computational cost of cross-section calculations in nuclear transport simulations. This paper lays the theoretical foundations underpinning these efforts. From general R-matrix scattering theory, we derive the windowed multipole representation of nuclear cross sections. Though physically and mathematically equivalent to R-matrix cross sections, the windowed multipole representation is particularly well suited for subsequent temperature treatment of angle-integrated cross sections, in particular Doppler broadening, which is the averaging of cross sections over the thermal motion of the target atoms. Doppler broadening is of critical importance in neutron transport applications, as it ensures the stability of many nuclear reactors (negative thermal reactivity). Yet, Doppler broadening of nuclear cross sections has been a considerable bottleneck for nuclear transport computations, often requiring memory-costly pretabulations. We show that the windowed multipole representation can perform accurate Doppler broadening analytically (up to the first reaction threshold), from which we derive cross-section temperature derivatives to any order—all computable on the fly (without precalculations stored in memory). Furthermore, we here establish a way of converting the R-matrix resonance parameters uncertainty (covariance matrices) into windowed multipole parameters uncertainty. We show that generating stochastic nuclear cross sections by sampling from the resulting windowed multipole covariance matrix can reproduce the cross-section uncertainty in the original nuclear data file. The windowed multipole representation is therefore a novel nuclear physics formalism able to generate Doppler broadened stochastic nuclear cross sections on the fly, unlocking breakthrough computational gains for nuclear computations. Through this foundational paper, we hope to make the windowed multipole representation accessible, reproducible, and usable for the nuclear physics community, as well as provide the theoretical basis for future research on expanding its capabilities.},

  abstract = {The multipole representation provides an analytical way of Doppler broadening cross sections for neutron interactions and relies on a partial fraction decomposition that represents R-matrix resonance parameters by poles and residues. The windowed multipole method selectively broadens impactful poles and approximates the rest to increase the efficiency of the process. However, this process requires knowledge of the resonance parameters and certain limitations occur when additional channels are opened in the defined resolved resonance region such that only 2/3 of the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclides can be processed. Some important nuclides needed in reactor applications such as Oxygen-16 and Hydrogen-1 are directly represented in point-wise form in the evaluation nuclear data library hindering the practicality of this approach. This paper presents a new fitting method for nuclear point-wise cross sections data that yields a pole and residue form analogous to the multipole representation. The Vector Fitting technique which originates from the field of signal processing was applied to the fitting of point-wise cross sections. Poles and residues from Vector Fitting were generated for Oxygen-16, Hydrogen-1, Boron-10 and Boron-11 and processed in the windowed multipole format. These new libraries were tested by direct comparison of the microscopic cross sections before and after Doppler Broadening, and by integral comparisons using a typical PWR pin cell from the BEAVRS benchmark. Results indicate that the new libraries are equivalent to the point-wise representation with the added benefit of allowing on-the-fly Doppler broadening without the need for temperature interpolation. Runtimes are approximately ∼28\% slower using the multipole representation on this example problem compared to a single temperature ACE file.},

  abstract = {A rigorous method for representing the multilevel cross sections and its practical applications are described. It is a generalization of the rationale suggested by de Saussure and Perez for the s-wave resonances. The rationale can be interpreted as the natural consequences of the important physical condition that the collision matrices must be single valued and meromorphic in momentum space. Thus, the latter can be rigorously represented by rational functions with simple poles in √E domain for all states. Such representation is especially attractive when it is used in conjunction with the applications of the R-matrix parameters and the subsequent Doppler broadening using Solbrig’s kernel.A computer code WHOPPER has been developed to convert the Reich-Moore parameters into the pole and residue parameters in momentum space. Sample calculations have been carried out to illustrate that the proposed method preserves the rigor of the Reich-Moore cross sections exactly. An analytical method has been developed to evaluate the pertinent Doppler-broadened line shape functions. Since the principal parts of these functions are identical to the widely used ψ and χ functions when applied to the energy region above 1 eV, the method is readily amenable to many existing processing codes. A discussion is presented on how to minimize the number of pole parameters so that the existing reactor codes can be best utilized.},

Implemented in OpenMC, this method correctly accounts for the energy dependence of cross sections when treating the thermal motion of target nuclei in elastic scattering events. The method is verified against both stochastic and deterministic reference results in the literature for 238U resonance scattering. Upscatter percentages and mean scattered energies calculated with the method are shown to agree well with the reference scattering kernel results. Additionally, pin cell and full core keff results calculated with this implementation of the exact resonance scattering kernel are shown to be in close agreement with those in the literature. The attractiveness of the method stems from its improvement upon a computationally expensive rejection sampling procedure employed by an earlier stochastic resonance scattering treatment. With no loss in accuracy, the accelerated sampling algorithm is shown to reduce overall runtime by 3–5\% relative to the Doppler broadening rejection correction method for both pin cell and full core benchmark problems. This translates to a 30–40\% reduction in runtime overhead.},

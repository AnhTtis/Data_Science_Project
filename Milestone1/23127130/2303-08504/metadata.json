    "abstract": "We study the distribution of the sequence of continued fraction convergents $p_n/q_n$ to a random irrational number in the group $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z}_m)$, and in particular the distribution of $p_n \\pmod{m}$ and $q_n \\pmod{m}$ with a fixed modulus $m$. Improving the strong law of large numbers due to Szüsz, Moeckel, Jager and Liardet, we establish the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm, as well as the weak and the almost sure invariance principles. As an application, we find the limit distribution of the maximum and the minimum of the Birkhoff sum for the irrational rotation with the indicator of an interval as test function. We also compute the normalizing constant in a classical limit law for the same Birkhoff sum due to Kesten, and dispel a misconception about its dependence on the test interval.",

The signature verification algorithm is based on an artificial neural network. The novel network presented here, called a “Siamese” time delay neural network, consists of two identical networks joined at their output. During training the network learns to measure the similarity between pairs of signatures. When used for verification, only one half of the Siamese network is evaluated. The output of this half network is the feature vector for the input signature. Verification consists of comparing this feature vector with a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer than a chosen threshold to this stored representation are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries. System performance is illustrated with experiments performed in the laboratory.}},

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the \$L\_\{1\}\$ norm in the target space approximates the “semantic” distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves.}},

This provides a fine-grained OA severity assessment of the knee, compared to the gold standard and most commonly used Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) composite score. In this study, we developed an automatic method to predict KL and OARSI grades from knee radiographs. Our method is based on Deep Learning and leverages an ensemble of residual networks with 50 layers. We used transfer learning from ImageNet with a fine-tuning on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. An independent testing of our model was performed on the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) dataset. Our method yielded Cohen’s kappa coefficients of 0.82 for KL-grade and 0.79, 0.84, 0.94, 0.83, 0.84 and 0.90 for femoral osteophytes, tibial osteophytes and joint space narrowing for lateral and medial compartments, respectively. Furthermore, our method yielded area under the ROC curve of 0.98 and average precision of 0.98 for detecting the presence of radiographic OA, which is better than the current state-of-the-art.}},

Clinically, knee OA severity is assessed using Kellgren \& Lawrence (KL) grades, a five point scale. Previous work on automatically predicting KL grades from radiograph images were based on training shallow classifiers using a variety of hand engineered features. We demonstrate that classification accuracy can be significantly improved using deep convolutional neural network models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on knee OA images. Furthermore, we argue that it is more appropriate to assess the accuracy of automatic knee OA severity predictions using a continuous distance-based evaluation metric like mean squared error than it is to use classification accuracy. This leads to the formulation of the prediction of KL grades as a regression problem and further improves accuracy. Results on a dataset of X-ray images and KL grades from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) show a sizable improvement over the current state-of-the-art.}},

abstract = {{Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one major cause of activity limitation and physical disability in older adults. Early detection and intervention can help slow down the OA degeneration. Physicians’ grading based on visual inspection is subjective, varied across interpreters, and highly relied on their experience. In this paper, we successively apply two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically measure the knee OA severity, as assessed by the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. Firstly, considering the size of knee joints distributed in X-ray images with small variability, we detect knee joints using a customized one-stage YOLOv2 network. Secondly, we fine-tune the most popular CNN models, including variants of ResNet, VGG, and DenseNet as well as InceptionV3, to classify the detected knee joint images with a novel adjustable ordinal loss. To be specific, motivated by the ordinal nature of the knee KL grading task, we assign higher penalty to misclassification with larger distance between the predicted KL grade and the real KL grade. The baseline X-ray images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset are used for evaluation. On the knee joint detection, we achieve mean Jaccard index of 0.858 and recall of 92.2\% under the Jaccard index threshold of 0.75. On the knee KL grading task, the fine-tuned VGG-19 model with the proposed ordinal loss obtains the best classification accuracy of 69.7\% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.344. Both knee joint detection and knee KL grading achieve state-of-the-art performance. The code, dataset, and models are released at https://github.com/PingjunChen/KneeAnalysis.}},

The visual evaluation of OA still suffers from subjectivity. Recently, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems based on learning methods showed potential for improving knee OA diagnostic accuracy. However, learning discriminative properties can be a challenging task, particularly when dealing with complex data such as X-ray images, typically used for knee OA diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a Discriminative Regularized Auto Encoder (DRAE) that allows to learn both relevant and discriminative properties that improve the classification performance. More specifically, a penalty term, called discriminative loss is combined with the standard Auto-Encoder training criterion. This additional term aims to force the learned representation to contain discriminative information. Our experimental results on data from the public multicenter OsteoArthritis Initiative (OAI) show that the developed method presents potential results for early knee OA detection.}},

In this work, we show that a multi-class 3D FCN trained on manually labeled CT scans of several anatomical structures (ranging from the large organs to thin vessels) can achieve competitive segmentation results, while avoiding the need for handcrafting features or training class-specific models. To this end, we propose a two-stage, coarse-to-fine approach that will first use a 3D FCN to roughly define a candidate region, which will then be used as input to a second 3D FCN. This reduces the number of voxels the second FCN has to classify to ∼10\% and allows it to focus on more detailed segmentation of the organs and vessels. We utilize training and validation sets consisting of 331 clinical CT images and test our models on a completely unseen data collection acquired at a different hospital that includes 150 CT scans, targeting three anatomical organs (liver, spleen, and pancreas). In challenging organs such as the pancreas, our cascaded approach improves the mean Dice score from 68.5 to 82.2\%, achieving the highest reported average score on this dataset. We compare with a 2D FCN method on a separate dataset of 240 CT scans with 18 classes and achieve a significantly higher performance in small organs and vessels. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning our models to different datasets. Our experiments illustrate the promise and robustness of current 3D FCN based semantic segmentation of medical images, achieving state-of-the-art results. 1 1 Our code and trained models are available for download: github.com/holgerroth/3Dunet\_abdomen\_cascade.}},

The signature verification algorithm is based on an artificial neural network. The novel network presented here, called a “Siamese” time delay neural network, consists of two identical networks joined at their output. During training the network learns to measure the similarity between pairs of signatures. When used for verification, only one half of the Siamese network is evaluated. The output of this half network is the feature vector for the input signature. Verification consists of comparing this feature vector with a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer than a chosen threshold to this stored representation are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries. System performance is illustrated with experiments performed in the laboratory.}},

Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas of OA radiographic features allows performing independent assessment of knee osteophytes, joint space narrowing and other knee features. This provides a fine-grained OA severity assessment of the knee, compared to the gold standard and most commonly used Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) composite score. In this study, we developed an automatic method to predict KL and OARSI grades from knee radiographs. Our method is based on Deep Learning and leverages an ensemble of residual networks with 50 layers. We used transfer learning from ImageNet with a fine-tuning on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. An independent testing of our model was performed on the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) dataset. Our method yielded Cohen’s kappa coefficients of 0.82 for KL-grade and 0.79, 0.84, 0.94, 0.83, 0.84 and 0.90 for femoral osteophytes, tibial osteophytes and joint space narrowing for lateral and medial compartments, respectively. Furthermore, our method yielded area under the ROC curve of 0.98 and average precision of 0.98 for detecting the presence of radiographic OA, which is better than the current state-of-the-art.}},

Clinically, knee OA severity is assessed using Kellgren \& Lawrence (KL) grades, a five point scale. Previous work on automatically predicting KL grades from radiograph images were based on training shallow classifiers using a variety of hand engineered features. We demonstrate that classification accuracy can be significantly improved using deep convolutional neural network models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on knee OA images. Furthermore, we argue that it is more appropriate to assess the accuracy of automatic knee OA severity predictions using a continuous distance-based evaluation metric like mean squared error than it is to use classification accuracy. This leads to the formulation of the prediction of KL grades as a regression problem and further improves accuracy. Results on a dataset of X-ray images and KL grades from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) show a sizable improvement over the current state-of-the-art.}},

abstract = {{Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one major cause of activity limitation and physical disability in older adults. Early detection and intervention can help slow down the OA degeneration. Physicians’ grading based on visual inspection is subjective, varied across interpreters, and highly relied on their experience. In this paper, we successively apply two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically measure the knee OA severity, as assessed by the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. Firstly, considering the size of knee joints distributed in X-ray images with small variability, we detect knee joints using a customized one-stage YOLOv2 network. Secondly, we fine-tune the most popular CNN models, including variants of ResNet, VGG, and DenseNet as well as InceptionV3, to classify the detected knee joint images with a novel adjustable ordinal loss. To be specific, motivated by the ordinal nature of the knee KL grading task, we assign higher penalty to misclassification with larger distance between the predicted KL grade and the real KL grade. The baseline X-ray images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset are used for evaluation. On the knee joint detection, we achieve mean Jaccard index of 0.858 and recall of 92.2\% under the Jaccard index threshold of 0.75. On the knee KL grading task, the fine-tuned VGG-19 model with the proposed ordinal loss obtains the best classification accuracy of 69.7\% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.344. Both knee joint detection and knee KL grading achieve state-of-the-art performance. The code, dataset, and models are released at https://github.com/PingjunChen/KneeAnalysis.}},

The visual evaluation of OA still suffers from subjectivity. Recently, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems based on learning methods showed potential for improving knee OA diagnostic accuracy. However, learning discriminative properties can be a challenging task, particularly when dealing with complex data such as X-ray images, typically used for knee OA diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a Discriminative Regularized Auto Encoder (DRAE) that allows to learn both relevant and discriminative properties that improve the classification performance. More specifically, a penalty term, called discriminative loss is combined with the standard Auto-Encoder training criterion. This additional term aims to force the learned representation to contain discriminative information. Our experimental results on data from the public multicenter OsteoArthritis Initiative (OAI) show that the developed method presents potential results for early knee OA detection.}},

year = {2017},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Confidence calibration - the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood - is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling - a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling - is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

abstract = {Recent advances in acquisition and display technologies have led to an enormous amount of visual data, which requires appropriate storage and management tools. One of the fundamental needs is the design of efficient image classification and recognition solutions. In this paper, we propose a wavelet neural network approach for sparse representation-based object classification. The proposed approach aims to exploit the advantages of sparse coding, multi-scale wavelet representation as well as neural networks. More precisely, a wavelet transform is firstly applied to the image datasets. The generated approximation and detail wavelet subbands are then fed into a multi-branch neural network architecture. This architecture produces multiple sparse codes that are efficiently combined during the classification stage. Extensive experiments, carried out on various types of standard object datasets, have shown the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the existing sparse coding and deep learning-based methods.}

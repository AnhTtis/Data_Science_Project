By analyzing this domain and extracting working computational ideas we want to offer a set of tools for the future creation of representations, operators, and search techniques that can competitively solve complex problems. To illustrate this, we describe an epiGenetic Algorithm, analyze its behavior and solve a set of instances of the multidimensional knapsack problem. Since we are in some measure opening a new line of research, we include a description of epigenetics and computational search, show their working principles and show an example algorithm solving a real problem. Our aim is to offer ideas as well as put them to work, to show that they are actually competitive, not just a nice new inspiration.}

 abstract = {1. Two replicate experiments were made, in which treatment by ether vapour was given to the eggs of Drosophila melanogaster 2 1/2--3 1/2 hours after laying, and selection practised either for the tendency to produce bithorax-like phenocopies ('upward selection'), or against it ('downward selection'). The two foundation stocks were both Oregon-K wild types, but had been bred separately for some considerable time. 2. Selection was effective in both directions, but its progress was not followed in detail owing to the death of many extreme phenocopies in the puparia. 3. In the 8th and 9th generations of the Up selected line of Experiment II, flies which showed a slight enlargement of the halteres appeared among the untreated individuals. These gave rise to a series of stocks, which were found to contain a dominant allele of Bxl with recessive lethal effect. 4. In the 29th generation of the Up selected line of Experiment I, similar flies were again found among untreated individuals. These gave rise to a stock (He 17), which contained a factor which was indistinguishable from that mentioned in para. 3. It might, indeed, have arisen through contamination by flies carrying that gene; but the numbers involved in the experiment (c. 150,000) make it conceivable that both occurrences of the gene were due to independent chance mutations. 5. In the 29th generation of the Up selected line of Experiment I there also occurred, among untreated individuals, some showing the metathorax partially converted into a mesothorax. These gave rise to a stock He*, in which the bithorax phenotype appears in high frequency and extreme grade. The genetic basis of the character is partly a recessive gene which causes females to produce eggs developing into bithorax phenotypes (a maternal effect), and partly a number of minor genes on both the second and third chromosomes. 6. Selection for sensitivity to one type of environmental stimulus does not necessarily produce susceptibility to stimuli of a different type. 7. The fact that such a bizarre phenotype as bithorax can be assimilated, with high grade expression, in less than 30 generations, suggests that the genetic assimilation mechanism is a very powerful one, which could have far-reaching effects during evolution.},

abstract = {We present the results of our work in simulating the recently discovered findings in molecular biology regarding the significant role which histones play in regulating the gene expression in eukaryotes. Extending the notion of inheritable genotype in evolutionary computation from the commonly considered model of DNA to chromatin (DNA and histones), we present epigenetic programming as an approach, incorporating an explicitly controlled gene expression through modification of histones in strongly-typed genetic programming (STGP). We propose a double cell representation of the simulated individuals, comprising somatic cell and germ cell, both represented by their respective chromatin structures. Following biologically plausible concepts, we regard the plastic phenotype of the somatic cell, achieved via controlled gene expression owing to modifications to histones (epigenetic learning, EL) as relevant for fitness evaluation, while the genotype of the germ cell corresponds to the phylogenesis of the individuals. The beneficial effect of EL on the performance characteristics of STGP is verified on evolution of social behavior of a team of predator agents in the predator–prey pursuit problem. Empirically obtained performance evaluation results indicate that EL contributes to about 2-fold improvement of computational effort of STGP. We trace the cause for that to the cumulative effect of polyphenism and epigenetic stability, both contributed by EL. The former allows for phenotypic diversity of genotypically similar individuals, while the latter robustly preserves the individuals from the destructive effects of crossover by silencing certain genotypic combinations and explicitly activating them only when they are most likely to be expressed in corresponding beneficial phenotypic traits.}

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors; thus, brain epigenomic alterations may provide insights into AD pathogenesis. Multiple array-based Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWASs) have identified robust brain methylation changes in AD; however, array-based assays only test about 2{\%} of all CpG sites in the genome. Here, we develop EWASplus, a computational method that uses a supervised machine learning strategy to extend EWAS coverage to the entire genome. Application to six AD-related traits predicts hundreds of new significant brain CpGs associated with AD, some of which are further validated experimentally. EWASplus also performs well on data collected from independent cohorts and different brain regions. Genes found near top EWASplus loci are enriched for kinases and for genes with evidence for physical interactions with known AD genes. In this work, we show that EWASplus implicates additional epigenetic loci for AD that are not found using array-based AD EWASs.},

Epigenetic phenomena have major economic and medical relevance, and several, such as imprinting and paramutation, violate Mendelian principles. Recent discoveries link the recognition of nucleic acid sequence homology to the targeting of DNA methylation, chromosome remodeling, and RNA turnover. Although epigenetic mechanisms help to protect cells from parasitic elements, this defense can complicate the genetic manipulation of plants and animals. Essential for normal development, epigenetic controls become misdirected in cancer cells and other human disease syndromes.",

Because of increasing evidence that DNA methylation is important in gene expression (for review see refs 7, 9--11), several investigators have studied DNA methylation in animal tumours, transformed cells and leukaemia cells in culture8,12--30. The results of these studies have varied; depending on the techniques and systems used, an increase12--19, decrease20--24, or no change25--29 in the degree of methylation has been reported. To our knowledge, however, primary human tumour tissues have not been used in such studies. We have now examined DNA methylation in human cancer with three considerations in mind: (1) the methylation pattern of specific genes, rather than total levels of methylation, was determined; (2) human cancers and adjacent analogous normal tissues, unconditioned by culture media, were analysed; and (3) the cancers were taken from patients who had received neither radiation nor chemotherapy. In four of five patients studied, representing two histological types of cancer, substantial hypomethylation was found in genes of cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. This hypomethylation was progressive in a metastasis from one of the patients.},

By exploiting the leading role of epigenetics in tumour development and the reversibility of epigenetic modifications, promising novel epigenetic-based therapies are being developed.

Because MZ twinning rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres, Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary: because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.},

A principle component of chromatin that plays a key role in this regulation is the modification of histones. There is an ever-growing list of these modifications and the complexity of their action is only just beginning to be understood. However, it is clear that histone modifications play fundamental roles in most biological processes that are involved in the manipulation and expression of DNA. Here, we describe the known histone modifications, define where they are found genomically and discuss some of their functional consequences, concentrating mostly on transcription where the majority of characterisation has taken place.},

    "abstract": "We present the results of our study of the X-ray pulsar IGR J21343+4738 based on NuSTAR, Swift, and SRG observations in the wide energy range 0.3 - 79 keV. The absence of absorption features in the energy spectra of the source, both averaged and phase-resolved ones, has allowed us to estimate the upper and lower limits on the magnetic field of the neutron star in the binary system, $B<2.5\\times10^{11}$G and $B>3.4 \\times 10^{12}$G, respectively. The spectral and timing analyses have shown that IGR J21343+4738 has all properties of a quasi-persistent X-ray pulsar with a pulsation period of $322.71\\pm{0.04}$s and a luminosity $L_{x} \\simeq3.3$ $\\times10^{35}$erg s$^{-1}$. The analysis of the long-term variability of the object in X-rays has confirmed the possible orbital period of the binary system $\\sim 34.3$ days previously detected in the optical range.",

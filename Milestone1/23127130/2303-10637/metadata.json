    "abstract": "Given a sound first-order p-time theory $T$ capable of formalizing syntax of first-order logic we define a p-time function $g_T$ that stretches all inputs by one bit and we use its properties to show that $T$ must be incomplete. We leave it as an open problem whether for some $T$ the range of $g_T$ intersects all infinite NP sets (i.e. whether it is a proof complexity generator hard for all proof systems).\n  A propositional version of the construction shows that at least one of the following three statements is true:\n  - there is no p-optimal propositional proof system (this is equivalent to the non-existence of a time-optimal propositional proof search algorithm),\n  - $E \\not\\subseteq P/poly$,\n  - there exists function $h$ that stretches all inputs by one bit, is computable in sub-exponential time and its range $Rng(h)$ intersects all infinite NP sets.",

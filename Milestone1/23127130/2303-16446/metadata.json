    "abstract": "We present a sample of 330 blue edge-on low surface brightness galaxies (ELSBGs). To understand the chemical evolution of LSBGs, we derived the gas-phase abundance and the [$α$/Fe] ratio. Compared with star-forming galaxies, ELSBGs show a flatter trend in the mass-metallicity ($M_*-Z$) relation, suggesting that the oxygen abundance enhancement is inefficient. We focus on 77 ELSBGs with HI data and found the closed-box model can not explain their gas fraction and metallicity relation, implying that infall and/or outflow is needed. We derived the [$α$/Fe] ratio of normal ELSBG ($<$ 10$^{9.5}$M$\\odot$) and massive ELSBG ($>=$ 10$^{9.5}$M$\\odot$) using single stellar population grids from MILES stellar library. The mean [$α$/Fe] ratios are 0.18 and 0.4 for normal ELSBG and massive ELSBG, respectively. We discussed that the long time-scale of star-formation, and/or metal-rich gas outflow event caused by SNe Ia winds are likely responsible for the $α$-enhancement of massive ELSBGs.",

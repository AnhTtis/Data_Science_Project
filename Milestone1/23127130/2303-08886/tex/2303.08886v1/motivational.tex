In this section, we will briefly describe a deployment scenario and the problems that arise when we are using the current state of the art of FHE integrity. We assume a privacy preserving Deep Neural Network (DNN) system where the client input is confidential. The function $f()$ in this system takes two input. The first input is $x$ the client data and server input $w$ the weight data.

\subsubsection{FHE-MAC Integrity Approach}
MAC approach does not support server input data. To ensure integrity across the computation, an interactive communication between client and server is needed.

Server needs to send $w$ to client and ask the client to encode and encrypt $w$.

MAC only support a linear function. Server needs to send some intermediete output to client side. The client then do the non linear function locally.

\subsubsection{FHE-ZKP Integrity Approach}
FHE-ZKP approach consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Client] KGEN($1^\lambda$,f) $\rightarrow$ (pk,sk)
    \item [Client] $ENC_{key}(x) \rightarrow (c_x,\tau_x)$
    \item [Server] $EVAL_{pk} (c_x,\tau_x) \rightarrow (c_y,\tau_y)$
    \item [Client] $VERIFY_{sk}(c_y,\tau_x,\tau_y) \rightarrow b$
    \item [Client] $DEC_{sk}(c_y) \rightarrow y$
\end{enumerate}

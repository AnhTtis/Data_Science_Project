In this research paper, we present the blind hash, an innovative approach designed to ensure data integrity in FHE computations. Our proposed method offers several key advantages, including scalability, low computational overhead, and compatibility with a diverse range of popular FHE schemes currently available. By addressing data integrity concerns, the blind hash technique contributes to the growing body of research on secure FHE computations and has the potential to enhance the practicality of FHE-based solutions across numerous applications.

@article{Spiller2017,
abstract = {A novel approach for minimum-time reconfiguration of satellite formations is proposed considering the perturbation forces as control variables. Planning appropriate attitude maneuvers for each satellite, the atmospheric drag and of the solar radiation pressure are properly controlled, and the formation is given the appropriate inputs to achieve the imposed reconfiguration. Limits and advantages of the presented maneuvers are examined considering low Earth orbits, medium Earth orbits, and geostationary orbits. The recent inverse dynamics particle swarm optimization is involved; the integration of the attitude dynamics is avoided, thus reducing the computational effort, and satisfied attitude constraints at the initial and final time instants are guaranteed. B-spline curves approximate the attitude kinematics, variable time mesh points are introduced, and adaptive decreasing tolerances are considered for the imposed constraints. The evolution of the configuration is simulated with a high-fidelity orbital simulator considering all the perturbations that can affect the maneuver. Two test cases are taken into account, one involving a circular formation reconfiguration and the other an along-track reconfiguration.},

@article{Tsujii2013,
abstract = {The motion of a charged satellite subjected to the Earth's magnetic field is considered. The Lorentz force, which acts on a charged particle when it is moving through a magnetic field, provides a new concept of propellantless electromagnetic propulsion. A dynamic model of a charged satellite, including the effect of the Lorentz force in the vicinity of a circular or an elliptic orbit, is derived and its application to formation flying is considered. Based on Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations and Tschauner-Hempel equations, analytical approximations for the relative motion in Earth orbit are obtained. The analysis based on the linearized equations shows the controllability of the system by stepwise charge control. The sequential quadratic programming method is applied to solve the orbital transfer problem of the original nonlinear equations in which the analytical solutions cannot be obtained.Astrategy to reduce the charge amount using sequential quadratic programming is also developed.

@article{Brouwer1959,
abstract = {Sections 1-6 give the solution of the main problem for a spheroidal earth with the potential limited to the principal term and the second harmonic which contains the small factor {\&} 2 . The solution is developed in powers of ¿2 in canonical variables by a method which is basically the same as that used in treating a different problem by von Zeipel (1916). The periodic terms are divided in two classes: the short-period terms contain the mean anomaly in their argu-ments ; the arguments of the long-period terms are multiples of the mean argument of the perigee. The periodic terms, both of short and long period, are developed to 0({\&} 2) ; the secular motions are obtained to 0({\pounds} 2 2). The results are obtained in closed form ; no series developments in eccentricity or inclination arise. The solution does not apply to orbits near the critical inclination, 63 ?4, but is otherwise valid for any eccentricity {\textless} I and any inclination. Section 7 gives the long-period terms and the additions to the secular motions caused by the fourth harmonic in the potential ; section 8 gives the contributions by the third and fifth harmonics ; section 9 contains formulas for computation.},

abstract = {An algorithm of satellite formation flying control in the Low-Earth Orbit using the aerodynamic force is considered. A simple model of the aerodynamic force that takes into account the lift component of the force is proposed. It allows us to calculate the satellite attitude relative to the incoming flow that provides the required aerodynamic force. For the given model parameters the acceptable control region is obtained. The relative motion control algorithm based on the Linear-Quadratic Regulator is considered. The technique for the algorithm parameters determination is suggested. Numerical study of the controlled motion is carried out. The simulation takes into account the second harmonic of the Earth gravitational field and the inaccuracy of the atmospheric density model.}

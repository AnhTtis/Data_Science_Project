    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows for the training of competent agents from offline datasets without any interaction with the environment. Online finetuning of such offline models can further improve performance. But how should we ideally finetune agents obtained from offline RL training? While offline RL algorithms can in principle be used for finetuning, in practice, their online performance improves slowly. In contrast, we show that it is possible to use standard online off-policy algorithms for faster improvement. However, we find this approach may suffer from policy collapse, where the policy undergoes severe performance deterioration during initial online learning. We investigate the issue of policy collapse and how it relates to data diversity, algorithm choices and online replay distribution. Based on these insights, we propose a conservative policy optimization procedure that can achieve stable and sample-efficient online learning from offline pretraining.",

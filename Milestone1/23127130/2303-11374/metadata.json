    "abstract": "Dynamical stellar-evolution modeling through the AGB phase reveals that radial pulsations with very fast-growing amplitudes develop if the luminosity to mass ratio of stars with tenuous envelopes exceeds a critical limit. An instability going nonlinear already after a few pulsation cycles might qualify as a source of the superwind - postulated to shed a substantial part of a star's envelope over a very short time - of hitherto persistently mysterious nature.",

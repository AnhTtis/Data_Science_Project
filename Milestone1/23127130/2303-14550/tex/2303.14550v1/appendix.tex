% There has been a lot of seminal work about this problem. Directly tracking $\phi_\mu(G)$ is co-$\mathbb{NP}$ hard, so people tend to design approximation algorithms to find good solutions. There are two main types of algorithms, flow-based and spectral-based. The flow-based algorithms are based on single-commodity flow or multi-commodity flow and they can find a solution with approximation ratio  $\log^{O(1)} n$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in a graph.\cite{LR99, orecchia2008partitioning,ARV09, KRV09, sherman2009breaking}.
% The spectral-based methods are mostly studying matrices or diffusion on graphs \cite{andersen2006local, orecchia2012approximating, ST13}. These spectral methods can  give a cut with conductance $\Theta(\sqrt{\phi_\mu(G)})$. 


%This kind of graphs we generate will have a dense core in the middle, which makes delocalizing harder.

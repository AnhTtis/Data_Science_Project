% In this paper, we propose a new task called taxonomy entering evaluation, we mainly used GAN to generate vast negative but confusing samples which should not be added into the existing taxonomy.



% In this paper, we propose an adaptively self-supervised user behavior-oriented product taxonomy expansion framework.
% The user behavior information allows our model to learn the domain-specific relational and structural representations while matching the users' intention and cognition.
% The adaptively self-supervised generation strategy can construct a high-quality and balanced training dataset that avoids inheriting problems in the existing taxonomy.
% Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world product taxonomies have shown that the results achieved by our proposed framework improve considerably over state-of-the-art both in automatic and manual evaluations.
% We observe that much other information can be incorporated into the model, such as image and merchant information.
% In the future, we will further explore other means to determine the problematic cases which need commonsense knowledge or domain knowledge.

This paper studies the drawbacks of the existing taxonomy expansion methods when applied to the real-scenarios.
We propose a pluggable framework called GANTEE to alleviate these drawbacks.
Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that GANTEE can boost the efficiency and effectiveness of the taxonomy expansion task.
Interesting future work includes lower the representation learning expense or learning representation for multi-model queries in the task of taxonomy expansion.

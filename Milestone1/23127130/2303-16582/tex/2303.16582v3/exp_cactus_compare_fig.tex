	\caption{Survival plots of the best configuration of \ugotNL (\citeexpid{7}{b}) compared with the other state-of-the-art SMT solvers.  
		For each solver, the plot shows the number of
		instances solved (x axis) within the given time (y axis). 
		Note that the plots of \cvctool and \mathsat are very close to each other (this is not surprising, as both tool use the same technique, incremental linearization).

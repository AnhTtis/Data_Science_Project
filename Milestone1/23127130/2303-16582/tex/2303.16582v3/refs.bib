In this article, we tackle the problems of SMT and VMT over the theories of nonlinear arithmetic over the reals (NRA) and of NRA augmented with transcendental (exponential and trigonometric) functions (NTA).We propose a new abstraction-refinement approach for SMT and VMT on NRA or NTA, called Incremental Linearization. The idea is to abstract nonlinear multiplication and transcendental functions as uninterpreted functions in an abstract space limited to linear arithmetic on the rationals with uninterpreted functions. The uninterpreted functions are incrementally axiomatized by means of upper- and lower-bounding piecewise-linear constraints. In the case of transcendental functions, particular care is required to ensure the soundness of the abstraction.The method has been implemented in the MathSAT SMT solver and in the nuXmv model checker. An extensive experimental evaluation on a wide set of benchmarks from verification and mathematics demonstrates the generality and the effectiveness of our approach.},

	This chapter reviews that continuous constraint solving has been widely studied in several fields of applied mathematics and computer science. In computer algebra, continuous constraints are viewed as formulas from first-order logic interpreted over the real numbers. The symbolic algorithms transform the constraint systems within the same equivalence class in the interpretation domain according to some simplification ordering. The chapter also discusses the interval analysis, which is a set extension of numerical analysis such that the floating-point numbers are replaced with the intervals. The interval approximations are defined so as to enclose the computed real quantities and the algorithms are said to be complete. In constraint programming, continuous constraints are viewed as relations. The complete solving of nonlinear systems is implemented by exhaustive search techniques that compute solution space coverings by means of multi-dimensional boxes. The search is commonly accelerated through propagation-based algorithms. It reviews that continuous and interval constraints are generally contrasted with non negative integer or more generally discrete constraints. These last constraints, sometimes also called finite domain constraints, are studied in the constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) framework and are basic components of most current constraint-based languages.}

We show that the CEGAR framework forming the theoretical basis of , makes provable progress in each iteration of the abstraction-refinement loop. The current tool is a significant advance on previous versions of ---it considers a richer class of abstract models (polyhedral flows as opposed to rectangular flows), and can be applied to a larger class of concrete models (non-linear hybrid automata as opposed to affine hybrid automata). These advances have led to better performance results for a wider class of examples. We report an experimental comparison of against other state of the art tools for affine models (, , and ) and non-linear models (, , and ).",

The procedure finds the domain and the zero set of a function f in an arbitrary, possibly unbounded, interval as long as f is represented by a tame expression. An elementary expression is tame if the arguments of its trigonometric subexpressions are bounded. We discuss implementation of the procedure and give empirical results. The procedure requires the ability to determine signs of elementary functions at simple roots of other elementary functions. The currently known method to do this depends on Schanuel's conjecture [7].},

abstract = {Mixed trigonometric-polynomials (MTPs) are functions of the form f(x,sin⁡x,cos⁡x) where f is a trivariate polynomial with rational coefficients, and the argument x ranges over the reals. In this paper, an algorithm “isolating” all the real roots of an MTP is provided and implemented. It automatically divides the real roots into two parts: one consists of finitely many roots in an interval [μ−,μ+] while the other consists of countably many roots in R﹨[μ−,μ+]. For the roots in [μ−,μ+], the algorithm returns isolating intervals and corresponding multiplicities while for those greater than μ+, it returns finitely many mutually disjoint small intervals Ii⊂[−π,π], integers ci>0 and multisets of root multiplicity {mj,i}j=1ci such that any root >μ+ is in the set (∪i∪k∈N(Ii+2kπ)) and any interval Ii+2kπ⊂(μ+,∞) contains exactly ci distinct roots with multiplicities m1,i,...,mci,i, respectively. The efficiency of the algorithm is shown by experiments. The method used to isolate the roots in [μ−,μ+] is applicable to any other bounded interval as well. The algorithm takes advantages of the weak Fourier sequence technique and deals with the intervals period-by-period without scaling the coordinate so to keep the length of the sequence short. The new approaches can easily be modified to decide whether there is any root, or whether there are infinitely many roots in unbounded intervals of the form (−∞,a) or (a,∞) with a∈Q.}

abstract = {We consider a class of univariate real functions—poly-powers—that extend integer exponents to real algebraic exponents for polynomials. Our purpose is to isolate positive roots of such a function into disjoint intervals, each contains exactly one positive root and together contain all, which can be easily refined to any desired precision. To this end, we first classify poly-powers into simple and non-simple ones, depending on the number of linearly independent exponents. For the former, based on Gelfond–Schneider theorem, we present two complete isolation algorithms—exclusion and differentiation. For the latter, their completeness depends on Schanuel's conjecture. We implement the two methods and compare them in efficiency via a few examples. Finally the proposed methods are applied to the field of systems biology to show the practical usefulness.}

The list of transcendental functions to which our decision method directly applies includes exp(x), the exponential function with respect to base e, ln(x), the natural logarithm of x, and arctan(x), the inverse tangent function. The inputs to the decision procedure are prenex sentences in which only the outermost quantified variable can occur in the transcendental function. In the case trans(x)=exp(x), the decision procedure has been implemented in the computer logic system REDLOG. It is shown how to transform a sentence involving a transcendental function from a much wider collection of functions (such as hyperbolic and Gaussian functions, and trigonometric functions on a certain bounded interval) into a sentence to which our decision method directly applies. Closely related work is reported by Anai and Weispfenning (2000), Collins (1998), Maignan (1998), Richardson (1991), Strzebonski (in press) and Weispfenning (2000).}

Roughly speaking, a trigonometric extension is a ring of univariate analytic functions obtained by adjoining trigonometric functions to a ring consisting of functions having only finitely many real zeros. It is shown that in this case, the decision problem can be reduced to looking for solutions in a bounded domain. Based on the reduction, several new decidability results are established when Schanuel’s Conjecture is assumed. Furthermore, for the theory of multivariate trigonometric extension, it is proved that, although a small fragment of the theory can be reduced to the univariate case, the general theory is undecidable.},

abstract = {For typical first-order logical theories, satisfying assignments have a straightforward finite representation that can directly serve as a certificate that a given assignment satisfies the given formula. For non-linear real arithmetic augmented with trigonometric and exponential functions (NTA), however, there is no known direct representation of satisfying assignments that allows for a simple independent check of whether the represented numbers exist and satisfy the given formula. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a different form of satisfiability certificate for NTA, and formulate the satisfiability problem as the problem of searching for such a certificate. This does not only ease the independent verification of satisfiability, but also allows the design of new algorithms that show satisfiability by systematically searching for such certificates. Computational experiments document that the resulting algorithms are able to prove satisfiability of a substantially higher number of benchmark problems than existing methods. We also characterize the formulas whose satisfiability can be demonstrated by such a certificate, by providing lower and upper bounds in terms of relevant well-known classes. Finally we show the existence of a procedure for checking the satisfiability of NTA-formulas that terminates for formulas that satisfy certain robustness assumptions.},

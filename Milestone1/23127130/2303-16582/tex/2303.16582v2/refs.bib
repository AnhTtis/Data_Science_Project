abstract = {Proof production for SMT solvers is paramount to ensure their correctness independently from implementations, which are often prohibitively difficult to verify. Historically, however, SMT proof production has struggled with performance and coverage issues, resulting in the disabling of many crucial solving techniques and in coarse-grained (and thus hard to check) proofs. We present a flexible proof-production architecture designed to handle the complexity of versatile, industrial-strength SMT solvers and show how we leverage it to produce detailed proofs, including for components previously unsupported by any solver. The architecture allows proofs to be produced modularly, lazily, and with numerous safeguards for correctness. This architecture has been implemented in the state-of-the-art SMT solver cvc5. We evaluate its proofs for SMT-LIB benchmarks and show that the new architecture produces better coverage than previous approaches, has acceptable performance overhead, and supports detailed proofs for most solving components.},

In this article, we tackle the problems of SMT and VMT over the theories of nonlinear arithmetic over the reals (NRA) and of NRA augmented with transcendental (exponential and trigonometric) functions (NTA).We propose a new abstraction-refinement approach for SMT and VMT on NRA or NTA, called Incremental Linearization. The idea is to abstract nonlinear multiplication and transcendental functions as uninterpreted functions in an abstract space limited to linear arithmetic on the rationals with uninterpreted functions. The uninterpreted functions are incrementally axiomatized by means of upper- and lower-bounding piecewise-linear constraints. In the case of transcendental functions, particular care is required to ensure the soundness of the abstraction.The method has been implemented in the MathSAT SMT solver and in the nuXmv model checker. An extensive experimental evaluation on a wide set of benchmarks from verification and mathematics demonstrates the generality and the effectiveness of our approach.},

	This chapter reviews that continuous constraint solving has been widely studied in several fields of applied mathematics and computer science. In computer algebra, continuous constraints are viewed as formulas from first-order logic interpreted over the real numbers. The symbolic algorithms transform the constraint systems within the same equivalence class in the interpretation domain according to some simplification ordering. The chapter also discusses the interval analysis, which is a set extension of numerical analysis such that the floating-point numbers are replaced with the intervals. The interval approximations are defined so as to enclose the computed real quantities and the algorithms are said to be complete. In constraint programming, continuous constraints are viewed as relations. The complete solving of nonlinear systems is implemented by exhaustive search techniques that compute solution space coverings by means of multi-dimensional boxes. The search is commonly accelerated through propagation-based algorithms. It reviews that continuous and interval constraints are generally contrasted with non negative integer or more generally discrete constraints. These last constraints, sometimes also called finite domain constraints, are studied in the constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) framework and are basic components of most current constraint-based languages.}

We show that the CEGAR framework forming the theoretical basis of , makes provable progress in each iteration of the abstraction-refinement loop. The current tool is a significant advance on previous versions of ---it considers a richer class of abstract models (polyhedral flows as opposed to rectangular flows), and can be applied to a larger class of concrete models (non-linear hybrid automata as opposed to affine hybrid automata). These advances have led to better performance results for a wider class of examples.

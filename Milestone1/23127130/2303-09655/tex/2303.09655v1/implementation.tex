We implemented RT-DBSCAN using the Optix Wrapper Library (OWL), which is built on top of Optix 7. The tests were run on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU (with RT cores) with 6 GB device memory, CUDA version 10.1 and Optix 7.1.

OWL has separate programs for different components of the ray tracing pipeline: bounding box construction, intersection test, closest hit and any hit. We implemented the fixed-radius nearest neighbors search and the DBSCAN clustering phases within the Intersection program, saving the cost of calling the {\tt AnyHit} or {\tt ClosestHit} program.

 As Optix only accepts 3D inputs, we set the z-dimension to 0 for 2D datasets and set the z-dimension of the ray direction as 1. We also explicitly disabled the {\tt AnyHit} and {\tt ClosestHit} programs to avoid overhead costs.

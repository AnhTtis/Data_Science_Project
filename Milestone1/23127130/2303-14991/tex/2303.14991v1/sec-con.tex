\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we showed that the cross-encoder performs poorly when there are not sufficient training samples which are hard to obtain in the cross-lingual setting. Then we proposed a novel method that utilizes the query generator to improve the dual-encoder.
We firstly proposed to use a query generator as the teacher.
After that, we proposed a novel alignment method for cross-lingual retrieval which does not need any parallel corpus. 
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines and significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance. 
Currently, our method depends on training data in all target languages. As future work, we will investigate how to perform the proposed method for zero-shot cross-lingual dense retrieval.

\section{Limitations}

The limitations are summarized as follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The method depends on training data in all target languages. Intuitively, the method can be directly applied to the zero-shot cross-lingual dense retrieval if we only take the passage as input for the query generator, but the query generator performs poorly in the zero-shot setting. As future work, novel pre-training tasks for cross-lingual generation can be considered.
    \item The method does not investigate how to effectively train the query generator for the re-ranking task, just directly applies the training method for the cross-encoder re-ranker. We believe the potential of query generators for re-ranking is strong and designing a special re-ranking training method for query generators such as token-level supervision may be interesting for future work.
    \item The method requires large GPU sources. The final model approximately costs 12 hours on 8 NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs. Although researchers who do not have enough GPU sources can use the ``gradient accumulation'' technique to reduce GPU memory consumption, they also need to pay more time.
    \item This work does not consider the inconsistency between different countries~(\eg law and religion), which leads to inconsistent positive passages for synonymous queries in different languages~(\eg the legal age of marriage varies from country to country). Because we find that most of the queries in XOR-Retrieve contain the target country such as \emph{``Mikä on yleisin kissa laji Suomessa?''~(translation: What is the most common cat breed in Finland?)}.

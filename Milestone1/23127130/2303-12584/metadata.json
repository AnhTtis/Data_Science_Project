    "abstract": "Topological supermatter is given by ordinary topological matter constrained by supersymmetry or graded supergroups such as OSP(2N|2N). Using results on super oscillators and lattice QFT$_{d}$, we construct a super tight binding model on hypercubic super lattice with supercharge $ \\boldsymbol{Q}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}\\hat{F}_{\\mathbf{k}}.\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\mathbf{k}}.\\hat{B}_{\\mathbf{k}}$. We first show that the algebraic triplet $(Ω,G,J)$ of super oscillators can be derived from the $OSp(2N|2N)$ supergroup containing the symplectic $Sp(2N)$ and the orthogonal $SO(2N)$ as even subgroups. Then, we apply the obtained result on super oscillating matter to super bands and investigate its topological obstructions protected by TPC symmetries. We also give a classification of the Bose/Fermi coupling matrix $\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ in terms of subgroups of $OSp(2N|2N)$\\ and show that there are $2P_{N}$ (partition of $N$) classes $\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ given by unitary subgroups of $U\\left( 2\\right) \\times U\\left( N\\right) $. Other features are also given.",

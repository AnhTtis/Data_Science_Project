\caption{
Distribution of frames over number of objects observed for OPDMulti.
Inset: distribution of openable part pixels aggregated across frames.
We see that the distribution of openable part mask pixels in OPDMulti is more uniformly spread out compared to OPDReal, where the openable part is mostly in the center.
Note that OPDReal has center-cropped images whereas in OPDMulti we preserve the original image resolution and aspect ratio.

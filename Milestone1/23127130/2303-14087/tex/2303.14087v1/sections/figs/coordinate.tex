\caption{We show the difference between the coordinate frames we use in our work.   In the case of a single object (left), the global scene coordinate (\textbf{S}) is the same as the single object coordinate (\textbf{O}).  When there are multiple objects in the scene, we need to predict multiple object poses as each object has its own coordinate frame ($\mathbf{O_A}$ and $\mathbf{O_B}$ for objects $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$).
All motion parameters are evaluated in camera coordinates (\textbf{C}).
We use the colors RGB to represent the local coordinate system XYZ axes in that order.

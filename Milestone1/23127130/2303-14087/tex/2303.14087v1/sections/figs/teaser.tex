\caption{We tackle the openable-part-detection (OPD) task: identifying parts that are openable and their motion parameters in a single-view image.
Our \opdformerbaseline architecture outputs segmentations for openable parts on potentially multiple objects, along with each part's motion parameters: motion type (translation or rotation, indicated by blue or purple mask), motion axis and origin (see green arrows and points).  For each openable part, we predict the motion parameters (axis and origin) in object coordinates ($\phi_i^o$) along with an object pose prediction to convert to camera coordinates ($\phi_i^c$).

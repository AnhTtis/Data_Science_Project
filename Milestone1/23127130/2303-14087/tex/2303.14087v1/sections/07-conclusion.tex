\section{Conclusion}

We generalized the openable part detection task to scenes with multiple objects.
To study this more realistic task setting, we constructed a dataset of images from real-world scenes and developed \opdformerbaseline, a part-informed transformer architecture that leverages insights about strong correlation between parts, and between object pose and parts.
We systematically evaluate on datasets from prior work and our new dataset to show that \opdformerbaseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multiple-object scenarios.
Our results show that scenarios with multiple openable objects in real scenes remain challenging, leaving opportunities for future work.
We hope our work catalyzes further investigation of openable part detection, enabling progress in 3D scene understanding, robotic vision, and embodied AI.

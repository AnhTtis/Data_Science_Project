\section{Future work}

The most pressing open problem for future work is to explore theoretical connections between our bounds and in- and out-of-sample classification accuracy for logistic regression and GLMs. Another future direction could investigate the existence of similar bounds for non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for logistic regression and GLMs.

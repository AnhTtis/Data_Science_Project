    "abstract": "The optimal lifespan estimates of a solution to weakly coupled systems of wave equations have been investigated by many works, except for the lower bound in even space dimensions. Our aim is to prove the open part under the assumption of radial symmetry on the solution. The odd dimensional case was already obtained in our previous paper by long time existence of the solution in weighted $L^\\infty$ space. In this paper, we employ similar methods. The main difficulty is found in estimating the integral kernel which is completely different from odd dimensional case.",

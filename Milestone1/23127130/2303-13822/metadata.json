    "abstract": "Two new Herbig-Haro flows were found in a study of the isolated Dobashi 5006 dark cloud (l$= 216^\\circ.7$, b= $-$13$^\\circ.9$): one certain (HH 1179) and one presumable, associated with the infrared sources 2MASS 06082284$-$0936139 and 2MASS 06081525$-$0933490, correspondingly. Judging from their spectral energy distributions, these sources may be Class 1 objects with luminosities of order 23 $L_{\\odot}$ and 3.6 $L_{\\odot}$ , respectively. They are part of the poor star cluster MWSC 0739, study of which based on data from the Gaia DR3 survey has made it possible to detect 17 stars which are probably members of it. A list of them and their main parameters is given. The distance of the cluster is estimated to be 820 pc and the color excess on the path to the cluster is E(BP-RP) $\\approx$1.05 mag. All of these stars are PMS-objects and most of them are optically variable. It is concluded that the newly discovered compact star-formation zone in the Dobashi 5006 cloud has an age of no more than a few million years and this process continues up to the present time.",

    "abstract": "In agreement with recent NMR experiments on beryl crystals containing confined water molecules, we developed an improved model for studying the interactions among the water molecules' dipole moments. The model is based on a local crystal potential with a dihexagonal symmetry for the rotations of the water dipole moments, leading to their deflection from the $ab$ hexagonal crystallographic plane. This shape of the potential implies nontrivial consequences concerning the dipole ordering, which are linked to the non-zero projection of the dipole moment along the hexagonal $c$ axis. We used a variational mean-field approximation, Monte Carlo simulations, and quantum tunneling to reveal a tendency toward three types of equilibrium-ordered states. These states involve a purely planar dipole order with an antiparallel arrangement in the adjacent planes, a configuration with deflected dipole moments ordered in antiparallel directions, and a helical structure of the dipoles twisting along the $c$ axis.",

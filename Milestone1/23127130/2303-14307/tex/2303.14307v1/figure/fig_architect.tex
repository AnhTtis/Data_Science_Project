    \caption{AV-ASR architecture overview.
    In the first stage, a pre-trained ASR model is leveraged to produce automatically-generated transcriptions for unlabelled audio-visual datasets. And then these unlabelled datasets are combined with the labelled training sets, including LRS2 and LRS3, for training. The frame rate of audio and visual features from the ASR and VSR encoders is 25 frames per second (fps).}

Gel permeation chromatography was used to track the change in molar mass and kinetics as a function of the dissolution time. The molar mass of cellulose in BmimCl decreased significantly as the dissolution time increased, following a zeroth order rate law. The decrease of inter-chain friction induced by depolymerization resulted in a lower viscosity, shorter relaxation time, and lower activation energy. The activation energies for flow were distinctly different above and below the critical molar mass, which indicates that the relaxation mechanisms were not identical above and below the critical molar mass. The transition behavior of liquid crystalline phase also changed at the critical molar mass, which strongly demonstrated the effect of chain length on the formation of cholesteric phase. The exponents of Mark-Houwink-Sakurada and the radius of gyration showed that cellulose in BmimCl existed as a Gaussian chain in a theta solvent.}

We found that [C4C1Im][OAc] could dissolve as much as 25 wt\% of cellulose at temperatures below 100 \textdegree C. The structure of the composite phase obtained after cooling a solution of 16 wt\% of cellulose in [C4C1Im][OAc] was analyzed by low angle X-ray diffraction showing the absence of microcrystalline cellulose, but depicting an extensive long range isotropic ordering. With the aim of improving the dissolution of cellulose in the ionic liquid, dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, was added as a co-solvent. It was observed that it enhances the solvent power of the ionic liquid by decreasing the time needed for dissolution, even at low temperatures. In order to understand what makes DMSO a good co-solvent, two approaches were followed. Firstly, we studied experimentally the mass transport properties (viscosity and ionic conductivity) of [C4C 1Im][OAc] + DMSO mixtures at different compositions and, secondly, we assessed the molecular structure and interactions around glucose, the structural unit of cellulose, by means of molecular dynamics simulations. As expected, DMSO dramatically decreases the viscosity and increases the conductivity of the mixtures, but without inducing cation-anion dissociation in the ionic liquid. These results were confirmed by molecular simulation as it was found that the presence of a 0.5 mole fraction concentration of DMSO does not significantly affect the hydrogen-bond network in the ionic liquid. Furthermore, molecular dynamics shows that in the [C4C1Im][OAc] + DMSO equimolar mixture, DMSO does not interact specifically with glucose. We conclude that DMSO improves the solvation capabilities of the ionic liquid because it facilitates mass transport by decreasing the solvent viscosity without significantly affecting the specific interactions between cations and anions or between the ionic liquid and the polymer. The behavior of DMSO as a co-solvent was compared with that of water and it was found that water molecules are more probably found near glucose than those of DMSO, thus interfering with ionic liquid-glucose interactions, which might explain the unsuitability of water as a co-solvent for cellulose in ionic liquids. \textcopyright{} the Partner Organisations 2014.}

We examine the dependence of the transient diameter profile and the time to breakup on the molecular weight, and compare the observations with simple theories for breakup of slender viscoelastic filaments. The evolution of the transient diameter profile predicted by a multimode FENE-P model quantitatively matches the data provided the initial stresses in the filament are taken into account. Finally, we show how the transient uniaxial extensional viscosity of a dilute polymer solution can be estimated from the evolution in the diameter of the necking filament. The resulting "apparent extensional viscosity" profiles are compared with similar results obtained from a filament stretching rheometer. Both transient profiles approach the same value for the steady state extensional viscosity, which increases with molecular weight in agreement with the Rouse-Zimm theory. The apparent discrepancy in the growth rate of the two transient curves can be quantitatively explained by examining the effective stretch rate in each configuration. Filament thinning studies and filament stretching experiments thus form complementary experiments that lead to consistent measures of the transient extensional viscosity of a given test fluid.

Wet spinning of lignin-cellulose ionic liquid solutions is a promising method for producing lignin-based CFs precursors. However, wet-spinning solutions containing lignin pose technical challenges that have to be solved to enable industrialization. One of these issues is that a part of the lignin leaches into the coagulation liquid, which reduces yield and might complicate solvent recovery. In this work, the mass transport during coagulation is studied in depth using a model system and trends are confirmed with spinning trials. It was discovered that during coagulation, efflux of ionic liquid is not hindered by lignin concentration in solution and the formed cellulose network will enclose soluble lignin. Consequently, a high total concentration of lignin and cellulose in solution is advantageous to maximize yield. This work provides a fundamental understanding on mass transport during coagulation of lignin-cellulose solutions, crucial information when designing new solution-based fiber forming processes.},

Recent theoretical work has incorporated a number of important additions to the basic Doi-Edwards theory, including an explicit description of chain stretch and additional relaxation mechanisms such as contour length fluctuations (CLF) and convective constraint release (CCR). However, very little quantitative data has been published on the theological behavior of entangled systems in strong flows. Hence, a comprehensive examination of the theoretical developments has not been possible. The experiments described in this paper use the filament stretching rheometer to obtain transient extensional stress growth data and steady state uniaxial extensional viscosity data for a number of entangled, narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene solutions in the strain-rate regime characterized by a significant degree of both chain alignment and stretch. These results are then compared with theoretical predictions for a number of the current generation of reptation-based models, including mechanisms for chain stretching, contour length fluctuations, and convective constraint release. These comparisons demonstrate that when the model parameters are properly obtained from linear viscoelastic measurements, the recent model due to Mead, Larson, and Doi (Macromolecules 1998, 31, 7895) provides quantitative predictions for this class of flows for solutions spanning the complete range from very lightly to highly entangled solutions.},

  abstract = {The "pom-pom" model of McLeish and Larson (J. Rheol. 42, 81, 1998) provides a simple molecular theory for the nonlinear rheology of long chain branched polymer melts. The Edwards-de Gennes tube concept is used to derive a constitutive equation for a simple branched molecule composed of two star polymers linked by a single backbone chain. A feature of this model is that the backbone section of tube can stretch up to maximum length given by the maximum entropic drag-force from the arms, after which the star arms are withdrawn into the backbone tube. This produces a sharp transition in the extensional viscosity at this maximum stretch. This unphysical feature results from an over-simplification of the behaviour near the branch points. In this paper we introduce a simple treatment of the coupling between relaxed and unrelaxed polymer segments at branch-points. This allows for localised displacements of branch-point within a quadratic potential before maximum extension is reached. Displacing the branch-point reduces the length of arm outside the tube and so reduces in the drag on the star arms. This smoothes out the sharp transitions in extensional viscosity in the original "pom-pom" model at the cost of introducing an extra unknown parameter. This modification improves the prediction of the nonlinear rheology of H-polymers whose molecular structure is known. Alternatively, for polymers of unknown structure such as commercial Low Density Polyethylene, the model parameters may be fitted from linear viscoelastic and uniaxial extension data, to provide predictions for the behaviour in transient nonlinear shear and planar extension. By including local branch-point displacement we find improved agreement with the data for Low-Density Polyethylene.},

To date, there are no molecular-based constitutive models that are practically suitable for describing industrially relevant polymers in industrially relevant flows. In this article, we extend but strongly simplify the model of Read et al. [J.

The dynamic measurement ranges of the four parameters are shown to be {$\alpha$} = 0\textasciitilde 180\textdegree, {$\beta$} = 0\textasciitilde 180\textdegree, \texttheta d = 0\textasciitilde 180\textdegree, and D = 0\textasciitilde 1, respectively. Thus, full-range measurements are possible for all parameters other than {$\beta$}. In this study, the proposed methodology does not require the principal birefringence axes and diattenuation axes to be aligned. In addition, the linear birefringence and linear diattenuation properties are decoupled within the analytical model, and thus the birefringence properties of the sample can be solved directly without any prior knowledge of the diattenuation parameters. Also, the characteristic parameters in the baked polarizer with linear birefringence are successfully extracted from an optically equivalent model and proved by the respective simulation and experiment introduced in this study.},

  abstract = {We investigate the concentration dependence of the characteristic relaxation time of dilute polymer solutions in transient uniaxial elongational flow. A series of monodisperse polystyrene solutions of five different molecular weights (1.8? 106 ?M?8.3? 106 gmol) with concentrations spanning five orders of magnitude were dissolved in two solvents of differing solvent quality (diethylphthalate and oligomeric styrene). Optical measurements with a capillary breakup extensional rheometer of the rate of filament thinning and the time to breakup in each fluid are used to determine the characteristic relaxation time. A criterion for a lower sensitivity limit is introduced, in the form of a minimum concentration cmin necessary for experimental resolution of the effects of polymeric viscoelasticity. This criterion is validated by experiment and comparison to numerical calculations with a multimode bead-spring dumbbell model. These calculations also rationalize previous paradoxical observations of extensional thinning in fluid threads of ultradilute polymer solutions in which stress relaxation apparently occurred faster than predicted by the Zimm theory. Above this minimum sensitivity limit we show that the effective relaxation time of moderately dilute solutions (0.01?c c* ?1) in transient extensional flow rises substantially above the fitted value of the relaxation time extracted from small amplitude oscillatory shear flow and above the Zimm relaxation time computed from kinetic theory and intrinsic viscosity measurements. This effective relaxation time exhibits a power-law scaling with the reduced concentration (c c*) and the magnitude of the exponent varies with the thermodynamic quality of the solvent. The scaling of this "self-concentration" effect appears to be roughly consistent to that predicted when the dynamics of the partially elongated and overlapping polymer chains are described within the framework of blob theories for semi-dilute solutions. ? 2006 The Society of Rheology.},

Correlation length, tube diameter, and chain size of neutral polymers in good solvent, neutral polymers in \texttheta -solvent, and polyelectrolyte solutions with no added salt are compared as these are the three universality classes for flexible polymers in solution. The 1956 Zimm model is used to describe the linear viscoelasticity of dilute solutions and of semidilute solutions inside their correlation volumes. The 1953 Rouse model is used for linear viscoelasticity of semidilute unentangled solutions and for entangled solutions on the scale of the entanglement strand. The 1971 de Gennes reptation model is used to describe linear viscoelastic response of entangled solutions. In each type of solution, the terminal dynamics, reflected in the terminal modulus, chain relaxation time, specific viscosity, and diffusion coefficient are reviewed with experiment and theory compared.

In this study, key wet spinning parameters have been investigated for the development of regenerated cellulose fibres from ionic liquid solutions. The coagulation and associated diffusion equilibrium were calculated for two imidazolium-based ILs, and it was found that the anion largely influenced the coagulation kinetics. This was likely due to the association between the anion of the IL and cellulose. The orientation of the polymer chains is known to influence the mechanical properties greatly; previously, hot stretching was used to orientate cellulose acetate. Here we investigated this influence on the mechanical properties of regenerated cellulose fibres by applying a post stretch at different stretch ratios.},

  month = feb,
  abstract = {Nanofilled polymer composites and lubricants have gained significant attention in fuelefficient vehicle designs due to the superior material properties and economic potentials with minimal filler loadings. However, mass-market applications are impeded by a lack of understanding of the complex rheological behavior arising from addition of nanofillers, especially in strong shear and extensional flows. In this thesis, these challenges are addressed through design of a rapid characterization protocol for the extensional rheology of such material systems, as well as a comprehensive rheological study of a prototypical graphene-derived nanocomposite with the development of a robust constitutive model framework to provide more insights into the microstructural variations that are induced through large deformations and strong flows during material processing and manufacturing operations.    In the first part of this thesis, an improved version of capillary breakup extensional rheometry (CaBER) is presented, with a special focus on quantifying the filament thinning dynamics which are governed by multiple contributions to the total tensile stress in the fluid. An Inelastic Rate-Thickening (IRT) constitutive model is proposed to characterize the weakly rate-dependent response of commercial synthetic motor oils. The evolution of the full-dimensional filament profiles is quantified through analytical and numerical calculations from which an explicit empirical expression is developed based on the magnitude of each stress contribution. Finally, a statistical strategy is proposed to select the best-fit model with regularized parameters on the basis of the Bayesian information criterion, paving the path for an automated industrial process to extract accurate and meaningful constitutive parameters from CaBER measurements.    The second part of this thesis focuses on the filament thinning dynamics of entangled polymer systems based on two modern tube models derived from reptation theory. One-dimensional numerical solutions of the governing equations are demonstrated to accurately capture a number of key observations reported in previous studies of concentrated polymer solutions, including rate-thinning behavior near filament breakup, and markedly different relaxation time constants in shear and extensional flows. An analytical expression for the ratio of these two relaxation times is obtained as a function of the polymer concentration and the number of entanglements, which shows excellent agreement with the experimental results from a number of polymer systems with no additional fitting parameters. As a case study, the material response predicted from the Rolie-Poly (Rouse-Linear-Polymer) model is used to interpret the rheology and dynamics of concentrated cellulose/ionic liquid systems, which are beginning to find application in fabric recycling and regeneration operations through a wet-spinning process. To obtain an accurate set of constitutive parameters, the material response in nonlinear shear and extensional flows are fitted to the model in order to obtain a universal set of constitutive parameters and scalings that can describe the rheology of these complex nanocomposite solutions as the concentration, temperature and degree of polymerization are varied.    The final part of this thesis presents a comprehensive study of the rheology of a graphene oxide (GO)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) system. Distinct features of the low-frequency dynamic moduli indicate the formation of a fractal nanofiller microstructure as the GO concentration is increased. A nonlinear fractional K-BKZ constitutive framework is used to develop a comprehensive rheological equation of state for this nanocomposite system in both the linear and non-linear regimes. In extensional flow the observed rheological behavior is similar to the prediction from the tube models due to the structural similarity of the materials, and the nanofiller orientation can be readily described in terms of the model parameters. The sensitivity of the nanofiller structural variations to the flow kinematics inspires the design of a new rheometric method to optimize nanofiller dispersion by using a periodic exponential shear flow. General principles for the design of the required flow profiles are provided and are justified via proof-of-concept experiments.},

Here we demonstrate that this is unfounded, and that many ionic liquids can be distilled at low pressure without decomposition. Ionic liquids represent matter solely composed of ions, and so are perceived as non-volatile substances. During the last decade, interest in the field of ionic liquids has burgeoned3, producing a wealth of intellectual and technological challenges and opportunities for the production of new chemical and extractive processes4-6, fuel cells and batteries7, and new composite materials8,9. Much of this potential is underpinned by their presumed involatility. This characteristic, however, can severely restrict the attainability of high purity levels for ionic liquids (when they contain poorly volatile components) in recycling schemes, as well as excluding their use in gas-phase processes. We anticipate that our demonstration that some selected families of commonly used aprotic ionic liquids can be distilled at 200-300\textdegree C and low pressure, with concomitant recovery of significant amounts of pure substance, will permit these currently excluded applications to be realized. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

  abstract = {Viscoelastic behavior reflects the combined viscous and elastic responses, under mechanical stress, of materials which are intermediate between liquids and solids in character. Polymersthe basic materials of the rubber and plastic industries and important to the textile, petroleum, automobile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries as wellexhibit viscoelasticity to a pronounced degree. Their viscoelastic properties determine the mechanical performance of the final products of these industries, and also the success of processing methods at intermediate stages of production. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers examines, in detail, the effects of the many variables on which the basic viscoelastic properties depend. These include temperature, pressure, and time; polymer chemical composition, molecular weight and weight distribution, branching and crystallinity; dilution with solvents or plasticizers; and mixture with other materials to form composite systems. With guidance by molecular theory, the dependence of viscoelastic properties on these variables can be simplified by introducing certain ancillary concepts such as the fractional free volume, the monomeric friction coefficient, and the spacing between entanglement loci, to provide a qualitative understanding and in many cases a quantitative prediction of how to achieve desired results. The phenomenological theory of viscoelasticitywhich permits interrelation of the results of different types of experimentsis presented first, with many useful approximation procedures for calculations given. A wide variety of experimental methods is then described, with critical evaluation of their applicability to polymeric materials of different consistencies and in different regions of the time scale (or, for oscillating deformations, the frequency scale). A review of the present state of molecular theory follows, so that viscoelasticity can be related to the motions of flexible polymer molecules and their entanglements and network junctions. The dependence of viscoestic properties on temperature and pressure, and its descriptions using reduced variables, are discussed in detail. Several chapters are then devoted to the dependence of viscoelastic properties on chemical composition, molecular weight, presence of diluents, and other features, for several characteristic classes of polymer materials. Finally, a few examples are given to illustrate the many potential applications of these principles to practical problems in the processing and use of rubbers, plastics, and fibers, and in the control of vibration and noise. The third edition has been brought up to date to reflect the important developments, in a decade of exceptionally active research, which have led to a wider use of polymers, and a wider recognition of the importance and range of application of viscoelastic properties. Additional data have been incorporated, and the books chapters on dilute solutions, theory of undiluted polymers, plateau and terminal zones, cross-linked polymers, and concentrated solutions have been extensively rewritten to take into account new theories and new experimental results. Technical managers and research workers in the wide range of industries in which polymers play an important role will find that the book provides basic information for practical applications, and graduate students in chemistry and engineering will find, in its illustrations with real data and real numbers, an accessible introduction to the principles of viscoelasticity. \textcopyright{} John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. 1980.},

In recent years, the availability of model polymers with nearly monodisperse molecular weight distributions and precisely controlled chemical structures has allowed for improved data both on rheology and on the dimensions of the chains. This has now allowed us to determine the correlations between such properties as chain dimensions, density, and plateau modulus and to show that some quite simple relations exist between them. The main body of these data is on polymers that can be considered to be models for polyolefins. These have been made by the hydrogenation of polydienes synthesized by anionic polymerization techniques. In this way the molecular weight distribution can be made to be nearly monodisperse (Mw/Mn {$<$} 1.1) and the chemical structure is well controlled. For example, models of a wide range of ethylene-butene copolymers have been made by the saturation of polybutadienes with a range of vinyl content. Such polymers can be made at many molecular weights as well. The viscoelastic properties of these polymers have been measured very precisely, and their chain dimensions have been determined by small-angle neutron scattering. To a high degree of correlation, we find that the mean-square unperturbed end-to-end distance, (R2)0, the density, {$\rho$}, and molecular weight, M, are related to the plateau modulus, G0N, G0N {$\propto$} \{(R2)0{$\rho$}/M\}3 a finding in accord with that of Ronca. This simple relationship gives us a deep understanding of what controls the rheology of these polyolefins and of how we might be able to predict the properties of as yet unsynthesized polymers. \textcopyright{} 1994, American Chemical Society.

Imidazolium-based ILs were chosen since these are the most studied ionic fluids in biomass dissolution approaches, while a large array of anions was investigated because it was already demonstrated that it is the IL anion that mainly governs the dissolution. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

Such fields\textendash hydrodynamic, electric, and magnetic\textendash are commonly encountered in both academic and industrial research, and can produce profound changes in the microscale properties of liquids comprised of polymers, colloids, liquid crystals, or surfactants. Starting with the basic Maxwell field equations, this book discusses the polarization properties of light, including Jones and Mueller calculus, and then covers the transmission, reflection, and scattering of light in anisotropic materials. Spectroscopic interactions with oriented systems such as absorptive dichroism, small wide angle light scattering, and Raman scattering are discussed. Applications of these methods to a wide range of problems in complex fluid dynamics and structure are presented, along with selected case studies chosen to elucidate the range of techniques and materials that can be studied. As the only book of its kind to present a self-contained description of optical methods used for the full range of complex fluids, this work will be special interest to a wide range of readers, including chemical engineers, physical chemists, physicists, polymer and colloid scientists, along with graduate and post-graduate researchers.},

To this end, a newly developed phenomenological model is utilized that accounts for the role of decrystallization and disentanglement as two rate-determinant steps in the cellulose dissolution process. Although fibers with lower crystallinity swell more and faster, the degree of crystallinity does not affect the dissolution rate. Fibers of smaller diameter swell more and become amorphous faster. When decrystallization is important, the solubility of thinner fibers increases more with a reduction in the crystallinity compared to the diameter. However, when the dissolution is controlled by chain disentanglement, or in the case of dissolution of fibers having larger diameters, milling the fibers to reduce the particle size could increase the solubility.},

The configurations of these depend on the deformation history, and their relative motion is determined by the coordinated part-stress in connection with a tensorial mobility which is a function of all configuration tensors. The simples special case of thise theory is given by a model with only one configuration tensor which both the stress and mobility tensors depend on. In this paper a further specialization is introduced by assuming a linear dependency of stress as well as of mobility tensors on the configuration tensor. Some relationship to a modified retation model, recently presented by Curtiss and Bird, is hereby established. This model which is of the rate-type and is non-linear in the configuration and stress tensors, respectively, nevertheless permits analytic solutions of some of the most important types of flow. These are explicitly given for both steady and transient extensional and shear flows. Besides shear thinning and non-vanishing first and second normal-stress differences, an extensional viscosity with finite asymptotic values as well as non-exponential stress relaxation and start-up curves are predicted, with stress-overshoot at least in the case of shear flow. \textcopyright{} 1982.}

The constitutive equation used to describe the spinning fluid includes both viscous and viscoelastic effects and is based on an equivalent parallel combination of a non-linear Giesekus equation and a simple Newtonian component. Temperature and composition effects are accounted for in the viscosity, glass transition, and zero-shear modulus, and through these, in the associated relaxation time of the constitutive model. Inclusion of the viscous component enables predictions of the distinction between locking-in of the fiber velocity profile due to the rapidly rising viscosity and consequently dropping deformation rate, and fiber solidification due to the occurrence of a glass transition. Predictions of the axial and radial profiles of temperature, composition, stress, and orientation reflect the occurrence of skin-core morphology. Moreover, the single free parameter in the model, representing the ratio of the Newtonian component viscosity to that of the total viscosity, affects the fiber force profiles, and most especially the fiber axial velocity profile, and can therefore be used as a fitting parameter for spinline data. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The focus of this work is on the effects of air gap conditioning (AGC) during the dry-jet wet spinning operation. The installation of an AGC system on the spinning line led to significant improvements of the fiber properties. The fiber titer variation decreased significantly, and the fiber toughness increased by approximately 50\% when controlling the temperature and the relative humidity in the airgap using a convective air flow. The presence of water vapor in the air stream was a determinant factor for the improvement of the fiber elongation. The interaction of water vapor with the spinning dope was investigated using dynamic vapor sorption. The diffusion coefficient of water vapor inside the dope could be identified from those experiments and used in a numerical simulation model of the heat and water vapor transfer in the air gap between the spinning dope and the surrounding air. The experimental and simulation results suggest that dope convective cooling and surface hydration lead to a higher fiber toughness.},

In order to achieve good properties of these materials, the nanostructure must be controlled. Here we present a process combining hydrodynamic alignment with a dispersion-gel transition that produces homogeneous and smooth filaments from a low-concentration dispersion of cellulose nanofibrils in water. The preferential fibril orientation along the filament direction can be controlled by the process parameters. The specific ultimate strength is considerably higher than previously reported filaments made of cellulose nanofibrils. The strength is even in line with the strongest cellulose pulp fibres extracted from wood with the same degree of fibril alignment. Successful nanoscale alignment before gelation demands a proper separation of the timescales involved. Somewhat surprisingly, the device must not be too small if this is to be achieved. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

FTIR spectroscopic analysis of liquid products showed that the IL pre-treatment increased the production of furans from the pyrolysis of RCRM, because the presence of amorphous Cellulose II in RCRM enhanced the dehydration reaction during pyrolysis. Moreover, the recovered lignin from IL pre-treatment enhanced the production of phenol-rich pyrolysis oil due to the cleavage of {$\beta$}-O-4 ether bonds of lignin during pre-treatment. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicated highly porous structure of both RCRM and recovered lignin derived biochars. The kinetic analysis using a hybrid approach (a combination of model-fitting and model-free methods) indicated a reduction in the activation energy for both RCRM and recovered lignin pyrolysis. It is concluded that IL pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass followed by low-temperature pyrolysis can be an efficient route for biorefinery production.},

We have developed a variant of the pom-pom model that qualitatively describes two surprising features recently observed in filament stretching rheometer experiments of uniaxial extensional flow of industrial branched polymer resins: (i) Overshoots of the transient stress during steady flow and (ii) strongly accelerated stress relaxation upon cessation of the flow beyond the overshoot. Within the context of our model, these overshoots originate from entanglement stripping (ES) during the processes of normal chain retraction and branch point withdrawal. We demonstrate that, for a single mode, the predictions of our overshoot model are qualitatively consistent with experimental data. To provide a quantitative fit, we represent an industrial melt by a superposition of several individual modes. We show that a minimal version of our model, in which ES due to normal chain retraction is omitted, can provide a reasonable, but not perfect, fit to the data. With regard the stress relaxation after (kinematically) steady flow, we demonstrate that the differential version of tube orientation dynamics in the original pom-pom model performs anomalously. We discuss the reasons for this and suggest a suitable alternative.},

The conclusion from the first three findings was that the diffusion advances through a liquid phase which possesses a continuous pore network and most of the volume. The precipitated cellulose is concentrated into fibrils whose inhibitive effect on the diffusion of small molecules through the surrounding phase is marginal.

  abstract = {Abstract: Cellulose can be regenerated from cellulose-ionic liquid (IL) solutions by immersion in water or alcohols. These compounds are potent non-solvents due to their proton-donating ability in hydrogen bonds to IL anions. Although they share this fundamental way of reducing IL solvent quality, coagulation in water is distinctly different from coagulation in alcohols with regard to the microstructures formed and the mechanisms that generate the microstructures. In this study, the possibility of mass-transport effects on microstructures was investigated. The mass-transport of all components: non-solvent (EtOH, 2PrOH), IL ([C2mim][OAc]), and a co-solvent (DMSO), during coagulation was studied. The data was compared to previous data with water as the non-solvent. Results showed that diffusion is essentially limited to a continuous non-solvent-rich phase that is formed during phase separation in all non-solvents. There were also significant differences between non-solvents. For instance, [C2mim][OAc] diffusion coefficients were 6\textendash 9 times smaller in 2PrOH than in water, and there were apparent effects from cellulose concentration in 2PrOH that were not observed in water. The differences stem from the interactions between solvent, non-solvents, and cellulose, which can be both mutual and competitive. Weaker [C2mim][OAc]-non-solvent interactions with alcohols give more persistent [C2mim][OAc]-cellulose interactions than with water as the non-solvent, which has consequences for mass-transport.

Cellulosic pulps from both annual plants and different wood species were analyzed. The obtained fractions were subject to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with multiple detection to monitor the development of molecular mass distribution (MMD), molecular mass, and recovered mass. The dissolution behavior of accompanying xylans was followed by quantitative analysis of the uronic acids by fluorescence labeling GPC. The morphological changes at the remaining fibers in the stepwise dissolution were addressed by SEM. The time needed to dissolve completely the cellulosic pulp differed from species to species, mainly between pulps from annual plants and pulps from wood. Annual plants generally needed much longer to dissolve completely. In the beginning of the dissolution, the dissolved fractions of annual plants showed a distinct discrimination effect because they were enriched in hemicellulose. By contrast, wood pulps dissolve fast and without distinct changes in the MMD of the dissolved fractions over time. Bagasse pulp is an exception to the observation for annual plants and rather resembled the behavior of wood celluloses. Prolonged dissolution times, as often practiced in cellulose GPC, do not lead to any improvements regarding the determination of molecular mass, MMD, and recovered mass of injected sample, so that the dissolution times required for reliable GPC analysis can be significantly shortened, which will be important for biorefinery analytics with high numbers of samples. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Abstract We consider shear flows that comprise of step changes in the shear rate. For these flows, we derive analytic solutions of the Rolie-Poly con-stitutive equation. Our method involves piecing together solutions for constant rate shear in a variety of flow rate regimes. We obtain solutions for interrupted shear, recoverable strain and nonlinear relaxation following cessation of flow. Whenever strong flow is present we neglect reptation, as other mechanisms dominate and for interrupted shear our solution is approximate as we neglect convective constraint release (CCR). Our analytic solutions provide new insight in several ways. These include revealing the mechanism of some experimental features of these flows; suggesting a method to extract the polymer contribution to the normal stress in the velocity gradient direction (r yy) from shear stress measurements alone; and a method to isolate the influence of CCR from damping function measurements. We also run complementary Graham, Likhtman and Milner, McLeish (GLaMM) model calculations to verify that insight from our analytic approach translates to this more detailed model. V},

The result is an atom-efficient process that up-converts fibrous substrates to value-added products and materials. A key aspect of bringing this and other IL-enabled technologies to market relies on efficient monitoring and recycling of IL-based solvents. Implementing online IL quality monitoring enhances the unit economics of these processes. Here, we characterize and report conductivity measurements, refractometry, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy techniques for online IL monitoring during an industrial fiber welding process. The online analysis enables more efficient recycling of the IL solvent, increasing the process efficiency and product quality.}

We demonstrate necking to be an intrinsic flow instability that arises as an inevitable consequence of the constitutive behaviour of essentially any material (with a possible rare exception, which we outline). We derive criteria for the onset of necking that are reportable simply in terms of characteristic signatures in the shapes of the experimentally measured rheological response functions, and should therefore apply universally to all materials. As evidence of their generality, we numerically show them to hold in six popular constitutive models of polymers and soft glasses. Two distinct modes of necking instability are predicted. The first is relatively gentle, and sets in when the tensile stress signal first curves down as a function of the time \$t\$ (or accumulated strain \$\textbackslash epsilon=\textbackslash dot\textbackslash varepsilon t\$) since the inception of the flow. The second is more violent, and sets in when a carefully defined `elastic derivative' of the tensile force first slopes down as a function of \$t\$ (or \$\textbackslash dot\textbackslash varepsilon\$). In the limit of fast flow \$\textbackslash dot\textbackslash varepsilon\textbackslash tau\textbackslash to\i nfty\$, where {$\tau$} is the material's characteristic stress relaxation time, this second mode reduces to the Consid\'ere criterion for necking in solids. However we show that the Consid\'ere criterion fails to correctly predict the onset of necking in any viscoelastic regime of finite imposed \$\textbackslash dot\textbackslash varepsilon\textbackslash tau\$. Finally, we elucidate the way these modes of instability manifest themselves in entangled linear polymers, wormlike micelles and branched polymers. We demonstrate four distinct regimes as a function of imposed strain rate, consistent with experimental master curves.},

Theoretically, the related viscoelastic response usually is discussed in terms of the tube model. We relate stress relaxation in the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic regimes to a primitive path analysis (PPA) and show that tension forces both along the original paths and along primitive paths, that is, the backbone of the tube, in the stretching direction correspond to each other.

It is also hypothesized that cohesive failure or fracture will occur if a critical stress level is reached. It is predicted that viscosity and viscoelasticity tend to stabilize the filaments. However, even extremely high viscosity filaments will neck and exhibit ductile failure. In highly viscoelastic fluids, defects tend to heal during stretch. Highly viscoelastic fluid filaments fail by fracture. The theory is used to predict the failure of molten polymer filaments as a function of molecular weight. The extensibility or spinnability of filaments is predicted to exhibit a maximum at intermediate molecular weights with capillarity-ductile failure occurring at low molecular weights and cohesive fracture, at high molecular weights. The results are compared to experiments on polyethylenes. There is general qualitative agreement especially with the behavior of low and high molecular weights where capillarity and fracture occur. The tendency to necking and ductile failure differs considerably among melts and is more pronounced in high-density than in low-density polyethylenes. The application to continuous spinline behavior is discussed, and draw resonance is suggested to be the continuous process analogue of ductile failure.

  abstract = {? 2014 The Society of Rheology.The relaxation processes of a wide variety of soft materials frequently contain one or more broad regions of power-law like or stretched exponential relaxation in time and frequency. Fractional constitutive equations have been shown to be excellent models for capturing the linear viscoelastic behavior of such materials, and their relaxation modulus can be quantitatively described very generally in terms of a Mittag-Leffler function. However, these fractional constitutive models cannot describe the nonlinear behavior of such power-law materials. We use the example of Xanthan gum to show how predictions of nonlinear viscometric properties, such as shear-thinning in the viscosity and in the first normal stress coefficient, can be quantitatively described in terms a nonlinear fractional constitutive model. We adopt an integral K-BKZ framework and suitably modify it for power-law materials exhibiting Mittag-Leffler type relaxation dynamics at small strains. Only one additional parameter is needed to predict nonlinear rheology, which is introduced through an experimentally measured damping function. Empirical rules such as the Cox-Merz rule and Gleissle mirror relations are frequently used to estimate the nonlinear response of complex fluids from linear rheological data. We use the fractional model framework to assess the performance of such heuristic rules and quantify the systematic offsets, or shift factors, that can be observed between experimental data and the predicted nonlinear response. We also demonstrate how an appropriate choice of fractional constitutive model and damping function results in a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model that predicts a flow curve identical to the elastic Herschel-Bulkley model. This new constitutive equation satisfies the Rutgers-Delaware rule, which is appropriate for yielding materials. This K-BKZ framework can be used to generate canonical three-element mechanical models that provide nonlinear viscoelastic generalizations of other empirical inelastic models such as the Cross model. In addition to describing nonlinear viscometric responses, we are also able to provide accurate expressions for the linear viscoelastic behavior of complex materials that exhibit strongly shear-thinning Cross-type or Carreau-type flow curves. The findings in this work provide a coherent and quantitative way of translating between the linear and nonlinear rheology of multiscale materials, using a constitutive modeling approach that involves only a few material parameters.},

  abstract = {Consumer products, such as foods, contain numerous polymeric and particulate additives that play critical roles in maintaining their stability, quality and function. The resulting materials exhibit complex bulk and interfacial rheological responses, and often display a distinctive power-law response under standard rheometric deformations. These power laws are not conveniently described using conventional rheological models, without the introduction of a large number of relaxation modes. We present a constitutive framework using fractional derivatives to model the power-law responses often observed experimentally. We first revisit the concept of quasiproperties and their connection to the fractional Maxwell model (FMM). Using Scott-Blair's original data, we demonstrate the ability of the FMM to capture the power-law response of 'highly anomalous' materials. We extend the FMM to describe the viscoelastic interfaces formed by bovine serum albumin and solutions of a common food stabilizer, Acacia gum. Fractional calculus allows us to model and compactly describe the measured frequency response of these interfaces in terms of their quasiproperties. Finally, we demonstrate the predictive ability of the FMM to quantitatively capture the behaviour of complex viscoelastic interfaces by combining the measured quasi-properties with the equation of motion for a complex fluid interface to describe the damped inertio-elastic oscillations that are observed experimentally. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {A reptation-based model, that incorporates transient polymer-nanoparticle surface interactions, is proposed to describe the dynamics and rheological behaviors of linear entangled polymers filled with isotropic rigid nanoscale particles. Dispersed nanoparticles are sufficiently small such that even at low volume fractions, the average particle wall-to-wall distance is on the order of the chain size. The model predicts a scaling law in the form, {$\tau$}d,eff{$\sim\tau$}d({$\varphi$}adN+1)2, where {$\tau$}d,eff is the effective reptation time of a chain in the presence of attractive nanoparticles, {$\tau$}d is its reptation time in the neat polymer, {$\varphi$}ad is the fraction of attached monomers per chain, and N is the number of monomers per chain. Hence, the overall relaxation is extremely retarded by attractive nanoparticles in the limit of strongly adsorbed chains. Also, it is found that the effective reptation time, {$\tau$}d,eff, can be controlled through five main parameters, i.e., the molecular weight of the polymer chain, N, the size of the nanoparticles, df, the density of attractive site on the nanoparticle surface, nas, the monomer-nanoparticle energetic interaction, e\{open\}, and the nanoparticle volume fraction, {$\varphi$}f. The nonequilibrium dynamics of detachment/re-attachment of monomers from/to nanoparticle surfaces under flow conditions is incorporated in the model to elucidate the effect of monomer-surface interactions on the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. The resulting model correctly captures the linear dynamical properties and shear rheological behaviors of nanocomposite systems studied. Under very slow shear flow conditions, these filled systems exhibit a strong non-Newtonian behavior and a large enhancement in the viscosity as a certain number of monomers in the chain are attached to nanoparticle surfaces, while at very high shear rates, the neat polymer dominates the shear thinning behavior, suggesting that addition of nanoparticles contributes negligible to the viscosity in strong flows. A picture that is based on transient polymer-particle surface interactions, i.e., the detachment/re-attachment dynamics of monomers from/to nanoparticle surfaces is proposed to interpret the observed huge alteration in rheological properties. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Accurate assessments of SCW cellulose are essential for improving cotton fibers. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy enables distinguishing SCW from other cell wall components in a rapid and non-invasive way. Thus it has been used for monitoring SCW development in model plants. Recently, several FT-IR methods have been proposed for monitoring cotton fiber development. However, they are rarely utilized for assessing SCW cellulose from cotton fiber due to limited validation with various cotton species grown in different conditions. Thus, we compared and validated three FT-IR methods including two previously proposed methods analyzing entire spectra or specific bands as well as a new method analyzing FT-IR spectral regions corresponding to cellulose with various cotton fibers grown in planta and in vitro. Comparisons of the FT-IR methods with reference methods showed that the two FT-IR methods analyzing the entire spectra or cellulose regions by principal component analysis monitored SCW qualitatively, whereas the FT-IR method analyzing specific bands (708, 730, and 800 cm-1) by a simple algorithm allowed the monitoring of SCW cellulose levels quantitatively. The quantitative FT-IR method is a potential substitute for lengthy and laborious chemical assays for monitoring SCW cellulose levels from cotton fibers, and it can be used for a better understanding of cotton fiber SCW development and as a part of the quality assessment tools used to guide choices for improving fiber quality.},

The mechanical properties of the fibres are shown to be related to the orientation parameter ({$\langle$}sin2\texttheta{$\rangle$}), and that by using the particular fibre spinning process (N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO)/cellulose), a plateau is reached, beyond which no improvements can be made. Clear shifts in the 1095 cm-1 Raman band towards a lower wavenumber are observed upon the application of external tensile deformation, which are thought to relate to the molecular deformation of the cellulose chain. It is found that relationships are determinable between the rate of band shift with respect to strain of the 1095 cm-1 Raman band and the orientation parameter. For the first time, a modified series model is related to the molecular deformation as revealed by Raman spectroscopy, and that the data for these fibres is consistent with a structure with a dominant amorphous fraction. Other high modulus cellulose fibres are shown to behave more like high performance polymer fibres such as poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) and poly(p-phenylene terephtalamide) (PPTA). The need, if high performance variants of these fibres are to be developed, to improve the microstructure of NMMO-cellulose fibres is discussed. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We have developed a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept was to assess the Gibbs free energy of fusion ({$\Delta$}fusG) for the process IL(S) \textrightarrow{} IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the IL. This was done using a suitable Born-Fajans-Haber cycle that was closed by the lattice (i.e., IL(S) \textrightarrow{} IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the solvation (i.e., IL(g) \textrightarrow{} IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants (by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies ({$\Delta$}lattG) were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics (VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation ({$\Delta$} SOlVG) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants. Under standard ambient conditions (298.15 K and 10s Pa) {$\Delta$}fusG\textdegree{} was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under standard ambient conditions because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable, due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy. A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model) gave a standard error of the estimate (sest) of 8 \textdegree C. A similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave sest as 2.5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Cellulose concentration covers the range of 0.1-3.0 wt \%, spanning both the dilute and semidilute regimes. The rheological properties of the cellulose ionic liquid solutions have been investigated by steady shear and oscillatory shear measurements in this study. In the steady shear measurements, all the cellulose solutions show a shear thinning behavior at high shear rates; however, the dilute cellulose solutions show another shear thinning region at low shear rates, which may reflect the characteristics of the [amim]Cl solvent. In the oscillatory shear measurements, for the dilute regime, the reduced dimensionless moduli are obtained by extrapolation of the viscoelastic measurements for the dilute solutions to infinite dilution. The frequency dependences of the reduced dimensionless moduli are intermediate between the predictions from the Zimm model and elongated rodlike model theories, while the fitting by using a hybrid model combining these two model theories agrees well with the experimental results. For the semidilute regime, the frequency dependences of moduli change from the Zimm-like behavior to the Rouse-like behavior with increasing cellulose concentration. In the studied concentration range, the effects of molecular weight and temperature on solution viscoelasticities and the relationship between steady shear viscosity and dynamic shear viscosity are presented. Results show that the solution viscoelasticity greatly depends on the molecular weight of cellulose; the empirical time-temperature superposition principle holds true at the experimental temperatures, while the Cox-Merz rule fails for the solutions investigated in this study. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

However, in the literature two definitions of the entanglement spacing in terms of plateau modulus have been presented, and confusion between these has produced numerous errors in the recent literature. In addition, two different definitions of the "equilibration time," a fundamental time constant, have also appeared, creating additional potential for confusion. We therefore, carefully review the alternative definitions and clarify the values of the prefactors that must be used for the different definitions, in the hope of helping future authors to avoid such errors.},

The rheological changes are captured by constitutive equations, prototypes of which are the FENE-P model for unentangled solutions and the DEMG model for entangled solutions and melts. From these equations, and supporting experimental data, for dilute solutions, the extensional viscosity increases with the strain rate from the low strain rate to the high strain rate asymptote, but in the densely entangled state, the high strain rate viscosity is lower than the low shear rate value, especially when orientation-dependent friction is accounted for. In shearing flow, shear thinning increases dramatically as the entanglement density increases, which can eventually lead to a shear-banding inhomogeneity.

The solutions were stable over time at room temperature and could be converted to regenerated fibers with good properties via conventional wet spinning process. The increase in crystallinity of the regenerated cellulose fibers obtained from the EmimAc/cosolvent solution was ascribed to the ability of cosolvent to promote interaction between cellulose chains. The crystallinity of the fibers with only EmimAc as solvent is lower than that of the fibers with cosolvent, it seems that in this case the crystallinity dose reflects the difference in tensile properties. Also, a slight increase in tensile strain, by adding cosolvent to the cellulose/IL system under same wet spinning conditions was observed. The increase in the strain may be due to the crystal chain slip and plasticization effect by the cosolvent dispersed in the fiber, resulting in the increase the mobility of cellulose chain.},

It is well-known that the original reptation theory is unable to fit linear relaxation spectra (G{${'}$} and G{${''}$}) as it misses several important physical processes: (1) contour length fluctuations, (2) constraint release, and (3) longitudinal stress relaxation along the tube. All of these processes were treated theoretically before; however, the treatment used either uncontrolled approximations or failed to include all of them at the same time. The aim of this work is to combine self-consistent theories for contour length fluctuations and constraint release with reptation theory. First, we improve the treatment of contour length fluctuations using a combined theoretical and stochastic simulation approach. This allows us to obtain an expression for the single chain relaxation function {$\mu$}(t) without any adjustable parameters and approximations. To include constraint release, we use the scheme proposed by Rubinstein and Colby, which provides an algorithm for calculating the full relaxation function G(t) from the single chain relaxation {$\mu$}(t). Then longitudinal modes are added, and a detailed comparison with different experimental data is given. One of the conclusions is that polystyrene is described by theory very well, but polybutadiene shows problems, which may be a first indication of nonuniversality of polymer dynamics.},

The theory is derived from a stochastic microscopic equation of motion of the chain inside the tube and of the tube itself. As a result we obtain a partial differential equation for the tube tangent correlation function, the solution of which requires quite intensive calculations. At the same time the application of this theory to realistic flows (which is anything other than the laboratory rheometer) requires a simple and less computationally intensive set of equations for the stress tensor similar to the Giesekus, PTT, Larson or Pom-Pom equations. In particular, the last was derived from molecular theory for a generic type of branched polymer. In this paper we demonstrate that molecular tube theory can also provide a route to constructing a family of very simple differential constitutive equations for linear polymers. They capture the full model quite well and therefore can be used in flow solving software to model spatially inhomogeneous flows. We present a comparison of the proposed equations with our full model and with experimental data. \textcopyright\{\}2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

During the dissolution process no degradation of cellulose was observed, and all the resultant cellulose/BmimAc/DMSO solutions were transparent and stable. These advantages make it as an ideal solvent system to build a new characteristic method of cellulose's molecular weight by the measurement of the intrinsic viscosity [{$\eta$}], which is significantly better than the currently used solvent systems. [{$\eta$}] of solutions of nine cellulose samples was measured by using rheometer with cylinder fixture and Ubbelohde viscometer, respectively. The [{$\eta$}] values obtained by these two methods were well consistent. The degree of polymerization (DP) of these cellulose samples was determined by Copper (II) ethylenediamine method. Then the molecular weight and its distribution of representative samples were cross-checked by gel permeation chromatography for soluble derivatives of cellulose. As a result, a relationship DP = 134 [{$\eta$}]1.2 was built, suitable for DPs in the range of 220\textendash 1400. The uncertainty of this relationship was estimated to be 5 \%.

  abstract = {Textile waste is a major waste source found in landfills around the world today, due to increases in population, fast fashion cycles, and inefficient recycling technologies. Here we demonstrate a textile recycling process whereby waste denim is dissolved into a binary solvent and a regenerated cellulose fiber is wet spun. We show that using this process the spun fiber can be regenerated whereby the original color of the waste garment is maintained or regenerated in the absence of color. The retention of color can be significant since the regenerated fibers do not need to be redyed, saving considerable water and energy that is typically required in the traditional textile dyeing processes. This process utilized dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent with ionic liquid 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium acetate ([Bmim]OAc) for the dissolution of the denim waste. The addition of the cosolvent allowed fast dissolution of the cellulosic materials while reducing the viscosity of the spinning dope. The regenerated discolored cellulose fibers produced had similar mechanical properties and morphology to that of viscose fibers, a common regenerated cellulose fiber used extensively in the textile industry. Furthermore, the utilization of binary IL solvent with high DMSO concentration (1:4) reduces the overall process cost.

Asymptotic analysis and numerical computation show that the resulting kinematics closely approximate those of an ideal homogeneous uniaxial elongation. The evolution in the tensile stress (measured mechanically) and the molecular conformation (measured optically) can be followed as functions of the rate of stretching and the total strain imposed. The resulting rheological measurements are a sensitive discriminant of molecularly based constitutive equations proposed for complex fluids. The dynamical response of the elongating filament is also coupled to the extensional rheology of the polymeric test fluid, and this can lead to complex viscoelastic-flow instabilities such as filament necking and rupture or elastic peeling from the rigid end-plates.},

The progressive thinning of a fluid filament is driven by capillarity and resisted by inertia, viscosity and additional stresses resulting from the extensional deformation of the fluid microstructure within the thread. In many processes of interest the fluid undergoing break-up is non-Newtonian and may contain dissolved polymer, suspended particles, surfactants or other microstructural constituents. In such cases the transient extensional viscosity of the fluid plays an important role in controlling the dynamics of break-up. The intimate connection between the degree of strain-hardening that develops during free extensional flow and the dynamical evolution in the profile of a thin fluid thread is also manifested in heuristic concepts such as `spinnability', `tackiness' and `stringiness'. In this review we survey recent experimental and theoretical developments in the field of capillary-driven thinning and break-up with a special focus on how quantitative measurements of the thinning and rupture processes can be used to quantify the material properties of the fluid. As a result of the absence of external forcing, the dynamics of the necking process are often self-similar and observations of this `self-thinning' can be used to extract qualitative, and even quantitative, measures of the transient extensional viscosity of a complex fluid.},

  abstract = {Despite being the world's most abundant natural polymer and one of the most studied, cellulose is still challenging researchers. Cellulose is known to be insoluble in water and in many organic solvents, but can be dissolved in a number of solvents of intermediate properties, like N-methylmorpholine N-oxide and ionic liquids which, apparently, are not related. It can also be dissolved in water at extreme pHs, in particular if a cosolute of intermediate polarity is added. The insolubility in water is often referred to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between cellulose molecules. Revisiting some fundamental polymer physicochemical aspects (i. e. intermolecular interactions) a different picture is now revealed: cellulose is significantly amphiphilic and hydrophobic interactions are important to understand its solubility pattern. In this paper we try to provide a basis for developing novel solvents for cellulose based on a critical analysis of the intermolecular interactions involved and mechanisms of dissolution. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The LC-PolScope is commonly used for birefringence imaging, analyzing the spatial and temporal variations of the differential phase delay in ordered and transparent materials. Here we describe an alternative use of the LC-PolScope for imaging the polarization dependent transmittance of dichroic materials. We explain the minor changes needed to convert the instrument between the two imaging modes, discuss the relationship between the quantities measured with each instrument, and touch on the physical connection between refractive index, birefringence, transmittance, diattenuation, and dichroism. \textcopyright{} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {In polymer melt elongational rheometry only by the rotary clamp technique large elongations can be obtained homogeneously. However, as described in this paper, there still remain disadvantages that led to the development of a new rheometer with the following main features: The dimensions of the required sample are small (60 \texttimes{} 7 \texttimes{} 2 nun3), the sample is supported by a cushion of inert gas and, after having reached the test temperature of up to well above 300\textdegree C, it can be extended by a new type of clamps that make use of metal conveyor belts. The resulting tensile force is measured with a resolution of better than 100 mgf (0.001 N). The strain rate range is 0.001-1 s-1, and the maximum Hencky strain is 7, corresponding to a maximum stretch ratio of 1100. Within the sample, the temperature variation in time and space is less than 0.1\textdegree C. For the evaluation and documentation of the test performance, a video camera records the top and side views of the sample that carries a marking powder to permit the evaluation of the true strain rate. The operation of the instrument is easy, and so is the sample preparation, but care must be taken concerning the necessary isotropy and 'internal homogeneity'. Examples of test results are given for several polymer melts at various temperatures: (1) Polystyrene up to a total Hencky strain larger than 7 at 170\textdegree C, (2) several types of polyethylene (LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE) at 150\textdegree C, (3) poly(amide) at 250\textdegree C, and (4) poly(ethersulfone) at 350\textdegree C. The wide applicability of the new rheometer is demonstrated by adding results obtained from samples of bread dough. The surface tension has no influence on the results if an error of 3\% can be tolerated. From the results it follows that by means of the newly developed rheometer many problems in polymer melt elongation have been solved. \textcopyright{} 1994 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff-Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Cellulose depolymerization was assessed by characterizing the precipitated cellulose and the rheological behavior of the cellulose-[emim]OAc solutions. The results show decreases in the weight average molecular mass and in the shear viscosity at temperatures exceeding 60 \textdegree C, which can be related to progressing degradation of cellulose in the IL upon storage at elevated temperature. The changes in behavior of the solutions under extensional stresses also attest the gradual depolymerization of cellulose. The degradation has been analyzed using appropriate kinetic models.

The solubility of cellulose in pure [EMIm][DEP] exhibits an asymptotic maximum of approximately 20 mass \% above 100 \textdegree C. Solubility studies conducted on antisolvent mixtures with [EMIm][DEP] and [BMIm][Cl] indicate that protic solvents, ethanol, methanol, and water, significantly reduce the cellulose capacity of IL mixtures by 38-100\% even at small antisolvent loadings ({$<$}5 mass \%). Alternatively, IL-aprotic cosolvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone) mixtures at mass ratios up to 1:1 enhance cellulose dissolution by 20-60\% compared to pure [EMIm][DEP] at select temperatures. Interactions between the IL and molecular solvents were investigated by Kamlet-Taft solvatochromic analysis, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy. The results indicate that preferential solvation of the IL cation and anion by co- and antisolvents impact the ability of IL ions to interact with cellulose thus affecting the cellulose dissolution capacity of IL-solvent mixtures.},

A fundamental facet of this study is thus to elucidate the role of specific anion binding following the Hofmeister series on the mechanical properties of wet fibrillar networks, and link this to the differences in properties of dry nanostructured fibers. This knowledge is useful for rational design of nanomaterials and is critical for validation of specific ion effect theories.

Application of ionic liquids in wood processing technology has attracted attention and is expected to promote further use of wood. They are effective as wood-preserving agents to enhance decay-resistance and also improve fire resistance of wood. Ionic liquids have been used as reaction solvents for preparing various cellulose derivatives or composites with other materials. Attempts have been made to use ionic liquids in pretreatments for enzymatic hydrolysis when producing bio-ethanol from cellulose or wood. Ionic liquids also have been shown to be effective for dissolution of cellulose or wood, forming the basis for studies into the separation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from wood. The effective separation of these components is essential for chemical use of wood, and ionic liquid treatment thus has potential as an enabling technique in biorefineries. Moreover, ionic liquids induce depolymerization of solubilized wood polymers, which may be applicable to the production of useful chemicals from wood polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.}

  abstract = {Abstract The production of cellulose-based textile fibers with high toughness is vital for extending the longevity and thus developing a sustainable textile industry by reducing the global burden of microplastics. This study presented strategies to improve fiber toughness by tuning spinneret geometries. Experimental studies were conducted by spinning with different spinneret geometries and measuring the mechanical and structural properties of the spun fibers. In addition, numerical simulation tools were used to better understand the effects of spinneret geometry. The altering parameters of the spinneret geometries were the capillary diameters D, the angle of the entry cone into the spinning capillary, and the ratio of capillary length to diameter L/D. The highest fiber toughness could be achieved at a capillary aspect ratio of 1 to 2. The obtained maximum fiber toughness was 93 MPa with a tensile strength of 60 cN/tex and a concomitant elongation of 16.5\%. For these fiber properties, a 13 wt\% solution of a high-purity pulp with higher viscosity in [DBNH][OAc] was spun into a 1.3 dtex fiber using a D100 spinneret with a capillary of 1:1 length/diameter and an entrance angle of 8. It was noticeable that the microvoid orientations decreased almost linearly with increasing toughness of the fibers. The morphologies of the fibers were similar regardless of the spinneret geometries and the raw materials used in the spinning process. In summary, by modulating the spinneret geometries, Ioncell fibers obtained high toughness that have the potential to replace synthetic fibers.}

Chitosan solutions behave generally as a typical non-Newtonian shear-thinning fluid with a characteristic n-parameter lower than 1. The rheological n-parameter decreases with decreasing deacetylation degree and increasing solution concentration but it increases with increasing temperature. Because of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding even at low concentration the chitosan macromolecules have a tendency to entangle and to network formation. The density of the molecular entanglements in the chitosan solution depends on concentration, temperature and shear rate applied. An effect of the deacetylation degree on the Huggins viscosity constant related to polymer solvent interaction is found. The most important results refer to the activation energy of viscous flow found from Arrhenius plots. The dependence of the activation energy on solution concentration, shear rate and DD is discussed.}

  abstract = {Cellulose and chitin, both biopolymers, decompose before reaching their melting points. Therefore, processing these unmodified biopolymers into multifilament yarns is limited to solution chemistry. Especially the processing of chitin into fibers is rather limited to distinctive, often toxic or badly removable solvents often accompanied by chemical de-functionalization to chitosan (degree of acetylation, DA, {$<$}50\%). This work proposes a novel method for the preparation of cellulose/chitin blend fibers using ionic liquids (ILs) as gentle, removable, recyclable and non-deacetylating solvents. Chitin and cellulose are dissolved in ethylmethylimidazolium propionate ([C2mim]\textsuperscript{+}[OPr]\textsuperscript{-}) and the obtained one-pot spinning dope is used to produce multifilament fibers by a continuous wet-spinning process. Both the rheology of the corresponding spinning dopes and the structural and physical properties of the obtained fibers have been determined for different biopolymer ratios. With respect to medical or hygienic application, the cellulose/chitin blend fiber show enhanced water retention capacity compared to pure cellulose fibers.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly of ordered structures under the external fields is one of the most important and fundamental research themes in physical science of soft matters including polymers. The "shish-kebab" self-assembly is a most intriguing but fundamental crystalline superstructure formed in polymers under various flow fields. Nevertheless the mechanism of shish-kebab formation is not fully understood yet. In order to clarify the mechanisms for polymer solutions, we have investigated the flow-induced self-assembling structures evolved along a fiber spinning line for concentrated polymer solutions and proposed a new scenario of the kinetic pathway leading to shish-kebab formation and various transient structures evolved therein. The proposed pathway comprises two stages: (i) the early stage pathway before an onset of the birefringence upturn, where the flow-induced phase separation plays a dominant role on creating a series of various transient structures leading to the "sring-like structure" (denoted as "string"), all of which are hardly able to be detected by conventional SAXS, SANS, and WAXD; (ii) the late stage pathway after the onset of the birefringence upturn where the flow-induced crystallization plays a dominant role on generating bundles of stretched chains, probably via the so-called coil-stretched chain transition, within the strings grown in the early stage pathway, followed by nucleation-growth of shishs and epitaxial crystallization of kebab lamellae onto shishs from the random coils incorporated within the demixed domains which coexist with shishs within the given string. Our work therefore elucidates an important role of the flow-induced phase separation on the flow-induced shish-kebab formation. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

Although cellulose remains in solution with much higher water contents, here we report the effect of 0-3 wt \% water on solution rheology of cellulose in 1butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and polarized light microscopy were also used to study water absorbance to the solutions. Tiny amounts of water (0.25 wt \%) can significantly affect the rheological properties of the solutions, imparting a yield stress, while dry solutions appear to be ordinary viscoelastic liquids. The yield stress grows linearly with water content and saturates at a level that increases with the square of cellulose content. Annealing the solutions containing small amounts of water at 80 C for 20 min transforms the samples to the fully dissolved ``dry'' state.}

The resulting structure consisted of two parallel chains having slightly different conformations and organized in sheets packed in a "parallel-up" fashion, with all hydroxymethyl groups adopting the tg conformation. The positions of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding were determined from a Fourier-difference analysis using neutron diffraction data collected from hydrogenated and deuterated samples. The hydrogen atoms involved in the intramolecular O3{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O5 hydrogen bonds have well-defined positions, whereas those corresponding to O2 and O6 covered a wider volume, indicative of multiple geometry with partial occupation. The observation of this disorder substantiates a recent infrared analysis and indicates that, despite their high crystallinity, crystals of cellulose I{$\beta$} have an inherent disorganization of the intermolecular H-bond network that maintains the cellulose chains in sheets.},

A single microtubule in aqueous suspension and imaged with a numerical aperture of 1.4 had a peak retardance of 0.07 nm. The peak retardance of a small bundle increased linearly with the number of MTs in the bundle. Axonemes (prepared from sea urchin sperm) had a peak retardance 20 times higher than that of single MTs, in accordance with the nine doublets and two singlets arrangement of parallel MTs in the axoneme. Measured filament retardance decreased when the filament was defocused or the numerical aperture of the imaging system was decreased. However, the retardance 'area', which we defined as the image retardance integrated along a line perpendicular to the filament axis, proved to be independent of focus and of numerical aperture. These results are in good agreement with a theory that we developed for measuring retardances with imaging optics. Our theoretical concept is based on Wiener's theory of mixed dielectrics, which is well established for nonimaging applications. We extend its use to imaging systems by considering the coherence region defined by the optical set-up. Light scattered from within that region interferes coherently in the image point. The presence of a filament in the coherence region leads to a polarization dependent scattering cross section and to a finite retardance measured in the image point. Similar to resolution measurements, the linear dimension of the coherence region for retardance measurements is on the order {$\lambda$}/(2 NA), where {$\lambda$} is the wavelength of light and NA is the numerical aperture of the illumination and imaging lenses.},

The microscope components specific to analyzing the polarization of light, such as polarizer and compensator, are introduced, and quantitative techniques for measuring the birefringence of the specimen point by point using a traditional polarizing microscope are discussed. The new LC-PolScope greatly improves the analytic power of the technique, providing quantitative birefringence data simultaneously for every image point, thereby revealing molecular order with unprecedented sensitivity and at the highest resolution of the light microscope. Practical aspects discussed include the choice of optics, sample preparation, and combining polarized light with differential interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy.

  abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) hold great potential as solvents to dissolve, recycle, and regenerate cellulosic fabrics, but the dissolved cellulose material system requires greater study in conditions relevant to fiber spinning processes, especially characterization of nonlinear shear and extensional flows. To address this gap, we aimed to disentangle the effects of the temperature, cellulose concentration, and degree of polymerization (DOP) on the shear and extensional flows of cellulose dissolved in an IL. We have studied the behavior of cellulose from two sources, fabric and filter paper, dissolved in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2C1Im][OAc]) over a range of temperatures (25 to 80 C) and concentrations (up to 4\%) that cover both semidilute and entangled regimes. The linear viscoelastic (LVE) response was measured using small-amplitude oscillatory shear techniques, and the results were unified by reducing the temperature, concentration, and DOP onto a single master curve using time superposition techniques. The shear rheological data were further fitted to a fractional Maxwell liquid (FML) model and were found to satisfy the Cox Merz rule within the measurement range. Meanwhile, the material response in the non-LVE (NLVE) regime at large strains and strain rates has special relevance for spinning processes. We quantified the NLVE behavior using steady shear flow tests alongside uniaxial extension using a customized capillary breakup extensional rheometer. The results for both shear and extensional NLVE responses were described by the Rolie-Poly model to account for flow-dependent relaxation times and nonmonotonic viscosity evolution with strain rates in an extensional flow, which primarily arise from complex polymer interactions at high concentrations. The physically interpretable model fitting parameters were further compared to describe differences in material response to different flow types at varying temperatures, concentrations, and DOP. Finally, the fitting parameters from the FML and Rolie-Poly models were connected under the same superposition framework to provide a comprehensive description within the wide measured parameter window for the flow and handling of cellulose in [C2C1Im][OAc] in both linear and nonlinear regimes.}

The results were obtained by extending the Doi and Edwards theory to include the effect of chain stretching. This nonlinear phenomenon is predicted to occur when the product of the shear rate and longitudinal relaxation time of the polymer exceeds one. If a constant-shear-rate flow is started under these conditions, it is shown that the shear stress and the normal stress are considerably larger than that predicted by the original reptation model. We also find that both of these stresses can pass through maxima before reaching a steady state and that the times required to reach these maxima are constants independent of the shear rate. In general the new model requires the numerical solution of coupled partial differential equations. However, at the highest shear rates where reptative relaxation is no longer important, an analytical solution for the stresses is found. The results obtained here are shown to agree well with experimental data and to be an improvement over a simpler model recently proposed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1991 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 72, 31-53 (1997)] predicted a Weissenberg number of 2/3 during capillary thinning of slender filaments of polymer solutions. Data from the experiments of Clasen et al. [J. Rheol. 50, 849-881 (2006)] however show that that is not the case. The Weissenberg number is observed to systematically decrease with concentration in nominally dilute solutions to values well below the critical value of 1/2 for the coil-to-stretch transition to reach a minimum around the critical-overlap concentration c{${_\ast}$}, and thereafter increase in semidilute solutions. Conformation dependence of the polymeric friction coefficient and the phenomenon of coil-stretch hysteresis are shown to play vital roles in determining capillary thinning dynamics. A key result is that when steady-state coil-stretch hysteresis exists, transient polymer conformations during capillary thinning evolve quasistatically along the unstable manifold of the hysteresis window. It is further found necessary to account for changes in polymeric friction due to intermolecular interactions as chains stretch in the flow. A new constitutive model for unentangled polymer solutions is proposed combining blob concepts to account for the effect of hydrodynamic screening on the average friction coefficient of partially stretched chains. It is shown that stretching causes intermolecular interactions to become stronger in the dilute regime and weaker in semidilute solutions. Predictions with this constitutive model agree well with the experimental data in capillary thinning.},

We examine fifteen different ionic liquids composed of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations ([Cnmim], n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) paired with either chloride, acetate or dimethylphosphate. We map the transitions of anions hydrogen bonded to cellulose into different bonding states. We find that increased tail length in the ionic liquids has only a very minor effect on these transitions, tending to slow the dynamics of the transitions and increasing the hydrogen bond lifetimes. Each anion can form up to four hydrogen bonds with cellulose. We find that this hydrogen bond ''redundancy'' leads to multiply bonded anions having lifetimes three to four times that of singly bound anions. Such redundant hydrogen bonds account for roughly half of all anion-cellulose hydrogen bonds. Additional simulations for [C2mim]Cl, [C2mim]Ac and [C2mim]DMP were performed at different water concentrations between 70 mol\% and 90 mol\%. It was found that water crowds the hydrogen bond-accepting sites of the anions, preventing interactions with cellulose. The more water that is present in the system, the more crowded these sites become. Thus, if a hydrogen bond between an anion and cellulose breaks, the likelihood that it will be replaced by a nearby water molecule increases as well. We show that the formation of these ''redundant'' hydrogen bonding states is greatly affected by the presence of water, leading to steep drops in hydrogen bonding between the anions and cellulose.},

  abstract = {Explicit, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the breakup of small bundles of cellulose I{$\alpha$} and I{$\beta$} in the ionic liquids [BMIM]Cl, [EMIM]Ac, and [DMIM]DMP. In all cases, significant breakup of the bundles is observed with the initial breakup following a common underlying mechanism. Anions bind strongly to the hydroxyl groups of the exterior strands of the bundle, forming negatively charged complexes. Binding also weakens the intrastrand hydrogen bonds present in the cellulose strands, providing greater strand flexibility. Cations then intercalate between the individual strands, likely due to charge imbalances, providing the bulk to push the individual moieties apart and initiating the separation. The peeling of an individual strand from the main bundle is observed in [EMIM]Ac with an analysis of its hydrogen bonds with other strands showing that the chain detaches glucan by glucan from the main bundle in discrete, rapid events. Further analysis shows that the intrastrand hydrogen bonds of each glucan tend to break for a sustained period of time before the interstrand hydrogen bonds break and strand detachment occurs. Examination of similar nonpeeling strands shows that, without this intrastrand hydrogen bond breakage, the structural rigidity of the individual unit can hinder its peeling despite interstrand hydrogen bond breakage. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

Abstract This paper describes finite-element simulations and associated experimental studies of extrudate swell for near-monodisperse and polydisperse polystyrenes. The tube-model based Rolie-Poly constitutive model, when extended to include a reduction of monomeric friction at high extension rates, makes much-improved predictions of extrudate swell at high Weissenberg number. This is especially significant for near-monodisperse polymers where rheological features are unchanged by the effects of polydispersity. Extension of this molecular rheology scheme to a polydisperse constitutive model addresses extrusion experiments on polydisperse polystyrenes inside a multipass rheometer, accounting for experimental data up to Rouse Weissenberg numbers of 50. We, therefore, show that from a measurement of polymer molecular weight distribution, it is possible to predict extrudate swell over a broad range of processing conditions for polydisperse polymers and realistic extrusion processes. Small changes in the capillary length to diameter ratio have little effect on extrudate swell in this range of Weissenberg number. This is because the capillary residence time is sufficiently long for a steady state to be reached within the polymer stretch relaxation time, which controls the most decisive physics responsible for extrudate swell.},

Standard measurements of the evolution of the midpoint diameter of the necking fluid filament are augmented by high speed digital video images of the break up dynamics. We show that the successful operation of a capillary thinning device is governed by three important time scales (which characterize the relative importance of inertial, viscous and elastic processes), and also by two important length scales (which specify the initial sample size and the total stretch imposed on the sample). By optimizing the ranges of these geometric parameters, we are able to measure characteristic time scales for tensile stress growth as small as 1 millisecond for a number of model dilute and semi-dilute solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) in water and glycerol. If the final aspect ratio of the sample is too small, or the total axial stretch is too great, measurements are limited, respectively, by inertial oscillations of the liquid bridge or by the development of the well-known beads-on-a-string morphology which disrupt the formation of a uniform necking filament. By considering the magnitudes of the natural time scales associated with viscous flow, elastic stress growth and inertial oscillations it is possible to construct an "operability diagram" characterizing successful operation of a capillary breakup extensional rheometer. For Newtonian fluids, viscosities greater than approximately 70 mPas are required; however for dilute solutions of high molecular weight polymer, the minimum viscosity is substantially lower due to the additional elastic stresses arising from molecular extension. For PEO of molecular weight 2{$\cdot$}106 g/mol, it is possible to measure relaxation times of order 1 ms in dilute polymer solutions with zero-shear-rate viscosities on the order of 2-10 mPas. \textcopyright{} Appl.

The transient force ratio X = 0.713 reveals the existence of an intermediate Newtonian thinning region for polystyrene and WLM solutions prior to the viscoelastic thinning. The exponential decay of X(t) in the first period of thinning defines an elongational relaxation time {$\lambda$}x which is equal to elongational relaxation time {$\lambda$}e obtained from exponential diameter decay D(t) indicating that the initial stress decay is controlled by the same molecular relaxation process as the strain hardening observed in the terminal regime of filament thinning. Deviations in true and apparent elongational viscosity are discussed in terms of X(t). A minimum Trouton ratio is observed which decreases exponentially with increasing polymer concentration leveling off at Trmin = 3 for the solutions exhibiting intermediate Newtonian thinning and Trmin {$\approx$} 10 otherwise. The relaxation time ratio {$\lambda$}e/ {$\lambda$}s, where {$\lambda$}s is the terminal shear relaxation time, decreases exponentially with increasing polymer concentration and the data for all investigated solutions collapse onto a master curve irrespective of polymer molecular weight or solvent viscosity when plotted versus the reduced concentration c[ {$\eta$}], with [ {$\eta$}] being the intrinsic viscosity. This confirms the strong effect of the nonlinear deformation in CaBER experiments on entangled polymer solutions as suggested earlier. On the other hand, {$\lambda$}e {$\approx\lambda$}s is found for all WLM solutions clearly indicating that these nonlinear deformations do not affect the capillary thinning process of these living polymer systems.},

It is shown that if the mobility parameter is greater than 1/2 then such a solution either does not exist or is not realizable for large values of the shear rate (if there is no solventviscosity contribution) or for an entire finite range of shear rates (if there is a small contribution from the solventviscosity). If the mobility parameter does not exceed 1/2 then the solution exists and is realizable for all values of the shear rate. The conclusions follow from a one-dimensional linear stability analysis of the appropriate boundary value problem and from an admissibility criterion that stems from restrictions imposed on the configuration tensor which arises from the molecular model description of the polymer liquid. We consider a solution realizable if it is stable and admissible. Thus a clearly distinct behavior of the Giesekus model is observed for values of the mobility parameter between 0 and 1/2 as opposed to values between 1/2 and 1. This may have implications on the suitability of the model with values of the mobility parameter exceeding 1/2.},

The goal was to compare the flow of solutions, macromolecule hydrodynamic properties in each solvent, and the activation energies of viscous flow. Intrinsic viscosities were determined using the truncated form of the general Huggins equation. In both solvents cellulose intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing temperature, indicating the decrease of solvent thermodynamic quality. The activation energies for both types of cellulose solutions were calculated. For cellulose-EMIMAc the Arrhenius plot showed a concave shape, and thus the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) approach was used. We suggest an improved method of data analysis for the determination of VTF constants and demonstrate that cellulose-EMIMAc solution viscosity obeys VTF formalism. Once the dependences of Arrhenius activation energy and VTF pseudo-activation energy were obtained for the whole range of concentrations studied, they were all shown to be described by a simple power-law function of polymer concentration. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

We discuss the dilution effect of the oligomers on the entangled long chains. In particular, we investigate the influence of both concentration and molar mass on the value of the effective dynamic dilution exponent determined from the level of the storage plateau at low and intermediate frequencies. We show that the experimental results can be quantitatively explained by considering the tension re-equilibration process along the chains, in agreement with van Ruymbeke et al. (Macromol., 2014), i.e. by considering that the real dilution exponent {$\alpha$} is always equal to 1, while larger values of the dilution exponent (1 {$<$} {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1.3) found experimentally are attributed to the enhanced relaxation of the long chain extremities. Then we discuss the influence of the polymer concentration on the terminal relaxation time of the solutions and how this can be modelled by the enhanced contour length fluctuation process (CR-CLF). We point out that this larger dilution effect is not only a function of concentration but also depends on the molar mass of the chains. While the proposed approach successfully explains the viscoelastic properties of a large number of semi-dilute solutions of polymers in their own oligomers, important discrepancies are found for semi-dilute entangled polymers in small-molecule theta or good solvents. Possible explanations for the differences between these sample sets are proposed, based on the comparison of their viscoelastic behavior.},

We also show that ionic liquid remains trapped in the regenerated cellulose and over a period of 2 years a significant reduction in DP was measured. This is likely due to the continued interaction between the cellulose and the trapped ionic liquid.},

The coagulation and associated diffusion equilibrium were calculated for two imidazolium-based ILs, and it was found that the anion largely influenced the coagulation kinetics. This was likely due to the association between the anion of the IL and cellulose. The orientation of the polymer chains is known to influence the mechanical properties greatly; previously, hot stretching was used to orientate cellulose acetate. Here we investigated this influence on the mechanical properties of regenerated cellulose fibres by applying a post stretch at different stretch ratios.},

Polarized optical microscopy (POM) measurements indicate that the two critical cellulose concentrations for the appearance of biphase and fully anisotropic phase for MCC/AMIMCl solutions are 9 and 16 wt\%, respectively. POM and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements coherently indicate that the clearing temperature, Tc increases with increasing cellulose concentration. Oscillatory shear measurements show that the crossover frequency first moves to lower values and then moves back to higher values with increasing cellulose concentration, which indicates that most cellulose chains are aligned or oriented to reduce chain entanglements when the cellulose concentration is above 14 wt\%. From the steady shear measurements, it is surprising to find that the viscosity versus shear rate curves exhibit four flow regions including two plateaus and two shear-thinning regions when the cellulose concentration exceeds 9 wt\%. The influences of cellulose concentration and temperature on the first normal stress differences (N1) are analyzed according to the Larson theory. The peak of N1 always appears at the intermediate part of the first shear-thinning region, and the following minimum of N1 appears at the onset of the second shear-thinning region. The viscosity versus shear rate curves only exhibit two flow regions when temperature is above the respective Tc; meanwhile, negative N1 values disappear and N1 increases monotonically. The above results suggest that melting of the liquid crystal domains at high temperature results in the disappearance of the second plateau for the viscosity versus shear rate curves. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

Different models, fluid viscosities and aspect-ratios are studied, employing a hybrid finite element/finite volume spatial approach. Finite element discretisation is employed for the momentum and continuity equation, whilst a pure-upwinding cell-vertex finite volume representation is utilised for the hyperbolic stress equation. The results are validated against equivalent experimental results from the literature. By employing various constitutive models, viscoelastic response has been studied for some strain-hardening fluids. Two different polymeric to solvent viscosity ratios are studied covering both high and low solvent fractions. The relaxation time and the apparent extensional viscosity are calculated for both viscosity ratios, from the evolution of the mid-filament diameter. For these viscoelastic solutions, the extensional viscosity increases with strain, and this trend, and its range of values in apparent extensional viscosity values agree well with the literature. Also, estimated relaxation times are found to lie in close agreement with the actual relaxation time data used for the fluids in question. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Unlike the commercial birefringence microscope employed in the previous studies, our approach is able to provide direct measurement of retardance, which quantifies the difference in refractive index of the fluid experienced by the ordinary and extraordinary rays, from one single image frame. This capability facilitates unsteady full-field quantitation of flow-induced birefringence in microfluidics that has never been achieved before. At low flow rates, we find that the value of the retardance is independent of the microfluidic design and proportional to the nominal strain rates. This linearity bridges the measurement of birefringence and the deformation rate in the microflow environment, which yields the stress information of the fluid flow. In addition, the {$\mu$}PIV results confirm that both extensional and shear strain rates contribute to the flow-induced birefringence so that the retardance distribution can be used to represent the field of the principal strain rate in a microfluidic device. The outcome of this study proves that our approach provides a non-invasive method that enables an intuitive fullfield representation of stress in the instantaneous flow field in a microfluidic device.},

This particular ability of some ionic liquids, accompanied by a series of concurrent advantages, enables the development of improved processing strategies for the manufacturing of a plethora of biopolymer-based advanced materials. The more recent discoveries of dissolution of lignocellulosic materials (e.g., wood) in ionic liquids, with at least partial separation of the major constituent biopolymers, suggest further paths towards the achievement of a truly sustainable chemical and energy economy based on the concept of a biorefinery which provides chemicals, materials, and energy. Nonetheless, questions remain about the use of ionic liquids and the advisability of introducing any new process which utilizes bulk synthetic chemicals which have to be made, disposed of, and prevented from entering the environment. In this article, we discuss our own journey from the discovery of the dissolution of cellulose in ionic liquids to the cusp of an enabling technology for a true biorefinery and consider some of the key questions which remain. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Curdlan, a linear {$\beta$}-1,3-glucan, can be potentially converted into a functional fiber with excellent sustainability and biodegradability because of its helical crystalline structure and unique physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and green preparation of regenerated curdlan fibers and characterize the fiber properties via mechanical and structural analyses. Curdlan (9 wt \%) in an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3methylimidazolium acetate, [Emim][OAc]), was sequentially extruded under a mild condition at 80 C, drawn in an air gap, and coagulated in water. The resulting fiber was transparent, soft, and had high water-absorption ability ( 86\%). By changing the draw ratio from 1 to 10, the molecular orientation of the regenerated fibers increased, resulting in enhanced tenacity (5.2 0.1 cN tex-1 or 75 1 MPa) and Young's moduli (2.7 0.1 GPa). Although the mechanical strength of these curdlan-regenerated fibers is not comparable to those of conventional cellulose-regenerated fibers, their exceptionally excellent elongation (20-50\%) in the dry state is noteworthy, indicating their potential use in different applications from those desired for the cellulose fibers.}

Extensional rheometry measurements were made using the Cambridge Trimaster filament-stretching device. The steady shear tests indicated a transition between a semi-dilute regime, below 10g/L, and an entangled regime at higher concentrations. The solutions were shear-thinning and obeyed the unmodified Cox-Merz rule in the dilute regime, but deviated from Cox-Merz and exhibited strongly viscoelastic behaviour at higher concentrations. The surface tension at higher concentration also deviated from the Szyszkowski model, exhibiting behaviour consistent with entanglement. The filament-thinning data did not fit the model for polymer solution behaviour presented by Entov and Hinch (1997), but gave a good fit to a modified form where time was normalised by the time for filament break-up. This scaling was independent of concentration effects, as reported by Chesterton, Meza, Moggridge, Sadd, and Wilson (2011) for cake batters. The modified model parameters approached asymptotic values for entangled solutions. The estimated apparent extensional viscosity exhibited a peak at unit strain followed by a constant value.

A new nonlinear two-species network model for these telechelic polymers is described which incorporates appropriate molecular mechanisms for the creation and destruction of elastically active chains. Like other recent models we incorporate the contributions of both the bridging chains (those between micelles) and the dangling chains to the final stress tensor. This gives rise to two distinct relaxation time scales: a short Rouse time for the relaxing chains and a longer network time scale that depends on the aggregation number and strength of the micellar junctions. The evolution equations for the fraction of elastically active chains and for the conformation tensors of each species are solved to obtain the total stress arising from imposed deformations. The model contains a single adjustable nonlinear parameter and incorporates the nonlinear chain extension, the shear-induced enhancement of associations, and the stretch-induced dissociation of hydrophobic chains. In contrast to earlier closed-form models, we are able to obtain quantitative agreement between experimental measurements and the model predictions for three different series of telechelic polymers over a range of concentrations. The scaling of both the zero shear viscosity and the effective network relaxation time shows good agreement with those measured in experiments. The model also quantitatively captures both the shear thickening and subsequent shear thinning observed in the rheology at high deformation rates and predicts transient extensional stress growth curves in close agreement with those measured using a filament stretching rheometer. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Chemical Society.}

All the numerical results are compared with experimental observations and the predictions of Giesekus and Phan-Thien and Tanner models.

Ionic liquids can dissolve large amounts of cellulose, which can later be regenerated from solution, but their high viscosity is an inconvenience. Hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and cellulose is the main aspect determining dissolution. Here we try to elucidate the role of a molecular cosolvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is an aprotic polar compound, in the system composed of cellulose and the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. We calculated quantities related to specific interactions (mainly hydrogen bonds), conformations, and the structure of local solvation environments, both for a solvated oligomer chain of cellulose and for a model microfibril composed of 36 chains in the I{$\beta$} crystal structure. We compare two solvent systems: the pure ionic liquid and a mixed solvent with an equimolar composition in ionic liquid and DMSO. All entities are represented by detailed all-atom, fully flexible force fields. The main conclusions are that DMSO behaves as an "innocent" cosolvent, lowering the viscosity and accelerating mass transport in the system, but without interacting specifically with cellulose or disrupting the interactions between cellulose with the anions of the ionic liquid. An understanding of solvation in mixed solvents composed of ionic liquids and molecular compounds can enable the design of high-performance media for the use of biomass materials.

  abstract = {We report on a new process for the spinning of high-performance cellulosic fibers. For the first time, cellulose has been dissolved in the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium octanoate ([C2C1im][Oc]) via a thin film evaporator in a continuous process. Compared to other ILs, [C2C1im][Oc] shows no signs of hydrolysis with water. For dope preparation the degree of polymerization of the pulp was adjusted by electron beam irradiation and determined by viscosimetry. In addition, the quality of the pulp was evaluated by means of alkali resistance. Endless filament fibers have been spun using dry-jet wet spinning and an extruder instead of a spinning pump, which significantly increases productivity. By this approach, more than 1000 m of continuous multifilament fibers have been spun. The novel approach allows for preparing cellulose fibers with high Young's modulus (33 GPa) and unprecedented high tensile strengths up to 45 cN/tex. The high performance of the obtained fibers provides a promising outlook for their application as replacement material for rayon-based tire cord fibers.},

  abstract = {The FENE-P model of a fluid is particularly suitable for describing the rheology of dilute polymer solutions (Newtonian solvents containing small amounts of dissolved polymer) as a result of its ability to capture nonlinear effects arising from the finite extensibility of the polymer chains. In extensional flows, these polymer solutions exhibit dramatically different behavior from the corresponding Newtonian solvents alone, notably through the creation of persistent filaments when stretched. By using the technique of capillary thinning to study the dynamics of the thinning process of these filaments, the transient extensional rheology of the fluid can be characterized. We show that under conditions of uniaxial elongational flow, a composite analytic solution can be developed to predict the time evolution of the radius of the filament. Furthermore we derive an analytic expression for the finite time to breakup of the fluid filaments. This breakup time agrees very well with results obtained from full numerical simulations, and both numerics and theory predict an increase in the time to breakup as the finite extensibility parameter b, related to the molecular weight of the polymer, is increased. As b\textrightarrow{$\infty$}, the results converge to an asymptotic result for the breakup time which shows that the breakup time grows as tbreak ln(MW), where MW is the molecular weight of the dilute polymer solution.},

  abstract = {Utilization of natural polymers has attracted increasing attention because of the consumption and over-exploitation of non-renewable resources, such as coal and oil. The development of green processing of cellulose, the most abundant biorenewable material on Earth, is urgent from the viewpoints of both sustainability and environmental protection. The discovery of the dissolution of cellulose in ionic liquids (ILs, salts which melt below 100 \textdegree C) provides new opportunities for the processing of this biopolymer, however, many fundamental and practical questions need to be answered in order to determine if this will ultimately be a green or sustainable strategy. In this critical review, the open fundamental questions regarding the interactions of cellulose with both the IL cations and anions in the dissolution process are discussed. Investigations have shown that the interactions between the anion and cellulose play an important role in the solvation of cellulose, however, opinions on the role of the cation are conflicting. Some researchers have concluded that the cations are hydrogen bonding to this biopolymer, while others suggest they are not. Our review of the available data has led us to urge the use of more chemical units of solubility, such as `g cellulose per mole of IL' or `mol IL per mol hydroxyl in cellulose' to provide more consistency in data reporting and more insight into the dissolution mechanism. This review will also assess the greenness and sustainability of IL processing of biomass, where it would seem that the choices of cation and anion are critical not only to the science of the dissolution, but to the ultimate `greenness' of any process (142 references). \textcopyright{} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The nonisothermal melt crystallization kinetics of neat PCL and its LDH nanocomposites was investigated with the Ozawa, Avrami, and combined Avrami-Ozawa methods. The Ozawa method failed to describe the crystallization kinetics of the studied systems. The Avrami method was found to be useful for describing the nonisothermal crystallization behavior, but the parameters in this method do not have explicit meaning for nonisothermal crystallization. The combined Avrami-Ozawa method explained the nonisothermal crystallization behavior of PCL and its LDH nanocomposites effectively. The kinetic results and polarized optical microscopy observations indicated that the addition of LDH could affect the mechanism of nucleation and growth of the PCL matrix. The Takhor model was used to analyze the activation energies of nonisothermal crystallization. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Cellulose is the most abundant and renewable organic compound on Earth, it is however not soluble in common organic solvents and aqueous solutions. Cellulose dissolution is a key aspect to promote its value-added applications. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to solubilize cellulose under relatively mild conditions. The easy processability of cellulose with ILs and their environmental-friendly nature prompted research in various fields such as biomass pretreatment and conversion, cellulose fiber and composite production, and chemical conversion of cellulose in ILs. Progress has been made on understanding the mechanism of cellulose dissolution in ILs, including the structural characteristics of ILs that are cellulose solvents, however many details remain unknown. In light of rapid development and importance of cellulose dissolution in the field of IL-based cellulose and biomass processing, it is necessary to provide an overview of current understanding of cellulose dissolution in ILs and outline possible future research trends. Recent literature studies suggest that synergistic effects between the anions and the cations of ILs need to be revealed, which requires refining the structure of cellulose elementary fibrils, simulation of more realistic cellulose fibrils and detailed studies on the solution structure of cellulose in ILs. After analyzing literature studies, three interacting modules are identified, which are crucial to understand the process of cellulose dissolution in ILs: (1) the structure of elementary fibrils; (2) solvation of cellulose in ILs; and (3) solution structure of cellulose solubilized in ILs. A coherent analysis of these modules will aid in better design of more efficient ILs and processes.}

The uniqueness of the model lies in its two-phase nature and ability to predict important characteristics of the wet spinning process, such as the locking-in of axial velocity, mass transfer behavior, and internal structure formation along the spinline. The model predicts growth of the two-phase gel that forms and the porous fractions within it, along with the compositions of the polymer-rich and solvent-nonsolvent-rich phases. The appearance of a skin-core structure that depends on the system and operating conditions is also predicted. These features are demonstrated through analyses of the isothermal wet spinning of poly(acrylonitrile) solutions in dimethlysulfoxide using two different nonsolvent coagulants, water and ethanol.},

In the past decades, ionic liquids have been studied to dissolve cellulose efficiently, sustainably, and in an eco-friendly manner. In this study, a series of imidazolium-based ionic liquids were synthesized to explore as solvents for cellulose, including 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([mmim]dmp), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([emim]dmp), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([bmim]dmp), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([hmim]dmp), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethylphosphate ([emim]dep), 1,3-diethylimidazolium diethylphosphate ([eeim]dep), and 1-butyl-3-ethylimidazolium diethylphosphate ([beim]dep). Rheology experiments were conducted to study the flow behavior of cellulose in these ionic liquids and cosolvents. We found that the dissolution capacity of cellulose increases with decreasing viscosity of the solvent and that the rheological properties depend most strongly on the concentration of cellulose dissolved. Systems composed of cellulose in [mmim]dmp, [emim]dmp, and [emim]dep behave as viscoelastic gels, while formulations of cellulose in [bmim]dmp, [hmim]dmp, [eeim]dep, and [beim]dep show viscoelastic liquid behavior. These results will impact development of new solvents for processing of cellulose-based polymeric materials.},

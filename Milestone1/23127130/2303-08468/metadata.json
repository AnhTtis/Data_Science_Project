    "abstract": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity. The essential ideal graph of $R$, denoted by $\\mathcal{E}_{R}$, is a graph with vertex set consisting of the set of all nonzero proper ideals of \\textit{R} and two vertices $I$ and $J$ are adjacent if and only if $I+J$ is an essential ideal. In this paper, We determine the adjacency spectrum and wiener index of the essential ideal graph of the finite commutative ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, for $n=p^{m_{1}}$ and $n= p^{m_{1}}q^{m_{2}}$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes with $p< q$ and $m_{1}, m_2$ are positive integers.",

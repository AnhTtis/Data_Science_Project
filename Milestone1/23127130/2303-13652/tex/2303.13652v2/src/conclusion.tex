\section{Conclusion}

We present InterWild, a framework for the 3D interacting hand mesh recovery in the wild.
InterWild effectively reduces the domain gap between MoCap and ITW datasets.
To this end, it takes an image of a single hand regardless of whether hands are interacting for the estimation of 3D meshes of left and right hands.
In addition, it takes geometric features for the estimation of 3D relative translation between two hands.
Integrating our InterWild with whole-body 3D human mesh estimation methods can be a promising future research direction.

\section{2D-based weak supervision in Table~\ref{table:transnet_input_weak_sup}}
We describe how the 2D-based weak supervision in Table~\ref{table:transnet_input_weak_sup} of the main manuscript is introduced.
We modified TransNet to output 3D global translation of the right hand and 3D relative translation between two hands from the two hand input.
We observed this produces better results than estimating 3D global translations of both hands.
The 3D global translation of the left hand is obtained by adding the 3D relative translation to the 3D global translation of the right hand.
Then, we translate root joint-relative 3D joint coordinates of each hand (\textit{i.e.}, output of SHNet) using the 3D global translation of each hand.
The translated 3D joint coordinates of two hands are projected to the TransNet's input space (\textit{i.e.}, union of two hand boxes).
Finally, we minimized the L1 distance between the projected and GT 2D coordinates.
Please note that we make the shape parameter of MANO of left and right hands be the same during the weak supervision to minimize the scale ambiguity of each hand.

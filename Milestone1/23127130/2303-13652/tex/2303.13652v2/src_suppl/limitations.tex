\section{Limitations}


Figure~\ref{fig:limitation} shows failure case of ours, highlighted by yellow circles.
It recovers the 3D mesh of the front view correctly; however, there are collisions in the 3D meshes of other views.
This can be addressed by introducing a collision avoidance loss function, similar to IHMR~\cite{rong2021monocular}.
We leave this as our one of future works.

\section{Verification of reproduced results in Table~\ref{table:comparison_sota_mesh}}

Table~\ref{table:intaghand_reproduce} and ~\ref{table:zhang_reproduce} verify our reproduce results of IntagHand~\cite{li2022interacting} and Zhang~\etal~\cite{zhang2021interacting} on InterHand2.6M, respectively.
For the verification of IntagHand~\cite{li2022interacting}, we used their officially released pre-trained model and evaluation code.
As their model is trained only on interacting hand sequences of InterHand2.6M, we also trained a model following their training set for the verification.
Their original evaluation setting is the first row of Table~\ref{table:intaghand_reproduce}.
On the other hand, our evaluation setting in Table~\ref{table:comparison_sota_mesh} of the main manuscript is the last row as most 3D hand recovery works~\cite{moon2020interhand2,boukhayma20193d,choi2020p2m,Freihand2019,moon2020i2l} align translation with the wrist joint, a \emph{root joint} in hand kinematic space.
Using the middle root joint reduces the errors as the length of the kinematic chain to the fingertips becomes much shorter.
Please note that the reproduced numbers can be different from those of Table~\ref{table:comparison_sota_mesh} in the main manuscript as the results in Table 5 are from additional training on MSCOCO.


For the verification of Zhang~\etal~\cite{zhang2021interacting}, we take numbers from their paper as their released pre-trained model does not work.
Following their training protocol, we trained a model only on the interacting hand sequence of InterHand2.6M.
Please note that the reproduced numbers can be different from those of Table~\ref{table:comparison_sota_mesh} in the main manuscript as the results in Table 5 are from additional training on MSCOCO.

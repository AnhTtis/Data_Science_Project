    "abstract": "Despite recent achievements, existing 3D interacting hands recovery methods have shown results mainly on motion capture (MoCap) environments, not on in-the-wild (ITW) ones. This is because collecting 3D interacting hands data in the wild is extremely challenging, even for the 2D data. We present InterWild, which brings MoCap and ITW samples to shared domains for robust 3D interacting hands recovery in the wild with a limited amount of ITW 2D/3D interacting hands data. 3D interacting hands recovery consists of two sub-problems: 1) 3D recovery of each hand and 2) 3D relative translation recovery between two hands. For the first sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared 2D scale space. Although ITW datasets provide a limited amount of 2D/3D interacting hands, they contain large-scale 2D single hand data. Motivated by this, we use a single hand image as an input for the first sub-problem regardless of whether two hands are interacting. Hence, interacting hands of MoCap datasets are brought to the 2D scale space of single hands of ITW datasets. For the second sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared appearance-invariant space. Unlike the first sub-problem, 2D labels of ITW datasets are not helpful for the second sub-problem due to the 3D translation's ambiguity. Hence, instead of relying on ITW samples, we amplify the generalizability of MoCap samples by taking only a geometric feature without an image as an input for the second sub-problem. As the geometric feature is invariant to appearances, MoCap and ITW samples do not suffer from a huge appearance gap between the two datasets.

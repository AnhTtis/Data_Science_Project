    "abstract": "We present rapid and robust protocols for STIRAP and quantum logic gates. Our gates are based on geometric phases acquired by instantaneous eigenstates of a slowly accelerating inertial Hamiltonian. To begin, we establish the criteria for inertial evolution and subsequently engineer pulse shapes that fulfill these conditions. These tailored pulses are then used to optimize geometric logic gates. We analyze a realization of our protocols with $^{87}$Rb atoms, resulting in gate fidelity that approaches the current state-of-the-art, with marked improvements in robustness.",

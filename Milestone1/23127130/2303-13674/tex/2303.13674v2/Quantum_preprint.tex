\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
 We present rapid and robust protocols for single- and two-qubit quantum logic gates.  Our gates are based on geometric phases acquired by instantaneous eigenstates of a \emph{slowly accelerating} ``inertial'' Hamiltonian. We begin by defining conditions for    inertial population transfer  and, then, find pulse shapes that meet these  conditions. We use those pulses  to perform inertial quantum logic gates and  optimize their performance. As an application of our approach, we propose  an implementation of our protocol  with  $^{87}$Rb atoms and analyze the effect of  polarization and leakage  errors. Our approach  can be extended beyond geometric gates and is useful for speeding up   adiabatic  quantum computation protocols.

\section{Introduction}

Rapid high-fidelity quantum logic gates  are essential   for   large-scale atom-based   quantum computers~\cite{ladd2010quantum,saffman2016quantum,henriet2020quantum}. State-of-the-art experiments   can reach    fidelities of  99$\%$  and 95$\%$ for single-qubit-  and two-qubit gates respectively~\cite{henriet2020quantum,morgado2021quantum,zhang2020submicrosecond}, bringing them closer but still not reaching  the required  threshold values for fault-tolerant quantum  computation~\cite{aharonov1997fault}. 
Further improving  these abilities is a key goal in quantum computation research.   Atomic qubits are typically encoded  in  long-lived hyperfine states and  transitions between them are driven indirectly  via    excited  states. Physical processes that limit gate fidelity   include depolarization and dephasing,  induced by  spontaneous emission from  the excited   states,  and  imperfections in the control fields that implement the gate. An elegant approach to     combat these issues  involves  adiabatic following of   ``dark states:'' By slowly varying the control fields, the system adheres to a dark combination of the long lived states, which  is decoupled from radiation and is, therefore, protected from incoherent  emission. 
This principle forms the basis of  stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)~\cite{vitanov2017stimulated} and geometric quantum logic gates~\cite{moller2007geometric}.
The outcome of such protocols depends only on  the geometric phase acquired by the dark eigenstate and  on the final state of the system. Hence, it is robust to  certain perturbations (i.e., those  that do not affect the geometric phase or  final state).  For the system to adhere to the dark state, the protocol must be sufficiently slow, limiting the computational speed.





\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=mypurple!5!white,colframe=mypurple!75!black,title=Contribution]
Quantum computation errors can be reduced by using adiabatic protocols, which involve slow manipulation of the qubits. However, the slowness of these protocols limits their performance. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that achieves the same level of robustness by using inertial protocols~\cite{dann2021inertial,hu2021experimental}. Unlike adiabatic protocols, these protocols do not rely on slow manipulation, but rather utilize slow acceleration to achieve robustness. To demonstrate the full power  of this approach, we develop an  algorithm that finds  optimal protocols for universal quantum logic gates.

\end{figure}



Many efforts  have focused on speeding up adiabatic schemes and increasing their fidelity  while maintaining their robustness~\cite{vitanov2017stimulated}.   A  seminal paper by Berry~\cite{berry2009transitionless} showed  that adiabatic approximations can be made exact and rapid  by  introducing appropriate fields  that counteract diabatic transitions, resulting in ``transitionless driving.'' This idea is  illustrated in \figref{Fig0}(a--c) (borrowed from~\cite{sels2017minimizing}), where a  cup of a running waiter is being tilted to avoid spilling.  An application of this approach to STIRAP successfully produced a high-fidelity rapid and robust population transfer protocol~\cite{unanyan1997laser,demirplak2003adiabatic,chen2010shortcut,torrontegui2013shortcuts,del2013shortcuts,guery2019shortcuts}.   Recent work presents a prescription for finding  improved transitionless-driving protocols with inherently small counter-diabatic terms~\cite{benseny2021adiabatic}. Since such protocols  differ only slightly from  the adiabatic protocols, they  are  often easy to implement. Although significantly improving  conventional STIRAP~\cite{du2016experimental}, 
errors in the  implementation of the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian terms translate into  errors in the   eigenstate and, therefore,  limit the gate  fidelity and  speed.
Alternatively, one can  try to improve adiabatic protocols by  optimizing the parameters of analytic   adiabatic pulses~\cite{vasilev2009optimum,chen2012engineering}.  For example, in Ref.~\cite{vasilev2009optimum},   optimized    pulses were used to  reduce diabatic errors below the threshold required for   fault tolerant quantum computation (using an idealized theoretical model system).  Despite its simplicity, this approach is limited in its ability to improve   performance in a  general setting.  To push these results further, one needs to resort to brute-force optimization methods, such as  quantum optimal control (QOCT)~\cite{malinovsky1997simple,werschnik2007quantum,koch2022quantum}. It remains  a challenge to find optimal solutions that are  both practical and globally optimal.  In this work, we  use the recent ``inertial theorem''~\cite{dann2021inertial,hu2021experimental} to find optimal STIRAP pulses with simple-shaped  pulses.  By transforming the Hamiltonian into an appropriate ``inertial frame''  and rescaling the time coordinate, we find solutions that are adiabatic in the new frame  but   may vary rapidly in the original frame. This concept is  illustrated in \figref{Fig0}(d), where   the cup  of a running waiter does not spill as long as the waiter's acceleration is small.  We use   inertial solutions as an initial  guess  for QOCT and impose   adiabaticity and inertiality constraints in the optimization algorithm. 



We use the  optimized  protocols  to improve   quantum logic gates that  use geometric phases acquired during cyclic evolution~\cite{unanyan1999laser,duan2001geometric}. Specifically,  these protocols employ tripod-level atoms, as  proposed in~\cite{moller2007geometric} and demonstrated   experimentally in~\cite{toyoda2013realization}. Our approach is generic and can be used to improve additional adiabatic  protocols.  For example,  a recent proposal associates  SU(2) rotations with  fixed  ratios between the pump and Stokes STIRAP fields~\cite{lacour2006arbitrary}; The   gate fidelity is limited by diabatic transitions and, hence, can be  improved by our approach.  Another example is a  STIRAP motivated approach  for   Grover’s search algorithm, which finds a marked item in an unsorted list~\cite{daems2008analog}. Finally, adiabatic protocols are used in quantum simulated annealing, where a system is adiabatically brought into  a final state that solves a complex  computational problem. Efforts have concentrated on speeding up  quantum annealing,  for example, by using a variational transitionless-driving approach~\cite{sels2017minimizing}. Based on our present work, inertial solutions are expected to be useful for improving such protocols. 


\section{Inertial evolution} 
The inertial theorem utilizes a timescale separation between variables to obtain approximate  solutions for the system's dynamics under rapid external driving~\cite{dann2021inertial}. The theorem is derived  in   Liouville space -- the vector space of operators on the Hilbert space. Starting with the Heisenberg equations of motion for the system operators, one identifies a suitable time-dependent operator basis  for which the equations of motion vary on two timescales.  By rescaling the generalized time coordinates,  one can eliminate the fast dynamics and, then, identify new  dynamical symmetries -- operators whose Heisenberg representation is independent of time. These symmetries enable the construction of  approximate analytic solutions. For the system considered in this paper, the construction in Liouville space inspires an equivalent formulation in Hilbert space.


Let $\KET{\psi}$ satisfy the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, $i\hbar\,\partial\KET{\psi}/\partial t = H(t)\KET{\psi}$, and introduce the eigenvalue decomposition  of the Hamiltonian, 
\begin{equation}
H(t) =P\Lambda P^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $P$ and $\Lambda$ are  instantaneous matrices of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H(t)$ respectively. Let us use the eigenvector matrix  to define the state  $|\tilde{\psi}\rangle=P\KET{\psi}$, which satisfies
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial \,|\tilde{\psi}\rangle}{\partial t} = 
\left(
P^\dagger H P - i\hbar P^\dagger \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}
\right)|\tilde{\psi}\rangle\equiv \tilde{H}|\tilde{\psi}\rangle.
\label{eq:inertial-H0}
\end{equation}
(Note that \eqref{inertial-H0} is valid for  any matrix $P$, not necessarily the eigenvector matrix.) Inertial frames are those in which $\tilde{H}$ can be written in the form 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{H} = \Omega(t) \mat{M}(\chi),
\label{eq:factor-H}
\end{equation}
where \emph{$\Omega(t)$ is a possibly rapidly varying scalar while $\chi$ is nearly stationary}. Introducing a rescaled time coordinate, $\tau = \int_0^t \Omega(t')dt'$,  we obtain the inertial frame Schr\"{o}dinger equation


\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial |\tilde{\psi}\rangle}{\partial\tau} = \mat{M}(\chi) |\tilde{\psi}\rangle.
\end{equation}
The solutions, $|\tilde{\psi}(\tau)\rangle$, 
can be approximated by adiabatically following the  eigenstates of $\mat{M}$. The validity condition is that $\mat{M}$ is slowly varying compared to its energy gap. We will see that for    STIRAP,  this condition  amounts to constraining the second-order temporal derivative of the control parameters (i.e.,  acceleration), versus the  adiabatic condition constraining the velocity.

\section{The inertial STIRAP protocol} 
 Consider a three-level system  driven by two fields as shown in \figref{Fig1}(a). The goal of the protocol is to transfer population between the ground states, from $\KET{1}$ to $\KET{2}$, without populating the third state, $\KET{3}$. Assuming that the fields are both detuned from the atomic transition  by $\Delta$,  the Hamiltonian of this system is
\begin{gather}
H = \Omega_1\KET{1}\!\BRA{3} + \Omega_2\KET{2}\!\BRA{3} + \mbox{h.c.} +\Delta\KET{3}\!\BRA{3}\nonumber\\ =\Omega\KET{B}\!\BRA{3} + \Omega^*\KET{3}\!\BRA{B} +\Delta\KET{3}\!\BRA{3},
\label{eq:STIRAP-Hamiltonian}
\end{gather}
where  the ''bright'' superposition state is defined as:  $\KET{B} \equiv (\Omega_1\KET{1}+ \Omega_2\KET{2})/\Omega$, with $\Omega \equiv \sqrt{\Omega_1^2 + \Omega_2^2}$. The orthogonal ``dark'' state,  $\KET{D} \equiv (\Omega_2\KET{1} - \Omega_1\KET{2})/\Omega,$ is an eigenvector of $H$ with eigenvalue 0. In the adiabatic limit, a system initialized in $\KET{D}$ remains in $\KET{D}$.  Therefore, to transfer population from $\KET{1}$ to $\KET{2}$ by following the dark state, one needs to first turn on only $\Omega_2$, then turn it off   slowly and turn on $\Omega_1$. This ``counter-intuitive'' pulse sequence  is shown in~\figref{Fig1}(b).



Next, we present conditions for finding   inertial STIRAP solutions. We introduce the parameterization
\begin{gather}
\Omega_1 = \Omega(t) \sin\theta(t)  \hspace{0.5in}
\Omega_2 = \Omega(t)\cos\theta(t).
\label{eq:sinusoidal}
\end{gather}
The  conditions are 
\begin{align}
&(i)\hspace{0.2in}\theta(0) = 0 \hspace{0.25in} ,\hspace{0.25in} \theta(t_f)= \pi/2 \nonumber\\
&(ii)\hspace{0.2in}\dot{\theta}(0)=
\dot{\theta}(t_f) = 0,
\nonumber\\
&(iii)\hspace{0.2in}
\ddot{\theta}\ll \Omega^4/\Delta^2.
\label{eq:inertial-conditions}
\end{align}

where $t_f$ is  the protocol duration. Condition (\emph{i}) guarantees    that the dark state is $\KET{1}$ at the beginning and $\KET{2}$ at the end of the protocol. Condition (\emph{ii}) implies that the eigenstate of the inertial Hamiltonian coincides with the dark state at $t = 0$ and $t = t_f$. Finally, condition  (\emph{iii}) constrains the magnitude of the acceleration, minimizing non-adiabatic transitions in the inertial frame. In contrast to adiabatic conditions, the slope of $\theta$ during the protocol does not need to be small. This property enables, in principle, finding faster-than adiabatic solutions. The derivation of these conditions is given below.

To simplify the equations, we present the derivation in the limit of large detuning, although the result holds in   general~\cite{dann2021inertial}.  
In this limit, the excited-state dynamics can be eliminated and the evolution in the ground-state manifold is  governed by  the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\Omega_2^2 - \Omega_1^2}{2\Delta} & \frac{\Omega_2 \Omega_1}{\Delta}  \\
\frac{\Omega_2 \Omega_1}{\Delta} & \frac{\Omega_1^2 - \Omega_2^2}{2\Delta} \end{array} \right).
\label{eq:STIRAP-H-2level}
\end{equation}
(see Appendix A.)
Substituting~\eqref{sinusoidal} into~\eqref{STIRAP-H-2level}, one can  rewrite the Hamiltonian in the form
\begin{equation}
H = \tfrac{\Omega^2}{2\Delta}
\left(\cos2\theta\sigma_z + \sin2\theta\sigma_x\right).
\end{equation}
Seeking an inertial solution, we transform the Hamiltonian to the eigenvector basis and find 
\begin{gather}
\tilde{H} = \tfrac{\Omega^2}{2\Delta}
\left(\sigma_z - \tfrac{\chi}{2}\sigma_y\right) = f(t)\mat{M}(\chi)\quad,\quad
\chi \equiv  \tfrac{\Delta \dot{\theta}}{\Omega^2}
\label{eq:inertial-H}
\end{gather}
with dot denoting a time derivative (see  appendix B). 
The inertial protocol succeeds provided that   $\mat{M}(\chi)$ varies  slowly     [condition ($iii$)] and that  the eigenstates of $\mat{M}(\chi)$ and $H$ coincide  at the beginning and end of the protocol [condition (\emph{ii}), because given this condition, both matrices are diagonal]. 
We considered Hamiltonian dynamics, but the same conditions apply to   open systems (proven using   Liouville space formalism presented in~\cite{dann2021inertial}).

In \figref{Fig1}(c),  we compare three analytic pulse shapes:  Gaussian  (solid green), squared sinusoidal  (dashed blue), and  ``inertial'' (dash-dot red),   with $\theta(t)$ satisfying  conditions (\emph{i})--(\emph{iii}) above. The pulses are defined as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
\mathrm{Gaussian}:\hspace{0.05in}
\Omega_{1,2}(t) = A e^{-(t -  t_i)^2/\sigma^2} \\
\mathrm{SinSQ}:
\hspace{0.05in}
\Omega_{1,2}(t) = A\sin^2[\pi(t-t_i)/2\tau]\\
\mathrm{Inertial}:\hspace{0.05in}
\mathrm{Use}\hspace{0.05in}\mathrm{Eq.}\hspace{0.05in}(6)
\hspace{0.05in}
\mathrm{with}\hspace{0.05in}
\theta(t) = \sum_{i = 0}^3C_it^i.
\label{eq:pulse-shapes}
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
The Gaussian width is  $\sigma = {t_f}/{2}$ and the peaks of the pulses are separated by $t_f$. The squared-sine pulse parameter is $\tau =t_f$, and the inertial  coefficients are: $C_0=C_1 =0 ,C_2 = (\pi/2-C_3t_f^3)/tf^2$ and $C_3 = -\pi/t_f^3$.
In \figref{Fig1}(d), we compare their infidelity as a function of protocol duration. 
The infidelity, $1 - \mbox{Tr}{\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho_f}\rho_t\sqrt{\rho_f}}}$, is defined in terms of the overlap between the desired target, $\rho_t$, and  final state, $\rho_f$. The infidelity of the protocols  decreases upon increasing protocol duration. Small oscillations in the infidelity are observed in all three plots. These arise from non-adiabatic transitions that can be controlled by using  mask functions that smooth the derivatives of the pulses, as explained in~\cite{laine1996adiabatic}. We find that the inertial protocol outperforms the other protocols.  We improve these results further with optimization (red triangles).  To this end, we perform an  iterative  algorithm, where we update the control fields in each step so that the target state is approached  while minimizing non-adiabatic and non-inertial transitions. 


\section{Optimal control  with  adiabatic inertial constraints}
We construct a functional $\mathcal{J}$, whose minimal solution is an optimal inertial STIRAP solution.  
Consider  the  functional
\begin{gather}
\Scale[1]{\mathcal{J}(\rho,\Omega) = \mathrm{Tr}\{\rho_t \rho_f\} - 
\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt \mathrm{Tr}\{
\xi(t)\left[\tfrac{d}{dt}-\hat{\mathcal{L}}
\right]\rho(t)\}}\nonumber\\
\Scale[1]{
+\lambda_1 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\Omega(t)|^2+
\lambda_2 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\dot{\Omega}(t)|^2+
\lambda_3 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\ddot{\Omega}(t)|^2}
\end{gather}
The quantum state is represented by a density matrix, $\rho$, and we use the symbol $\Omega$ to represent control fields (e.g., $\Omega_{1,2}$ in STIRAP).
The first term  is maximized when the system reaches the target state; that is, when $\rho_f=\rho_t $. The second  enforces  solutions to satisfy the Lindblad equation, $\dot{\rho}=\hat{\mathcal{L}}\rho$, where  $\hat{\mathcal{L}}$ is the Lindbladian operator,  $\xi$  is the associated  Lagrange multiplier. The third  term restricts the amount of power in the control pulses. We include the  last two terms to restrict the time-averaged velocity and acceleration (in STIRAP, $\dot{\theta}$ and $\ddot{\theta}$ respectively). 
We use  Krotov’s method to optimize $\mathcal{J}$ \cite{krotov1983iterative,bartana1997laser,tannor1992control,krotov1988technique,krotov1995global,konnov1999global}, modified   to include adiabatic and  inertiality constraints. The algorithm starts from an initial guess for the controls, $\Omega$, solves the  equations of motion for $\rho$ and $\xi$, and   updates the guess, $\Omega\rightarrow\Omega+\Delta\Omega$, to decrease  $\Delta\mathcal{J}$ in each iteration. 
The equations of motion for $\rho$ and $\xi$  are the Lindblad equation and its conjugate. The update equation for $\Omega$ (required to  decrease $\mathcal{J}$)  is
\begin{gather}
\Scale[0.95]{
2\lambda_1\Delta\Omega_R - 2\lambda_2\Delta\ddot{\Omega}_R + 2\lambda_3\Delta\ddddot{\Omega}_R = \mathrm{Tr}\{\xi^k \tfrac{\partial\Delta\hat{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial\Delta\Omega_R}\rho^{k+1}\}}
\nonumber\\
\Scale[0.95]{
2\lambda_1\Delta\Omega_I - 2\lambda_2\Delta\ddot{\Omega}_I + 2\lambda_3\Delta\ddddot{\Omega}_I = \mathrm{Tr}\{\xi^k \tfrac{\partial\Delta\hat{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial\Delta\Omega_I}\rho^{k+1}\}.}
\label{eq:updates}
\end{gather}
Here $\Delta\Omega_R$ and $\Delta\Omega_I$  are the update rules of the real and imaginary parts of each control field in the $k+1$ iteration. The second and third terms on the left-hand side of~\eqref{updates} arise due to inertial and adiabatic constraints. These correspond to second- and fourth-order temporal derivatives.  
A complete derivation of the update equations is given in Appendix C, along with an alternative approach to impose the constraints (by maximizing the state projection onto the adiabatic or inertial subspaces). 

We use~\eqref{updates} to find an optimal  solution. Its fidelity is compared  with unoptimized protocols in~\figref{Fig1}(d) and their robustness is shown in \figref{Fig2}(a), demonstrating that the optimal protocol is  highly robust with respect to variations in the single-photon detuning, $\Delta$. \figrefbegin{Fig2}(b)   shows that when increasing the weight of the inertial constraint relative to the adiabatic constraint (e.g., taking $\lambda_3/\lambda_2 = 10$),  one obtains a 2dB reduction in pulse energy for the same protocol duration.  Having found optimal inertial and adiabatic solutions, we use those solutions to perform high-fidelity  quantum logic gates.

\section{Geometric quantum logic  gates.} 
Adiabatic protocols have many applications in quantum information science. An important class of  protocols involves cyclic evolution (which starts and ends with the same Hamiltonian) under which a qubit’s state acquires a geometric phase that depends only on its path in the Hilbert space~\cite{kato1950adiabatic}. While non-degenerate Hamiltonians are associated with scalar (abelian) phases, degeneracy gives rise to matrix (non-abelian) phases~\cite{zanardi1999holonomic}. When including both abelian and non-abelian ``holonomic'' operations, it is possible to realize a universal set of  gates that are robust against certain types of errors~\cite{saffman2009efficient,rao2013dark,rao2014deterministic,petrosyan2017high,khazali2020fast}. A protocol for holonomic quantum logic gates was proposed in~\cite{moller2007geometric}, where the qubit state acquires geometric phases by driving transitions out and back into the qubit subspace. Such transitions  can be driven  using STIRAP. In this section, we apply our optimized  pulses to implement these gates. 

Let us  review the principle of operation of the   gates.  Consider the tripod-level scheme shown in  \figref{Fig3}(a).  The qubit state is encoded in the levels $\KET{0}$ and $\KET{1}$. To implement a phase gate, one uses two fields, $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$,  to transfer population from $\KET{1}$ to the auxiliary level $\KET{2}$ and back into $\KET{1}$,  using two   STIRAP steps, as shown in the right inset.  A phase gate is implemented by shifting the phase of $\Omega_2$ in the second STIRAP step, which leads to an accumulated phase of the  dark state.  
To implement a Hadamard gate [\figref{Fig3}(b)], one needs a third field, $\Omega_0$. The three fields, $\Omega_{0,1,2}$, are applied following the protocol in the right inset. 
In this case, the dark  state is a  combination of  $\KET{0}$ and $\KET{1}$, whose weights are determined by the  ratio of $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega_1$. During the protocol, a phase is acquired by the dark state, which   translates  into a rotation in the qubit basis \cite{moller2007geometric,toyoda2013realization}. Finally, a  controlled-phase gate is achieved using Rydberg interaction between  excited states [\figref{Fig3}(c)]. This gate operates in a regime of a weak Rydberg interaction compared to the Rabi frequencies, $V_R\ll\Omega_{1},\Omega_{2}$. In this limit, when two atoms occupy the excited  state, their interaction produces an energy shift and  the wavefunction acquires a phase proportional to  $V_R$.  A controlled phase gate is implemented by applying two STIRAP steps (right inset) and tuning the time delay between  the pulses such  that  the $\KET{11}$ component of the wavefunction acquires a phase of $\pi$. 


We simulated  these protocols  using the three pulse shapes from~\figref{Fig1}.  For each protocol, we reconstructed the simulated gate, $\rho\rightarrow \hat{G}(\rho)$, with process tomography (appendix E), which  provides the Kraus operators, $G_k$, that can be used to write   $\hat{\mathcal{G}}$ as:~\cite{nielsen2002quantum}
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathcal{G}}(\rho) = \sum_k G_k\rho G_k^\dagger.
\end{equation}
Using this expansion, we computed the average gate fidelity, $\mathcal{F}$, defined as the overlap between the simulated and target gates ($\hat{\mathcal{G}}$ and $U_0$ respectively) averaged   over all possible initial states. For an initial pure state, $\KET{\psi}$, the average gate fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ is given by~\cite{nielsen2002simple,beterov2016simulated,goerz2014robustness,pedersen2007fidelity}:
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{F} \equiv 
\int_{S^{2n-1}} \hspace{-0.2in}dV\,
\BRA{\psi}
U_0^\dagger
\hat{G}(\KET{\psi}\!\BRA{\psi})
U_0\KET{\psi}
=
\nonumber\\
\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\sum_k\left(
\mbox{Tr}(M_kM_k^\dagger)+\left|\mbox{Tr}(M_k)\right|^2
\right),
\end{gather}
where $n$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space (2 for  single-qubit gates  and 4 for 2-qubit gates) and   $M_k \equiv U_0^\dagger G_k$. 

The results are shown in the bottom plots.  For  single-qubit gates, we plot the infidelity as a function of protocol duration, where the limit of large $t_f$ corresponds to the adiabatic limit. For the controlled-phase gate, we plot the infidelity versus Rabi frequency, since $t_f$ is set by requiring that the conditional phase shift  is $\pi$. 
The inertial  protocol approaches $\mathcal{F}=1$ at the fastest rate, as expected based on \figref{Fig1}. Unfortunately, the gate fidelity is much smaller than the  STIRAP fidelity.
%(e.g., we get $10^{-4}$ for the phase gate compared to $10^{-8}$ for STIRAP  for $t_f = 1\mu$s). 
The reason is that  gate fidelities are limited by phase errors, which are  larger than population errors that limit STIRAP \footnote{It  is a consequence of first-order perturbation theory that population errors scale quadratically with  the small parameter while phase errors scale linearly.}.

\section{Experimental realization.} 
We analyze a realization  of our protocol using $^{87}$Rb atoms. 
Two possible choices  of energy levels and transitions from the D2 line are shown  in \figref{Fig4}(a-b).   
In particular, we are  interested in analyzing realistic imperfections, including polarization  and  leakage errors (following the analysis from~\cite{shomroni2014all,rosenblum2016extraction,rosenblum2017analysis,bechler2018passive}). 
For example, consider a single-qubit phase gate implemented using the levels shown in  \figref{Fig4}(a). Ideally, to drive STIRAP transitions from the state $\KET{0_L}$ to $\KET{A}$ and back, we want to apply only two beams: The pulse $\Omega_1$ with  $\sigma_+$ polarization, which drives $\KET{F = 1,m_F = -1}\leftrightarrow\KET{F'=0,m_F = 0}$, and the pulse $\Omega_2$ with  $\sigma_-$ polarization,  which drives  $\KET{F = 1,m_F = 1}\leftrightarrow\KET{F'=0,m_F = 0}$.
However, polarization errors in the second pulse, $\Omega_2$, produce a $\sigma_+$ component that drives the first transition, and  errors in the first pulse drive the second transition. This process reduces the success probability of the protocol. To combat this issue, one can apply  a DC magnetic field to shift the energy levels and tune the frequencies of the control fields to be in resonance with the shifted levels. By off-setting the frequencies of the $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ pulses, the error fields become off resonant and their effect is suppressed.  
Our calculation assumes that the magnetic field is in the weak Zeeman regime.  A more accurate treatment should include nonlinear (Paschen-Back) corrections for fields exceeding   10G \footnote{Field stength of 10G corresponds to the green curve at Rabi frequency $\Omega = 50$MHz.}.
Our simulations demonstrate that the fidelity approaches unity when  increasing the magnetic field [\figref{Fig4}(c)]. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented  inertial protocols for STIRAP and geometric single- and two-qubit  gates. We estimated the fidelity and robustness of our protocols using realistic experimental parameters, taking  account of practical   considerations including polarization impurity, spontaneous emission, and populating leakage (i.e., transitions out of the tripod  system). We used a DC magnetic field to suppress polarization errors. The fidelity could be improved further by introducing  a resonant  optical  cavity to enhance  desired transitions, e.g., using the setup of~\cite{bechler2018passive}. 
In light of the long list of existing ``improved adiabatic protocols,''  our work adds  simple analytic pulse shapes that yield nearly optimal solutions by satisfying the   condition of small acceleration~\cite{dann2021inertial}. Another strength  of our approach is that we consider Lindbladian dynamics  in the optimization process, so the various decay channels with their respective branching ratios affect the optimal solution. Indeed, we find in some cases optimal  pulses with two humps, as opposed to standard quasi-Gaussian pulses. A downside of our approach is that our protocols are not robust to perturbations in the   geometric phase acquired during the protocol, but are rather determined by it.  It would be intriguing to optimize  adiabatic protocols 
that  are topologically robust to errors (such as~\cite{kitaev2010topological,lahtinen2017short}) in future work.   Finally, we note that  the presented inertial solutions are  also adiabatic in the sense that the control fields do not vary rapidly in comparison to the energy gap. The reason is that
when considering protocols that satisfy the   conditions of \eqref{inertial-conditions},  strong violations of adiabaticity imply  violations of inertiality.   We hypothesize that  inertial non-adiabatic solutions exist in other cases.  To conclude, due to immense   recent  progress in  quantum computation research  and the ability to prepare and manipulate large  registers of  atomic qubits~\cite{barredo2016atom,bernien2017probing,henriet2020quantum},  our protocols are directly  applicable and could be used to improve  gate fidelities in these platforms. 



 
 %In this paper we developed a rapid and robust  protocol for STIRAP and STIRAP-based quantum logic gates, using inertial solutions and quantum optimal control. We have analyzed the theoretical performance of our proposed protocol and performed simulations for a realistic model system. Our calculations demonstrate the superiority of the inertial protocol over traditional pulse shapes in the long-time limit in all studied examples. Although we reach population transfer infidelities of $10^{-8}$ under realistic time and energy constraints, geometric quantum logic gates suffer from phase errors and reach high (although not as high) fidelities of $10^{-4}$. We overcome  practical challenges of polarization impurity and spurious transitions with standard tools of Zeeman shifts and tunable  cavity enhancement, as proposed and implemented in [x].

\section*{A. Effective 2-level Hamiltonian for STIRAP}
In this appendix, we present a Derivation  of Eq.~(6)
from the main text. 
Consider the  Hamiltonian of a 3-level system from driven by two optical  fields (as shown in Fig.~2):
\begin{equation}
H = \Omega_1\KET{1}\!\BRA{3} + \Omega_2\KET{1}\!\BRA{2} + h.c. +
\Delta\KET{3}\!\BRA{3}.
\end{equation}
Let us express the wavefunction as
\begin{equation}
\KET{\psi} = c_1\KET{1}+c_2\KET{2}+c_3\KET{3}.
\end{equation}
We  substitute this expansion  into the  Schr\"{o}dinger equation $i\hbar\tfrac{d\KET{\psi}}{dt} = H\KET{\psi}$, to obtain the  equations of motion for the coefficients:
\begin{gather}
i\hbar\dot{c}_1 = \Omega_1c_3\nonumber\\
i\hbar\dot{c}_2 = \Omega_2c_3\nonumber\\
i\hbar\dot{c}_3 = \Omega_1^*c_1+\Omega_2^*c_2+\Delta c_3.
\label{eq:emo}
\end{gather}
In the limit of large detuning, $\Delta\gg\Omega_1,\Omega_2$, on can adiabatically eliminate the dynamics of the third level, setting $\dot{c}_3 = 0$. This assumption yields the relation
\begin{equation}
c_3 = -\tfrac{\Omega_1^*}{\Delta}c_1 - \tfrac{\Omega_2^*}{\Delta}c_2.
\label{eq:elimination}
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{elimination} into \eqref{emo}, we obtain
\begin{gather}
i\hbar\dot{c}_1 = -\tfrac{|\Omega_1|^2}{\Delta}c_1 -
\tfrac{\Omega_1\Omega_2^*}{\Delta}c_2\nonumber\\
i\hbar\dot{c}_2 = -\tfrac{|\Omega_2|^2}{\Delta}c_2 -
\tfrac{\Omega_2\Omega_1^*}{\Delta}c_1
\end{gather}
The dynamics is described by the effective Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{|\Omega_1|^2}{2\Delta} & \frac{\Omega_2^*\Omega_1}{\Delta}  \\
\frac{\Omega_2\Omega_1^*}{\Delta} & \frac{|\Omega_2|^2}{2\Delta} \end{array} \right).
\label{eq:H-before-subtract}
\end{equation}
By subtracting a  constant-diagonal matrix, $\tfrac{|\Omega_1|^1-|\Omega_2|^2}{2\Delta}\cdot\mathcal{I}$, from \eqref{H-before-subtract} one obtains Eq.~(6). Subtracting a constant  diagonal matrix only shifts the energy spectrum by a constant, symmetrizing it around zero, without affecting the dynamics otherwise.


\section*{B. Inertial STIRAP Hamiltonian}
In this section, we  derive   Eq.~(9) from the main text. 
We choose the parameterization
\begin{equation}
\Omega_1 = \Omega\sin\theta \quad,\quad
\Omega_2 = \Omega\cos\theta.
\end{equation}
The 2-level Hamiltonian [Eq.~(6) from the main text] becomes
\begin{equation}
H = \tfrac{\Omega^2}{2\Delta}
\left(
\cos2\theta\sigma_z + \sin2\theta\sigma_x\right)
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are Pauli matrices. 
We obtain an explicit expression for the inertial-frame Hamiltonian defined as 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{H}\equiv
P^\dagger H P - i\hbar P^\dagger \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
The eigenvalues are $\pm\Omega$. The eigenvector matrix is
\begin{equation}
P = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\cot2\theta+\csc2\theta}{\sqrt{\cot{\theta}^2+1}} & \frac{\cot2\theta-\csc2\theta}{\sqrt{\tan{\theta}^2+1}}  \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\cot{\theta}^2+1}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tan{\theta}^2+1}} \end{array} \right).
\end{equation}
For $0<\theta<\pi$, we find
\[
P^\dagger\frac{dP}{d\theta} = 
\tfrac{\dot{\theta}}{2}
\left( \begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1  \\
1 & 0 \end{array} \right).
\]
This completes the proof of Eq.~(9) in the main text.


One finds a striking similarity between the inertial-frame Hamiltonian, Eq.~(9), and the Hamiltonian one obtains when adding counter-diabatic terms to the lab-frame Hamiltonian realizing the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol (see Eqs.~(4-5) in the Methods section of~\cite{du2016experimental}). 
The similarity is  expected, since the inner product of the instantaneous eigenvectors and their derivatives appear in both formulations. 
However, there is a conceptual difference which is important to point out. 
In shortcut-to-adiabaticity, one constructs a Hamiltonian, which may be challenging to realize, but whose eigenstates are exact solutions to the dynamics. In contrast, in our approach, the lab-frame Hamiltonian is straightforward, and the instantaneous eigenstates of the inertial-frame solutions are only approximations to the true dynamics.




\section*{C. Adiabatic and inertial constraints in QOCT}
In this section, we generalize Krotov's QOCT  algorithm  to include inertial and adiabatic constrains. We present to approaches: 
in the first, we add a penalty for the time averaged velocity and acceleration, while in the second, we penalize instantaneous population in non-adiabatic and non-inertial states. We follow the derivation of~\cite{bartana1997laser} with appropriate modifications to our problem. 

\subsection*{C1. Introducing penalty terms for the  time-averaged velocity and acceleration}

Let us consider the following functional to be minimized:
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{J} = \mathrm{Tr}\{\rho_t \rho_f\} - 
\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt \mathrm{Tr}\{
\xi(t)\left[\tfrac{d}{dt}-\hat{\mathcal{L}}
\right]\rho(t)\}\nonumber\\
+\lambda_1 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\Omega(t)|^2+
\lambda_2 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\dot{\Omega}(t)|^2+
\lambda_3 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\ddot{\Omega}(t)|^2
\label{eq:J-appendix}
\end{gather}
where the two last terms correspond to the integrated velocity and acceleration. Using integration by parts, one can rewrite  the first line of \eqref{J-appendix} as:
\begin{gather}
\mathrm{Tr}
\left\{\rho_t \rho_f - 
(\xi\,\rho)|_0^{t_f}+
\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt \left[
\rho\tfrac{d\xi}{dt}+
\xi\hat{\mathcal{L}}\rho\right]\right\}.
\label{eq:integration-by-parts}
\end{gather}
Krotov's algorithm starts with an initial guess from the control fields, evolves $\rho$ and $\xi$ and finds an updated control pulse that decreases $\mathcal{J}$. By iteratively updating the control pulse, convergence is reached.   Let us  compute the change in $\mathcal{J}$  between   iteration $k$ and $k+1$ in terms of the change in $\rho$. Using the definitions
\begin{gather}
\Delta\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{J}^{(k+1)}-\mathcal{J}^{(k)}\quad,\quad
\Delta\rho=\rho^{(k+1)}-\rho^{(k)},
\end{gather}
 we obtain:
 \begin{gather}
\Delta\mathcal{J} = \mathrm{Tr}
\left\{\rho_t \Delta\rho - 
\xi^k\,\Delta\rho]|_0^{t_f}\right\}+\nonumber\\
\mathrm{Tr}
\left\{\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt \left[
\Delta\rho\tfrac{d\xi}{dt}+
\xi^k\hat{\mathcal{L}}\Delta\rho+
\xi^k\Delta\hat{\mathcal{L}}\rho^{(k+1)}\right]\right\}+\nonumber\\
-\int_0^{t_f}
\left\{2\lambda_1\mathrm{Re}[\varepsilon^k\Delta\varepsilon^*]+\lambda_1[\Delta\varepsilon_R^2+\Delta\varepsilon_I^2]\right\}+\nonumber\\
-\int_0^{t_f}
\left\{2\lambda_2\mathrm{Re}[\dot{\varepsilon}^k\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}^*]+\lambda_2[\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_R^2+\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_I^2]\right\}+\nonumber\\
-\int_0^{t_f}
\left\{2\lambda_3\mathrm{Re}[\ddot{\varepsilon}^k\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}^*]+\lambda_3[\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R^2+\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_I^2]
\right\}.
\end{gather}
The first 4 terms do not depend on the field	increment and produce the dynamical equations for $\rho$ and $\xi$. The additional terms produce the differential: $\Delta\mathcal{J}_1+
\Delta\mathcal{J}_2+\Delta\mathcal{J}_3+\Delta\mathcal{J}_4$ where
\begin{gather}
\Delta\mathcal{J}_1 = 
\mathrm{Tr}
\left\{\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt 
\xi^k\Delta\hat{\mathcal{L}}\rho^{(k+1)}\right\}
\nonumber\\
\Delta\mathcal{J}_2 =  
-2\mathrm{Re}\left[\int_0^{t_f}
\lambda_1\varepsilon^k\Delta\varepsilon^*
+\lambda_2\dot{\varepsilon}^k\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}^*
+\lambda_3\ddot{\varepsilon}^k\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}^*\right]\nonumber\\
\Delta\mathcal{J}_3 =  
-\int_0^{t_f}\!
\lambda_1\Delta{\varepsilon}_R^2+\!
\lambda_2\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_R^2+\!
\lambda_3\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R^2\nonumber\\
\Delta\mathcal{J}_4 =  
-\int_0^{t_f}\!
\lambda_1\Delta{\varepsilon}_I^2+\!
\lambda_2\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_I^2+\!
\lambda_3\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_I^2.
\end{gather}
The term $\Delta\mathcal{J}_2$ vanishes on average since the integrand is rapidly oscillating. The complete differential of the third term is
\begin{gather}
d(\Delta\mathcal{J}_3) = \int_0^{t_f} df(\Delta\varepsilon_R,\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_R,\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R)dt = \nonumber\\
\int_0^{t_f}
\left[\tfrac{df}{d\Delta\varepsilon_R}\Delta\varepsilon_R+
\tfrac{df}{d\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_R}\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_R+
\tfrac{df}{d\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R}\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R\right]dt \nonumber\\
\int_0^{t_f}
\left[
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial\Delta\varepsilon_R} -
\tfrac{d}{dt}\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial\Delta\dot{\varepsilon}_R} + 
\tfrac{d^2}{dt^2}\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R}
\right]\Delta\varepsilon_R\,dt +\mbox{surface terms}\nonumber\\
2\int_0^{t_f}(-\lambda_1\Delta\varepsilon_R+\lambda_2\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R-\lambda_3\Delta\!\ddddot{\varepsilon}\!\!\!_R)+\mbox{surface terms}
\end{gather}
The surface terms vanish since the field update at the start and end point is zero, $\Delta\varepsilon_R(0)= \Delta\varepsilon_R(t_f) = 0$. Using this result (and repeating the same procedure for $\Delta\mathcal{J}_4$), we find update equations:
\begin{gather}
-\lambda_1\Delta\varepsilon_R+\lambda_2\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_R-\lambda_3\Delta\!\ddddot{\varepsilon}\!\!\!_R = \tfrac{1}{2}\mbox{Tr}
[\xi^{k}\tfrac{\partial\Delta\hat{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial\Delta\varepsilon_R}
\rho^{k+1}]\equiv F(t)\nonumber\\
-\lambda_1\Delta\varepsilon_I+\lambda_2\Delta\ddot{\varepsilon}_I-\lambda_3\Delta\!\ddddot{\varepsilon}\!\!\!_I = \tfrac{1}{2}\mbox{Tr}[
\xi^{k}\tfrac{\partial\Delta\hat{\mathcal{L}}}{\partial\Delta\varepsilon_I}
\rho^{k+1}]\equiv G(t)
\end{gather}
These equations are easily solved by discretizing  time and rewriting the equation in matrix form (the second-order time derivatives becomes the tridiagonal Hessian matrix and the fourth-order time derivatives is a 5-diagonal matrix).
We obtain equations of the form
\begin{gather}    \mat{M}_1\Delta\varepsilon_R = \mat{F}\nonumber\\
    \mat{M}_2\Delta\varepsilon_I = \mat{G}
\end{gather}
The update rules for the control fields are found by inverting $\mat{M}_1$ and $\mat{M}_2$.

\subsection*{C2. Maximize projection onto desired subspace}


In this section, we present an alternative approach for optimization. We used both protocols in our simulations, choosing the protocol with the fastest convergence by trial and error.  In this case, we impose adiabatic and inertial constraints by maximizing  the projections onto adiabatic or inertial eigenstates. Denoting the projection operator by $P$ (e.g., $P = \KET{D}\BRA{D}$ for adiabatic protocols), we penalize undesired transitions by introducing the last term in  the functional
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{J} = \mathrm{Tr}\,\{\rho_t \rho_f\} - 
\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt \mathrm{Tr}\{
\xi(t)\left[\tfrac{d}{dt}-\hat{\mathcal{L}}
\right]\rho(t)\}\nonumber\\
+\lambda_1 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt|\Omega(t)|^2-
\lambda_2 \int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt\, \mbox{Tr}\,(P\rho)(P\rho)^\dagger
\label{eq:project-constraint}
\end{gather}
For convenience,  we rewrite the integrand of the last term in the form
\begin{gather}
\mbox{Tr}\,(P\rho)(P\rho)^\dagger = 
\mbox{Tr}\,(P\rho)(\rho P) = 
\mbox{Tr}\,\rho P \rho.
\label{eq:J-projection-constraint}
\end{gather} 
To derive optimization equations, we compute the full  differential of $\mathcal{J}$ with respect to $\delta\rho, \delta\xi$ and $\Omega$. The new constraint modifies only  terms related to  $\delta\rho$. Specifically, taking the differential of \eqref{J-projection-constraint} with respect to $\delta\rho$, we obtain
$\mbox{Tr}\,(2P\rho)\delta\rho$.
Revisiting all terms in \eqref{project-constraint}, one can see that the second term also contributed to $\delta\rho$. After integration by parts, from the integral term in \eqref{integration-by-parts}, we have 
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{J}}{\partial\rho}\delta\rho = 
\mathrm{Tr}
\int_0^{t_f}\!\! dt \left[
\tfrac{d\xi}{dt}+
\xi\hat{\mathcal{L}} +  2 \lambda_2P \rho \right]\delta \rho
\end{gather}
We obtain a modified equation of motion  for the Lagrange multiplier
\begin{gather}
\tfrac{d\xi}{dt}+
\hat{\mathcal{L}}^\dagger\xi +  2 \lambda_2P \rho  = 0
\end{gather}
The equation of motion of $\rho$ and the update equation for the field are unaltered by the projection constraint. We obtain an equation of the Lindblad form with an inhomogeneous source term, which we can solve by standard numerical methods. 





 

\section*{D. Quantum gate tomography} 
Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a method by which a quantum gate is reconstructed from simulated data (experimental or numerical).  In this work, we use QPT to quantify the overlap between our simulated and target gates. In this appendix, we review the method presented in \cite{nielsen2002quantum}.


Suppose that  a density matrix $\rho$ evolves under our simulation  into $\mathcal{G}(\rho)$. The goal of QPT is to determine  $\mathcal{G}$.  
Given a  complete  basis of matrices, $\tilde{E}_m$,  that spans the operator  space (i.e., the Liouville space),  any unitary $\mathcal{G}$ can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{G}(\rho)=\sum_{m,n} \chi_{mn}\tilde{E}_m\rho \tilde{E}_n^\dagger,
\end{equation}
where $\chi_{mn}$ are coefficients that we wish to find.  For single-qubit gates,  the set $\tilde{E_m}$ contains four  $2\times2$ matrices ($m=1,...,4$) and $\chi_{mn}$ is a $4\times4$ matrix. Let us choose the Pauli and identity matrices as basis operators:
\begin{gather}
\tilde{E}_1 = I\quad,\quad
\tilde{E}_2 = \sigma_x\quad,\quad
\tilde{E}_3 = -i\sigma_y\quad,\quad
\tilde{E}_4 = \sigma_z.
\label{eq:Pauli-basis}
\end{gather}
To determine $\chi$, we run our simulations on 4 initial states 
\begin{gather}
\rho_1 = \KET{0}\!\BRA{0}\hspace{0.05in},\hspace{0.05in}
\rho_2 = \rho_1\sigma_x \hspace{0.05in},\hspace{0.05in}
\rho_3 = \sigma_x\rho_1\hspace{0.05in},\hspace{0.05in}
\rho_4 = \sigma_x\rho_1\sigma_x.
\end{gather}
We compute the final state for every  input: $\rho_i'\equiv\mathcal{E}(\rho_i)$. Then, 
following \cite{nielsen2002quantum}, $\chi$ is given by   
\begin{equation}
\chi = 
\frac{1}{4} \begin{pmatrix}
I & \sigma_x\\
\sigma_x & I
 \end{pmatrix}
 \begin{pmatrix}
\rho_1' & \rho_2' \\
\rho_3' & \rho_4'
 \end{pmatrix}
 \begin{pmatrix}
I & \sigma_x\\
\sigma_x & I
 \end{pmatrix}.
 \label{eq:chi-single-qubit}
\end{equation}
where $I, \sigma_x, \rho'_{1},...,\rho'_{4} \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times2}$  and $\chi \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times4}$.

 





For two-qubit gates, 
we write
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{G}(\rho)=\sum_{m,n} \chi_{mn}\tilde{E}_m^{(2)}\rho (\tilde{E}_n^{(2)})^\dagger
\end{equation}
in terms of two-qubit operators, $\tilde{E}_m^{(2)}\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times4}$, defined as 
Kronecker products of the single-qubit  basis operators, $\tilde{E}_m$, from \eqref{Pauli-basis}.
 The matrix $\chi\in\mathbb{R}^{16\times16}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\chi=\Lambda\,\Bar{\rho}\,
\Lambda, 
 \label{eq:chi-two-qubit}
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda\in\mathbb{R}^{16\times16}$ is a rotation matrix
\begin{align}
\Lambda\equiv
\frac{1}{4}\left[
\begin{pmatrix}
I & \sigma_x\\
\sigma_x & I
\end{pmatrix}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}
I & \sigma_x\\
\sigma_x & I
 \end{pmatrix}\right]
\end{align}
and $\Bar{\rho}\in\mathbb{R}^{16\times16}$ is defined as
\begin{align}
\Bar{\rho}=P^T \rho' P. 
\end{align}
Here, $\rho'\in\mathbb{R}^{16\times16}$
the matrix of final states 
\begin{align}
\rho' = \mathcal{G}(\rho),
\end{align}
found by propagating  16 input  states 
\begin{align}
\rho_{mn} = T_n\KET{00}\BRA{00}T_m\quad
\forall n,m =1,...,4
\end{align}
with 
\begin{gather}
T_1=I\otimes I \quad,\quad
T_2=I\otimes\sigma_x\nonumber\\
T_3=\sigma_x\otimes I  \quad,\quad
T_4=\sigma_x\otimes \sigma_x.
\end{gather}
The permutation matrix $P$ is given by 
\begin{align}
P = I\otimes\ 
 \left[  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0& 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0&1 &0 \\
    0& 1 &0 &0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
 \otimes I  \right].
 \end{align}
 Note that $I\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}$ and, hence, $P\in\mathbb{R}^{16\times16}$.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}
Here we propose a neural \ac{ls} method as a means of coupling convolutional \ac{nn}s and the unfitted \ac{ls} method. The neural parameterization provides more regular geometries and similar, in some cases better, performance compared to the well-known SIMP method of \ac{to} and the pixel-based counterpart \ac{ls} method.
The neural parameterization learns features at multiple scales during the optimization allowing for the emergence of regular structures whilst maintaining performance. 
The method takes longer to converge than the SIMP method and may not be suitable for simple problems such as those in linear elasticity. In this case, the network can be used in conjunction with the SIMP method. In contrast to SIMP, however, the method extends naturally to interface multiphysics problems and is more suitable in the general case. 
It should be noted that in our approach, the expressivity of geometries for the neural parameterization is the same as pixel counterpart methods since we use the same space $V_h^1$ in all cases to describe the geometry. A direction for development in the future would be to relax this constraint and also allow for the \ac{nn} to control the space in which it expresses itself, potentially allowing for more efficient expressions of better topologies. Further investigation into architecture design and optimization strategy may also lead to a greater and more general improvement in performance.

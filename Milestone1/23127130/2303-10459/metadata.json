    "abstract": "Current portable memory device relies heavily on flash memory technology for its implementation. New generation of non-volatile memory is likely to replace floating gates, charge-trapping memory currently still suffering from inadequate retention performance and slow programming speeds as well as small memory window. In contrast, the use of HfO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ stacked high-k materials has substantially increased the memory window of memory devices, with a 63% increase relative to pure HfO$_2$ materials. The current goal of up to 80% retention characteristics over a ten-year period has been achieved by adjusting the deposition ratio or dopant material. Process conditions can continue to be investigated in the future to reduce charge loss while maintaining the increased memory window.",

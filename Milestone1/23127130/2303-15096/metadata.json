    "abstract": "This paper concerns the structural stability of subsonic flows with a contact discontinuity in a two-dimensional finitely long slightly curved nozzle. We establish the existence and uniqueness of subsonic flows with a contact discontinuity by prescribing the entropy function, the Bernoulli quantity and the horizontal mass flux distribution at the entrance and the flow angle at the exit. The problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem for the hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system. To deal with the free boundary value problem, the Lagrangian transformation is employed to straighten the contact discontinuity. The Euler system is reduced to a nonlinear second-order equation for the stream function. Inspired by \\cite{CXZ22}, we use the implicit function theorem to locate the contact discontinuity. We also need to develop an iteration scheme to solve a nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem with nonlinear boundary conditions in a weighted Hölder space.",

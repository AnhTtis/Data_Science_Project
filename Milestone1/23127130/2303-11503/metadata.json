    "abstract": "Ahanjideh, Akbari, Fakharan and Trevisan proposed a conjecture %in \\cite{AhMS} on the distribution of the Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs: for any connected graph of order $n$ with diameter $d\\ge 2$ that is not a path, the number of Laplacian eigenvalues in the interval $[n-d+2,n]$ is at most $n-d$. We show that the conjecture is true and provide a family of graphs to show that the bound is best possible. This establishes an interesting relation between the spectral and classical parameters.",

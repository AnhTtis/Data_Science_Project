    "abstract": "Dynamical compensation (DC) provides robustness to parameter fluctuations. As an example, DC enable control of the functional mass of endocrine or neuronal tissue essential for controlling blood glucose by insulin through a nonlinear feedback loop. Researchers have shown that DC is related to structural unidentifiability and $\\mathbb{P}$-invariance property, and $\\mathbb{P}$-invariance property is a sufficient and necessary condition for the DC property. In this article, we discuss DC and $\\mathbb{P}$-invariancy from an adaptive control perspective. An adaptive controller is a self-tuning controller used to compensate for changes in a dynamical system. To design an adaptive controller with the DC property, it is easier to start with a two-dimensional dynamical model. We introduce a simplified system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the DC property and extend it to a general form. The value of the ideal adaptive control lies in developing methods to synthesize DC to variations in multiple parameters. Then we investigate the stability of the system with time-varying input and disturbance signals, with a focus on the system's $\\mathbb{P}$-invariance properties. This study provides phase portraits and step-like response graphs to visualize the system's behavior and stability properties.",

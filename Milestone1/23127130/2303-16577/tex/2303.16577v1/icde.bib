abstract = {Database design is critical for high performance in relational databases and many tools exist to aid application designers in selecting an appropriate schema. While the problem of schema optimization is also highly relevant for NoSQL databases, existing tools for relational databases are inadequate for this setting. Application designers wishing to use a NoSQL database instead rely on rules of thumb to select an appropriate schema. We present a system for recommending database schemas for NoSQL applications. Our cost-based approach uses a novel binary integer programming formulation to guide the mapping from the application's conceptual data model to a database schema. We implemented a prototype of this approach for the Cassandra extensible record store. Our prototype, the NoSQL Schema Evaluator (NoSE) is able to capture rules of thumb used by expert designers without explicitly encoding the rules. Automating the design process allows NoSE to produce efficient schemas and to examine more alternatives than would be possible with a manual rule-based approach.},

abstract = {We observe significant overlaps in the computations performed by user jobs in modern shared analytics clusters. Navely computing the same subexpressions multiple times results in wasting cluster resources and longer execution times. Given that these shared clus-ter workloads consist of tens of thousands of jobs, identifying over-lapping computations across jobs is of great interest to both clus-ter operators and users. Nevertheless, existing approaches support orders of magnitude smaller workloads or employ heuristics with limited effectiveness. In this paper, we focus on the problem of subexpression selec-tion for large workloads, i.e., selecting common parts of job plans and materializing them to speed-up the evaluation of subsequent jobs. We provide an ILP-based formulation of our problem and map it to a bipartite graph labeling problem. Then, we introduce BIGSUBS, a vertex-centric graph algorithm to iteratively choose in parallel which subexpressions to materialize and which subex-pressions to use for evaluating each job. We provide a distributed implementation of our approach using our internal SQL-like execu-tion framework, SCOPE, and assess its effectiveness over produc-tion workloads. BIGSUBS supports workloads with tens of thou-sands of jobs, yielding savings of up to 40{\%} in machine-hours. We are currently integrating our techniques with the SCOPE runtime in our production clusters.},

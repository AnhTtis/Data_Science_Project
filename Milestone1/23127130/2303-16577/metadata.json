    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a schema optimization method for time-dependent workloads for NoSQL databases. In our proposed method, we migrate schema according to changing workloads, and the estimated cost of execution and migration are formulated and minimized as a single integer linear programming problem. Furthermore, we propose a method to reduce the number of optimization candidates by iterating over the time dimension abstraction and optimizing the workload while updating constraints.",

    "abstract": "A relativistic Quantum Field Theory framework is devised for Mermin's inequalities. By employing smeared Dirac spinor fields, we are able to introduce unitary operators which create, out of the Minkowski vacuum $\\vert 0 \\rangle$, GHZ-type states. In this way, we are able to obtain a relation between the expectation value of Mermin's operators in the vacuum and in the GHZ-type states. We show that Mermin's inequalities turn out to be maximally violated when evaluated on these states.",

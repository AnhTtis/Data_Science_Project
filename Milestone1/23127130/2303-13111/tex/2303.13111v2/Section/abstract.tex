The advent of Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought substantial advancements in 3D volumetric benchmarks, particularly in 3D medical image segmentation. Concurrently, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks have regained popularity among researchers due to their comparable results to ViT, albeit with the exclusion of the heavy self-attention module. This paper introduces a permutable hybrid network for volumetric medical image segmentation, named PHNet, which exploits the advantages of convolution neural network (CNN) and MLP. PHNet addresses the intrinsic isotropy problem of 3D volumetric data by utilizing both 2D and 3D CNN to extract local information. Besides, we propose an efficient Multi-Layer Permute Perceptron module, named MLPP, which enhances the original MLP by obtaining long-range dependence while retaining positional information. Extensive experimental results validate that PHNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, namely, COVID-19-20 and Synapse. Moreover, the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of PHNet in harnessing the strengths of both CNN and MLP. The code will be accessible to the public upon acceptance.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented a novel permutable hybrid network, referred to as PHNet, designed for the task of volumetric medical image segmentation. 
PHNet integrated 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and MLP to enable the extraction and integration of both local and global features. 
Besides, we introduced a permutable MLP block to address the problem of spatial information loss and to minimize the computational burden. 
Through extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, our proposed PHNet demonstrated its effectiveness and outperformed state-of-the-art approaches by a remarkable margin.
Future work includes extending the proposed framework on versatile medical image analysis tasks, such as classification and disease localization, and systematically investigating the efficiency, effectiveness, and interactions of CNN, Transformer, and MLP.

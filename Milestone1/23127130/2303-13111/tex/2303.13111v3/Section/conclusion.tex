\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduced a novel permutable hybrid network, PHNet, specifically designed for volumetric medical image segmentation. 
By integrating 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and MLP, PHNet effectively captures both local and global features. 
Additionally, we proposed a permutable MLP block to address spatial information loss and alleviate computational burden. 
Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of PHNet over state-of-the-art approaches. Future research will explore extending the framework to other medical image analysis tasks, such as disease diagnosis and  localization, and further examine the interactions and effectiveness of CNN, Transformer, and MLP.

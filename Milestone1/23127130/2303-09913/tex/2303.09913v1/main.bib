    abstract = { Background: Considering current insulin action profiles and the nature of glycemic responses to insulin, there is an acute need for longer term, accurate, blood glucose predictions to inform insulin dosing schedules and enable effective decision support for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, current methods achieve acceptable accuracy only for prediction horizons of up to 1 h, whereas typical postprandial excursions and insulin action profiles last 4–6 h. In this study, we present models for prediction horizons of 60–240 min developed by leveraging “shallow” neural networks, allowing for significantly lower complexity compared with related approaches. Methods: Patient-specific neural network-based predictive models are developed and tested on previously collected data from a cohort of 24 subjects with T1D. Models are designed to avoid serious pitfalls through incorporating essential physiological knowledge into model structure. Patient-specific models were generated to predict glucose 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min ahead, and a “transfer learning” approach to improve accuracy for patients where data are limited. Finally, we determined subgroup characteristics that result in higher model accuracy overall. Results: Root mean squared error was 28 ± 4, 33 ± 4, 38 ± 6, 40 ± 8, and 43 ± 12 mg/dL for 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min, respectively. For all prediction horizons, at least 93\% of predictions were clinically acceptable by the Clarke error grid. Variance of historic continuous glucose monitor (CGM) values was a strong predictor for the need of transfer learning approaches. Conclusions: A shallow neural network, using features extracted from past CGM data and insulin logs, can achieve multi-hour glucose predictions with satisfactory accuracy. Models are patient specific, learnt on readily available data without the need for additional tests, and improve accuracy while lowering complexity compared with related approaches, paving the way for new advisory and closed loop algorithms able to encompass most of the insulin action timeframe. },

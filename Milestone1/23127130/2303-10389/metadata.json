    "abstract": "In this paper, we show that the minimal quantum discord over \"cross-symmetric\" state extensions is an entanglement monotone. In particular, we show that the minimal Bures distance of discord over cross-symmetric extensions is equivalent to the Bures distance of entanglement. At last, we refute a long-held but unstated convention that only contractive distances can be used to construct entanglement monotones by showing that the entanglement quantifier induced by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, which is not contractive under quantum operations, is also an entanglement monotone.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a decentralized passive impedance control scheme for collaborative grasping using under-actuated aerial manipulators (AMs). The AM system is formulated, using a proper coordinate transformation, as an inertially decoupled dynamics with which a passivity-based control design is conducted. Since the interaction for grasping can be interpreted as a feedback interconnection of passive systems, an arbitrary number of AMs can be modularly combined, leading to a decentralized control scheme. Another interesting consequence of the passivity property is that the AMs automatically converge to a certain configuration to accomplish the grasping. Collaborative grasping using 10 AMs is presented in simulation.",

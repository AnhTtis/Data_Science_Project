    "abstract": "We present a lattice-QCD based analysis of the nucleon sigma terms using gauge ensembles with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of ${\\cal O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, with a complete error budget concerning excited-state contaminations, chiral extrapolation as well as finite-size and lattice spacing effects. We compute the sigma terms determined directly from the matrix elements of the scalar currents. For the pion nucleon sigma term, we obtain $σ_{πN} = (43.6\\pm3.8)$ MeV, where the error includes all systematics. The tension with extractions based on dispersion theory persists at the 3-$σ$ level. For the strange sigma term, we obtain a non-zero value, $σ_s=(27.1\\pm9.8)$ MeV.",

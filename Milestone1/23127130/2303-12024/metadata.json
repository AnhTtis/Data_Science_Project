    "abstract": "An open challenge in multimodal conversational AI requires augmenting large language models with information from textual and non-textual sources for multi-turn dialogue. To address this problem, this paper introduces Conversational Tables (cTBL), a three-step encoder-decoder approach to retrieve tabular information and generate dialogue responses grounded on the retrieved information. cTBL uses Transformer encoder embeddings for Dense Table Retrieval and obtains up to 5% relative improvement in Top-1 and Top-3 accuracy over sparse retrieval on the HyrbiDialogue dataset. Additionally, cTBL performs tabular knowledge retrieval using both encoder and decoder models, resulting in up to 46% relative improvement in ROUGE scores and better human evaluation for response generation on HyrbiDialogue.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a unique set of generators for a cyclic code over a finite chain ring has been established. The minimal spanning set and rank of the code have also been determined. Further, sufficient as well as necessary conditions for a cyclic code to be an MDS code and for a cyclic code to be an MHDR code have been obtained. Some examples of optimal cyclic codes have also been presented.",

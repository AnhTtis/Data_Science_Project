    "abstract": "Given a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with smooth boundary $\\partial M$, we give an explicit expression for full symbol of the thermoelastic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $Λ_g$ with variable coefficients $λ,μ,α,β\\in C^{\\infty}(\\bar{M})$. We prove that $Λ_g$ uniquely determines partial derivatives of all orders of the coefficients on the boundary. Moreover, for a nonempty open subset $Γ\\subset\\partial M$, suppose that the manifold and the coefficients are real analytic up to $Γ$, we show that $Λ_g$ uniquely determines the coefficients on the whole manifold $\\bar{M}$.",

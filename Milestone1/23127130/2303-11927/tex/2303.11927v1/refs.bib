    abstract = { This paper develops a theory of the length of food chains in community food webs. The theory derives from a mathematical model of webs called the cascade model. Our analysis concerns the behaviour of chain lengths for webs in which the number, S, of species is large. From an exact formula for the expected number of chains of each length, we derive a theoretical mean and variance of the length of chains in webs with a given S. For webs in which S becomes large, we compute the asymptotic distribution of the length of a randomly chosen chain, giving explicit closed-form formulas for the asymptotic mean and variance. The cascade model implies a simple rule of thumb for large webs: the mean length of chains approximately equals the mean number of predators plus prey of any species in the web. Such a quantitative relation between mean chain length and the number of links per species appears to be new. The height of a web is defined as the length (number of links) in its longest chain. We show that, according to the cascade model, the median height increases very slowly with the number of species in a web. Indeed, the median height is below 17 for S up to one million. This analysis provides the first quantitative explanation, we believe, of why the longest chains are very short relative to the number of species in a web, even when the number of species is very large. As a theoretical curiosity, we show, for webs in which S becomes unrealistically large, that the height equals one of two adjacent integers with a probability that slowly approaches 1. With increasing S, these two integers approximate ln S/ln (In S), and thus grow extremely slowly. }

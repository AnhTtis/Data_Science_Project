abstract = {Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) has been receiving increasing attention recently due to its potential to describe traffic dynamics and guide the design of traffic control schemes at the network level. Perimeter control and route guidance are two main MFD-based traffic control approaches. However, current MFD-based perimeter control seldom considers travelers’ route choice behavior, while MFD-based route guidance studies usually assume directly that travelers would follow the guidance and neglect the effects of traffic control. This paper aims to integrate the MFD-based perimeter control (i.e., the behavior of a system manager) and the dynamic user equilibrium based route choice behavior (i.e., the behavior of travelers) into one rigorous mathematical framework. Given a traffic network that has been divided into multiple homogeneous regions, we use MFD to describe the dynamics of each region, and use point queue model to capture the dynamics of queues formed at the boundaries. Besides, we model travelers' route choice behavior by the instantaneous dynamic user equilibrium (IDUE) principle, and design an efficient range perimeter control method from the system perspective. We model the interactions between the system manager and the travelers as a non-zero sum, non-cooperative differential game, where the system manager aims to improve the system performance while travelers try to minimize their own travel times. Meanwhile, they share the common constraints (i.e., MFD dynamics and point queue dynamics at boundaries). Mathematically, this leads to a differential complementarity system (DCS). We propose a time-stepping approach to discretize and solve the DCS model, based on which the solution existence and convergence are also established. Numerical results show that the proposed method can limit the vehicle accumulations within the efficient range of each region, which helps improve the network performance. Compared with the condition without perimeter control, the proposed control method can improve network-wide traffic performance up to 14.18%.}

abstract = {Increasingly, commercial vehicles are equipped with automated vehicle (AV) features such as adaptive cruise control systems. The AV feature can automatically control the headway between the current vehicle and the preceding vehicle in an adaptive manner. The automatic control may lead to significantly different car- following motions compared with those of human-driven vehicles, which challenges the applicability of classic traffic flow theory to emerging road traffic with AVs. To investigate the impacts of commercial AVs on traffic flow, this paper proposes a general methodology that combines both empirical experiments and theoretical models to construct a fundamental diagram (FD), i.e., the foundation for traffic flow theory for AV traffic. To demonstrate the empirical experiment settings, we collected high-resolution trajectory data with multiple commercial AVs following one another in a platoon with different headway settings. The field experiment results revealed that the traditional triangular FD structure remains applicable to describe the traffic flow characteristics of AV traffic. Further, by comparing the FDs between AVs and human-driven vehicles, it was found that although the shortest AV headway setting can significantly improve road capacity, other headway settings may decrease road capacity compared with existing human-driven-vehicle traffic. It was also found that headway settings may affect the stability of traffic flow, which has been revealed by theoretical studies but was first verified by empirical AV data. With these findings, mixed traffic flow FDs were derived by incorporating different headway settings and AV penetration rates. The method proposed in this paper, including experiment designs, data collection approaches, traffic flow characteristics analyses, and mixed traffic flow FD construction approaches, can serve as a methodological foundation for studying future mixed traffic flow features with uncertain and evolving AV technologies.}}

This paper derives the FD for mixed HV and CAV traffic considering the stochastic headway. Firstly, the deterministic FD of pure CAV traffic and pure HV traffic are built. Then the FD of mixed HV and CAV traffic is developed with CAV penetration and platooning intensity taken into consideration. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to model the stochastic headway, based on which the stochastic FD is derived. Impact of CAV penetration and platooning intensity on the stochasticity of FD is studied. Results from theoretical analysis and case study show that increasing CAV penetration can reduce the scattering of FD, while higher platooning intensity may result in more scattering of FD.}

A constrained optimization based control scheme is proposed to ensure an entire platoon’s transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic dynamic performance. By exploiting the solution properties of the underlying optimization problem and using primal-dual formulation, this paper develops dual based distributed algorithms to compute optimal solutions with proven convergence. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the unconstrained linear closed-loop system is established. These stability analysis results provide a principle to select penalty weights in the underlying optimization problem to achieve the desired closed-loop performance for both the transient and the asymptotic dynamics. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.}

This paper develops a path-control scheme to achieve the system optimum (SO) of the network by controlling a portion of cooperative AVs (CAVs) as per the SO routing principle. A linear program is formulated to delineate the scheme and determine the minimum control ratio (MCR) of CAVs to achieve SO. The properties of the MCR are mathematically and numerically investigated. Numerical examples based on real-world networks reveal that the SO of most of the tested networks can be achieved with an MCR below 23%. Considering the low market penetration of AVs at early stages of their deployment, we further investigate a joint path-based control and pricing scheme to replicate SO. Numerical examples demonstrate the remarkable synergy of these combined instruments on reducing the MCR with little collected tolling revenue.}

Not surprisingly, despite the relatively short history of AVs, there have been numerous studies in the literature focusing on understanding and modeling various aspects of AV-involved traffic flow and significant progresses have already been made. To understand the recent development and ultimately inspire new research ideas on this important topic, this survey systematically and comprehensively reviews the existing AV-involved traffic flow models with different levels of details, and examines the relationship among the design of AV-based driving strategies, the management of transportation systems, and the resulting traffic dynamics.

abstract = {Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have been currently considered as promising solutions for realization of envisioned autonomous traffic management systems in the future. CAVs can achieve high desired traffic efficiency and provide safe, energy-saving, and comfortable ride experience for passengers. However, in order to practically implement such autonomous systems based on CAVs, there exist several significant challenges to be dealt with, such as coupled spatiotemporal constraints on CAVs’ trajectories at unsignalized intersections, multiple objectives for trajectory optimization in road segments, and heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks with highly dynamic traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a cooperative autonomous traffic organization method for CAVs in multi-intersection road networks. The methodological framework consists of threefold components: an autonomous crossing strategy based on a conflict resolution approach at unsignalized intersections, multi-objective trajectory optimization in road segments, and a composite strategy for route planning considering heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs based on social and individual benefit, respectively. Specifically, we first identify a set of potential conflict points of different CAVs’ spatial trajectories at the intersection, and then design different minimum safe time headways to resolve conflicts. Under the constraints of entry and exit conditions at adjacent intersections, we propose a multi-objective optimal control model by jointly considering vehicle safety, energy conservation, and ride comfort, and then analytically derive a closed-form solution for optimizing the CAVs’ trajectories. Furthermore, with the purpose to adapt dynamic traffic demand, we propose a composite strategy for route planning by coordinating heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been performed to validate our proposed method and to demonstrate its advantage over conventional baseline schemes in terms of global traffic efficiency. Additional numerical results are also provided to shed light on the impact of the proportion of CAVs with heterogeneous decision-making behaviors on the global system performance.}

The model also captures the spatial correlation of all queues adjacent to a node, and derives their joint distribution. The approach builds upon an existing stationary queueing network model that is based on finite capacity queueing theory. The original model is specified in terms of a set of differentiable equations, which in the new model are carried over to a set of equally smooth difference equations. The physical correctness of the new model is experimentally confirmed in several congestion regimes. A comparison with results predicted by the kinematic wave model (KWM) shows that the new model correctly represents the dynamic build-up, spillback and dissipation of queues. It goes beyond the KWM in that it captures queue lengths and spillbacks probabilistically, which allows for a richer analysis than the deterministic predictions of the KWM. The new model also generates a plausible fundamental diagram, which demonstrates that it captures well the stationary flow/density relationships in both congested and uncongested conditions.}

abstract = {A recent study (Li, 2020) analytically predicted tradeoffs between automated vehicle (AV) following characteristics on safety, mobility, and stability using a parsimonious linear car-following model. This work aimed to verify the key theoretical findings in the above study with empirical experiments using commercial AVs, e.g., vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) functions. We collect high-resolution trajectory data of multiple commercial AVs following one another in a platoon with different headway settings. Parsimonious linear AV-following models that capture the first-order parameters on safety, mobility, and stability aspects are estimated with the data. The estimation results of the key parameters validate several theoretical predictions predicted by Li (2020). Specifically, it was found that as the time lag setting increases, the corresponding safety buffer decreases, indicating that AV safety could be improved with less pursuit of AV mobility or, conversely, AV mobility improvement may come at a cost of more stringent safety requirements. Also, as the time lag setting increases, AV string stability increases, indicating that stop-and-go traffic potentially could be dampened by compromising AV mobility. With this, one possible explanation to the observed string instability of commercial AV following control (i.e., ACC function) is that automakers may prefer to ensure a relatively short headway (and thus better user experience on vehicle mobility) at a cost of compromising string stability. It was also found that as the time lag increases, the cycle period of traffic oscillations gets longer, and the oscillation amplification gets smaller, which supports the tradeoff between mobility and stability. On the other hand, field experiments revealed issues beyond the predictivity of a simple linear model. That is, vehicle control sensitivity factors vary across different speed and headway settings, and the model estimation results for key parameters are not consistent over different speed ranges. This opens future research needs for investigating nonlinearity and stochasticity in the AV following modeling.}

abstract = {This article shows how the evolution of multi-commodity traffic flows over complex networks can be predicted over time, based on a simple macroscopic computer representation of traffic flow that is consistent with the kinematic wave theory under all traffic conditions. The method does not use ad hoc procedures to treat special situations. After a brief review of the basic model for one link, the article describes how three-legged junctions can be modeled. It then introduces a numerical procedure for networks, assuming that a time-varying origin-destination (O-D) table is given and that the proportion of turns at every junction is known. These assumptions are reasonable for numerical analysis of disaster evacuation plans. The results are then extended to the case where, instead of the turning proportions, the best routes to each destination from every junction are known at all times. For technical reasons explained in the text, the procedure is more complicated in this case, requiring more computer memory and more time for execution. The effort is estimated to be about an order of magnitude greater than for the static traffic assignment problem on a network of the same size. The procedure is ideally suited for parallel computing. It is hoped that the results in the article will lead to more realistic models of freeway flow, disaster evacuations and dynamic traffic assignment for the evening commute.}

A novel aspect of this framework is its integration of the continuous-time double queue traffic flow model in a signal controlled traffic network to capture queue spillbacks in continuous-time. Furthermore, drivers’ long term responses to changes in traffic signal control settings are captured by their route choices following Wardrop’s first principle, which results in the dynamic user equilibrium state. Two signal control strategies, the fixed-timing control and the adaptive signal control, are considered. A continuous approximation method for the signal control is applied to eliminate integer variables and enhance the computational efficiency. A heuristic genetic algorithm based solution procedure is proposed to solve the proposed nonlinear programming problem with time-varying delay terms. Numerical tests are conducted in two testing networks and the results show that adaptive control with drivers taking into account signal timing on their route travel times performs best, and in some cases nearly as well as the benchmark performance derived from system optimal control without equilibrium constraints. The results also show that the advantage of adaptive over fixed-time signal control is more pronounced under UE than SO routing behavior.}

To efficiently solve the relaxed problem, we explore the relationship between the relaxed problems based on different traffic flow models (PQ, SQ, CTM) and a minimal cost flow (MCF) problem for a special space-expansion network. It is shown that all the four problem formulations produce the same minimal system cost and share one common solution which does not involve inside queues in the network. Efficient solution algorithms such as the network simplex method can be applied to solve the MCF problem and identify such an optimal traffic pattern.

Semi-automated vehicles with the capability of automatically following a vehicle in front as long as it is in the same lane and in the vicinity of the forward looking ranging sensor are expected to be deployed in the near future. Their penetration into the current manual traffic will give rise to mixed manual/semi-automated traffic. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental flow–density curve for mixed traffic using flow–density curves for 100% manual and 100% semi-automated traffic. Assuming that semi-automated vehicles use a time headway smaller than today’s manual traffic average due to the use of sensors and actuators, we have shown using the flow–density diagram that the traffic flow rate will increase in mixed traffic. We have also shown that the flow–density curve for mixed traffic is restricted between the flow–density curves for 100% manual and 100% semi-automated traffic. We have presented in a graphical way that the presence of semi-automated vehicles in mixed traffic propagates a shock wave faster than in manual traffic. We have demonstrated that the presence of semi-automated vehicles does not change the total travel time of vehicles in mixed traffic. Though we observed that with 50% semi-automated vehicles a vehicle travels 10.6% more distance than a vehicle in manual traffic for the same time horizon and starting at approximately the same position, this increase is marginal and is within the modeling error. Lastly, we have shown that when shock waves on the highway produce stop-and-go traffic, the average delay experienced by vehicles at standstill is lower in mixed traffic than in manual traffic, while the average number of vehicles at standstill remains unchanged.}

The influence of such information assistance on driver decision making and task performance during safety-critical events is not well understood. Thus, this study focusses on understanding the impact of connected environment on the acceleration noise and the response time as indicators of task performance and the decision making involved in safety-critical events. To overcome the paucity of connected environment data, an advanced driving simulator experiment is designed and conducted. Three categories of uninterrupted information are available to drivers in connected environment scenario, namely continuous information, on-time event-triggered information, and advanced event-triggered information. The safety-critical event designed in the simulator experiment is the leader’s hard braking behaviour in car-following regime. In connected environment scenario, drivers receive an advanced message for this safety-critical event. To model drivers’ decision in safety-critical situations, random parameters modelling approaches are adopted to account for the unobserved heterogeneities in drivers’ decision. Consequently, a grouped random parameters hazard-based duration model and a grouped random parameters linear regression model—both with heterogeneity in parameter means—are estimated for the response time and the acceleration noise, respectively. Results show that the acceleration noise reduces in connected environment while the response time can either increase or decrease in connected environment compared to those in the traditional environment. To better understand this mixed effect on response time, a decision tree analysis is conducted. For human factors, the results demonstrate that young drivers take more advantage of connected environment relative to the middle-aged or old drivers. Overall, drivers exhibit stable driving behaviour because they have more time to react and thus, are at low risk in safety-critical situations in connected environment.}

abstract = {Emerging connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) technologies provide an opportunity to the detailed vehicle trajectory control to reduce adverse impacts of stop-and-go traffic imposed by freeway bottlenecks. This study proposes a CAV-based trajectory-smoothing concept to harmonize traffic, improve fuel-efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. The presented algorithm is applicable to mixed-traffic environments with human-driven vehicles (HVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and CAVs. This algorithm controls CAVs so that they smoothly hedge against the backward deceleration waves and gradually merge into the downstream traffic with a reasonable speed. This model addresses the full spectrum of CV and CAV market penetration rates and various traffic conditions. Numerical experiments are performed to assess the algorithm performance with different traffic conditions and CV and CAV market penetration rates. The results show significant improvements in dampening traffic oscillation and reducing fuel consumption and emissions.}

    abstract = { Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is providing urban transportation managers tremendous opportunities for better operation of urban mobility systems. However, there are significant challenges in real-time implementation as the computational time of the corresponding operations optimization model increases exponentially with increasing vehicle numbers. Following the companion paper (Chen et al. 2021), which proposes a novel automated traffic control scheme for isolated intersections, this study proposes a network-level, real-time traffic control framework for CAVs on grid networks. The proposed framework integrates a rhythmic control method with an online routing algorithm to realize collision-free control of all CAVs on a network and achieve superior performance in average vehicle delay, network traffic throughput, and computational scalability. Specifically, we construct a preset network rhythm that all CAVs can follow to move on the network and avoid collisions at all intersections. Based on the network rhythm, we then formulate online routing for the CAVs as a mixed integer linear program, which optimizes the entry times of CAVs at all entrances of the network and their time–space routings in real time. We provide a sufficient condition that the linear programming relaxation of the online routing model yields an optimal integer solution. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to show the performance of the proposed operations management framework under various scenarios. It is illustrated that the framework is capable of achieving negligible delays and increased network throughput. Furthermore, the computational time results are also promising. The CPU time for solving a collision-free control optimization problem with 2,000 vehicles is only 0.3 second on an ordinary personal computer. }

Recently, with the development of connected vehicles, regulating conflict movements by controlling individual vehicles to improve intersection performance has attracted a lot of research efforts. This study aims at developing an advanced vehicle control system with connected vehicles to reduce vehicle delays at intersections without the help of signals. An intersection delay model is proposed to predict the total vehicle delay at one intersection and to search for the optimal speed control actions to manage traffic under mixed connected and non-connected vehicle environment. The simulation experiments illustrate that the control system is able to reduce average vehicle delay by up to 95\%, and the sensitivity analysis of vehicle demand and market penetrate rates of connected vehicles is also conducted to understand the benefits of the system at different traffic and connected vehicle environments.},

The trajectory of CAVs is continuously optimized via a central methodology, while a new “white” phase is introduced to enforce CHVs to follow their immediate front vehicle. The movement of CHVs is incorporated in the optimization framework utilizing a customized linear car-following model. During the white phase, CAVs lead groups of CHVs through an intersection. The proposed formulation determines the optimal signal indication for each lane-group in each time step. We have developed a receding horizon control framework to solve the problem. The case study results indicate that the proposed methodology successfully controls the mixed CAV-CHV traffic under various CAV market penetration rates and different demand levels. The results reveal that a higher CAV market penetration rate induces more frequent white phase indication compared to green-red signals. The proposed program reduces the total delay by 19.6%–96.2% compared to a fully-actuated signal control optimized by a state-of-practice traffic signal timing optimization software.}

Specifically, AV lanes are exclusive lanes that can only be utilized by AVs, and the deployment plan specifies when, where, and how many AV lanes to be deployed. We first present a multi-class network equilibrium model to describe the flow distributions of both CVs and AVs, given the presence of AV lanes in the network. Considering that the net benefit (e.g., reduced travel cost) derived from the deployment of AV lanes will further promote the AV adoption, we proceed to apply a diffusion model to forecast the evolution of AV market penetration. With the equilibrium model and diffusion model, a time-dependent deployment model is then formulated, which can be solved by an efficient solution algorithm. Lastly, numerical examples based on the south Florida network are presented to demonstrate the proposed models.}

Computer reaction times may admit reduced following headways and increase capacity and backwards wave speed. The degree of these improvements will depend on the proportion of autonomous vehicles in the network. To model arbitrary shared road scenarios, we develop a multiclass cell transmission model that admits variations in capacity and backwards wave speed in response to class proportions within each cell. The multiclass cell transmission model is shown to be consistent with the hydrodynamic theory. This paper then develops a car following model incorporating driver reaction time to predict capacity and backwards wave speed for multiclass scenarios. For intersection modeling, we adapt the legacy early method for intelligent traffic management (Bento et al., 2013) to general simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models. Empirical results on a city network show that intersection controls are a major bottleneck in the model, and that the legacy early method improves over traffic signals when the autonomous vehicle proportion is sufficiently high.}

This paper aims to present a mathematical framework for the optimal design of AV zones in a general network. With the presence of AV zones, AVs may apply different routing principles outside of and within the AV zones. A novel network equilibrium model (we refer to it as the “mixed routing equilibrium model”) is thus firstly proposed to capture such mixed-routing behaviors. We then proceed to formulate a mixed-integer bi-level programming model to optimize the deployment plan of AV zones.

This study proposes a route control scheme that aims to strike a balance between gains in the system efficiency and the control intensity, defined as the demand flow under control for each origin-destination (OD) pair. The proposed model has a bi-level structure and is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). A specialized algorithm based on sensitivity analysis and the alternative direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is developed to find a local optimum for the MPEC. Results of numerical experiments show that (1) in all tested cases, controlling a minority of vehicles (less than 10% in some case) could bring the system very close to the system optimum; (2) some O-D pairs enjoy a higher control priority than the others, mostly due to the underlying network topology rather than the demand magnitude; (3) the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient; (4) starting from different initial solutions, the algorithm produces very similar local optimal solutions.}

abstract = {Compared to existing human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer users the potential for reduced value of time, enhanced quality of travel experience, and seamless situational awareness and connectivity. Hence, CAV users can differ in their route choice behavior compared to HDV users, leading to mixed traffic flows that can significantly deviate from the single-class HDV traffic pattern. However, due to the lack of quantitative models, there is limited knowledge on the evolution of mixed traffic flows in a traffic network. To partly bridge this gap, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment model, where HDV users and CAV users follow different route choice principles, characterized by the cross-nested logit (CNL) model and user equilibrium (UE) model, respectively. The CNL model captures HDV users’ uncertainty associated with limited knowledge of traffic conditions while overcoming the route overlap issue of logit-based stochastic user equilibrium. The UE model characterizes the CAV's capability for acquiring accurate information on traffic conditions. In addition, the multiclass model can capture the characteristics of mixed traffic flow such as the difference in value of time between HDVs and CAVs and the asymmetry in their driving interactions, thereby enhancing behavioral realism in the modeling. The study develops a new solution algorithm labeled RSRS-MSRA, in which a route-swapping based strategy is embedded with a self-regulated step size choice technique, to solve the proposed model efficiently. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is performed to gain insights into the effects of perturbations on the mixed traffic equilibrium, which facilitates the estimation of equilibrium traffic flow and identification of critical elements under expected or unexpected events. The study results can assist transportation decision-makers to design effective planning and operational strategies to leverage the advantages of CAVs and manage traffic congestion under mixed traffic flows.}

For the mode choice, travellers select among three options, following a logit modal split: driving their private HV, or taking an AV mobility service provided by either a firm or the government. For the route choice, the HV drivers follow the random utility maximisation principle while central agents route the AV passengers following the Cournot Nash (firm agent) or Social Optimal (government agent) principles. We consider two types of travel costs (i.e. travel time and monetary travel cost) to characterise the new features (e.g. expanded link capacity and reduced value of time) of the mixed AV–HV transportation system. We model the MBE-MC problem in a combined mode–route choice framework and formulate it as a route-based variational inequality (VI) problem. We show the equivalence between the VI formulation and the MBE-MC problem, and the existence of a solution to the MBE-MC problem. Then, we modify a partial linearisation algorithm for solving the proposed model. Numerical results validate the equilibrium conditions and show the efficacy of the new model in capturing the features of the mixed AV–HV transportation system. The impact patterns of different parameters on (1) the network performance in terms of AV share and system cost and (2) on the solution efficiency are analysed.}

Specifically, our study integrated/contributed the following technical approaches. First, the car-following behavior of human-drive vehicles is modeled by well-accepted Newell car-following models. Accordingly, an online curve matching algorithm is integrated to anticipate the aggregated response delay of the human-drive vehicles using real-time trajectory data. Built upon that, constrained One- or P-step MPC models are developed to control the movement of the CAV platoon upstream or downstream of the HDV platoon so that we can ensure both transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic stability of this sample mixed flow platoon, leveraging the communication and computation technologies equipped on CAVs. Considering the lack of the centralized computation facilities and severe changes of the platoon topology, this study develops a distributed algorithm to solve the MPCs according to the properties of the optimizers, such as solution uniqueness, sequentially feasibility, and nonempty interior point of the solution space. The convergence of the distributed algorithm as well as the stability of the MPC control is proved by both the theoretical analysis and the experimental study. Extensive numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the distributed algorithm can solve the One-step and P-step MPCs efficiently. The cooperative MPC can dampen traffic oscillation propagation and stabilize the traffic flow more efficiently for the entire mixed flow platoon. Moreover, the cooperative platoon control scheme outperforms the other three control strategies, including the non-cooperative control strategy and a latest CACC strategy in literature.}

However, in most existing system optimum dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), no side constraints are used to describe the dynamic link capacities in a network which is shared by multiple vehicle types. Our motivation is based on the possibility for dynamic system optimum (DSO) to have multiple solutions, which differ in where queues are formed and dissipated in the network. To this end, this paper proposes a novel DSO formulation for the multi-class DTA problem containing both human driven and automated vehicles in single origin-destination networks. The proposed method uses the concept of link based approach to develop a multi-class DTA model that equally distributes the total physical queues over the links while considering explicitly the variations in capacity and backward wave speeds due to class proportions. In the model, the DSO is formulated as an optimization problem considering linear vehicle composition constraints representing the dynamics of the link capacities. Numerical examples are set up to provide some insights into the effects of automated vehicles on the queue distribution as well as the total system travel times.}

We consider two optimal control problems: the DTA problem, where turning ratios are part of the control inputs, and the Freeway Network Control (FNC), where turning ratios are instead assigned exogenous parameters. It is known that relaxation of the supply and demand constraints in the cell-based formulations of the DTA problem results in a linear program. However, solutions to the relaxed problem can be infeasible with respect to traffic dynamics. Previous work has shown that such solutions can be made feasible by proper choice of ramp metering and variable speed limit control for specific traffic networks. We extend this procedure to arbitrary networks and provide insight into the structure and robustness of the proposed optimal controllers. For a network consisting only of ordinary, merge, and diverge junctions, where the cells have linear demand functions and affine supply functions with identical slopes, and the cost is the total traffic volume, we show, using the Pontryagin maximum principle, that variable speed limits are not needed in order to achieve optimality in the FNC problem, and ramp metering is sufficient. We also prove bounds on perturbation of the controlled system trajectory in terms of perturbations in initial traffic volume and exogenous inflows. These bounds, which leverage monotonicity properties of the controlled trajectory, are shown to be in close agreement with numerical simulation results.}

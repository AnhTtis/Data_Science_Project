    "abstract": "This study develops the headway control framework in a fully automated road network, as we believe headway of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is another influencing factor to traffic dynamics in addition to conventional vehicle behaviors (e.g. route and departure time choices). Specifically, we aim to search for the optimal time headway between AVs on each link that achieves the network-wide system optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA). To this end, the headway-dependent fundamental diagram (HFD) and headway-dependent double queue model (HDQ) are developed to model the effect of dynamic headway on roads, and a dynamic network model is built. It is rigorously proved that the minimum headway could always achieve SO-DTA, yet the optimal headway is non-unique. Motivated by these two findings, this study defines a novel concept of maximin headway, which is the largest headway that still achieves SO-DTA in the network. Mathematical properties regarding maximin headway are analyzed and an efficient solution algorithm is developed. Numerical experiments on both a small and large network verify the effectiveness of the maximin headway control framework as well as the properties of maximin headway. This study sheds light on deriving the desired solution among the non-unique solutions in SO-DTA and provides implications regarding the safety margin of AVs under SO-DTA.",

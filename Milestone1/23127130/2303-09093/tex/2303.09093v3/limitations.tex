\section{Limitations}
We perceive the following limitations for our work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of argument annotation. Event argument extraction is a critical component of event extraction. At the time of publication, \datasetname\ is only an event detection dataset without argument annotation. This is an issue that we are actively working towards for future releases of the dataset.
    \item Timeliness of documents. The source documents of the PropBank annotated datasets are not very new. 
    In particular, the OntoNotes dataset contains news articles from 2000-2006 \footnote{\url{https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19}}. 
    Hence, there is the possibility of a data distribution shift between our training set and any document that our model is being applied, which might cause performance degrade, as shown in other tasks~\cite{rijhwani-preotiuc-pietro-2020-temporally}.
    \item Completeness of ontology. Although our dataset is the most comprehensive event detection dataset of date, we acknowledge that there might be event types that we have overlooked. We plan to keep \datasetname\ as a living project and update our ontology and dataset over time.
    \item Multilingual support. 
    Currently, our documents are from the English PropBank annotation dataset so our system only supports English. One idea would be to utilize resources such as the Universal PropBank~\cite{jindal2022UniversalPropbank}which can help us align corpora in other languages to PropBank and then further to our ontology.

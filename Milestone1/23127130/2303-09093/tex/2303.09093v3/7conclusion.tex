\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We introduce a new general-purpose event detection dataset \datasetname\ that covers over 3k event types for all domains. \datasetname\ can be seen as our first attempt towards making event extraction systems more accessible to the general audience, removing the burden on users of designing their own ontology and collecting annotation. 
We also introduce a multi-stage model designed to handle the large ontology size and partial labels in \datasetname\ and show that our tailored model achieves much better performance than a range of baselines. 

Our model \ours\ can be used as an off-the-shelf event detection tool 
for various downstream tasks, and we also encourage members of the community to improve upon our results, (e.g. tackle the noise brought by partial labels) or extend upon our benchmark (e.g. include other languages).

\caption{The event type distribution of GLEN. In the training set, instances associated with $N$ labels are weighted as $\frac{1}{N}$. Figure (a) illustrates the distribution of event types based on the number of instances. In figure (b), we show the top three most popular event types as well as randomly sampled types from the middle and tail of the distribution curve.}

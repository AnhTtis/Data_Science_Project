\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We introduce a new general-purpose event detection dataset \datasetname\ that covers over 3k event types for all domains. \datasetname\ can be seen as our first attempt toward making event extraction systems more accessible to the general audience, removing the burden on users to design their own ontology and collect annotation. 
We also introduce a multi-stage model that is designed to handle the large ontology size and partial labels in \datasetname\ and show that our tailored model achieves much better performance than a range of baselines. 
Our model can be used as an off-the-shelf event detection tool \footnote{We are preparing to release a Docker container of the system.} for various downstream tasks and we also encourage members of the community to improve upon our results, in particular, tackle the noise brought by partial labels.

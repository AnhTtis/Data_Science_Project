    "abstract": "We study $s$-fractional $p$-Laplacian type equations with discontinuous kernel coefficients in divergence form to establish $W^{s+σ,q}$ estimates for any choice of pairs $( σ,q)$ with $q\\in(p,\\infty)$ and $σ\\in\\left(0,\\min\\left\\{\\frac{s}{p-1},1-s\\right\\}\\right)$ under the assumption that the associated kernel coefficients have small BMO seminorms near the diagonal. As a consequence, we find in the literature an optimal fractional Sobolev regularity of such a non-homogeneous nonlocal equation when the right-hand side is presented by a suitable fractional operator. Our results are new even in the linear case.",

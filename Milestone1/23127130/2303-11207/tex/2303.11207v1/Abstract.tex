Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), originally developed for natural language processing, hold great promise for accurately describing strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Here, we employ 2D RNNs to investigate two prototypical quantum many-body Hamiltonians exhibiting topological order. Specifically, we demonstrate that RNN wave functions can effectively capture the topological order of the toric code and a Bose-Hubbard spin liquid on the kagome lattice by estimating their topological entanglement entropies. We also find that RNNs favor coherent superpositions of minimally-entangled states over minimally-entangled states themselves. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RNN wave functions constitute a powerful tool to study phases of matter beyond Landau's symmetry-breaking paradigm.

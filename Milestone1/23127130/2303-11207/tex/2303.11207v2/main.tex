\section*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank Giacomo Torlai, Jeremy Côté, Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Ejaaz Merali, Isaac De Vlugt and Arun Paramekanti for helpful discussions. Our RNN implementation is based on Tensorflow~\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} and NumPy~\cite{Harris2020}.
Computer simulations were made possible thanks to the Vector Institute computing cluster and Compute Canada. M.H acknowledges support from Mitacs through Mitacs Accelerate. J.C. acknowledges support from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET), Compute Canada, and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) AI chair program. Research at Perimeter Institute is supported in part by the Government of Canada through the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada and by the Province of Ontario through the Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade.

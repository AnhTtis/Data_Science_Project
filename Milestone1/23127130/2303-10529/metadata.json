    "abstract": "Open-print version of dissertation thesis. This thesis focuses on the relation between the diproton correlation and the two-proton emission with quantum entanglement. For this purpose, I developed a time-dependent three-body (proton-proton-core) model, where one Cooper pair of protons move inside the mean-field potential. The time-dependent calculation based on the three-body model provides an intuitive way to describe the quantum dynamics of the entangled fermionic pair. It has been shown that, by considering the Cooper-pairing correlation in the initial state of the two protons, (i) the experimental 2p-decay width of Be-6 is well reproduced, and (ii) the two protons are emitted mainly as a diproton-like cluster with the spin-singlet configuration in the early stage of the emission. Hence, the two-proton emission can provide an access to the diproton correlation. This thesis presented the first step to theoretically investigate the diproton correlation as well as quantum entanglement in the time-dependent radioactive emission. [NOTE] In this open-print version, several Figures were inevitably eliminated, because of the copyright and/or file-size problems. Several minor corrections have been done, but without changing the scientific discussions, results, and conclusions from the original version in 2014.",

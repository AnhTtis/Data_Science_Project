Conclusion
}
In this work, we tackle the challenges of applying data mixing augmentations to object detection.
Specifically, we present Supervision Interpolation (SI),
a novel conceptual reinterpretation and generalization of Mixup. 
Given SI, we propose LossMix, a simple-yet-effective regularization that interpolates the losses instead of labels to strengthen object detectors. 
Our empirical results demonstrate that LossMix can consistently offer performance gains, surpass popular object mixing strategies, and even enhance the state-of-the-art domain adaptation method.
We hope LossMix and Supervision Interpolation can inspire future research on data mixing for object detection and beyond.

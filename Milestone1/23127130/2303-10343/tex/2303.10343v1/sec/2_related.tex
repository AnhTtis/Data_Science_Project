\paragraph{Data Mixing Augmentations} 
The original Mixup~\cite{mixup} was designed for image classification tasks, proposing to use a convex combination of data and labels to expand the space of augmented training examples.
Mixup~\cite{mixup}, CutMix~\cite{cutmix}, and follow-up works~\cite{
supermix,
stylemix,
puzzlemix,
tokenmix,
automix,
over_train_mixup,
mixup_cls_fixbi,
regmixup,
manifold_mixup,
mixup_cls_dual,
mixup_cls_adv,
cutmix,
mixup} have demonstrated the benefits of this interpolation-based augmentation for improving models' memorization and sensitivity to appearance changes. 
Since then, many works have utilized Mixup for image classification problems~\cite{mixup_cls_fixbi,mixup_cls_dual,mixup_cls_adv}.
However, due to the challenges discussed above, only a few studies~\cite{bof} have explored the use of Mixup for general object detection.
Others tend to focus on settings with limited labeled data, such as semi-supervised learning~\cite{union_ssl_dual,union_ssl_instant_teaching}, few-shot learning~\cite{union_da_fewshot_acrofod}, or domain adaptation~\cite{union_da_fewshot_acrofod,afan}.


\paragraph{Cross-Domain Object Detection}
There are two main approaches for object detection: one-stage object detectors that attempt to perform localization and classification simultaneously~\cite{ssd,yolo}, and two-stage object detectors that first generate object proposals and then perform classification and bounding box refinement in the second stage~\cite{faster_rcnn}.
Domain Adaptation based approaches aims to build a robust detectors that can generalize well to a target domain with limited or no labeled data.
These methods can either explicitly align the feature distributions using a specific distance metric~\cite{long2015icml,long2016nips,sun2016aaai},
or implicitly align the distributions using an adversarial loss ~\cite{ganin2016jmlr,hoffman2018icml,long2018nips} or GAN~\cite{lee2021cvpr,murez2018cvpr}.
While most current works in domain adaptation focus on image classification~\cite{
da_det_image_stats,
da_adamatch,
da_bridge_domain,
da_transformer_improve,
da_cls_dine,
da_crowd_cnt,
da_geotexaug,
da_cls_seg_pareto,
da_seg_style_fog,
da_cls_slimmable,
da_cls_det_smooth,
da_transformer_safe}, a few have delved into object detection~\cite{
umt,
da_det_pit,
da_det_progressive,
amt,
da_det_ssal,
simrod}.
Data mixing~\cite{cutmix,mixup} is appealing in the context of UDA because of the opportunity to strategically blend cross-domain information during training.
To our best knowledge, the topic of data mixing for cross-domain object detection remains largely understudied~\cite{afan}.
We are interested in exploring the potential of LossMix when applied to UDA.

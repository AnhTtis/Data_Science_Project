\caption{
    Compared to label-mixing methods, e.g. Mixup~\cite{mixup} or CutMix~\cite{cutmix}, the proposed LossMix deploys interpolated losses instead of interpolated ground truths as the mixed supervision signals. This significantly simplifies the challenges involved in applying data mixing to higher-level tasks such as object detection.

    ABSTRACT = {The 3rd full-mission reanalysis (RAN3) of global sea surface temperature (SST) with a 750 m resolution at nadir is available from VIIRS instruments flown onboard two JPSS satellites: NPP (February 2012&ndash;present) and N20 (January 2018&ndash;present). Two SSTs, &lsquo;subskin&rsquo; (sensitive to skin SST) and &lsquo;depth&rsquo; (proxy for in situ SST at depth of 20 cm), were produced from brightness temperatures (BTs) in the VIIRS bands centered at 8.6, 11 and 12 &micro;m during the daytime and an additional 3.7 &micro;m band at night, using the NOAA Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) enterprise SST system. The RAN3 dataset is fully archived at NASA JPL PO.DAAC and NOAA CoastWatch, and routinely supplemented in near real time (NRT) with a latency of a few hours. Delayed mode (DM) processing with a 2 months latency follows NRT, resulting in a more uniform science quality SST record. This paper documents and evaluates the performance of the VIIRS RAN3 dataset. Comparisons with in situ SSTs from drifters and tropical moorings (D+TM) as well as Argo floats (AFs) (both available from the NOAA iQuam system) show good agreement, generally within the NOAA specifications for accuracy (&plusmn;0.2 K) and precision (0.6 K), in a clear-sky domain covering 18&ndash;20% of the global ocean. The nighttime SSTs compare with in situ data more closely, as expected due to the reduced diurnal thermocline. The daytime SSTs are also generally within NOAA specs but show some differences between the (D+TM) and AF validations as well as residual drift on the order of &minus;0.1 K/decade. BT comparisons between two VIIRSs and MODIS-Aqua show good consistency in the 3.7 and 12 &micro;m bands. The 11 &micro;m band, while consistent between NPP and N20, shows residual drift with respect to MODIS-Aqua. Similar analyses of the 8.6 &micro;m band are inconclusive, as the performance of the MODIS band 29 centered at 8.6 &micro;m is degraded and unstable in time and cannot be used for comparisons.},

ABSTRACT = {The primary measure of the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) fields obtained from satellite-borne infrared sensors has been the bias and variance of matchups with co-located in-situ values. Because such matchups tend to be widely separated, these bias and variance estimates are not necessarily a good measure of small scale (several pixels) gradients in these fields because one of the primary contributors to the uncertainty in satellite retrievals is atmospheric contamination, which tends to have large spatial scales compared with the pixel separation of infrared sensors. Hence, there is not a good measure to use in selecting SST fields appropriate for the study of submesoscale processes and, in particular, of processes associated with near-surface fronts, both of which have recently seen a rapid increase in interest. In this study, two methods are examined to address this problem, one based on spectra of the SST data and the other on their variograms. To evaluate the methods, instrument noise was estimated in Level-2 Visible-Infrared Imager-Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST fields of the Sargasso Sea. The two methods provided very nearly identical results for AVHRR: along-scan values of approximately 0.18 K for both day and night and along-track values of 0.21 K for day and night. By contrast, the instrument noise estimated for VIIRS varied by method, scan geometry and day-night. Specifically, daytime, along-scan (along-track), spectral estimates were found to be approximately 0.05 K (0.08 K) and the corresponding nighttime values of 0.02 K (0.03 K). Daytime estimates based on the variogram were found to be 0.08 K (0.10 K) with the corresponding nighttime values of 0.04 K (0.06 K). Taken together, AVHRR instrument noise is significantly larger than VIIRS instrument noise, along-track noise is larger than along-scan noise and daytime levels are higher than nighttime levels. Given the similarity of results and the less stringent preprocessing requirements, the variogram is the preferred method, although there is a suggestion that this approach overestimates the noise for high quality data in dynamically quiet regions. Finally, simulations of the impact of noise on the determination of SST gradients show that on average the gradient magnitude for typical ocean gradients will be accurately estimated with VIIRS but substantially overestimated with AVHRR.},

abstract = {The numerical implementation of an ocean model based on the incompressible Navier Stokes equations which is designed for studies of the ocean circulation on horizontal scales less than the depth of the ocean right up to global scale is described. A “pressure correction” method is used which is solved as a Poisson equation for the pressure field with Neumann boundary conditions in a geometry as complicated as that of the ocean basins. A major objective of the study is to make this inversion, and hence nonhydrostatic ocean modeling, efficient on parallel computers. The pressure field is separated into surface, hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic components. First, as in hydrostatic models, a two-dimensional problem is inverted for the surface pressure which is then made use of in the three-dimensional inversion for the nonhydrostatic pressure. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient iteration is used to invert symmetric elliptic operators in both two and three dimensions. Physically motivated preconditioners are designed which are efficient at reducing computation and minimizing communication between processors. Our method exploits the fact that as the horizontal scale of the motion becomes very much larger than the vertical scale, the motion becomes more and more hydrostatic and the three-dimensional Poisson operator becomes increasingly anisotropic and dominated by the vertical axis. Accordingly, a preconditioner is used which, in the hydrostatic limit, is an exact integral of the Poisson operator and so leads to a single algorithm that seamlessly moves from nonhydrostatic to hydrostatic limits. Thus in the hydrostatic limit the model is “fast,” competitive with the fastest ocean climate models in use today based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. But as the resolution is increased, the model dynamics asymptote smoothly to the Navier Stokes equations and so can be used to address small-scale processes. A “finite-volume” approach is employed to discretize the model in space in which property fluxes are defined normal to faces that delineate the volumes. The method makes possible a novel treatment of the boundary in which cells abutting the bottom or coast may take on irregular shapes and be “shaved” to fit the boundary. The algorithm can conveniently exploit massively parallel computers and suggests a domain decomposition which allocates vertical columns of ocean to each processing unit. The resulting model, which can handle arbitrarily complex geometry, is efficient and scalable and has been mapped on to massively parallel multiprocessors such as the Connection Machine (CM5) using data-parallel FORTRAN and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology data-flow machine MONSOON using the implicitly parallel language Id.},

abstract = {This paper describes the sea ice component of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm); it presents example Arctic and Antarctic results from a realistic, eddy-admitting, global ocean and sea ice configuration; and it compares B-grid and C-grid dynamic solvers and other numerical details of the parameterized dynamics and thermodynamics in a regional Arctic configuration. Ice mechanics follow a viscous-plastic rheology and the ice momentum equations are solved numerically using either line-successive-over-relaxation (LSOR) or elastic–viscous-plastic (EVP) dynamic models. Ice thermodynamics are represented using either a zero-heat-capacity formulation or a two-layer formulation that conserves enthalpy. The model includes prognostic variables for snow thickness and for sea ice salinity. The above sea ice model components were borrowed from current generation climate models but they were reformulated on an Arakawa C grid in order to match the MITgcm oceanic grid and they were modified in many ways to permit efficient and accurate automatic differentiation. Both stress tensor divergence and advective terms are discretized with the finite-volume method. The choice of the dynamic solver has a considerable effect on the solution; this effect can be larger than, for example, the choice of lateral boundary conditions, of ice rheology, and of ice-ocean stress coupling. The solutions obtained with different dynamic solvers typically differ by a few cms−1 in ice drift speeds, 50cm in ice thickness, and order 200km3yr−1 in freshwater (ice and snow) export out of the Arctic.}

We compare the simulated ice melt with an estimate derived from oceanographic data. The simulations show turbulent upwelling and spreading of the freshwater-laden plume along the ice face and the vigorous melting of ice at rates of meters per day. The simulated August 2010 melt rate of 2.0±0.3 m/d is within uncertainties of the melt rate of 3.0±1.0 m/d calculated from oceanographic data. Melting is greatest at depth, above the subglacial channels, causing glacier undercutting. Melt rates increase proportionally to thermal forcing raised to the power of 1.2–1.6 and to subglacial water flux raised to the power of 0.5–0.9. Therefore, in a warmer climate, Store Glacier melting by ocean may increase from both increased ocean temperature and subglacial discharge.},

abstract = {High-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) estimates are dependent on satellite-based infrared radiometers, which are proven to be highly accurate in the past decades. However, the presence of clouds is a big stumbling block when physical approaches are used to derive SST. This problem is more prominent across tropical regions such as Arabian Sea(AS) and Bay of Bengal(BoB), restricting the availability of high-resolution SST data for ocean applications. The previous studies for developing daily high-resolution cloud-free SST products mainly focus on fusion of multiple satellites and in-situ data products that are computationally expensive and often time consuming. At the same time, it was observed that the capabilities of data-driven approaches are not yet fully explored in the estimation of cloud-free high-resolution SST data. Hence, in this study an attempt has been made for the first time to estimate daily cloud free SST from a single sensor (MODIS Aqua) dataset using advanced machine learning techniques. Here, three distinct machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)-based algorithms were developed and evaluated over two different study areas within the AS and BoB using 10 years of MODIS data and in-situ reference data. Among the developed algorithms, the SVR-based algorithm performs consistently better. In AS region, while testing, the SVR-based SST estimates was able to achieve an adjusted coefficient of determination (Radj2) of 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.71 °C with respect to the in situ data. Similarly, in BoB too, the SVR algorithm outperforms the other algorithms with Radj2 of 0.78 with RMSE of 0.88 °C. Further, a spatio-temporal and visual analysis of the results as well as an inter-comparision with NOAA AVHRR daily optimally interpolated global SST (a standard SST product available in practice) the suggest that the proposed SVR-based algorithm has huge potential to produce operational high-resolution cloud-free SST estimates, even if there is cloud cover in the image.}

ABSTRACT = {The sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter of the energy balance on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. SST prediction is crucial to marine production, marine protection, and climate prediction. However, the current SST prediction model still has low precision and poor stability. In this study, a medium and long-term SST prediction model is designed on the basis of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network algorithm. This model captures the SST time regularity by using the GRU layer and outputs the predicted results through the fully connected layer. The Bohai Sea, which is characterized by a large annual temperature difference, is selected as the study area, and the SSTs on different time scales (monthly and quarterly) are used to verify the practicability and stability of the model. The results show that the designed SST prediction model can efficiently fit the results of the real sea surface temperature, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.98. Regardless of whether monthly or quarterly data are used, the proposed network model performs better than long short-term memory in terms of stability and accuracy when the length of the prediction increases. The root mean square error and mean absolute error of the predicted SST are mostly within 0&ndash;2.5 &deg;C.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning techniques are attractive tools to establish statistical models with a high degree of non linearity. They require a large amount of data to be trained and are therefore particularly suited to analysing remote sensing data. This work is an attempt at using advanced statistical methods of machine learning to predict the bias between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) derived from infrared remote sensing and ground “truth” from drifting buoy measurements. A large dataset of collocation between satellite SST and in situ SST is explored. Four regression models are used: Simple multi-linear regression, Least Square Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and random forest. In the case of geostationary satellites for which a large number of collocations is available, results show that the random forest model is the best model to predict the systematic errors and it is computationally fast, making it a good candidate for operational processing. It is able to explain nearly 31% of the total variance of the bias (in comparison to about 24% for the multi-linear regression model).},

ABSTRACT = {We performed an out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis of ∼12,000,000 semi-independent 128 × 128 pixel2 sea surface temperature (SST) regions, which we define as cutouts, from all nighttime granules in the MODIS R2019 Level-2 public dataset to discover the most complex or extreme phenomena at the ocean’s surface. Our algorithm (ULMO) is a probabilistic autoencoder (PAE), which combines two deep learning modules: (1) an autoencoder, trained on ∼150,000 random cutouts from 2010, to represent any input cutout with a 512-dimensional latent vector akin to a (non-linear) Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis; and (2) a normalizing flow, which maps the autoencoder’s latent space distribution onto an isotropic Gaussian manifold. From the latter, we calculated a log-likelihood (LL) value for each cutout and defined outlier cutouts to be those in the lowest 0.1% of the distribution. These exhibit large gradients and patterns characteristic of a highly dynamic ocean surface, and many are located within larger complexes whose unique dynamics warrant future analysis. Without guidance, ULMO consistently locates the outliers where the major western boundary currents separate from the continental margin. Prompted by these results, we began the process of exploring the fundamental patterns learned by ULMO thereby identifying several compelling examples. Future work may find that algorithms such as ULMO hold significant potential/promise to learn and derive other, not-yet-identified behaviors in the ocean from the many archives of satellite-derived SST fields. We see no impediment to applying them to other large remote-sensing datasets for ocean science (e.g., SSH and ocean color).},

    "abstract": "The possibility of high-precision and rapid detection of pathologies on chest X-rays makes it possible to detect the development of pneumonia at an early stage and begin immediate treatment. Artificial intelligence can speed up and qualitatively improve the procedure of X-ray analysis and give recommendations to the doctor for additional consideration of suspicious images. The purpose of this study is to determine the best models and implementations of the transfer learning method in the binary classification problem in the presence of a small amount of training data. In this article, various methods of augmentation of the initial data and approaches to training ResNet and DenseNet models for black-and-white X-ray images are considered, those approaches that contribute to obtaining the highest results of the accuracy of determining cases of pneumonia and norm at the testing stage are identified.",

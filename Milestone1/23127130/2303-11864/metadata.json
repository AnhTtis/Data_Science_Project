    "abstract": "Recently, Debruyne and Tenenbaum proved asymptotic formulas for the number of partitions with parts in $\\mathcal{L}\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ ($\\gcd(\\mathcal{L})=1$) and good analytic properties of the corresponding zeta function, generalizing work of Meinardus. In this paper, we extend their work to prove asymptotic formulas if $\\mathcal{L}$ is a multiset of integers and the zeta function has multiple poles. In particular, our results imply an asymptotic formula for the number of irreducible representations of degree $n$ of $\\mathfrak{so}{(5)}$. We also study the Witten zeta function $ζ_{\\mathfrak{so}{(5)}}$, which is of independent interest.",

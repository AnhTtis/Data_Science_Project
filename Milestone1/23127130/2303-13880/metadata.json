    "abstract": "We present ongoing investigations of maximally supersymmetric Yang--Mills ($Q = 16$ SYM) theory in three space-time dimensions. At low temperatures and large $N$ this theory is related to black branes in higher-dimensional quantum gravity. Building on previous work that focused on the homogeneous `D2' phase of the theory, we are now exploring phase transitions between this D2 phase and the localized `D0' phase.",

    "abstract": "Geometric pattern formation is an important emergent behavior in many applications involving large-scale multi-agent systems, such as sensor networks deployment and collective transportation. Attraction/repulsion virtual forces are the most common control approach to achieve such behavior in a distributed and scalable manner. Nevertheless, for most existing solutions only numerical and/or experimental evidence of their convergence is available. Here, we revisit the problem of achieving pattern formation giving sufficient conditions to prove analytically that under the influence of appropriate virtual forces, a large-scale multi-agent swarming system locally converges towards a stable and robust triangular lattice configuration. Specifically, the proof is carried out using LaSalle's invariance principle and geometry-based arguments. Our theoretical results are complemented by exhaustive numerical simulations confirming their effectiveness and estimating the region of asymptotic stability of the triangular configuration.",

For a positive integer $d$, we define $[d]:=\{1,2,\ldots,d\}$. 
The set of non-negative integers is denoted by $\NN:=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$.
The cardinality of a set $S$ is denoted by $|S|$.
%Operations on $[d]$ cyclically.

Our \emph{graphs} are finite and undirected. We allow multiple edges and loops. A \emph{simple graph} is a graph without multiple edges or loops. 


A \emph{plane map} is a connected planar graph drawn in the plane without edge crossing, considered up to continuous deformation. 
The \emph{faces} of a plane map are the connected components of the complement of the graph. The infinite face is called \emph{outer face}, and the finite faces are called \emph{inner faces}. The vertices and edges incident to the outer face are called \emph{outer} while the other are called \emph{inner}. 
The numbers $\vv$, $\ee$ and $\ff$ of vertices, edges and faces of a plane map are related by the \emph{Euler relation}  $\vv+\ff=\ee+2$. 


We now define the class of plane maps which will be relevant for this article.
\begin{definition}\label{def:d-adapted}
A \emph{$d$-map} is a plane map such that the inner faces have degree at most $d$, and the outer face has degree $d$ and is incident to $d$ distinct vertices (in other words, the contour of the outer face is a simple cycle). 
We will assume that the outer vertices of a $d$-map are labeled $v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_d$ in clockwise order along the boundary of the outer face. %, as in Figure \ref{???}.\\
A \emph{$d$-adapted map} is a $d$-map such that any simple cycle which is not the contour of a face has length at least $d$.\\
\end{definition}
We point out that $d$-adapted maps are necessarily 2-connected (because a cut point in a $d$-map $G$ implies the existence of a simple cycle of length strictly less than the degree of an inner face of $G$, which shows that $G$ is not $d$-adapted).


In a plane map, a \emph{corner} is the sector delimited by two consecutive (half-)edges around a vertex. It is called an \emph{inner corner} if it lies in an inner face, and an \emph{outer corner} otherwise.
The \emph{degree} of a vertex or face is its number of incident corners. A  \emph{$d$-angulation} is a plane map with all faces of degree $d$. A \emph{$d$-angulation of the $k$-gon} is a plane map with inner faces of degree $d$, and outer face of degree $k$. 
A graph is \emph{bipartite} if it admits a bicoloring of its vertices such that adjacent vertices have different colors. It is known that a plane map is bipartite if and only if all its faces have even degree. For $k\geq 2$, a graph is called \emph{$k$-connected} if it is connected and the deletion of any subset of $(k-1)$ vertices does not disconnect it (loops are forbidden for $k\geq 2$, multiple edges are forbidden for $k\geq 3$). 




Let $G$ be an undirected graph. An \emph{arc} of $G$ is an edge $e$ of $G$ together with a chosen orientation of $e$ (so each edge of $G$ correspond to two arcs). The arc \emph{opposite} to an arc $a$, denoted by $-a$, is the arc corresponding to the same edge as $a$ but with the opposite direction. 
The endpoints of an arc $a$ are called the \emph{initial} and \emph{terminal} vertices of $a$ (with $a$ oriented from the initial vertex to the terminal vertex).  If $v$ is the initial (resp. terminal) vertex of the arc $a$, then we say that $a$ is an \emph{outgoing arc} (resp. \emph{ingoing arc}) at $v$. 
\\

%In a graph, a \emph{walk} (of length $k$) is a sequence $v_1,e_1,v_2,\ldots,e_k,v_{k+1}$ that alternates vertices and edges, such that $e_i$ connects $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ for $i\in[k]$. It is called a \emph{closed walk} if $v_1=v_{k+1}$. 
%\OB{Made a change in the def of walk (talking about arcs instead). Should we call them ``paths'' rather than ``walks''?}
A \emph{path} in an undirected graph $G$ is a sequence of arcs $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$ such that the terminal vertex of $a_i$ is the initial vertex of $a_{i+1}$ for all $i\in[k-1]$. It is called a \emph{closed path} if the terminal vertex of $a_k$ is the initial vertex of $a_1$. A \emph{cycle} is a (cyclically ordered) closed path. A path or cycle is called \emph{simple} if it does not pass twice by the same vertex. The \emph{girth} of a graph is the minimum length of its simple cycles.   In a plane map, a closed path formed by the arcs around a face is called \emph{contour} of that face. It is known that face contours are simple cycles if the plane map is 2-connected. 
A simple cycle on a plane map is called \emph{counterclockwise} (resp. \emph{clockwise}) if the direction of arcs is counterclockwise (resp. clockwise) around the cycle.

Let $G$ be a graph.  Given an orientation of $G$, a \emph{directed path} (resp. \emph{directed cycle}) is a path (resp. cycle) $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$ such that every arc $a_i$ is oriented according to the orientation of $G$.
A \emph{weighted orientation} of $G$ is an assignment of a non-negative integer to each arc of $G$. Given a weighted orientation $\cW$ of $G$, we call \emph{weight} of an edge the sum of the weights of the two corresponding arcs. 
Weighted orientations are a generalization of the classical (unweighted) orientations of $G$. Indeed the ``unweighted'' orientations of $G$ can be identified to the weighted orientations of $G$ such that the weight of every edge is 1 (for each edge, the arc of weight 1 is taken as the orientation of the edge). The \emph{outgoing weight} (shortly, the \emph{weight}) of a vertex $v$ is the sum of the weights of the arcs going out of $v$. Given a weighted orientation, we call \emph{positive path} (resp. \emph{positive cycle}) a path (resp. cycle) $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$ such that the weight of every arc is positive (this generalizes the notion of \emph{directed path} and \emph{directed cycle}).  




A \emph{tree} is a connected, acyclic graph. For a tree $T$ with a vertex $v$ distinguished as its \emph{root}, we apply the usual ``genealogy'' vocabulary about trees, where $v$ is an \emph{ancestor} of all the other vertices, and every non-root vertex incident to $T$ has a \emph{parent} in $T$, etc. 
We say that we \emph{orient the tree $T$ toward its root} by orienting every edge from child to parent. With this orientation, every non-root vertex of $T$ is incident to one outgoing edge in $T$ (the edge leading to its parent).
%\OB{changed: calling ``subtree'' instead of ``tree''}
A \emph{subtree} of a graph $G$ is a subset of edges of $G$ such that this set of edges together with the incident vertices forms a tree. A \emph{spanning tree} of $G$ is a subtree of $G$ incident to every vertex of $G$.

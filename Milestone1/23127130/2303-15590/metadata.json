    "abstract": "One characteristic feature of many fractonic lattice models, and a defining property of the exotic field theories developed to describe them, are subsystem symmetries including a conservation of not just net electric charge but also electric dipole moments or charges living on submanifolds. So far all such theories were based on internal subsystem symmetries. In this work we generalize the notion of subsystem symmetries to system with subsystem spacetime symmetries with locally conserved energies.",

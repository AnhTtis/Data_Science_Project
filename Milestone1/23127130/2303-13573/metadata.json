    "abstract": "We report the discovery of ZTF J0127+5258, a compact mass-transferring binary with an orbital period of 13.7 minutes. The system contains a white dwarf accretor, which likely originated as a post-common envelope carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf, and a warm donor ($T_{\\rm eff,\\,donor}= 16,400\\pm1000\\,\\rm K$). The donor probably formed during a common envelope phase between the CO white dwarf and an evolving giant which left behind a helium star or helium white dwarf in a close orbit with the CO white dwarf. We measure gravitational wave-driven orbital inspiral with $\\sim 35σ$ significance, which yields a joint constraint on the component masses and mass transfer rate. While the accretion disk in the system is dominated by ionized helium emission, the donor exhibits a mixture of hydrogen and helium absorption lines. Phase-resolved spectroscopy yields a donor radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $771\\pm27\\,\\rm km\\, s^{-1}$, and high-speed photometry reveals that the system is eclipsing. We detect a {\\it Chandra} X-ray counterpart with $L_{X}\\sim 3\\times 10^{31}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. Depending on the mass-transfer rate, the system will likely evolve into either a stably mass-transferring helium CV, merge to become an R Crb star, or explode as a Type Ia supernova in the next million years. We predict that the Laser Space Interferometer Antenna (LISA) will detect the source with a signal-to-noise ratio of $24\\pm6$ after 4 years of observations. The system is the first \\emph{LISA}-loud mass-transferring binary with an intrinsically luminous donor, a class of sources that provide the opportunity to leverage the synergy between optical and infrared time domain surveys, X-ray facilities, and gravitational-wave observatories to probe general relativity, accretion physics, and binary evolution.",

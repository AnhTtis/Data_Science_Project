    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm used to train models across multiple nodes (i.e., clients) holding local data sets, without explicitly exchanging the data. It has attracted a growing interest in recent years due to its advantages in terms of privacy considerations, and communication resources. In FL, selected clients train their local models and send a function of the models to the server, which consumes a random processing and transmission time. The server updates the global model and broadcasts it back to the clients. The client selection problem in FL is to schedule a subset of the clients for training and transmission at each given time so as to optimize the learning performance. In this paper, we present a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based approach for client selection to minimize the training latency without harming the ability of the model to generalize, that is, to provide reliable predictions for new observations. We develop a novel algorithm to achieve this goal, dubbed Bandit Scheduling for FL (BSFL). We analyze BSFL theoretically, and show that it achieves a logarithmic regret, defined as the loss of BSFL as compared to a genie that has complete knowledge about the latency means of all clients. Furthermore, simulation results using synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that BSFL is superior to existing methods.",

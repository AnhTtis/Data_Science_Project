    "abstract": "The logic $\\mathcal L^1_κ$ was introduced by Shelah in [3]. In [4], he proved that for a strongly compact cardinal $κ$, it admits the following algebraic characterization: two structures are $\\mathcal L^1_κ$-equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic iterated ultrapowers via $κ$-complete ultrafilters. We give a presentation of the logic $\\mathcal L^1_κ$ and a simplified and slightly modified proof of this result.",

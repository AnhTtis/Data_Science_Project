    "abstract": "The stable critical points and their corresponding cosmology are derived in the teleparallel gravity with an added Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant term. We have analyzed the dynamics of the Universe by presenting two cosmological viable models, showing the potential to describe different phases of the evolution of the Universe. The value of the deceleration parameter ($q$), total equation of state parameter ($ω_{tot}$) and dark energy equation of state parameter ($ω_{DE}$) have been presented against each critical point. The existence and stability conditions are also presented. We study the behavior of the phase space trajectories at each critical point. Finally, the evolutionary behavior of the deceleration parameter and the equation of state parameters have been assessed with the initial condition of the dynamical variables, and compatibility has been observed in connection with the present cosmological scenario.",

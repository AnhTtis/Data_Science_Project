    "abstract": "Online Ramsey game is played between Builder and Painter on an infinite board $K_{\\mathbb N}$. In every round Builder selects an edge, then Painter colors it red or blue. Both know target graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$. Builder aims to create either a red copy of $H_1$ or a blue copy of $H_2$ in $K_{\\mathbb N}$ as soon as possible, and Painter tries to prevent it. The online Ramsey number $\\tilde{r}(H_1,H_2)$ is the minimum number of rounds such that the Builder wins. We study $\\tilde{r}(C_k,C_n)$ where $k$ is fixed and $n$ is large. We show that $\\tilde{r}(C_k,C_n)=2n+\\mathcal O(k)$ for an absolute constant $c$ if $k$ is even, while $\\tilde{r}(C_k,C_n)\\le 3n+o(n)$ if $k$ is odd.",

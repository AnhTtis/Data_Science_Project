ABSTRACT = {Large-scale quantum computing poses a major threat to classical public-key cryptography. Recently, strong &ldquo;quantum access&rdquo; security models have shown that numerous symmetric-key cryptosystems are also vulnerable. In this paper, we consider classical encryption in a model that grants the adversary quantum oracle access to encryption and decryption, but where we restrict the latter to non-adaptive (i.e., pre-challenge) queries only. We formalize this model using appropriate notions of ciphertext indistinguishability and semantic security (which are equivalent by standard arguments) and call it     QCCA 1     in analogy to the classical     CCA 1     security model. We show that the standard pseudorandom function (   PRF   )-based encryption schemes are     QCCA 1    -secure when instantiated with quantum-secure primitives. Our security proofs use a strong bound on quantum random-access codes with shared randomness. Revisiting plain     IND &minus; CPA    -secure Learning with Errors (   LWE   ) encryption, we show that leaking only a single quantum decryption query (and no other leakage or queries of any kind) allows the adversary to recover the full secret key with constant success probability. Information-theoretically, full recovery of the key in the classical setting requires at least a linear number of decryption queries. Our results thus challenge the notion that    LWE    is unconditionally &ldquo;just as secure&rdquo; quantumly as it is classically. The algorithm at the core of our attack is a new variant of the well-known Bernstein&ndash;Vazirani algorithm. Finally, we emphasize that our results should not be interpreted as a weakness of these cryptosystems in their stated security setting (i.e., post-quantum chosen-plaintext secrecy). Rather, our results mean that, if these cryptosystems are exposed to chosen-ciphertext attacks (e.g., as a result of deployment in an inappropriate real-world setting) then quantum attacks are even more devastating than classical ones.},

abstract = {We present a quantum algorithm for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem (DHSP) with
time and query complexity $2^{O(sqrt{log N})}$. In this problem an oracle computes
a function $f$ on the dihedral group $D_N$ which is invariant under a hidden reflection
in $D_N$. By contrast, the classical query complexity of DHSP is $O(sqrt{N})$.  The
algorithm also applies to the hidden shift problem for an arbitrary finitely generated
abelian group.The algorithm begins as usual with a quantum character transform, which
in the case of $D_N$ is essentially the abelian quantum Fourier transform. This yields
the name of a group representation of $D_N$, which is not by itself useful, and a
state in the representation, which is a valuable but indecipherable qubit. The algorithm
proceeds by repeatedly pairing two unfavorable qubits to make a new qubit in a more
favorable representation of $D_N$. Once the algorithm obtains certain target representations,
direct measurements reveal the hidden subgroup.},

In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here.

Our solution relies on the existence of a new cryptographic primitive for constraining the power of an untrusted quantum device: post-quantum secure trapdoor claw-free functions that must satisfy an adaptive hardcore bit property.

general quantum attacks. This includes the well-known Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson classical
zero-knowledge protocols for Graph Isomorphism and Graph 3-Coloring (assuming the
existence of quantum computationally concealing commitment schemes in the second case).
Also included is a quantum interactive protocol for a complete problem for the complexity
class of problems having "honest verifier" quantum statistical zero-knowledge proofs,
which therefore establishes that honest verifier and general quantum statistical zero-knowledge
are equal: QSZK = QSZKHV. Previously no non-trivial proof systems were known to be
zero-knowledge against quantum attacks, except in restricted settings such as the
honest-verifier and common reference string models. This paper therefore establishes
for the first time that true zero-knowledge is indeed possible in the presence of
quantum information and computation.},

A revocable timed-release encryption is one where, before the time T is over, the sender can “give back” the timed-release encryption, provably loosing all access to the data. We show that revocable timed-release encryption without trusted parties is possible using quantum cryptography (while trivially impossible classically).Along the way, we develop two proof techniques in the quantum random oracle model that we believe may have applications also for other protocols.Finally, we also develop another new primitive, unknown recipient encryption, which allows us to send a message to an unknown/unspecified recipient over an insecure network in such a way that at most one recipient will get the message.},

In practice, the main challenge in realizing quantum computers is that general, many-particle quantum states are highly sensitive to noise, which inevitably causes errors in quantum algorithms. Some noise sources are inherent to the current materials platforms. de Leon et al. review some of the materials challenges for five platforms for quantum computers and propose directions for their solution. Science, this issue p. eabb2823 Quantum computing hardware technologies have advanced during the past two decades, with the goal of building systems that can solve problems that are intractable on classical computers. The ability to realize large-scale systems depends on major advances in materials science, materials engineering, and new fabrication techniques. We identify key materials challenges that currently limit progress in five quantum computing hardware platforms, propose how to tackle these problems, and discuss some new areas for exploration. Addressing these materials challenges will require scientists and engineers to work together to create new, interdisciplinary approaches beyond the current boundaries of the quantum computing field. }

applications. In particular, based on the recent scheme by Cramer-Shoup, we construct
adaptively secure threshold cryptosystems secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext
attack under the DDH intractability assumption. Our techniques are also applicable
to other cryptosystems and signature schemes, like RSA, DSS, and ElGamal.Our techniques
include the first efficient implementation, for a wide but special class of protocols,
of secure channels in erasure-free adaptive model. Of independent interest, we present
the notion of a committed proof.},

abstract="Formulating cryptographic definitions to protect against software piracy is an important research direction that has not received much attention. Since natural definitions using classical cryptography are impossible to achieve (as classical programs can always be copied), this directs us towards using techniques from quantum computing. The seminal work of Aaronson [CCC'09] introduced the notion of quantum copy-protection precisely to address the problem of software anti-piracy. However, despite being one of the most important problems in quantum cryptography, there are no provably secure solutions of quantum copy-protection known for any class of functions.",

learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Applying known results on LWE, the security
of our scheme is based on the worst-case hardness of ``short vector problems'' on
arbitrary lattices. Our construction improves on previous works in two aspects:begin{enumerate}item
We show that ``somewhat homomorphic'' encryption can be based on LWE, using a new
{em re-linearization} technique. In contrast, all previous schemes relied on complexity
assumptions related to ideals in various rings. item We deviate from the "squashing
paradigm'' used in all previous works. We introduce a new {em dimension-modulus reduction}
technique, which shortens the cipher texts and reduces the decryption complexity of
our scheme, {em without introducing additional assumptions}. end{enumerate}Our scheme
has very short cipher texts and we therefore use it to construct an asymptotically
efficient LWE-based single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol. The
communication complexity of our protocol (in the public-key model) is $k cdot polylog(k)+log
dbs$ bits per single-bit query (here, $k$ is a security parameter).},

in order to perform cryptographic tasks. While the most well-known example of this
discipline is quantum key distribution (QKD), there exist many other applications
such as quantum money, randomness generation, secure two- and multi-party computation
and delegated quantum computation. Quantum cryptography also studies the limitations
and challenges resulting from quantum adversaries--including the impossibility of
quantum bit commitment, the difficulty of quantum rewinding and the definition of
quantum security models for classical primitives. In this review article, aimed primarily
at cryptographers unfamiliar with the quantum world, we survey the area of theoretical
quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on the constructions and limitations beyond
the realm of QKD.},

Our contributions include a new notion of trapdoor function with preimage sampling, simple and efficient "hash-and-sign" digital signature schemes, and identity-based encryption. A core technical component of our constructions is an efficient algorithm that, given a basis of an arbitrary lattice, samples lattice points from a discrete Gaussian probability distribution whose standard deviation is essentially the length of the longest Gram-Schmidt vector of the basis. A crucial security property is that the output distribution of the algorithm is oblivious to the particular geometry of the given basis.},

abstract = {Informally, an obfuscator O is an (efficient, probabilistic) “compiler” that takes as input a program (or circuit) P and produces a new program O(P) that has the same functionality as P yet is “unintelligible” in some sense. Obfuscators, if they exist, would have a wide variety of cryptographic and complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from software protection to homomorphic encryption to complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most of these applications are based on an interpretation of the “unintelligibility” condition in obfuscation as meaning that O(P) is a “virtual black box,” in the sense that anything one can efficiently compute given O(P), one could also efficiently compute given oracle access to P.In this work, we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that, even under very weak formalizations of the above intuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by constructing a family of efficient programs P that are unobfuscatable in the sense that (a) given any efficient program P' that computes the same function as a program P ∈ p, the “source code” P can be efficiently reconstructed, yet (b) given oracle access to a (randomly selected) program P ∈ p, no efficient algorithm can reconstruct P (or even distinguish a certain bit in the code from random) except with negligible probability.We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time, (b) only approximately preserve the functionality, and (c) only need to work for very restricted models of computation (TC0). We also rule out several potential applications of obfuscators, by constructing “unobfuscatable” signature schemes, encryption schemes, and pseudorandom function families.},

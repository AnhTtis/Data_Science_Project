abstract = {Recently, formal complexity-theoretic treatment of cryptographic hash functions was suggested. Two primitives of Collision-free hash functions and Universal one-way hash function families have been defined. The primitives have numerous applications in secure information compression, since their security implies that finding collisions is computationally hard. Most notably, Naor and Yung have shown that the most secure signature scheme can be reduced to the existence of universal one-way hash (this, in turn, gives the first trapdoor-less provably secure signature scheme).In this work, we first present reductions from various one-way function families to universal one-way hash functions. Our reductions are general and quite efficient and show how to base universal one-way hash functions on any of the known concrete candidates for one-way functions. We then show equivalences among various definitions of hardness for collision-free hash functions.},

The main property of this primitive is that given an element x. We prove constructively that universal one-way hash functions exist if any 1-1 one-way functions exist.Among the various applications of the primitive is a One-Way based Secure Digital Signature Scheme, a system which is based on the existence of any 1-1 One-Way Functions and is secure against the most general attack known. Previously, all provably secure signature schemes were based on the stronger mathematical assumption that trapdoor one-way functions exist.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the following question: what are the minimal assumptions needed to construct statistically-hiding commitment schemes? Naor et al. show how to construct such schemes based on any one-way permutation. We improve upon this by showing a construction based on any approximable preimage-size one-way function. These are one-way functions for which it is possible to efficiently approximate the number of pre-images of a given output. A special case is the class of regular one-way functions where all points in the image of the function have the same (known) number of pre-images.},

abstract="While unconditionally-secure quantum bit commitment (allowing both quantum computation and communication) is impossible, researchers turn to study the complexity-based one, a.k.a. computational quantum bit commitment. A computational canonical (non-interactive) quantum bit commitment scheme refers to a kind of schemes such that the commitment consists of just a single (quantum) message from the sender to the receiver that later can be opened by uncomputing the commit stage. In this work, we study general properties of computational quantum bit commitments through the lens of canonical quantum bit commitments. Among other results, we in particular obtain the following two: 1.Any computational quantum bit commitment scheme can be converted into the canonical (non-interactive) form (with its sum-binding property preserved).2.Two flavors of canonical quantum bit commitments are equivalent; that is, canonical computationally-hiding statistically-binding quantum bit commitment exists if and only if the canonical statistically-hiding computationally-binding one exists. Combining this result with the first one, it immediately implies (unconditionally) that computational quantum bit commitment is symmetric.",

abstract = {Starting from the one-way group action framework of Brassard and Yung (Crypto’90), we revisit building cryptography based on group actions. Several previous candidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on classical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g., discrete logarithm).We propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to build cryptography based on group actions. Recent works (Futorny–Grochow–Sergeichuk Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019) suggest that the underlying algorithmic problem, the tensor isomorphism problem, is the hardest one among several isomorphism testing problems arising from areas including coding theory, computational group theory, and multivariate cryptography. We present evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive study of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, hardness results, as well as quantum algorithms.We then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further develop group-action based cryptography. Briefly speaking, given a group G acting on a set S, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions of (s, t) either uniformly chosen from , or where s is randomly chosen from S and t is the result of applying a random group action of on s. This subsumes the classical Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption when specialized to a particular group action. We carefully analyze various attack strategies that support instantiating this assumption by the general linear group action on tensors.Finally, we construct several cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures and pseudorandom functions. We give quantum security proofs based on the one-way group action assumption and the pseudorandom group action assumption.},

The problem stems from (1) the difficulty of quantum rewinding, and (2) the inability of current techniques to adaptively program random oracles in the quantum setting.

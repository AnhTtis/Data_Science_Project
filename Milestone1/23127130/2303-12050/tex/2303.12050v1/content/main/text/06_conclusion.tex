% \todo{conclusion and limitations}

We have described a point-processing backbone, CurveCloudNet, which introduces curve-level operations to achieve efficient, versatile, and accurate performance on 3D perception tasks. CurveCloudNet shows state-of-the-art results on the ShapeNet, \kortx, nuScenes, and A2D2 datasets, exhibiting a trade-off between accuracy and memory budgets as well as a unified solution to \emph{both} small and large-scale scenes with various scanning patterns.

In future research, we intend to incorporate explicit curve-to-curve communication that can further improve accuracy and efficiency on large scenes. Additionally, we believe an exciting direction will be to explicitly incorporate geometric properties of polylines, such as surface tangents and normals along with their connectivity via intersections.

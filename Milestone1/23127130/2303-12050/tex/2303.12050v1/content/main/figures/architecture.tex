    \caption{\textit{CurveCloudNet Architecture.} The network employs a mix of curve and point layers to process a curve cloud through progressive down-sampling followed by up-sampling with skip connections. Curve layers operate on higher resolutions to efficiently capture the 1D structure, while at lower resolutions point layers propagate information across curves. Feature dimensions are listed above each block.}

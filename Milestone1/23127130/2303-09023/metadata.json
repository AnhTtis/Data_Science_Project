    "abstract": "Suppose that a random variable $X$ of interest is observed. This paper concerns \"the least favorable noise\" $\\hat{Y}_ε$, which maximizes the prediction error $E [X - E[X|X+Y]]^2 $ (or minimizes the variance of $E[X| X+Y]$) in the class of $Y$ with $Y$ independent of $X$ and $\\mathrm{var} Y \\leq ε^2$. This problem was first studied by Ernst, Kagan, and Rogers ([3]). In the present manuscript, we show that the least favorable noise $\\hat{Y}_ε$ must exist and that its variance must be $ε^2$. The proof of existence relies on a convergence result we develop for variances of conditional expectations. Further, we show that the function $\\inf_{\\mathrm{var} Y \\leq ε^2} \\, \\mathrm{var} \\, E[X|X+Y]$ is both strictly decreasing and right continuous in $ε$.",

    "abstract": "We discuss some perturbation results concerning certain pairs of sequences of vectors in a Hilbert space $\\Hil$ and producing new sequences which share, with the original ones, { reconstruction formulas on a dense subspace of $\\Hil$ or on the whole space}. We also propose some preliminary results on the same issue, but in a distributional settings.",

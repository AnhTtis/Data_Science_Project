               symmetries, it is possible for electron states at band-edges
               ('valleys') to have additional spin-like quantum numbers. An
               important question is whether coherent manipulation can be
               performed on such valley pseudospins, analogous to that
               implemented using true spin, in the quest for quantum
               technologies. Here, we show that valley coherence can be
               generated and detected. Because excitons in a single valley emit
               circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only be
               generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent
               superposition of the two valley states. Using monolayer
               semiconductor WSe2 devices, we first establish the circularly
               polarized optical selection rules for addressing individual
               valley excitons and trions. We then demonstrate coherence
               between valley excitons through the observation of linearly
               polarized luminescence, whose orientation coincides with that of
               the linearly polarized excitation, for any given polarization
               angle. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from
               trions is not observed to be linearly polarized, consistent with
               the expectation that the emitted photon polarization is
               entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address
               coherence, in addition to valley polarization, is a step forward
               towards achieving quantum manipulation of the valley index
               necessary for coherent valleytronics.",

               hybridization arising from moir{\'e} interference effects. Here,
               we report experimental and theoretical studies of excitons in
               twisted heterobilayers and heterotrilayers of transition metal
               dichalcogenides. Using MoSe2-WSe2 stacks as representative
               realizations of twisted van der Waals bilayer and trilayer
               heterostructures, we observe contrasting optical signatures and
               interpret them in the theoretical framework of interlayer
               moir{\'e} excitons in different spin and valley configurations.
               We conclude that the photoluminescence of MoSe2-WSe2

               radiatively decaying valley-direct interlayer excitons and

               spin-valley physics, make them promising for next-generation
               photonic and valleytronic devices. While the emission
               characteristics of interlayer excitons have been studied,
               efficient manipulation of their valley-state, a necessary
               requirement for information encoding, is still lacking. Here, we
               demonstrate comprehensive electrical control of interlayer
               excitons in a MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure. Encapsulation of our
               well-aligned stack with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows us
               to resolve two separate narrow interlayer transitions with
               opposite helicities under circularly polarized excitation,
               either preserving or reversing the polarization of incoming
               light. By electrically controlling their relative intensities,
               we realize a polarization switch with tuneable emission
               intensity and wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate large Zeeman
               shifts of these two transitions upon application of an external
               magnetic field. These results are interpreted within the picture
               of moir{\'e}-induced brightening of forbidden optical
               transitions. The ability to control the polarization of
               interlayer excitons is a step forward towards the manipulation

abstract = {Controlling the density of exciton and trion quasiparticles in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) materials at room temperature by nondestructive techniques is highly desired for the development of future optoelectronic devices. Here, the effects of different orbital angular momentum (OAM) lights on monolayer tungsten disulfide at both room temperature and low temperatures are investigated, which reveal simultaneously enhanced exciton intensity and suppressed trion intensity in the photoluminescence spectra with increasing topological charge of the OAM light. In addition, the trion-to-exciton conversion efficiency is found to increase rapidly with the OAM light at low laser power and decrease with increasing power. Moreover, the trion binding energy and the concentration of unbound electrons are estimated, which shed light on how these quantities depend on OAM. A phenomenological model is proposed to account for the experimental data. These findings pave a way toward manipulating the exciton emission in 2D materials with OAM light for optoelectronic applications. A light carrying an orbital angular momentum is used to suppress the trion quasiparticles in monolayer WS2 at room temperature.}}

    "abstract": "Several tiers of social organizations with varying economic and social disparities have been observed, such as bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and kingdoms. Noting that anthropologists emphasize gifts as drivers of social change, we introduce a simple model for gift interactions. Numerical results and the corresponding mean-field theory demonstrate the transition of the above four socioeconomic phases, characterized by wealth and reputation distribution following exponential or power-law. A novel mechanism for social evolution is provided, expanding the scope of econo- and socio-physics.",

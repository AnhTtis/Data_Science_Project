    "abstract": "When electrodynamics is quantized in a situation where electrons are confined to a flat surface, as in the case of graphene, one of the Maxwell's equations emerges as a local component of the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that, owing to the residual gauge invariance for the local Hamiltonian, nontrivial constraints on physical states arise. We construct two stationary quantum states with a zero energy expectation value: one replicates the scattering and absorption of light, a phenomenon familiar in classical optics, while the other is more fundamentally associated with photon creation. According to the Hamiltonian, these two states are inseparable, forming a two-state system. However, there exists a specific number of surfaces for which the two states become decoupled. This number is $2/πα$, where $πα$ is the absorption probability of a single surface. To explore the physics that can emerge in such decoupled cases, we investigate certain perturbations that can influence a two-state system based on symmetry considerations, utilizing concepts such as parity, axial (pseudo) gauge fields, and surface deformation.",

    "abstract": "In two previous papers we constructed new families of completely regular codes by concatenation methods. Here we determine cases in which the new codes are completely transitive. For these cases we also find the automorphism groups of such codes. For the remaining cases, we show that the codes are not completely transitive assuming an upper bound on the order of the monomial automorphism groups, according to computational results.",

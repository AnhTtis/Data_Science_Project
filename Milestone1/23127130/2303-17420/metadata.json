    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem of the multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Euler system for two-phase flow motion, which consists of the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations and the isothermal compressible Euler equations coupled with each other through a relaxation drag force. We first establish the local existence and uniqueness of the strong solution for general initial data in a critical homogeneous Besov space, and then prove the global existence of the solution if the initial data is a small perturbation of the equilibrium state. Moreover, under the additional condition that the low-frequency part of the initial perturbation also belongs to another Besov space with lower regularity, we obtain the optimal time-decay rates of the global solution toward the equilibrium state. These results imply that the relaxation drag force and the viscosity dissipation affect regularity properties and long time behaviors of solutions for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Euler system.",

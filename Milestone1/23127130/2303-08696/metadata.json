    "abstract": "We review some recent results concerning the Initial Value Problem of 1d-cubic non-linear Schrödinger equation (NLS) and other related systems as the Schrödinger Map. For the latter we prove the existence of a cascade of energy. Finally, some new examples of the Talbot effect at the critical level of regularity are given.",

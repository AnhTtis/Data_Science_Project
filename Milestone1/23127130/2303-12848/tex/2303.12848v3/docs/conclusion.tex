We have presented a novel test-time defense called DRAM against (previously unknown) adversarial attacks. By using the self-supervision task MAE, \sys effectively detects and repairs the adversarial samples during the inference time. Results show that \sys achieves an average 82\% detection score on eight previously unseen attacks. Our method for attack repair improved the robust accuracy of ResNet50 by up to 40\% and 8\% under standard and robust training after repair. In addition, we show \sys is possible to defend against a defense-aware attack and delineate the trade-off between the attack budgets of the self-supervision task and the classification task. Overall, \sys improves the robust accuracy across multi-type of adversarial attacks at the inference time, which provides new insight into the frontier of test-time defense for unseen attacks.

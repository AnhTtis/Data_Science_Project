 abstract = {The test is based on the maximum difference between an empirical and a hypothetical cumulative distribution. Percentage points are tabled, and a lower bound to the power function is charted. Confidence limits for a cumulative distribution are described. Examples are given. Indications that the test is superior to the chi-square test are cited.},

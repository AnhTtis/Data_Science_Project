We present a novel test-time defense approach \sys for defending against unknown adversarial attacks. By combining the self-supervised objective with MAE, \sys effectively detects and reconstructs the adversarial samples during the inference time. The experiment results demonstrated that our method achieved an average 82\% detection score on unknown attack types. Our reconstruction method improved the robust accuracy of ResNet50 by up to 40\% and 8\% under normal and robust training after reconstruction. In addition, we show \sys is possible to defend against the defense-aware attack and delineate the trade-off between the attack budgets of the self-supervision task and the classification task. Overall, we reconstruct and improve robust accuracy across multi-type of adversarial attacks which provide new insight into the frontier of test-time defense for unseen adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "We study the impact of dependence uncertainty on the expectation of the product of $d$ random variables, $\\mathbb{E}(X_1X_2\\cdots X_d)$ when $X_i \\sim F_i$ for all~$i$. Under some conditions on the $F_i$, explicit sharp bounds are obtained and a numerical method is provided to approximate them for arbitrary choices of the $F_i$. The results are applied to assess the impact of dependence uncertainty on coskewness. In this regard, we introduce a novel notion of \"standardized rank coskewness,\" which is invariant under strictly increasing transformations and takes values in $[-1,\\ 1]$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for global-in-time existence of classical solutions for the fully parabolic chemorepulsion system posed on a convex, bounded three-dimensional domain. Our main result establishes global-in-time existence of regular nonnegative solutions provided that $\\nabla\\sqrt{u} \\in L^4(0, T; L^2(Ω))$. Our method is related to the Bakry--Émery calculation and appears to be new in this context.",

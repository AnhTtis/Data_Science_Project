    "abstract": "For random systems of $K$ polynomials in $N + 1$ real variables which include the models of Kostlan (1987) and Shub and Smale (1992), we prove that the number of zeros for $K = N$ or the volume of the zero set for $K < N$ on the unit sphere concentrates around its mean as $N\\to\\infty$. To prove concentration we show that the variance of the latter random variable normalized by its mean goes to zero. The polynomial systems we consider depend on a choice of a set of parameters which determine the variance of their Gaussian coefficients. We prove that the convergence is uniform in those parameters and K.",

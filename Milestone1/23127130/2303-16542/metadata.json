    "abstract": "The accurate thermoelastic properties and thermal conductivity are crucial in understanding the thermal evolution of the Martian core. A fitting method based on the ab initio calculated pressure-volume-temperature data is proposed in the formulation of the equation of state with high accuracy, by which the pressure and temperature dependent thermoelastic properties can be directly calculated by definitions. The ab initio results show that the liquid Fe0.75S0.25 under Martian core condition is thoroughly in the ferromagnetic state, without existing spin crossover. The liquid Fe0.75S0.25 in magnetic calculation owns a low thermal conductivity (21~23 W/m/K) when compared with non-magnetic calculation at the same state. Based on the Insight estimated and ab initio calculated properties of the Martian core, the iron snow model is verified when the current temperature at the core-mantle boundary is below the core melting temperature, and the simply secular cooling model is verified on the contrary.",

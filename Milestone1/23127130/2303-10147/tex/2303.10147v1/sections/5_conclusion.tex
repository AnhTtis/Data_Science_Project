\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present \net as the first approach for online continual learning for joint monocular depth estimation and panoptic segmentation. \net enables the vision system of a robotic platform to continually enhance its performance in an online fashion.
In particular, we propose a new cross-domain mixing strategy to adapt panoptic segmentation combining annotated source data with unlabeled images from a target domain. 
To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, \net leverages experience replay using a buffer composed of source and target samples.
Unlike prior works, we explicitly address the limited memory capacity of robotic platforms by setting a fixed size for the replay buffer. To ensure distinct replay samples, we use rare class sampling on the source set and employ image-based diversity sampling when updating the target buffer.
Using extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that \net outperforms competitive baselines while avoiding catastrophic forgetting in the online continual learning setting.
Future work will explore cross-task synergies and the use of pretext tasks for domain adaptation.

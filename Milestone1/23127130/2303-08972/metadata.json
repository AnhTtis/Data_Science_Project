    "abstract": "Manipulating nonlinear excitations, including solitons and vortices, is an essential topic in quantum many-body physics. A recent progress in this direction is a new protocol proposed in [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 043256 (2020)] to produce dark solitons in a one-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by quenching inter-atomic interaction. Motivated by this work, we generalize the protocol to a two-dimensional BEC and investigate the general scenario of its post-quench dynamics. For an isotropic disk trap with a hard-wall boundary, we find that successive inward-moving ring dark solitons (RDSs) can be induced from the edge, and the number of RDSs can be controlled by tuning the ratio of the after- and before-quench interaction strength across different critical values. The role the quench played on the profiles of the density, phase, and sound velocity is also investigated. Due to the snake instability, the RDSs then become vortex-antivortex pairs with peculiar dynamics managed by the initial density and the after-quench interaction. By tuning the geometry of the box traps, demonstrated as polygonal ones, more subtle dynamics of solitons and vortices are enabled. Our proposed protocol and the discovered rich dynamical effects on nonlinear excitations can be realized in future cold-atom experiments.",

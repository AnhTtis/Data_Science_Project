\section{Problem Formulation}

We consider the problem of estimating an unknown object's pose while simultaneously reconstructing its shape.
Given as inputs a tactile image collected from the finger and a RGB image collected from a wrist-mounted camera, FingerSLAM estimates the object's 6-DoF pose $P_t \in SE(3)$ and reconstructs its shape as a point cloud $S_t$ incrementally, at each time step $t$.
We show our hardware setup and sample images in Fig. \ref{datacollection}.

Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only one object is present in the same sequence.
    \item The object is rigid.
    \item The object is always in contact with the finger, and it is always inside the wrist-mounted camera's view.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized with our approach for pose estimation and reconstruction in Sec. \ref{sec:approach} and the discussion of performance on evaluated objects in Sec. \ref{sec:eval}.

    "abstract": "We consider a model of dark photon which appears as a result of the successive symmetry breaking SU(2)$\\,\\to\\,$U(1)$\\,\\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where various types of topological defects appear in the dark sector. In this paper, we study the interactions between QED charges and the dark topological defects through mixing between QED photon and dark photon. In particular, we extend our previous analysis by incorporating the magnetic mixing and $θ$-terms. We also consider the dyons and dyonic beads in the dark sector. Notably, dark magnetic/dyonic beads are found to induce a QED Coulomb potential through the magnetic mixing despite finite mass of the dark photon.",

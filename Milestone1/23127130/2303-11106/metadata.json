    "abstract": "An error in the original paper is identified and corrected. The C*-algebras with approximately inner flip, which satisfy the UCT, are identified (and turn out to be fewer than what is claimed in the original paper). The action of the flip map on K-theory turns out to be more subtle, involving a minus sign in certain components. To this end, we introduce new geometric resolutions for C*-algebras, which do not involve index shifts in K-theory and thus allow for a more explicit description of the quotient map in the Künneth formula for tensor products.",

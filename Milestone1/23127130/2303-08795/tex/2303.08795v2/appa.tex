\section{Discovery image cutouts at the locations of the identified nova candidates}
In Figures \ref{fig:known_nova_cutouts} and \ref{fig:unknown_nova_cutouts}, we show the science, template and difference image triplets for all the novae that passed our thresholds. For each source, we show the epoch corresponding to the epoch of brightest detection in the $W1$/$W2$ band. Several sources are close to the nominal saturation threshold of WISE at their peak brightness, and the transient sources show clear artifacts from diffraction spikes.

\section{WISE light curves of known novae that were excluded in the search}
\label{sec:appendix}
Given the selection criteria and identification methods in our WISE search, a number of previously confirmed novae did not pass our thresholds and were therefore excluded from our demographic analysis. However, a number of these sources have clear detections in WISE data when performing forced photometry at the known sky locations. In this section, we provide for completeness, WISE $W1$/$W2$ light curves of all these novae and briefly discuss their properties. As mentioned in the main text, the excluded novae constitute a combination of fast fading events that were not detected in multiple visits of WISE, events that had prior history of variability and were excluded or were not recovered due to the inefficiencies of the subtraction pipeline. First, the sources V1660\,Sco, V1707\,Sco, V3730\,Oph, V3663\,Oph and V5850\,Sgr were not detected in a single epoch of WISE forced photometry, suggesting that they faded too quickly to be included in the sample. Although V6567\,Sgr erupted within the search period, the first WISE observations of the source were acquired in 2021 and therefore excluded from our sample.  Next, the sources ASASSN\,17no, V1658\,Sco, V2860\,Ori, V3661\,Oph, V5854\,Sgr, V611\,Sct, V613\,Sct, V670\,Ser, V1657\,Sco, V556\,Nor and Gaia\,20dfb are faster novae that were detected in at least one epoch, but faded too quickly by the time of the second epoch such that the SNR threshold or magnitude cut requirement was not satisfied at the second epoch (though the transient many have been formally detected in forced photometry). V1535\,Sco, V3890\,Sgr and V3664\,Oph are symbiotic novae coincident with bright evolved stars, and have variability prior to the nova outburst and therefore were excluded by the selection. V392\,Per exhibited a dwarf nova outburst several years prior to the nova and did not pass our selection. The slowly evolving / brightening (instead of fading) MIR light curves of V1709\,Sco, V5856\,Sgr and V906\,Car were excluded from our selection for fast fading outbursts. The sources V612\,Sct, V555\,Nor, V3662\,Oph, V2000\,Aql, and V1662\,Sco have light curves in forced photometry that would formally pass our cuts; however the imperfect detection efficiency of our pipeline led to incomplete recovery of the transient in some epochs, leading to these sources being excluded from our search. The sources V3731\,Oph, V2949\,Oph, V1663\,Sco and V1659\,Sco were masked out in the pipeline due to their proximity to a very bright star ($< 8$\,mag) in the template WISE images. We attempt to incorporate the last two effects with our simulations of the pipeline efficiency in Section \ref{sec:rate}.

The first detection of the nova above the SNR threshold of 15 is marked by a blue dashed line. In several cases, the history of activity prior to the main outburst is due to artifacts introduced by the presence of nearby bright stars or due to intrinsic variability from the donors in symbiotic novae and previous dwarf nova outbursts.}

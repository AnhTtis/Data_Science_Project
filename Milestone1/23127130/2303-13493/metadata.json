    "abstract": "Fog computing allows computationally-heavy problems with tight time constraints to be solved even if end devices have limited computational resources and latency induced by cloud computing is too high. How can energy consumed by fog computing be saved while obeying latency constraints and considering not only computations but also transmission through wireless and wired links? This work examines the latency and energy consumption sources in fog networks and discusses models describing these costs for various technologies. Next, resource allocation strategies are discussed considering the various degrees of freedom available in such a complex system, and their influence on energy consumption and latency. Finally, a vision for a future distributed, AI-driven resources allocation strategy is presented and justified.",

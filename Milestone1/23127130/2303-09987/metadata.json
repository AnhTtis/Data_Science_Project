    "abstract": "Tumour heterogeneity in breast cancer poses challenges in predicting outcome and response to therapy. Spatial transcriptomics technologies may address these challenges, as they provide a wealth of information about gene expression at the cell level, but they are expensive, hindering their use in large-scale clinical oncology studies. Predicting gene expression from hematoxylin and eosin stained histology images provides a more affordable alternative for such studies. Here we present BrST-Net, a deep learning framework for predicting gene expression from histopathology images using spatial transcriptomics data. Using this framework, we trained and evaluated 10 state-of-the-art deep learning models without utilizing pretrained weights for the prediction of 250 genes. To enhance the generalisation performance of the main network, we introduce an auxiliary network into the framework. Our methodology outperforms previous studies, with 237 genes identified with positive correlation, including 24 genes with a median correlation coefficient greater than 0.50. This is a notable improvement over previous studies, which could predict only 102 genes with positive correlation, with the highest correlation values ranging from 0.29 to 0.34.",

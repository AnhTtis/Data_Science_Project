    "abstract": "The next generation of computer engineers and scientists must be proficient in not just the technical knowledge required to analyze, optimize, and create emerging microelectronics systems, but also with the skills required to make ethical decisions during design. Teaching computer ethics in computing curricula is therefore becoming an important requirement with significant ramifications for our increasingly connected and computing-reliant society. In this paper, we reflect on the many challenges and questions with effectively integrating ethics into modern computing curricula. We describe a case study of integrating ethics modules into the computer engineering curricula at Colorado State University.",

\begin{abstract}
% Gaining popularity
As Large Language Models (LLMs) become popular, there emerged an important trend of using multimodality to augment the LLMs' generation ability, which enables LLMs to better interact with the world.
% importance of survey
However, there lacks a unified perception of at which stage and how to incorporate different modalities.
% Survey content
In this survey, we review methods that assist and augment generative models by retrieving multimodal knowledge, whose formats range from images, codes, tables, graphs, to audio.
Such methods offer a promising solution to important concerns such as factuality, reasoning, interpretability, and robustness. 
% Survey contributions
By providing an in-depth review, this survey is expected to provide scholars with a deeper understanding of the methods' applications and encourage them to adapt existing techniques to the fast-growing field of LLMs.

\section{Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation}
\vspace{-1ex}

For each modality, there are different retrieval and synthesis procedures, targeted tasks, and challenges. Therefore, we discuss relevant methods by grouping them in terms of modality, including image, code, structured knowledge, audio, and video.

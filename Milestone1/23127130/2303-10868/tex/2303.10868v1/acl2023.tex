\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In this survey, we review methods that retrieve multimodal knowledge to assist and augment generative models. This group of works focuses on retrieving grounding contexts from external sources, including images, codes, tables, graphs, and audio. As multimodal learning and generative AI have become more and more impactful, such retrieval augmentation offers a promising solution to important concerns such as factuality, reasoning, interpretability, and robustness. We provide an in-depth review of retrieval-augmented generation in different modalities and discuss potential future directions. As this is an emerging field, we continue to add new papers and methods.

\section{Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation}

As there are different retrieval and synthesis procedures, targeted tasks, and challenges for each modality, we discuss relevant methods by grouping them in terms of modality, including image, code, structured knowledge, audio, and video.

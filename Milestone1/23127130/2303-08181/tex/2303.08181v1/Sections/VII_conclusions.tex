\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented  GaPT, a scalable and fast toolkit for state space GPs. This method shows superior computational performance compared to a classical GP inference approach on both single and multi-input settings especially for large datasets. \projectName~ enables easy exporting of GPs into C++ functions allowing direct integration in common robotics libraries enabling real-time inference speed even on embedded platforms used on SWaP-constrained aerial robots. \projectName~ incorporates both single of multiple inputs solutions. The latter further improves the inference capabilities of the proposed approach. Future works will involve adding additional kernels into the Toolkit such as spectral mixture or deep state-space models which can better capture complex patterns. This process will also be facilitated by the open source implementation that the robotics community can leverage to collaborate by adding additional functionalities that may be helpful for different purposes. Furthermore, we will show the integration of our method in various additional robotic use cases such as for control in aggressive maneuvers~\cite{mao2022robust}, calculating safety sets, or exploiting the full power of model predictive control with online refined learned dynamics.

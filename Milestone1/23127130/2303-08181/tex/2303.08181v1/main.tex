\begin{abstract}
Gaussian Processes (GPs) are expressive models for capturing signal statistics and expressing prediction uncertainty. As a result, the robotics community has gathered interest in leveraging these methods for inference, planning, and control. 
Unfortunately, despite providing a closed-form inference solution, GPs are non-parametric models that typically scale cubically with the dataset size, hence making them difficult to be used especially on onboard Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. In addition, the integration of popular libraries with GPs for different kernels is not trivial. 
In this paper, we propose GaPT, a novel toolkit that converts GPs to their state space form and performs regression in linear time.
GaPT is designed to be highly compatible with several optimizers popular in robotics.
We thoroughly validate the proposed approach for learning quadrotor dynamics on both single and multiple input GP settings.
GaPT accurately captures the system behavior in multiple flight regimes and operating conditions, including those producing highly nonlinear effects such as aerodynamic forces and rotor interactions.
Moreover, the results demonstrate the superior computational performance of GaPT compared to a classical GP inference approach on both single and multi-input settings especially when considering large number of data points, enabling real-time regression speed on embedded platforms used on SWaP-constrained aerial robots.
% Moreover, the results demonstrate comparable predictive performance of GaPT compared to a classical GP baseline on both single and multi input settings, but at the fraction of the computational cost enabling real-time inference speed.
% Moreover, the results demonstrate the high predictive performance of the proposed for both single and multiple input cases, as well as the ability to provide real-time inference speed even on embedded platforms used on SWaP-constrained aerial robots.
%To verify our claims, we verified the speed of our inference with respect to a traditional method on both a laptop and an embedded platform. Next, we also proved that our performance is high on robotic datasets. Finally, we showed the effectiveness of the toolbox for handling multiple inputs  and  that combining inputs gives a higher predicitive performance. %Finally, we showed integration into an MPC for quadrotor dynamics.% We thoroughly validate the proposed approach in several learning quadrotor dynamic problems by also considering multiple inputs GP cases, to capture the system behavior in multiple flight regimes and operating conditions, including those producing highly nonlinear effects such as aerodynamic forces and torques, and rotor interactions.

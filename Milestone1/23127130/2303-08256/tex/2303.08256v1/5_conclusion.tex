\section{Conclusion}

Reasoning high-level abstractions from bit-blasted BNs has benefited functional verification, logic minimization, datapath synthesis, malicious logic identification, etc.
In this work, we propose a novel symbolic reasoning framework, \textsc{Gamora}, which exploits GNNs to imitate structural hashing and functional aggregation in conventional reasoning approaches.
Evaluation shows that 
(1) with the proposed multi-task GNN model, \textsc{Gamora} offers \textbf{high reasoning precision} that reaches almost 100\% and over 97\% accuracy for CSA and Booth-encoded multipliers, which is still over 92\% in finding functional modules after complex technology mapping;
(2) with GPU acceleration on graph learning, \textsc{Gamora} has \textbf{strong scalability} to BNs with over 33 million nodes, with up to \textbf{six orders of magnitude speedups} compared to the state-of-the-art implementation in the ABC framework; 
(3) \textsc{Gamora} also demonstrates {\bf great generalization capability} from simple to complex designs, such as from small to large bitwidth multipliers, and from before to after technology mapping. 
\textsc{Gamora} reveals the great potential of applying GNNs and GPU acceleration to speed up symbolic reasoning.

% We comprehensively analyze the impacts from design complexity and different technology mapping on the reasoning performance of \textsc{Gamora}.

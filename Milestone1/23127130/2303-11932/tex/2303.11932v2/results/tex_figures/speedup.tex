    \textbf{Faster training by guiding at later layers.} While input-level attributions tend to be more detailed (cf.~\cref{fig:teaser2}), they are costlier to compute than attributions at later layers. However, we find that guidance at later layers (\eg @Mid3) also significantly improves input-level attributions, yielding similar \epg results as input-level guidance (@Input) at up to twice the training speed; for \iou results, see supplement.

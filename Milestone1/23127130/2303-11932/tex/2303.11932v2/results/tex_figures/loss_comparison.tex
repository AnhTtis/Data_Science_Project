    \caption{\textbf{Loss comparison} for input attributions (atts.) of a \bcos model. We show atts.~before (baseline, col.~2) and after guidance (cols.~3-6) for a specific image (col.~1) and its bounding box annotation. We find that \epgloss and \rrrloss yield sparse atts, whereas \lone yields smoother atts, as it is optimized to fill the entire bounding box. For \ppceloss we observe only a minor effect on the atts.

    \caption{\textbf{\epg results with limited annotations} for a \bcos model at the input layer, optimized with the \epgloss and the \lone loss. Using bounding box annotations for as little as 1\% (left) of the images yields significant improvements in \epg, and with 10\% (center) similar gains as in the fully annotated setting (right) are obtained.

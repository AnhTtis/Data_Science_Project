    \caption{\textbf{Qualitative \waterbirds results.} Without guidance, a model might focus on the background to classify birds (baseline) and thus misclassify waterbirds on land (col.~2). Guided models can correct such errors and focus on the desired feature: in cols.~3+4 (5+6) the model is guided to classify by using the bird (background) features and arrives at the desired prediction. Model predictions and confidence scores are indicated below the images.

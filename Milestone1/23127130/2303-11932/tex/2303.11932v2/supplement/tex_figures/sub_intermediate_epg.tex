    \caption{\textbf{Intermediate layer results comparing \epg vs.~F1.} We compare the effectiveness of model guidance at varying network depths (\textbf{rows}) for each attribution method and model (\textbf{columns}) across localization loss functions. For the \bcos model, we find similar trends at all network depths, with the \energyloss localization loss outperforming all other losses. For the \vanilla and \xdnn models, the \energyloss loss similarly performs the best, but we also observe improved performance across losses when optimizing at deeper layers of the network. Full results can be found in \cref{fig:intermediate:epg,fig:intermediate:iou}.}

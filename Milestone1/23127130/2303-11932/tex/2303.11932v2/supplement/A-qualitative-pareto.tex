\subsection{Visualizing the Pareto front}
\label{supp:sec:main:qualitative:pareto}
To better understand the differences between models across the Pareto fronts (cf.\ \cref{fig:epg_voc,fig:epg_coco}), in \cref{fig:supp:pareto_front_quali} we show the attribution maps of all \bcos models that are optimized via the \epgloss loss at the input layer, which lie on the Pareto front for the \cocos dataset for multiple examples (rows). In the columns, we plot the attributions from the models on the Pareto front, ordered in decreasing order of \epg score (\ie in the same left-to-right order as shown in \cref{fig:supp:pareto_front_quali:b}). We find a clear correspondence between the \epg score and how much the attributions visually appear to `focus' on the object bounding box.

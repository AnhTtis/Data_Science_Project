    \caption{\textbf{Intermediate layer results comparing \iou vs.~F1.} We compare the effectiveness of model guidance at varying network depths (\textbf{rows}) for each attribution method and model (\textbf{columns}) across localization loss functions. We find similar trends across all configurations, with the \lone  loss outperforming all other losses. For the \vanilla and \xdnn models,  we observe improved performance across losses when optimizing at deeper layers of the network, whereas the results seem very stable for the \bcos models. For \epg results, see \cref{fig:intermediate:epg}.}

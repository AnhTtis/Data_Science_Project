    \caption{\textbf{Selecting models for evaluation.} For each configuration, we evaluate every model at every checkpoint and measure its performance across various metrics (\fone, \epg, \iou) on the validation set; \ie every point in the left graph corresponds to one model (for \bcos models optimized via the \epgloss loss at the input layer). Instead of evaluating a single model on the test set, we evaluate \emph{all Pareto-dominant} models, as indicated in the center and right plot.

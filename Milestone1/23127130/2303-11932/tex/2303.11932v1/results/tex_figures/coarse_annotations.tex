    \caption{\textbf{Quantitative results for dilated bounding boxes} for a \bcos model at the input layer.
    We show \epg  and \iou (top and bottom) results for models trained with various amounts of annotation errors (increasingly large bounding boxes, see \cref{fig:dilation_comp}). The \epgloss loss yields highly consistent results despite training with heavily dilated bounding boxes (left), whereas the results of the \lone loss (right) worsen markedly.

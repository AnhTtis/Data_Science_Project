    \caption{\textbf{Qualitative results of model guidance.} We show model-inherent \bcos explanations (input layer) of a \bcos \resnet and \gradcam explanations (final layer) of a conventional \resnet before (`Standard') and after optimization (`Guided') for images from the \vocs test set, using our proposed \epgloss loss (\cref{eq:energyloss}). Guiding the model via bounding box annotations consistently increases the focus on object features for both methods. 
    Specifically, we find that background attributions are consistently suppressed in both cases.

    "abstract": "A small-$x$ helicity evolution has been derived in 2016-18 and received an important modification in 2022. This proceedings discusses the setup and summarizes recent results of the theoretical development, including the asymptotic behavior of helicity PDFs and $g_1$ structure function at small $x$. The recent fits to various polarized scattering data are also discussed, together with similar calculations that follow from the same framework. The results from this research program will provide important theoretical inputs for the future polarized small-$x$ measurements at the electron-ion collider (EIC).",

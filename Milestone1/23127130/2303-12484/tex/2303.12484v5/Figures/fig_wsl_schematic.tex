	\caption{Overview of weakly-supervised learning paradigm which addresses the \textit{inexact label} scenario. On the annotation side, annotation-efficient learning strategy aims to maximize the utility of limited or partially annotated data while minimizing annotation burden. On the task side, multi-instance learning strategy aims to bridge the label granularity gap by inferring fine-grained predictions from coarse supervision.

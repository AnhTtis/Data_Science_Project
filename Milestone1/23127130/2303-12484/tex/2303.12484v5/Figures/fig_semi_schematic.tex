	\caption{Overview of Semi-supervised learning (Semi-SL) paradigm which addresses the \textit{insufficient label} scenario. Semi-SL leverages a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to jointly train a model. The goal is to ensure prediction consistency between labeled and unlabeled examples, typically by optimizing a combination of supervised ($\mathcal{L}_{sup}$) and unsupervised ($\mathcal{L}_{unsup}$) loss functions.} \label{fig_semi_schematic}

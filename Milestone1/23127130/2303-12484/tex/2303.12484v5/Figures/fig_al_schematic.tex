	\caption{Overview of the active learning (AL) paradigm, which addresses the \textit{label refinement} scenario. AL iteratively trains a model by employing informative sampling strategies to select and annotate the most valuable unlabeled samples, thereby maximizing model performance under a limited annotation budget.}

	\caption{Overview of self-supervised learning (Self-SL) paradigm which addresses the \textit{no label} scenario. Self-SL aims to learn a pre-trained model by developing various proxy tasks based solely on unlabeled data. Then the pre-trained model can be fine-tuned on different downstream tasks with labeled datasets.}

	\caption{Overview of active learning paradigm. In a cycle, a deep learning model $f$ is trained from a labeled medical dataset $X_L$. Then, active sampling strategies based on different criteria (i.e., data uncertainty $\mathcal{U}(X_U)$, model uncertainty $\mathcal{U}(f)$) are implemented to select the data that is most valuable to the model from unlabeled medical dataset $X_U$. Finally, oracles are employed to annotate the selected data.

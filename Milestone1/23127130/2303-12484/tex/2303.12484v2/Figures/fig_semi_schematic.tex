	\caption{Overview of semi-supervised learning paradigm. Semi-SL includes a small set of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to conduct learning jointly, aiming at leveraging the unlabeled data to boost learning performance. Semi-SL typically seeks to optimize the combination of a supervised loss function $\mathcal{L}_{sup}$ and an unsupervised loss function $\mathcal{L}_{unsup}$.  }

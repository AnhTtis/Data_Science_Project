	\caption{Overview of multi-instance learning paradigm. %Take WSIs for example. 
    The inputs are cut into patches and selected patches are used to form bags, in which each patch is an instance. Given the bag-level labels, the model are trained to predict the category of bags, instances, and/or the original inputs.}

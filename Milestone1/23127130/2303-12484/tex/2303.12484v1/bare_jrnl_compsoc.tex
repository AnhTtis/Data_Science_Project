% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:

%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.

% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.




\usepackage{multirow}

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
  \usepackage{cite}

  \usepackage{amsfonts}
  \usepackage{amsmath}
  \usepackage{captcont}
  \usepackage{threeparttable}
  \usepackage{url}
\else
  % normal IEEE
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array
\usepackage{tablefootnote}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{longtable}

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Deep learning has seen rapid growth in recent years and achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications. However, training models typically requires expensive and time-consuming collection of large quantities of labeled data. This is particularly true within the scope of medical imaging analysis (MIA), where data are limited and labels are expensive to be acquired. Thus, label-efficient deep learning methods are developed to make comprehensive use of the labeled data as well as the abundance of  unlabeled and weak-labeled data. In this survey, we extensively investigated over 300 recent papers to provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress on label-efficient learning strategies in MIA. We first present the background of label-efficient learning and categorize the approaches into different schemes. Next, we examine the current state-of-the-art methods in detail through each scheme. Specifically, we provide an in-depth investigation, covering not only canonical semi-supervised, self-supervised, and multi-instance learning schemes, but also recently emerged active and annotation-efficient learning strategies. Moreover, as a comprehensive contribution to the field, this survey not only elucidates the commonalities and unique features of the surveyed methods but also presents a detailed analysis of the current challenges in the field and suggests potential avenues for future research.

% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

\IEEEPARstart{C}{omputer-aided} medical image analysis (MIA) plays a more and more critical role in achieving efficiency and accuracy in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. In recent years, MIA systems powered by deep learning (DL) have provided a more objective approach to learning from large and heterogeneous medical image datasets and improved disease diagnosis accuracy. However, DL models requires abundant precisely annotated data to effectively capture anatomical heterogeneity and disease-specific traits\cite{yu2021convolutional} due to their data-driven nature. Unfortunately, due to a shortage of available annotators\cite{lu2020national}, there is a significant gap between the demand for annotation and the available annotated datasets. Therefore, the need to minimize annotation costs, accelerate the annotation process, and reduce the burden on annotators has become a critical challenge in DL-based MIA tasks. While conventional fully-supervised DL methods rely on only fully annotated datasets. Recently, strategies based on semi-supervised, self-supervised, and multi-instance learning have been widely utilized to maximize the utility of existing medical data that may be only partially annotated by point, scribble, box, pixel-wise, \textit{etc.} or even completely unannotated data. In this paper, we dub these methods as label-efficient learning.  
As seen in Fig. \ref{fig_trend}, label-efficient learning methods have significantly proliferated in recent years. Meanwhile, label-efficient learning methods excelling in other MIA tasks like denoising, image registration, and super-resolution have also been rising beyond common classification, segmentation, and detection.
\input{Figures/fig_trend.tex} 

\input{Figures/fig_taxonomy}
Several surveys related to label-efficient learning in medical image analysis have been published in recent years. Cheplygina \textit{et al.} \cite{cheplygina2019not} categorized methods under supervised, semi-supervised, multi-instance, and transfer learning and named them "not-so-supervised" learning, while Budd \textit{et al.} \cite{budd2021survey} surveyed human-in-the-loop strategies for MIA tasks. However, methods in these surveys are either limited in scope or lag behind the current trends. 
To address this issue, we conduct a systematic review of current label-efficient methodologies, of which the outline is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig_taxonomy}.
Aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and future challenges of label-efficient learning methods in MIA, we review more than 300 quality-assured and recent label-efficient learning methods based on semi-supervised, multi-instance, self-supervised, active, and annotation-efficient learning strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review in the field of label-efficient MIA. In each learning scheme, we formulate the fundamental problem, offer the necessary background, and display the evaluation results case by case. With the challenges proposed at the end of the survey, we explore feasible future directions in several branches to potentially enlighten the follow-up research on label-efficient learning.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, the necessary background and categorization is presented. In Sections \ref{sec:semi}--\ref{sec:anno}, we introduce the primary label-efficient learning schemes in MIA, including semi-supervised learning in Section \ref{sec:semi}, self-supervised learning in Section \ref{sec:ssl}, multi-instance learning in Section \ref{sec: mil}, active learning in Section \ref{sec:al}, and annotation-efficient learning in Section \ref{sec:anno}. We discuss the existing challenges in label-efficient learning and present several heuristic solutions for these open problems in Section \ref{sec:cnfd}, where promising future research directions are proposed as well. Finally, we conclude the  paper in Section \ref{sec:con}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}
Despite significant advances in computer-aided MIA, the question of how to endow deep learning models with enormous data remains a daunting challenge. Deep learning models under label-efficient schemes have shown significant flexibility and superiority in dealing with high degree of quality- and quantity-variant data. To that end, we have presented the first comprehensive label-efficient learning survey in MIA. A variety of learning schemes, including semi-supervised, self-supervised, multi-instance, active and annotation-efficient learning in the general field are classified and analyze thoroughly. We hope that by systematically sorting out the methodologies for each learning schemes, this survey will shed light on more progress in the future.

\section{Concepts of Prior Knowledge}\label{appendix1}
\subsection{Assumptions and Detail in Semi-supervised Learning}
\subsubsection{Assumptions in Semi-supervised Learning}
In fact, Semi-SL is not effective in every scenario. As stated in \cite{xiaojin2008semi, van2020survey}, a necessary condition for Semi-SL algorithms to work is that the marginal data distribution $p(x)$ contains underlying information about the posterior distribution $p(y|x)$, where $x$ and $y$ represent the data sample over input space $\mathcal{X}$ and the associated label, respectively. Otherwise the additional unlabeled data will be useless to infer information about $p(y|x)$, which means the Semi-SL algorithms may achieve similar or even worse performance compared with supervised learning algorithms. Therefore, several assumptions over the input data distribution have been proposed to constrain the data structure and ensure the algorithms can be generalized from a limited labeled dataset to a large-scale unlabeled dataset. Following \cite{van2020survey, ouali2020overview}, the assumptions in Semi-SL are introduced as follows:

\textbf{Smoothness assumption}. Suppose $x_1,~x_2 \in X$ are two input data samples over input space $\mathcal{X}$. If the distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is very close, \textit{i.e.}, $D(x_1, x_2) < \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is an artificially set threshold, then the associated labels $y_1$ and $y_2$ should also be the same. Note that sometimes there is an additional constraint in the smoothness assumption. In \cite{ouali2020overview}, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are required to belong to the same high-density region, so as to avoid the situation that these two samples reside on the brink of different high-density regions and are misclassified as one category.

\textbf{Cluster assumption}. In this assumption, we assume that data points with similar underlying information are likely to form high-density regions, i.e., clusters. If the two data points $x_1$ and $x_2$ lie in the same cluster, then they are expected to have the same label. In fact, the cluster assumption can be considered as a special case of the smoothness assumption. According to \cite{chapelle2009semi}, if the two data points $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be connected with a line that does not pass through any low-density area, they belong to the same cluster. 

\textbf{Low-density assumption}. The decision boundary of the classifier is assumed to lie in the low-density areas instead of high-density ones, which can be derived from the cluster assumption and smoothness assumption. On the one hand, if the decision boundary resides in the high-density regions, the two data points $x_1$ and $x_2$ located in the same cluster but opposite sided of the decision boundary will be categorized as different classes, which obviously violates the cluster assumption and smoothness assumption. On the other hand, following the cluster and smoothness assumption, data points in any high-density areas are expected to be assigned the same label, which means the decision boundary of the model can only lie in the low-density areas, thus satisfying the low-density assumption.

\textbf{Manifold assumption}. A manifold is a concept in geometry, that represents a geometric structure in a high-dimensional space, i.e., a collection of data points in the input space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, a curve in 2-dimensional space can be thought of as a 1-dimensional manifold, and a surface in 3-dimensional space can be seen as a 2-dimensional manifold. The manifold assumption states that there is a certain geometry of the data distribution in the high-dimensional space, namely that the data are concentrated around a certain low-dimensional manifold. Due to the fact that high-dimensional data not only poses a challenge to machine learning algorithms, but also leads to a large computational load and the problem of dimensional catastrophe, it will be much more effective to estimate the data distribution if they lie in a low-dimensional manifold. 

\subsubsection{Details of Key Generative Methods}
Researchers can obtain various generative methods according to different assumptions on the latent distribution. On the one hand, it can be easy to formulate a generative method once an assumption on the distribution is made, whereas on the other, the hypothetical generative model must match the real data distribution to avoid the unlabeled data in turn degrading the generalization performance. One can formulate the modeling process of generative methods as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{generative}
    \begin{aligned}
    y^{*}&=\arg \max _{y} p(y | x)=\arg \max _{y} \frac{p(x | y) p(y)}{p(x)}\\
    &=\arg \max _{y} p(x | y) p(y),\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the generative methods models the joint distribution $p(x,y)$. Eq. (\ref{generative}) indicates that if the correct assumption on prior $p(y)$ and conditional distribution $p(x | y)$ is made, the input data can be expected to come from the latent distribution. 

\textbf{Definition of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)}
The aim of generator $\mathcal{G}$ is to iteratively learn the latent distribution from real data $x$  starting from generating data with random noise distribution $p(z)$. Meanwhile, the goal of discriminator $\mathcal{D}$ is to correctly distinguish the fake input generated by $\mathcal{G}$ and real data $x$. Formally, we can formulate the optimization problem of a GAN as follows:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\mathcal{G}}\max_{\mathcal{D}} \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{D}) &= \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p(x)}[\mathrm{log}\mathcal{D}(x)]\\
    &+\mathbb{E}_{z\sim p(z)}[1-\mathrm{log}(\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{G}(z)))],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{L}$ represents the loss function of generator $\mathcal{G}$ and discriminator $\mathcal{D}$. Concretely, $\mathcal{G}$ aims to minimize the objective function by confusing $\mathcal{D}$ with generated data $\mathcal{G}(z)$, while $\mathcal{D}$ aims at maximizing the objective function by making correct predictions.

\textbf{Definition of Variational Autoencoder (VAE)}
The typical VAE consists of two objectives: one is to minimize the discrepancy between input data $x$ and its reconstruction version $\hat{x}$ produced by the decoder, and the other is to model a latent space $p(z)$ following a simple distribution, such as a standard multivariate Gaussian distribution. Thus, the loss function for training a VAE can be formulated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\theta}\sum_{x\in X} \mathcal{L}(x, \theta) = \mathcal{L}_{MSE}(x,\hat{x}_{\theta})+\mathcal{L}_{KL}(p_{\theta}(z|x)||p(z)),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{L}_{MSE}$ represents the mean square error; $\hat{x}_{\theta}$ is the reconstruction version of input data $x$ generated by the decoder $p_{\phi}(x|z)$ given parameters $\phi$; $\mathcal{L}_{KL}(\cdot||\cdot)$ represents the Kullback-Leibler divergence which measures the distance between two distributions; and $p_{\theta}(z|x)$ denotes the posterior distribution produced by the encoder given parameters $\theta$.


\subsection{Conventional Uncertainty Metrics in Active Learning}
The uncertainty measure reflects the degree of dispersion of a random input. There are many ways to measure the uncertainty of inputs. Starting with simple metrics like standard deviation and variance, current studies in MIA mainly focus on \textbf{margin sampling} \cite{campbell2000query} and \textbf{entropy sampling}\cite{holub2008entropy}. Denote the probability as $p$, we give the definition of these metrics as follows.

\textbf{Margin sampling} \textbf{\cite{campbell2000query}} estimates the probability difference $\mathcal{M}$ between the first and second most likely labels $\hat{y}_{1}, \hat{y}_{2}$ according to the deep model parameter $\theta$ and expect the least residual value by the following notation:

\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{M}=\underset{x}{\operatorname{argmin}}   [p_{\theta}\left(\hat{y}_{1} \mid x\right)-p_{\theta}\left(\hat{y}_{2} \mid x\right)]
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Entropy sampling}\cite{holub2008entropy} is another conventional metric for sampling. In a binary or multi-classification scenario, the sampled data with higher entropy can be selected as the expected annotation data. For a $C$-class task, entropy sampling metric $\mathcal{E}$ can be denoted as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{E}=\underset{x}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(-\sum_{c=1}^{C}p(y_c\mid x)\log p(y_c\mid x)\right)
\end{equation*}

As a supplement to the main text, we summarize representative publicly available datasets across 16 different organs such as the brain, chest, prostate, \textit{etc.} in Tab. \ref{tab:Dataset1}. 
These publicly available MIA datasets can be leveraged to construct label-efficient learning algorithms for numerous purposes, including classification, detection, and segmentation.

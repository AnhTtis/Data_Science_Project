	\caption{Label-Efficiency Learning scenarios. Annotations are demonstrated only for the sake of presentation and do not necessarily represent the truth. Upper left: Semi-Supervised learning (Section \ref{sec:semi}). Labeled datasets and unlabeled datasets are available. Upper right: Self-supervised learning (Section \ref{sec:ssl}). Only unlabeled patches are available. Middle left: Multiple instance learning (Section \ref{sec: mil}). Global-level labels are present, but Patch-level lebels are not available. Middle right: Active Learning (Section \ref{sec:al}). In addition to labeled patches and an intermediate model, human annotators are available. Bottom left: Few-shot Learning (Section \ref{sec:fsl}). Only limited labeled datasets are available. Bottom right: Annotation-Efficient Learning (Section \ref{sec:anno}). Different kinds of labeled datasets are available.}

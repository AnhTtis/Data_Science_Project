	\caption{Overview of few-shot learning paradigm. The model $f$ learns to generalize from the support set $S$ and infers on the query set $Q$, which contains new, unlabeled examples. The design of $f$ varies: it can either employ deep metric learning to discern patterns within the support set or function as a meta-learner, extracting meta-knowledge pertinent to the task.

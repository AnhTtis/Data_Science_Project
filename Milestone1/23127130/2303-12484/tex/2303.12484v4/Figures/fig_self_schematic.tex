	\caption{Overview of self-supervised learning paradigm. Self-SL aims to learn a pre-trained model by developing various proxy tasks based solely on unlabeled data. Then the pre-trained model can be fine-tuned on different downstream tasks with labeled datasets. The process of Self-SL creates a generalizable model based on proxy tasks and avoids the overfitting which might occur if the model is trained only using the labeled datasets of downstream tasks.}

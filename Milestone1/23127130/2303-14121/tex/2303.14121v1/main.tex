This thesis explores the effects and origins of a `noise with memory' in the dynamics of an open quantum system.\ The system considered here is a multi-qubit register performing the Grover's quantum search algorithm.\ We show that a Markovian-correlated noise can enhance the efficiency of the algorithm over a time-correlation-less noise.\ We also analytically find the set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithm's success probability to remain invariant with respect to the number of noisy sites in the register and point out that these conditions hold irrespective of the presence of time-correlations in the noise.\ We then investigate the origins of the type of noise considered.\ In this regard, a `collisional model' is constructed that exactly reproduces the noisy evolution of the open system.\ Non-Markovianity in the system's evolution is then assessed using two well-known measures and they are shown to be non-coincident.\ Our model is then slightly modified to accommodate an elementary thermal bath.\ There we show that increasing the bath's temperature increases information drainage from the system.

{\large 
In this thesis we have explored the situation when a quantum system is subjected to a noise that is correlated in time. Specifically, we consider that the noise is caused by free evolution of some of the qubits in a quantum register performing Grover's search.\ We show that irrespective of the presence of Markovian time-correlations in the noise, the necessary and sufficient condition for the algorithm's success probability to be unchanged while the number of noisy qubits is increased, is that the unitary operators governing the free evolution of the noisy qubits are the Pauli $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ matrices.\ For Pauli $\sigma_y$, success probability at all times will be unaltered as long as the number of noise sites is changed to another number with the same parity (even or odd).\\
We found that the system's noisy evolution can be modeled by colliding the system with three 2-level systems (qubits) at each time step.\ The system's non-Markovian dynamics can be thus made sense of as arising from the back-action of the walker qubit due to the system-walker coupling for all times, since otherwise the collisions with the two periodically-refreshed ancilla qubits lead to a Markovian evolution for the (system + walker).\ By decomposing the collision unitary, we could specifically point to the mechanism behind the Markovian-correlations of the noise in consecutive time steps.\ We then showed that for a sizeable portion of the parameter space, there is no `information back-flow' from the environment into the system.\ Still, in those cases, we found that the system can be classified as non-Markovian when the dynamical map is not CP-divisible.\\
Taking the ancilla qubits to be in their thermal states, we could simulate a thermal bath, albeit elementary.\ The effect of this was to decrease the information back-flow with increasing temperature of the bath.\\
\hfill\\
\textit{To conclude,} there are three main outcomes of this thesis.\ Firstly, we have shown that memory in noise can enhance the performance of the Grover algorithm under a Markovian-correlated noise.\ Secondly, we have shown that for a register's noisy qubits freely evolving under some unitary, the total time evolution of the register becomes independent of the number of noisy qubits if and only if the unitaries are the Pauli matrices.\ Thirdly, we found a physical model for the noisy register's environment and using that model, could explain the origin of memory in our particular case.

I want to thank Prof.\ Sen for giving me the opportunity to work on this project.\ His expert guidance and precious advice have been the main impetus behind bringing my efforts to fruition.\ I also learn and take inspiration from his openness, dedication and critique of each new direction of research that have been undertaken.\\
I want to thank Prof.\ Mahesh for his constant support and precious time as the local expert of the Thesis Advisory Committee.\ I am grateful to the physics department and all staff for their cooperation and the director of IISER Pune, Prof.\ Jayant B.\ Udgaonkar, for this wonderful opportunity.\\
The work done in this project would only have reached a fraction of its present volume, had Ahana and Chirag of Prof.\ Sen's group not offered me countless hours in discussions - pointing out mistakes, clearing doubts and providing suggestions during writing of this thesis.\ Your kindness has only raised my expectations from the people I will work with in the future.\ I have also been blessed with having some wonderful people around me.\ I wonder if some of my ideas in the project would have come to me, had my ruminating mind not been refreshed by the memorable times spent with Chrisil, Soubhadra, Hitesh, Vaibhav and others...\\
I acknowledge the support from the Department
of Science and Technology, Government of India through the INSPIRE scholarship that helped me sustain myself during the project.\\
Most of all, I thank my parents, my sister and other family members for their unconditional love and support during my studies.

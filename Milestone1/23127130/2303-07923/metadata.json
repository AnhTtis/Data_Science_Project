    "abstract": "Clustering with capacity constraints is a fundamental problem that attracted significant attention throughout the years. In this paper, we give the first FPT constant-factor approximation algorithm for the problem of clustering points in a general metric into $k$ clusters to minimize the sum of cluster radii, subject to non-uniform hard capacity constraints. In particular, we give a $(15+ε)$-approximation algorithm that runs in $2^{0(k^2\\log k)}\\cdot n^3$ time. When capacities are uniform, we obtain the following improved approximation bounds: A (4 + $ε$)-approximation with running time $2^{O(k\\log(k/ε))}n^3$, which significantly improves over the FPT 28-approximation of Inamdar and Varadarajan [ESA 2020]; a (2 + $ε$)-approximation with running time $2^{O(k/ε^2 \\cdot\\log(k/ε))}dn^3$ and a $(1+ε)$-approximation with running time $2^{O(kd\\log ((k/ε)))}n^{3}$ in the Euclidean space; and a (1 + $ε$)-approximation in the Euclidean space with running time $2^{O(k/ε^2 \\cdot\\log(k/ε))}dn^3$ if we are allowed to violate the capacities by (1 + $ε$)-factor. We complement this result by showing that there is no (1 + $ε$)-approximation algorithm running in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{O(1)}$, if any capacity violation is not allowed.",

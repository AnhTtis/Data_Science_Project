@article{Sharma2010,
	abstract = {In this paper we show that experimentally realizable apparently piezoelectric thin-film superlattices can be created from nonpiezoelectric materials provided an odd-order (e.g., trilayer) stacking sequence is used. The size-dependent mechanism of flexoelectricity, which couples gradients of strain to polarization, allows such a possibility. We present closed-form analytical expressions for the response of various thin-film and superlattice configurations. We also clarify some of the subtleties that arise in considering interface boundary conditions in the theory of flexoelectricity as well as the relationship of flexoelectricity to the frequently used polarization gradient terms used in modeling ferroelectrics. We find that for certain (optimum) material combinations and length scales, thin-film superlattices yielding apparent piezoelectricity close to 75% of ferroelectric barium titanate may be achievable.},

	abstract = {The flexoelectricity describes the contribution of the linear couplings between the electric polarization and strain gradient and between polarization gradient and strain to the thermodynamics of a solid and represents the amount of polarization change of a solid arising from a strain gradient. Although the magnitude of the flexoelectric effect is generally small, its contribution to the overall thermodynamics of a solid may become significant or even dominant at the nanometer scale. Recent experimental and computational efforts have led to significant advances in our understanding of the flexoelectric effect and its exploration of potential applications in devices such as sensors, actuators, energy harvesters, and nanoelectronics. Here we review the theoretical development and experimental progress in flexoelectricity including the types of materials systems that have been explored and their potential applications. We discuss the challenges in the experimental measurements and density functional theory computations of the flexoelectric coefficients including understanding the order of magnitude discrepancies between existing experimentally measured and computed values. Finally, we offer a perspective on the future directions for research on flexoelectricity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Electromechanical effects are ubiquitous in biological and materials systems. Understanding the fundamentals of these coupling phenomena is critical to devising next-generation electromechanical transducers. Piezoelectricity has been studied in detail, in both the bulk and at mesoscopic scales. Recently, an increasing amount of attention has been paid to flexoelectricity: electrical polarization induced by a strain gradient. While piezoelectricity requires crystalline structures with no inversion symmetry, flexoelectricity does not carry this requirement, since the effect is caused by inhomogeneous strains. Flexoelectricity explains many interesting electromechanical behaviors in hard crystalline materials and underpins core mechanoelectric transduction phenomena in soft biomaterials. Most excitingly, flexoelectricity is a size-dependent effect which becomes more significant in nanoscale systems. With increasing interest in nanoscale and nano-bio hybrid materials, flexoelectricity will continue to gain prominence. This Review summarizes work in this area. First, methods to amplify or manipulate the flexoelectric effect to enhance material properties will be investigated, particularly at nanometer scales. Next, the nature and history of these effects in soft biomaterials will be explored. Finally, some theoretical interpretations for the effect will be presented. Overall, flexoelectricity represents an exciting phenomenon which is expected to become more considerable as materials continue to shrink.},

The effects of mechanical, electrical and magnetic boundary devices, external charges, polarizations and magnetization are taken into account in formulating the free energy. The linear and nonlinear boundary value problems governing these materials are explicitly derived as the Euler--Lagrange equations of the principle of minimum free energy. Finally, we illustrate the applications of the formulations by presenting solutions to a few simple problems and give an outlook of potential applications.},

	abstract = {The flexoelectric effect is very strong and coupled with large strain gradients for nanoscale dielectrics. At the nanoscale, the electrostatic force cannot be ignored. In this paper, we have established the electric enthalpy variational principle for nanosized dielectrics with the strain gradient and the polarization gradient effect, as well as the effect of the electrostatic force. The complete governing equations, which include the effect of the electrostatic force, are derived from this variational principle, and based on the principle the generalized electrostatic stress is obtained, the generalized electrostatic stress contains the Maxwell stress corresponding to the polarization and strain, and stress related to the polarization gradient and strain gradient. This work provides the basis for the analysis and computations for the electromechanical problems in nanosized dielectric materials.},

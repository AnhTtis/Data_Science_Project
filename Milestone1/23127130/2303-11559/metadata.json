    "abstract": "We provide a survey of results on the statistics of random sections of holomorphic line bundles on Kähler manifolds, with an emphasis on the resulting asymptotics when a line bundle is raised to increasing tensor powers. We conclude with a brief discussion of the `Bergman' Kähler metrics induced by these random sections.",

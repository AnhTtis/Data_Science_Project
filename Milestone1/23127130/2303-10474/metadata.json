    "abstract": "Within a Bayesian statistical framework using a Gaussian Process emulator for an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies, we infer from the HADES proton flow data the posterior probability distribution functions of in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross section modification factor X with respect to free-space and the corresponding incompressibility K of nuclear matter as well as their correlation function. The mean value of X is found to be $X=1.32^{+0.28}_{-0.40}$ at 68\\% confidence level, providing circumstantial evidence for enhanced baryon-braryon scattering cross sections in hot and dense nuclear matter.",

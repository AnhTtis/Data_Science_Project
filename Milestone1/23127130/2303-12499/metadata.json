    "abstract": "Agricultural robots have the prospect to enable more efficient and sustainable agricultural production of food, feed, and fiber. Perception of crops and weeds is a central component of agricultural robots that aim to monitor fields and assess the plants as well as their growth stage in an automatic manner. Semantic perception mostly relies on deep learning using supervised approaches, which require time and qualified workers to label fairly large amounts of data. In this paper, we look into the problem of reducing the amount of labels without compromising the final segmentation performance. For robots operating in the field, pre-training networks in a supervised way is already a popular method to reduce the number of required labeled images. We investigate the possibility of pre-training in a self-supervised fashion using data from the target domain. To better exploit this data, we propose a set of domain-specific augmentation strategies. We evaluate our pre-training on semantic segmentation and leaf instance segmentation, two important tasks in our domain. The experimental results suggest that pre-training with domain-specific data paired with our data augmentation strategy leads to superior performance compared to commonly used pre-trainings. Furthermore, the pre-trained networks obtain similar performance to the fully supervised with less labeled data.",

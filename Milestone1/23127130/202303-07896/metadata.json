    "abstract": "Reliable classification and detection of certain medical conditions, in\nimages, with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, require vast\namounts of pixel-wise annotation. However, the public availability of such\ndatasets is minimal. Therefore, semantic segmentation with image-level labels\npresents a promising alternative to this problem. Nevertheless, very few works\nhave focused on evaluating this technique and its applicability to the medical\nsector. Due to their complexity and the small number of training examples in\nmedical datasets, classifier-based weakly supervised networks like class\nactivation maps (CAMs) struggle to extract useful information from them.\nHowever, most state-of-the-art approaches rely on them to achieve their\nimprovements. Therefore, we propose a framework that can still utilize the\nlow-quality CAM predictions of complicated datasets to improve the accuracy of\nour results. Our framework achieves that by first utilizing lower threshold\nCAMs to cover the target object with high certainty; second, by combining\nmultiple low-threshold CAMs that even out their errors while highlighting the\ntarget object. We performed exhaustive experiments on the popular multi-modal\nBRATS and prostate DECATHLON segmentation challenge datasets. Using the\nproposed framework, we have demonstrated an improved dice score of up to 8% on\nBRATS and 6% on DECATHLON datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art.",

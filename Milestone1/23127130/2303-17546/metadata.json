    "abstract": "Generative image editing has recently witnessed extremely fast-paced growth. Some works use high-level conditioning such as text, while others use low-level conditioning. Nevertheless, most of them lack fine-grained control over the properties of the different objects present in the image, i.e.\\,object-level image editing. In this work, we tackle the task by perceiving the images as an amalgamation of various objects and aim to control the properties of each object in a fine-grained manner. Out of these properties, we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive to understand and useful for editing purposes. We propose \\textbf{PAIR} Diffusion, a generic framework that can enable a diffusion model to control the structure and appearance properties of each object in the image. We show that having control over the properties of each object in an image leads to comprehensive editing capabilities. Our framework allows for various object-level editing operations on real images such as reference image-based appearance editing, free-form shape editing, adding objects, and variations. Thanks to our design, we do not require any inversion step. Additionally, we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance which enables editing images using both reference images and text when using our approach with foundational diffusion models. We validate the above claims by extensively evaluating our framework on both unconditional and foundational diffusion models.

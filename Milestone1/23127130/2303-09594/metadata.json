    "abstract": "One-bit quantization with time-varying sampling thresholds has recently found significant utilization potential in statistical signal processing applications due to its relatively low power consumption and low implementation cost. In addition to such advantages, an attractive feature of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is their superior sampling rates as compared to their conventional multi-bit counterparts. This characteristic endows one-bit signal processing frameworks with what we refer to as sample abundance. On the other hand, many signal recovery and optimization problems are formulated as (possibly non-convex) quadratic programs with linear feasibility constraints in the one-bit sampling regime. We demonstrate, with a particular focus on quadratic compressed sensing, that the sample abundance paradigm allows for the transformation of such quadratic problems to merely a linear feasibility problem by forming a large-scale overdetermined linear system; thus removing the need for costly optimization constraints and objectives. To efficiently tackle the emerging overdetermined linear feasibility problem, we further propose an enhanced randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, called Block SKM. Several numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.",

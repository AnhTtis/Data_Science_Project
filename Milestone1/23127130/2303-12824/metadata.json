    "abstract": "Perfectly contractile graphs form a typical class of perfect graphs. In particular, all $k$-colorings of a perfectly contractile graph are Kempe equivalent. Everett and Reed conjectured that a graph is perfectly contractile if and only if it contains no odd holes, no antiholes and no odd prisms. On the other hand the authors and Shibata conjectured that a perfect graph is perfectly contractile if and only if its toric ring, which is called the stable set ring, is quadratic. In the present paper, we characterize when the stable set ring of a (not necessarily perfect) graph is quadratic by using Kempe equivalence. As applications of this characterization, we can claim that if Everett and Reed conjecture is true, then the conjecture of the authors and Shibata is also true. Moreover, we can show that for several important classes of perfectly contractile graphs, the stable set rings are quadratic.",

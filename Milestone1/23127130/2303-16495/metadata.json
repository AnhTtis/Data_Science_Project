    "abstract": "Trust is a key motivation in developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). However, researchers attempting to measure trust in AI face numerous challenges, such as different trust conceptualizations, simplified experimental tasks that may not induce uncertainty as a prerequisite for trust, and the lack of validated trust questionnaires in the context of AI. While acknowledging these issues, we have identified a further challenge that currently seems underappreciated - the potential distinction between trust as one construct and \\emph{distrust} as a second construct independent of trust. While there has been long-standing academic discourse for this distinction and arguments for both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional conceptualization of trust, distrust seems relatively understudied in XAI. In this position paper, we not only highlight the theoretical arguments for distrust as a distinct construct from trust but also contextualize psychometric evidence that likewise favors a distinction between trust and distrust. It remains to be investigated whether the available psychometric evidence is sufficient for the existence of distrust or whether distrust is merely a measurement artifact. Nevertheless, the XAI community should remain receptive to considering trust and distrust for a more comprehensive understanding of these two relevant constructs in XAI.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic textures are promising candidates for unconventional computing due to their non-linear dynamics. We propose to investigate the rich variety of seemingly trivial lamellar magnetic phases, e.g., helical, spiral, stripy phase, or other one-dimensional soliton lattices. These are the natural stray field-free ground states of almost every magnet. The order parameters of these phases may be of potential interest for both classical and unconventional computing, which we refer to as helitronics. For the particular case of a chiral magnet and its helical phase, we use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate the working principles of all-electrical (i) classical binary memory cells and (ii) memristor and neuron cells, based on the orientation of the helical stripes.",

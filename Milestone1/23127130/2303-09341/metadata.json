    "abstract": "This paper shows that accretion of positronium plasma between 0.01s-14s after the Big Bang could have created small black holes contributing at least 1% of present-day dark matter, with uncertainties ranging from 10% or more. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations newly adapted to the early Universe confirm that accretion is due to magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a rotating plasma. By contrast with Bondi accretion producing primordial masses above solar, MRI could produce masses 10^15-18g observable by their Hawking radiation contributing to background gamma rays.",

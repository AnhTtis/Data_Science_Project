    "abstract": "We propose an SU(5) GUT model added two pairs of $\\mathbf{10}$ representation for the vector-like fermions to the minimal SU(5) GUT model. By a real $\\mathrm{SU(2)_L}$ triplet coming from the $\\mathbf{24}$ representation Higgs getting the VEVs, the $W$ boson mass anomaly reported by the CDF collaboration can be explained. The vector-like quark doublet acquire the mass through the Yukawa interaction of a real triplet via the type-$\\rm{I\\hspace{-.01em}I}$ seesaw-like mechanism in addition to that of $\\mathbf{24}$ representation Higgs. We assume that the mass for the vector-like quark doublet is expressed in terms of a real triplet mass. By combining the constraints of the vector-like quark doublet mass with that of the heavy Higgs boson masses, we can obtain the allowed mass ranges for the vector-like quark doublet and a real triplet scalar which are very narrow. Therefore, our model can be tested by the search of these particles in the near future. In addition, in the case that included the new contribution, the SM gauge couplings unify successfully at $M_{\\mathrm{GUT}}\\thickapprox6.76\\times10^{15}$ GeV and our model is testable by the future Hyper-Kamiokande experiment expected as $τ_p(p\\toπ^0{e^+})<1.0\\times10^{35}$ years.",

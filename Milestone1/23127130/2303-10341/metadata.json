    "abstract": "Given a saturated fusion system $\\mathcal{F}$ over a finite $p$-group $S$, we provide criteria to determine when uniqueness of factorization into irreducible $\\mathcal{F}$--invariant representations holds. We use them to prove uniqueness of factorization when the order of $S$ is at most $p^3$. We also describe an example where the monoid of fusion-invariant representations is not even half-factorial. Finally, we find other examples of fusion systems where this monoid is not factorial using GAP.",

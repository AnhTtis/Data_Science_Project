    "abstract": "We consider an ultra-weak first order system discretization of the Helmholtz equation. By employing the optimal test norm, the `ideal' method yields the best approximation to the pair of the Helmholtz solution and its scaled gradient w.r.t.~the norm on $L_2(Ω)\\times L_2(Ω)^d$ from the selected finite element trial space. On convex polygons, the `practical', implementable method is shown to be pollution-free when the polynomial degree of the finite element test space grows proportionally with $\\log κ$. Numerical results also on other domains show a much better accuracy than for the Galerkin method.",

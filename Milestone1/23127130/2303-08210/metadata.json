    "abstract": "We study the correlation function between one single-trace scalar operator and a circular Wilson loop in the $4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ and matter transforming in the symmetric and anti-symmetric representations. By exploiting supersymmetric localization, we resum the perturbative expansion of this correlator in the large-$N$ 't Hooft limit. Furthermore, using both analytical and numerical techniques, we provide a prediction for the leading term of its strong coupling expansion and we compare this prediction to numerical Padé resummations of the perturbative series.",

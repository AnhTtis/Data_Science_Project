    "abstract": "Monte Carlo (MC) simulations allowing to describe photons propagation in statistical mixtures represent an interest that goes way beyond the domain of optics, and can cover, e.g., nuclear reactor physics, image analysis or life science just to name a few. MC simulations are considered a ``gold standard'' because they give exact solutions (in the statistical sense), however, in the case of statistical mixtures they are enormously time consuming and their implementation is often extremely complex. For this reason, the aim of the present contribution is to propose a new approach that should allow us in the future to simplify the MC approach. This is done through an explanatory example, i.e.; by deriving the `exact' analytical expression for the probability density function of photons' random steps (single step function, SSF) propagating in a medium represented as a binary (isotropic-Poisson) statistical mixture. The use of the SSF reduces the problem to an `equivalent' homogeneous medium behaving exactly as the original binary statistical mixture. This will reduce hundreds time-consuming MC simulations to only one equivalent simple MC simulation. To the best of our knowledge the analytically `exact' SSF for a binary (isotropic-Poisson) statistical mixture has never been derived before.",

%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,

%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and

%% If you are preparing content for an event

\caption{Prompt artists develop descriptive text-based prompts that are rendered by text-to-image models. Highly skilled prompt artists will develop 1) distinct visual concepts and styles (S1), 2) prompts that can also serve as titles of the art piece (``prompts as art'', A1), and 3) ``prompt templates'' (A2), which encapsulate specific visual concepts to be customized by others. Artists strive to discover unique \textit{natural language} that produces unique \textit{visual outputs} (G1), and/or model ``glitches'' (G2) that can be elevated to artistic styles in their own right. Finally, some prompt artists validate the novelty of their work by conducting an image search for similar images (C1).}

    "abstract": "This paper fills in all details in the announcement arXiv:2301.10054 on our results: we construct infinitely many non-isotrivial families of abelian varieties of $\\text{GL}_2$-type over four punctured projective lines with bad reduction of type-$(1/2)_\\infty$ via $p$-adic Hodge theory and Langlands correspondence. They lead to algebraic solutions of the Painleve VI equation. Recently Lin-Sheng-Wang proved the conjecture on the torsioness of zeros of Kodaira-Spencer maps of those type families. Based on their theorem we show the set of those type families of abelian varieties is {\\sl exactly} parameterized by torsion sections of the universal family of elliptic curves modulo the involution.",

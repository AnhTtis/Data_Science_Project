    "abstract": "This work examines the impact of electromagnetic cross-talk in magnonic devices when using inductive spin-wave (SW) transducers. We present detailed electrical SW spectroscopy measurements showing the signal contributions to be considered in magnonic device design. We further provide a rule of thumb estimation for the cross-talk that is responsible for the secondary SW excitation at the output transducer. Simulations and calibrated electrical characterizations underpin this method. Additionally, we visualize the secondary SW excitation via time-resolved MOKE imaging in the forward-volume configuration in a 100nm Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) system. Our work is a step towards fast yet robust joint electromagentic-micromagnetic magnonic device design.",

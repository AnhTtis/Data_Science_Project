\section{Discussion and Conclusion}


We have presented a method for exploring object-level shape variations in an image, which addresses two main technical challenges: changing the shape of an object and localizing the change. To achieve this, we introduced a Mix-and-Match technique to generate shape variations, and built upon self-attention maps injection to preserve the original image structure, while enabling changes to the object of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrated how the geometric information encoded in self-attention maps can be used for image segmentation, which allows for guiding the preservation of the background. While our method produces plausible variations of an image, we acknowledge that automatic proxy-words may fail at times. In the future, we would like to develop means to explore a continuous words space rather than the current discrete one.

	\caption{Our method traverses the CLIP space using proxy words, enabling us to generate object-level variations. 
    Here, we generate two different outputs using the prompt ``Luxury yellow \emph{purse} on a table'' shown in the ``original'' column. We then apply Mix-and-Match using proxy words, where the left part shows auto-suggested proxy words using our ranking technique. In the right part, we show words from a large distance in CLIP's space. 
    As illustrated above, distant words tend to yield objects which can no longer be identified as the original object, while our method allows for generating convincing object-level variations.}

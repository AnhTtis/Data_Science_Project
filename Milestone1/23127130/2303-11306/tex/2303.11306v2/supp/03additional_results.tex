\section{Additional Results}

\subsection{Comparison to Other Methods}



In Figure~\ref{fig:comparision_sup2}, we extend Figure~\ref{fig:our-results} by showing another example. Our method produces diverse results and remains faithful to the class of tents while preserving the rest of the image. Plug-n-Play\cite{pnpDiffusion2022} and Instruct-Pix2Pix\cite{brooks2022instructpix2pix} make only minor texture changes to the tent and fail to preserve the background of the image. P2P\cite{hertz2022prompt} makes some noticeable texture changes when injecting self-attention during 40\% for the steps, or geometric shape changes when injecting self-attention during 10\% of the steps, but drifting away from the tents domain. 
Zero-shot Image2Image Translation struggles at changing the shape of the tent. Imagic struggles at preserving the hamster and the background and drifts away from the tents domain.

In Figure~\ref{fig:our-results-supp}, we show our result for the example in Figure~\ref{fig:inpainting}. As can be seen, our method produces significant shape changes while preserving the bananas and the background.


\subsection{Our Method Results}

In Figures~\ref{fig:our-extended-results-supp} and ~\ref{fig:our-results-supp}, we show additional results of our object shape variations pipeline.

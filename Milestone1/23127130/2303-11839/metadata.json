    "abstract": "This article describes a rewriting system for resistor circuits over any positive division rig using general star to mesh transformations. Star to mesh transformations, which are reminiscent of local complementation for graph states in qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics, are well-known in electrical engineering. Here we show how these transformations can be organized into a confluent and terminating rewriting system on the category of resistor circuits. The star to mesh transformations are an infinite family of identities: an obvious -- yet seemingly open -- question concerns whether there is a finite presentation for these identities.",

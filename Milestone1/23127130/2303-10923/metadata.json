    "abstract": "This research paper focuses on the problem of dynamic objects and their impact on effective motion planning and localization. The paper proposes a two-step process to address this challenge, which involves finding the dynamic objects in the scene using a Flow-based method and then using a deep Video inpainting algorithm to remove them. The study aims to test the validity of this approach by comparing it with baseline results using two state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms, ORB-SLAM2 and LSD, and understanding the impact of dynamic objects and the corresponding trade-offs. The proposed approach does not require any significant modifications to the baseline SLAM algorithms, and therefore, the computational effort required remains unchanged. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the results obtained and concludes that the proposed method is effective in removing dynamic objects from the scene, leading to improved SLAM performance.",

\caption{\textbf{Visualization of segmentation results via IFSeg.}
We visualize the segmentation results of IFSeg (ours) and MaskCLIP (baseline). 
We also present predicted semantic categories next to each segmentation results. 
Unlike the MaskCLIP (baseline) only roughly segments segmentation vocabularies onto an image, our method does visual categories with accurate segmentation.
We note that both models are not trained using any images from the pre-trained VL models, CLIP and OFA, respectively.

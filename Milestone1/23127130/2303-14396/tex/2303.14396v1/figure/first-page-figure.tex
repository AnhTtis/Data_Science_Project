   \caption{\textbf{Visualization of image-free segmentation results via IFSeg on a web image.} 
   Here, we present a web image (\textbf{Top}) and its segmentation results (\textbf{Middle} and \textbf{Bottom}) of our image-free segmentation approach. 
   Note that our model is not trained with any task-specific images and annotations, but only the text words (\emph{e.g.}, ``grass'', ``cat'', ``dog'' and ``other'') as semantic categories.}

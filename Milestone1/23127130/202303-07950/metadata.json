    "abstract": "Recapitulation of the resonance condition for the fundamental and higher\nelectron cyclotron harmonics in the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability (ECMI)\nenables radiation below and confirms the possibility of radiation in a narrow\nband above harmonics $n>1$. Near $n=1$ resonance on the confined lower X-mode\nbranch, amplification is supported by the decrease of phase and group speeds.\nConfined slow large-amplitude quasi-electrostatic X-modes nonlinearly modulate\nthe plasma to form cavitons until self-trapped inside them at further\nincreasing wavenumber. They undergo wave-wave interaction, enabling escape to\nfree space in the second harmonic band below $n=2$. At sufficiently large\nparallel wavenumber (oblique propagation), the fundamental resonance $n=1$ is\nhyperbolic, a possibility so far missed but vital for an effective ECMI in the\nupward current region. Here, the resonance hyperbola favourably fits the loss\ncone boundary, the presumably important ECMI upward-current source-electron\ndistribution, to stimulate ECMI growth at available auroral electron energies.",

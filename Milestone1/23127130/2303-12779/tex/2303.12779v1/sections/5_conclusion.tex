\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this work, our main contribution is a novel method for local feature matching that integrates estimated 3D signals to guide correspondence estimation -- leading to high-quality feature associations under wide baseline conditions.
Experiments indicate that the way the 3D signal is incorporated into the model matters, with improvements observed when using positional encodings based on periodic functions.
Our enhanced feature correspondences enable a significant boost in performance for relative pose estimation of in-the-wild images.
Based on the quantitative and qualitative evidence we gathered, one can conclude that 3D information can greatly improve the estimation of image correspondences.

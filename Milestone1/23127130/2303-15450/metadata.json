    "abstract": "A variational volume-of-fluid (VVOF) methodology is devised for evolving interfaces under curvature-dependent speed. The interface is reconstructed geometrically using the analytic relations of Scardovelli and Zaleski [1] and the advection of the volume fraction is performed using the algorithm of Weymouth and Yue (WY) [2] with a technique to incorporate a volume conservation constraint. The proposed approach has the advantage of simple implementation and straightforward extension to more complex systems. Canonical curves and surfaces traditionally investigated by the level set (LS) method are tested with the VVOF approach and results are compared with existing work in LS.",

    "abstract": "We study the late time behavior of $n$-point spectral form factors (SFFs) in two-dimensional Witten-Kontsevich topological gravity, which includes both Airy and JT gravities as special cases. This is conducted in the small $\\hbar$ expansion, where $\\hbar \\sim e^{- {1}/{G_N}}$ is the genus counting parameter and nonperturbative in Newton's constant $G_N$. For one-point SFF, we study its absolute square at two different late times. We show that it decays by power law at $t \\sim \\hbar^{-2/3}$ while it decays exponentially at $t \\sim \\hbar^{-1}$ due to the higher order corrections in $\\hbar$. We also study general $n (\\ge 2)$-point SFFs at $t \\sim \\hbar^{-1}$ in the leading order of the $\\hbar$ expansion. We find that they are characterized by a single function, which is essentially the connected two-point SFF and is determined by the classical eigenvalue density $ρ_0(E)$ of the dual matrix integral. These studies suggest that qualitative behaviors of $n$-point SFFs are similar in both Airy and JT gravities, where our analysis in the former case is based on exact results.",

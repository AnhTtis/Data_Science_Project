    "abstract": "In the paper \"An Abelian Loop for Non-Composites\" (arXiv:110.14716), we introduced a group-like structure consisting of odd prime numbers and 1, with properties that allowed us to prove analogous results to well known theorems in Number Theory. In this paper, we explore some theorems and conjectures in the SP space.",

Using SpeAR, systems engineers capture requirements, environmental assumptions, and critical system properties using the formal semantics of Past LTL. SpeAR analyzes requirements for logical consistency and uses model checking to prove that assumptions and requirements entail stated properties. These analyses build confidence in the correctness of the formally captured requirements.",

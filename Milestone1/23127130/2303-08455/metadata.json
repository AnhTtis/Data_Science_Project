    "abstract": "In practical engineering experiments, the data obtained through detectors are inevitably noisy. For the already proposed data-enabled physics-informed neural network (DEPINN) \\citep{DEPINN}, we investigate the performance of DEPINN in calculating the neutron diffusion eigenvalue problem from several perspectives when the prior data contain different scales of noise. Further, in order to reduce the effect of noise and improve the utilization of the noisy prior data, we propose innovative interval loss functions and give some rigorous mathematical proofs. The robustness of DEPINN is examined on two typical benchmark problems through a large number of numerical results, and the effectiveness of the proposed interval loss function is demonstrated by comparison. This paper confirms the feasibility of the improved DEPINN for practical engineering applications in nuclear reactor physics.",

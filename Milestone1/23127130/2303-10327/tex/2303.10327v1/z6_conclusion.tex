\section{Conclusion}
We propose a learning-based hierarchical approach to stabilize nonlinear hybrid systems. The learned low-level controller can stabilize the system states within each mode. Upon switching, the high-level planner finds the optimal configuration that guarantees the next entering state is within the RoA of the next mode. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the best overall performance on multiple hybrid systems compared to other approaches. For future works, we aim to tackle some of the limitations discussed in \secref{sec:limitations}, and extend this framework to further control hybrid systems with perception modules and the presence of estimation error and disturbances.

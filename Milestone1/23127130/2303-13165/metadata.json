    "abstract": "We describe a general procedure which allows to construct, starting from a given Hamiltonian, the whole family of new ones sharing the same set of unparameterized trajectories in phase space. The symmetry structure of this family can be completely characterized provided the symmetries of initial Hamiltonian are known. Our approach covers numerous examples considered in literature. It provides a simple proof of Darboux theorem and Hietarinta et al. coupling-constant metamorphosis method.",

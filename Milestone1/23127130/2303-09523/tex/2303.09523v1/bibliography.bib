abstract = {In case of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the image of an object is taken in all 3 directions. But, all the analysis and study based on MR images is carried out on 2D data, more precisely taking a single view at a time rather than considering all 3 views. Hence, the analysis is not always accurate. A solution is to create a 3D figure that will include all three views in it, so that the doctor can see any view as per his/her wish with just one click using virtual scissors. We have developed a tool that will generate the 3D from a set of MR images in a single plane and from that we can slice out along any axis to get the view from different angle in different planes as per our wish using virtual scissors. The results show that the slices generated after reconstruction are very close to the ground truth images.},

abstract = {Methods of hidden surface removal and shading for computer-displayed surfaces are proposed. If the surface to be displayed is approximated by a large number of square faces of restricted orientation, the methods proposed in this paper work at least an order of magnitude faster than previously published methods. A situation in which such approximation is natural is the display of organs based on data obtained by the reconstruction of the internal structure of a body from multiple shadowgraphs such as X-ray photographs (computed tomography). The methods can also be used for rapidly achieving some but not all of the aims of surface modeling in more general situations. The hidden surface removal method is based on the Z-buffer algorithm (no sorting is required), with modifications which make use of the nature of the assumed surface approximation. The artifact caused by approximating the curved surface with squares is reduced by low-pass filtering of the picture to be displayed. The results are demonstrated by displays of actual human organs based on data provided by computed tomography.}

Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

abstract = {We describe our implementation of kriging for interpolation of scalar values in three-dimensional medical image surface rendering and for slice interpolation. Kriging is an interpolation technique developed in the geosciences for estimating ore deposit spatial distributions. Kriging has been mathematically proven to be the best (statistically optimal) linear unbiased estimation technique for spatially distributed data. As a byproduct of the kriging technique, kriging can calculate the estimation error for the interslice interpolated values. Kriging also offers the potential for quantifying the interpolation error in slices computed by the estimation technique. This paper presents the initial results obtained using kriging for the pre-processing operations of slice interpolation by slice-value interpolation and interpolating voxel values during iso-surface extraction. We found that kriging is an accurate interpolation technique for surface rendering and for slice interpolation. Our results indicate that kriging can duplicate the rendering results obtained with other interpolation techniques and it offers the potential for providing visually “better” images than are obtained using the other interpolation techniques we tested.}

title = {Robust edge-directed interpolation of magnetic resonance images},
journal = {Physics in Medicine \& Biology},
abstract = {Image interpolation is intrinsically a severely under-determined inverse problem. Traditional non-adaptive interpolation methods do not account for local image statistics around the edges of image structures. In practice, this results in artifacts such as jagged edges, blurring and/or edge halos. To overcome this shortcoming, edge-directed interpolation has been introduced in different forms. One variant, new edge-directed interpolation (NEDI), has successfully exploited the ‘geometric duality’ that links the low-resolution image to its corresponding high-resolution image. It has been demonstrated that for scalar images, NEDI is able to produce better results than non-adaptive traditional methods, both visually and quantitatively. In this work, we return to the root of NEDI as a least-squares estimation method of neighborhood patterns and propose a robust scheme to improve it. The improvement is twofold: firstly, a robust least-squares technique is used to improve NEDI's performance to outliers and noise; secondly, the NEDI algorithm is extended with the recently proposed non-local mean estimation scheme. Moreover, the edge-directed concept is applied to the interpolation of multi-valued diffusion-weighted images. The framework is tested on phantom scalar images and real diffusion images, and is shown to achieve better results than the non-adaptive methods as well as NEDI, in terms of visual quality as well as quantitative measures.}

abstract = {The availability of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) microstructures is an essential prerequisite to understanding the macroscopic behaviours of heterogeneous media. Considering the high cost of 3D microscopy imaging, it is an economical way to derive large numbers of virtual 3D microstructures from limited morphological information of 2D cross-sectional images. This paper presents an efficient method that incorporates machine learning-based characterization of 2D images to statistically reconstruct 3D microstructures. The latent stochasticity of 2D images is mastered by fitting supervised machine learning models, which essentially characterize the local morphological statistics. A morphology integration scheme is developed to project the 2D morphological statistics into the 3D space, and new equivalent 3D microstructures can then be synthesized by sequentially generating voxel values from probability sampling. The new method is tested on a series of heterogeneous media with distinct morphologies, and it is also compared with two classical methods (i.e. stochastic optimization-based reconstruction and Gaussian random field transformation) in terms of reconstruction accuracy and efficiency. Besides, various microstructural descriptors are used to quantify the discrepancies between the reconstructed and target microstructures. The results confirm that the proposed method provides a highly cost-effective and widely applicable way to reproduce 3D realizations that precisely preserve the statistical characteristics, geometrical irregularities, long-distance connectivity and anisotropy that exist in 2D cross-sectional images.}

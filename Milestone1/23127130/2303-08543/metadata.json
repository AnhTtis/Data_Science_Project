    "abstract": "Recent experimental work has demonstrated the potential to combine the merits of diffractive and on-chip photonic information processing devices in a single chip by making use of planar (or slab) waveguides. Researchers have adapted key results of 3D Fourier optics to 2D, by analogy, but rigorous derivations in planar contexts have been lacking. Here, such arguments are developed to show that diffraction formulas familiar from 3D can be adapted to 2D under certain mild conditions on the operating speeds of the devices in question. Equivalents to the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction (RS) formulas in 2D are provided and a Radiation Condition of validity proved. The equivalence of the first 2D RS formula with an angular spectrum formulation is demonstrated. Finally Fresnel approximations are derived starting from the RS formulation and that of the angular spectrum. In addition to serving those working with slab waveguides, this letter provides analytical tools to researchers in any field where 2D diffraction is encountered, including the study of surface plasmon polaritons, surface waves, 3D diffraction with line-sources or corresponding symmetries, and the optical, acoustic and crystallographic properties of 2D materials.",

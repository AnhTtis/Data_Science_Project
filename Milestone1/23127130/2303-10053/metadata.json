    "abstract": "The negatively charged silicon-vacancy center in diamond has great potential for quantum information processing due to its strong zero-phonon line emission, narrow inhomogeneous broadening, and stable optical transition frequencies. Developing universal quantum computation in silicon-vacancy centers is highly expected. Here, we propose a scheme for nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation in the system, in which silicon-vacancy centers are placed in a one-dimensional phononic waveguide. To improve the performance of the scheme, dynamical decoupling pulse sequences are used to eliminate the impact of the environment on its system. This scheme has the feature of geometric quantum computation that is robust to control errors and has the advantage of dynamical decoupling that is insensitive to environmental impact. Moreover, the feature that qubits are encoded in long-lifetime ground states of silicon-vacancy centers can reduce the decoherence caused by decay. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the silicon-vacancy center system for quantum computation and the improvement of dynamic decoupling pulse in quantum system immunity to environmental noise. Our scheme may provide a promising way toward high-fidelity geometric quantum computation in the solid-state system.",

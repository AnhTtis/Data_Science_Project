    abstract = { A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. }

abstract={Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling combines the robustness of nonadiabatic geometric gates and the decoherence-resilience feature of dynamical decoupling. Solid-state systems provide an appealing candidate for the realization of nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation protected dynamical decoupling since the solid-state qubits are easily embedded in electronic circuits and scaled up to large registers. In this paper, we put forward a scheme of nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling via the XXZ Hamiltonian, which not only combines the merits of nonadiabatic geometric gates and dynamical decoupling but also can be realized in a number of solid-state systems, such as superconducting circuits and quantum dots.},

	abstract = { A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp{iγ(C)} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor. }

	abstract = {We provide a unified geometrical description for analyzing the stability of holonomic quantum gates in the presence of imprecise driving controls (parametric noise). We consider the situation in which these fluctuations do not affect the adiabatic evolution but can reduce the logical gate performance. Using the intrinsic geometric properties of the holonomic gates, we show under which conditions of the noise's correlation time and strength the fluctuations in the driving field cancel out. In this way, we provide theoretical support for previous numerical simulations. We also briefly comment on the error due to the mismatch between the real and the nominal time of the period of the driving fields and show that it can be reduced by suitably increasing the adiabatic time.}

	abstract={A significant development in computing has been the discovery1 that the computational power of quantum computers exceeds that of Turing machines. Central to the experimental realization of quantum information processing is the construction of fault-tolerant quantum logic gates. Their operation requires conditional quantum dynamics, in which one sub-system undergoes a coherent evolution that depends on the quantum state of another sub-system2; in particular, the evolving sub-system may acquire a conditional phase shift. Although conventionally dynamic in origin, phase shifts can also be geometric3,4. Conditional geometric (or `Berry') phases depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and are therefore resilient to certain types of errors; this suggests the possibility of an intrinsically fault-tolerant way of performing quantum gate operations. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have already been used to demonstrate both simple quantum information processing5,6,7,8,9 and geometric phase shifts10,11,12. Here we combine these ideas by performing a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment in which a conditional Berry phase is implemented, demonstrating a controlled phase shift gate.},

The computational space is realized by a n-fold degenerate eigenspace of a family of Hamiltonians parametrized by a manifold M. The point of M represents classical configuration of control fields and, for multi-partite systems, couplings between subsystem. Adiabatic loops in the control M induce non trivial unitary transformations on the computational space. For a generic system it is shown that this mechanism allows for universal quantum computation by composing a generic pair of loops in M.}

	journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Quantum computation based on nonadiabatic geometric phases has attracted a broad range of interests, due to its fast manipulation and inherent noise resistance. However, it is limited to some special evolution paths, and the gate-times are typically longer than conventional dynamical gates, resulting in weakening of robustness and more infidelities of the implemented geometric gates. Here, we propose a path-optimized scheme for geometric quantum computation (GQC) on superconducting transmon qubits, where high-fidelity and robust universal nonadiabatic geometric gates can be implemented, based on conventional experimental setups. Specifically, we find that, by selecting appropriate evolution paths, the constructed geometric gates can be superior to their corresponding dynamical ones under different local errors. Numerical simulations show that the fidelities for single-qubit geometric phase, π/8 and Hadamard gates can be obtained as 99.93%, 99.95% and 99.95%, respectively. Remarkably, the fidelity for two-qubit control-phase gate can be as high as 99.87%. Therefore, our scheme provides a new perspective for GQC, making it more promising in the application of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.}

The introduced method is then applied to investigate nonadiabatic Abelian geometric quantum computation. We demonstrate that, by employing the nonadiabatic Berry phase generated through nonadiabatic periodic evolution, a driven two-level system which undergoes a single cyclic evolution along a loop path in Bloch space can realize a universal set of one-qubit gates. Subsequently, under consideration of the influence of the systematic error and dissipation on nonadiabatic process, the result reveals arbitrary one-qubit gate can be implemented with a high fidelity. Moreover, to complete the universal set, arbitrary controlled-U gate is designed by utilizing a driven system consisted of a pair of coupled spin subsystems.}

	abstract = {Abstract Realization of a large-scale quantum computation relies on fast and high-fidelity quantum control. Geometric quantum control is thought to be a promising candidate for quantum computation which consolidates the robustness against both random noise (through the global geometrical feature) and systematic errors (through adiabatic characteristic). The adiabatic process of geometric control can be accelerated through an auxiliary Hamiltonian in different scenarios by means of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA). Especially, the auxiliary Hamiltonian can be absorbed into the original interacting configuration in most of the cases, which allows STA to coalesce with the Abelian or the non-Abelian geometric control. As a consequence, geometric quantum control can have an enhanced robustness against decoherence after speeding up by STA. Here, the recent theoretical and experimental advances in geometric quantum computation based on STA are reviewed.},

Specifically, our proposal combined with optimized-control-technology (OCT) can reduce gate operation error by adjusting the time-dependent amplitude and phase of the resonant field which further enhances the robustness of the quantum operation.

In our implementation, with the assistant of the appropriate driving fields, the quantum evolution is insensitive to the cavity field state, which is only virtually excited. The implemented non-adiabatic holonomies, utilizing optical transitions in the $\Lambda$ type of three-level configuration of the nitrogen-vacancy centers, can be used to construct a universal set of quantum gates on the encoded logical qubits. Therefore, our scheme opens up the possibility of realizing universal holonomic quantum computation with cavity assisted interaction on solid-state spins characterized by long coherence times.},

	abstract = {The isolated electronic spin system of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond offers unique possibilities to be employed as a nanoscale sensor for detection and imaging of weak magnetic fields. Magnetic imaging with nanometric resolution and field detection capabilities in the nanotesla range are enabled by the atomic-size and exceptionally long spin-coherence times of this naturally occurring defect. The exciting perspectives that ensue from these characteristics have triggered vivid experimental activities in the emerging field of ‘NV magnetometry’. It is the purpose of this article to review the recent progress in high-sensitivity nanoscale NV magnetometry, generate an overview of the most pertinent results of the last years and highlight perspectives for future developments. We will present the physical principles that allow for magnetic field detection with NV centres and discuss first applications of NV magnetometers that have been demonstrated in the context of nano magnetism, mesoscopic physics and the life sciences.}

Most of the fluorescence is concentrated in a strong zero phonon line (ZPL), with a weak phonon sideband extending for 100 nm that contains several clear features. We demonstrate that the ZPL position can be used to reliably identify the silicon isotope present in a single centre. This is of interest for quantum information applications since only the 29Si isotope has nuclear spin. In addition, we show that the sharp 64 meV phonon peak is due to a local vibrational mode of the silicon atom. The presence of a local mode suggests a plausible origin of the measured isotopic shift of the ZPL.}

	abstract = {Atomic-scale impurity spins, also called color centers, in an otherwise spin-free diamond host lattice have proven to be versatile tools for applications in solid-state-based quantum technologies ranging from quantum information processing (QIP) to quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology. Due to its wide band gap, diamond can host hundreds of different color centers. However, their suitability for QIP or sensing applications has only been tested for a handful of these, with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) strongly dominating this field of research. Due to its limited optical properties, the success of the NV for QIP applications however strongly depends on the development of efficient photonic interfaces. In the past years the negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV−) center received significant attention due to its highly favourable spectral properties such as narrow zero phonon line transitions and weak phonon sidebands. Here, the recent work investigating the SiV center's orbital and electron spin coherence properties is reviewed as well as techniques to coherently control its quantum state using microwave as well as optical fields. Also, potential future experimental directions to improve the SiV's coherence time scale and to develop it into a valuable tool for QIP applications are outlined.},

Sipahigil et al. combined the quantum optical features of silicon-vacancy color centers with diamond-based photonic cavities to form a platform for integrated quantum nanophotonics (see the Perspective by Hanson). They could thus generate single photons from the color centers, optically switch light in the cavity by addressing the state of the color center, and quantum-mechanically entangle two color centers positioned in the cavity. The work presents a viable route to develop an integrated platform for quantum networks. Science, this issue p. 847; see also p. 835 An integrated quantum optical platform is demonstrated using silicon vacancy color centers and diamond photonics. Efficient interfaces between photons and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable optical nonlinearities at the single-photon level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum nanophotonics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to diamond nanodevices. By placing SiV centers inside diamond photonic crystal cavities, we realize a quantum-optical switch controlled by a single color center. We control the switch using SiV metastable states and observe optical switching at the single-photon level. Raman transitions are used to realize a single-photon source with a tunable frequency and bandwidth in a diamond waveguide. By measuring intensity correlations of indistinguishable Raman photons emitted into a single waveguide, we observe a quantum interference effect resulting from the superradiant emission of two entangled SiV centers.}}

Verification relied on the most complete exploration of engineered decoherence to date. The achieved fidelities show improved information storage for a large, noncommutative set of errors.}}

abstract={Spin impurities in diamond have emerged as a promising building block in a wide range of solid-state-based quantum technologies. The negatively charged silicon-vacancy centre combines the advantages of its high-quality photonic properties with a ground-state electronic spin, which can be read out optically. However, for this spin to be operational as a quantum bit, full quantum control is essential. Here we report the measurement of optically detected magnetic resonance and the demonstration of coherent control of a single silicon-vacancy centre spin with a microwave field. Using Ramsey interferometry, we directly measure a spin coherence time, T2*, of 115{\textpm}9{\thinspace}ns at 3.6{\thinspace}K. The temperature dependence of coherence times indicates that dephasing and decay of the spin arise from single-phonon-mediated excitation between orbital branches of the ground state. Our results enable the silicon-vacancy centre spin to become a controllable resource to establish spin-photon quantum interfaces.},

	abstract = { Quantum computers, which process information encoded in quantum mechanical systems, hold the potential to solve some of the hardest computational problems. A substantial obstacle for the further development of quantum computers is the fact that the lifetime of quantum information is usually too short to allow practical computation. A promising method for increasing the lifetime, known as dynamical decoupling (DD), consists of applying a periodic series of inversion pulses to the quantum bits. In the present review, we give an overview of this technique and compare different pulse sequences proposed earlier. We show that pulse imperfections, which are always present in experimental implementations, limit the performance of DD. The loss of coherence due to the accumulation of pulse errors can even exceed the perturbation from the environment. This effect can be largely eliminated by a judicious design of pulses and sequences. The corresponding sequences are largely immune to pulse imperfections and provide an increase of the coherence time of the system by several orders of magnitude. }

We present a commonly used procedure for elimination of the upper level, and we show that it may lead to ambiguous results. To overcome this problem and better understand the applicability conditions of this scheme, we review two rigorous methods which allow us both to derive an unambiguous effective two-level Hamiltonian of the system and to quantify the accuracy of the approximation achieved: the first relies on the exact solution of the Schr枚dinger equation, while the second resorts to the Green's function formalism and the Feshbach projection operator technique.}

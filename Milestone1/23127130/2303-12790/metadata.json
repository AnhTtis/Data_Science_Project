    "abstract": "Crowd counting is a key aspect of crowd analysis and has been typically accomplished by estimating a crowd-density map and summing over the density values. However, this approach suffers from background noise accumulation and loss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian kernels to create the ground truth density maps. This issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian kernel. However, existing approaches perform poorly when trained with such ground truth density maps. To overcome this limitation, we propose using conditional diffusion models to predict density maps, as diffusion models are known to model complex distributions well and show high fidelity to training data during crowd-density map generation. Furthermore, as the intermediate time steps of the diffusion process are noisy, we incorporate a regression branch for direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the feature learning. In addition, owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model, we introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting performance contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. Further, we also differ from the density summation and introduce contour detection followed by summation as the counting operation, which is more immune to background noise. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, our novel crowd-counting pipeline improves the error of crowd-counting by up to $6\\%$ on JHU-CROWD++ and up to $7\\%$ on UCF-QNRF.",

    \caption{Overall crowd counting pipeline. The crowd density maps are generated from the denoising diffusion process for a crowd image. Next, thresholding is performed on the resulting crowd density realizations to create crowd maps. The crowd maps are then fused into a single crowd map. The counting branch is trained in parallel using the encoder-decoder features of the denoising U-Net and discarded during inference.}

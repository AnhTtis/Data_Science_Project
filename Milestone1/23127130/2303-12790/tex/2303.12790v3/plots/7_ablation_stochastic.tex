    \caption{Qualitative results for stochastic crowd map generation from two realizations. Green boxes include new dots created at different realizations. Blue boxes include dots present in both realizations but with a shift, and pink boxes include perfectly reassigned dots. ({\it best viewed in highest zooming level})}

    "abstract": "In this paper we improve on existing methods to compute quadratic points on modular curves and apply them to successfully find all the quadratic points on all modular curves $X_0(N)$ of genus up to $8$, and genus up to $10$ with $N$ prime, for which they were previously unknown. The values of $N$ we consider are contained in the set \\[ \\mathcal{L}=\\{58, 68, 74, 76, 80, 85, 97, 98, 100, 103, 107, 109, 113, 121, 127 \\}.\\] We obtain that all the non-cuspidal quadratic points on $X_0(N)$ for $N\\in \\mathcal{L}$ are CM points, except for one pair of Galois conjugate points on $X_0(103)$ defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2885})$. We also compute the $j$-invariants of the elliptic curves parametrised by these points, and for the CM points determine their geometric endomorphism rings.",

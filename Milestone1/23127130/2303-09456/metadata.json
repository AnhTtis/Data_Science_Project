    "abstract": "Efficiency of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) is increasingly critical as renewable energy generation becomes more prevalent on the grid. Therefore, it is necessary to study the energy efficiency of Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs), which are typically used in BESSs. The purpose of this study is to propose the State of Efficiency (SOE) as a measure of how efficiently LIBs transfer energy, and what factors affect the SOE of a battery throughout its lifetime. Using NASA's data set, we calculate the SOE of NCA LIBs by calculating the ratio of energy generated and consumed during discharge and charge phases. A linear trend was observed in the SOE trajectories, which is confirmed by the MannKendall (MK) trend test. Following that, a linear SOE degradation model was presented. Ambient temperature, discharge current, and cutoff voltage all affect SOE in different ways. Using the SOE and its behavior observed in this study, Battery Management Systems (BMS) can improve the energy efficiency of LIBs by adjusting operating conditions or developing better management strategies.",

   abstract = {Entangling gates between qubits are a crucial component for performing algorithms in quantum computers. However, any quantum algorithm must ultimately operate on error-protected logical qubits encoded in high-dimensional systems. Typically, logical qubits are encoded in multiple two-level systems, but entangling gates operating on such qubits are highly complex and have not yet been demonstrated. Here we realize a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate between two multiphoton qubits in two microwave cavities. In this approach, we encode a qubit in the high-dimensional space of a single cavity mode, rather than in multiple two-level systems. We couple two such encoded qubits together through a transmon, which is driven by an RF pump to apply the gate within 190 ns. This is two orders of magnitude shorter than the decoherence time of the transmon, enabling a high-fidelity gate operation. These results are an important step towards universal algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits.},

   abstract = {With recent improvements in coherence times, superconducting transmon qubits have become a promising platform for quantum computing. They can be flexibly engineered over a wide range of parameters, but also require us to identify an efficient operating regime. Using state-of-the-art quantum optimal control techniques, we exhaustively explore the landscape for creation and removal of entanglement over a wide range of design parameters. We identify an optimal operating region outside of the usually considered strongly dispersive regime, where multiple sources of entanglement interfere simultaneously, which we name the quasi-dispersive straddling qutrits regime. At a chosen point in this region, a universal gate set is realized by applying microwave fields for gate durations of 50 ns, with errors approaching the limit of intrinsic transmon coherence. Our systematic quantum optimal control approach is easily adapted to explore the parameter landscape of other quantum technology platforms.},

   abstract = {Full manipulation of a quantum system requires controlled evolution generated by nonlinear interactions, which is coherent when the rate of nonlinearity is large compared with the rate of decoherence. As a result, engineered quantum systems typically rely on a bare nonlinearity much stronger than decoherence rates, and this hierarchy is usually assumed to be necessary. Here we challenge this assumption by demonstrating the universal control of a quantum system where the rate of bare nonlinear interaction is comparable to the fastest rate of decoherence. We introduce a noise-resilient protocol for the universal quantum control of a nearly harmonic oscillator that takes advantage of an in situ enhanced nonlinearity instead of harnessing a bare nonlinearity. Our experiment consists of a high-quality-factor microwave cavity with weak dispersive coupling to a superconducting qubit with much lower quality. By using strong drives to temporarily excite the oscillator, we realize an amplified three-wave-mixing interaction, achieving typical operation speeds over an order of magnitude faster than expected from the bare dispersive coupling. Our demonstrations include the preparation of a single-photon state with high fidelity, the generation of squeezed vacuum with large intracavity squeezing and measurement-free preparation of logical states for the binomial and Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill quantum error-correcting codes.},

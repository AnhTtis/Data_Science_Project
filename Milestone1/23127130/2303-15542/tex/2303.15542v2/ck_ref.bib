By employing recent quantum optimal control approaches described in (Petersson and Garcia, 2021), we showcase control of single-qudit operations up to eight states, and two-qutrit operations, mapped respectively onto a single mode and two modes of the resonator. We discuss the results of numerical pulse engineering on the closed system for parametrized gates useful to implement qudit quantum approximate optimization (QAOA) algorithms. The results show that high fidelity ({\textgreater} 0.99) is achievable with sufficient computational effort for most cases under study, and extensions to multiple modes and open, noisy systems are possible.

There is emerging interest in utilizing bosonic modes for quantum information processing, with circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) as one of the leading architectures. Quantum information can be encoded into subspaces of a bosonic superconducting cavity mode with long coherence time. However, standard Gaussian operations (e.g., beam splitting and two-mode squeezing) are insufficient for universal quantum computing. The major challenge is to introduce additional nonlinear control beyond Gaussian operations without adding significant bosonic loss or decoherence. Here we review recent advances in universal control of a single bosonic code with superconducting circuits, including unitary control, quantum feedback control, driven-dissipative control and holonomic dissipative control. Various approaches to entangling different bosonic modes are also discussed.},

In the medium-term, however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability through error correction, likely through promising techniques such as surface codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains. Specifically, we *virtualize logical qubits* by storing them in layers distributed across qubit memories connected to each transmon. Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient operations. Our design permits fast transversal CNOT operations between logical qubits sharing the same physical address which are 6x faster than lattice surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves {\textasciitilde}10x in transmons with another 2x from an additional optimization for compactness. Although Virtualized Logical Qubits (VLQ) pays a 10x penalty in serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and area efficiency result in performance comparable to 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show fault tolerance comparable to 2D architectures while saving substantial hardware. Furthermore, VLQ can produce magic states 1.22x faster for a fixed number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future fault-tolerant quantum computers. VLQ substantially reduces the hardware requirements for fault tolerance and puts within reach a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of around 10 logical qubits, requiring only 11 transmons and 9 attached cavities in total.},

	abstract = {Power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10\% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.},

	abstract = {We establish lower-bounds on the number of resource states, also known as magic states, needed to perform various quantum computing tasks, treating stabilizer operations as free. Our bounds apply to adaptive computations using measurements and an arbitrary number of stabilizer ancillas. We consider (1) resource state conversion, (2) single-qubit unitary synthesis, and (3) computational tasks. To prove our resource conversion bounds we introduce two new monotones, the stabilizer nullity and the dyadic monotone, and make use of the already-known stabilizer extent. We consider conversions that borrow resource states, known as catalyst states, and return them at the end of the algorithm. We show that catalysis is necessary for many conversions and introduce new catalytic conversions, some of which are close to optimal. By finding a canonical form for post-selected stabilizer computations, we show that approximating a single-qubit unitary to within diamond-norm precision \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ requires at least \$1/7{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}log\_2(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon) - 4/3\$ \$T\$-states on average. This is the first lower bound that applies to synthesis protocols using fall-back, mixing techniques, and where the number of ancillas used can depend on \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$. Up to multiplicative factors, we optimally lower bound the number of \$T\$ or \$CCZ\$ states needed to implement the ubiquitous modular adder and multiply-controlled-\$Z\$ operations. When the probability of Pauli measurement outcomes is 1/2, some of our bounds become tight to within a small additive constant.},

This no-go theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however, is the possibility of nontransversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that work directly on small quantum codes. Here, we demonstrate precisely the existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of nontransversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate error correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit and 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable method of code switching.},

Rev. Lett. 108, 180501 (2012)]. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 160503 (2012)] is able to achieve lower logical error rates and higher thresholds than MWPM, but requires a classical runtime complexity which is super-polynomial in L, the linear size of the code. In this work we present an MCMC algorithm that achieves significantly lower logical error rates than MWPM at the cost of a polynomially increased classical runtime complexity. For error rates p close to the threshold, our algorithm needs a runtime complexity which is increased by O(L{\textasciicircum}2) relative to MWPM in order to achieve a lower logical error rate. If p is below an L-dependent critical value, no increase in the runtime complexity is necessary any longer. For p-{\textgreater}0, the logical error rate achieved by our algorithm is exponentially smaller (in L) than that of MWPM, without requiring an increased runtime complexity. Our algorithm allows for trade-offs between runtime and achieved logical error rates as well as for parallelization, and can be also used to correct in the case of imperfect stabilizer measurements.},

Yet, to make the step to large-scale quantum computation, an extensible qubit system has to be developed. In classical semiconductor technology, this was made possible by the invention of the integrated circuit, which allowed to interconnect large numbers of components without having to solder to each and every one of them. Similarly, we expect that the scaling of interconnections and control lines with the number of qubits will be a central bottleneck in creating large-scale quantum technology. Here, we define the quantum Rent's exponent \$p\$ to quantify the progress in overcoming this challenge at different levels throughout the quantum computing stack. We further discuss the concept of quantum extensibility as an indicator of a platform's potential to reach the large quantum volume needed for universal quantum computing and review extensibility limits faced by different qubit implementations on the way towards truly large-scale qubit systems.},

Its benchmark programs sweep over a range of problem sizes and inputs, capturing key performance metrics related to the quality of results, total time of execution, and quantum gate resources consumed. In this manuscript, we investigate challenges in broadening the relevance of this benchmarking methodology to applications of greater complexity. First, we introduce a method for improving landscape coverage by varying algorithm parameters systematically, exemplifying this functionality in a new scalable HHL linear equation solver benchmark. Second, we add a VQE implementation of a Hydrogen Lattice simulation to the QED-C suite, and introduce a methodology for analyzing the result quality and run-time cost trade-off. We observe a decrease in accuracy with increased number of qubits, but only a mild increase in the execution time. Third, unique characteristics of a supervised machine-learning classification application are explored as a benchmark to gauge the extensibility of the framework to new classes of application. Applying this to a binary classification problem revealed the increase in training time required for larger anzatz circuits, and the significant classical overhead. Fourth, we add methods to include optimization and error mitigation in the benchmarking workflow which allows us to: identify a favourable trade off between approximate gate synthesis and gate noise; observe the benefits of measurement error mitigation and a form of deterministic error mitigation algorithm; and to contrast the improvement with the resulting time overhead. Looking ahead, we discuss how the benchmark framework can be instrumental in facilitating the exploration of algorithmic options and their impact on performance.},

In this Perspective, a novel quantum information processing architecture based on optically active spins in silicon is proposed that offers a combined single technological platform for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing and networking. The architecture is optimized for overall entanglement distribution and leverages colour centre spins in silicon (T centres) for their manufacturability, photonic interface, and high fidelity information processing properties. Silicon nanophotonic optical circuits allow for photonic links between T centres, which are networked via telecom-band optical photons in a highly-connected graph. This high connectivity unlocks the use of low-overhead quantum error correction codes, significantly accelerating the timeline for modular, scalable fault-tolerant quantum repeaters and quantum processors.},

However, no concrete architecture has been presented so far that exploits both the advantages of qubits encoded into states of light and the modern tools for their generation. Here we propose such a design for a scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer informed by the latest developments in theory and technology. Central to our architecture is the generation and manipulation of three-dimensional hybrid resource states comprising both bosonic qubits and squeezed vacuum states. The proposal enables exploiting state-of-the-art procedures for the non-deterministic generation of bosonic qubits combined with the strengths of continuous-variable quantum computation, namely the implementation of Clifford gates using easy-to-generate squeezed states. Moreover, the architecture is based on two-dimensional integrated photonic chips used to produce a qubit cluster state in one temporal and two spatial dimensions. By reducing the experimental challenges as compared to existing architectures and by enabling room-temperature quantum computation, our design opens the door to scalable fabrication and operation, which may allow photonics to leap-frog other platforms on the path to a quantum computer with millions of qubits.},

We improve the procedures of Bravyi and Kitaev in the Hadamard "magic" direction of the Bloch sphere to achieve a sharp threshold between those rho allowing universal quantum computation, and those for which any calculation can be efficiently classically simulated. As a corollary, the ability to repeatedly prepare any pure state which is not a stabilizer state (e.g., any single-qubit pure state which is not a Pauli eigenstate), together with stabilizer operations, gives quantum universality. It remains open whether there is also a tight separation in the so-called T direction.},

Both code families are implemented by assigning physical data and ancilla qubits to both vertices and edges of low degree graphs. Such a layout is particularly suitable for superconducting qubit architectures to minimize frequency collisions and crosstalk. In some cases, frequency collisions can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. The heavy hexagon code is a hybrid surface/Bacon-Shor code mapped onto a (heavy) hexagonal lattice whereas the heavy square code is the surface code mapped onto a (heavy) square lattice. In both cases, the lattice includes all the ancilla qubits required for fault-tolerant error-correction. Naively, the limited qubit connectivity might be thought to limit the error-correcting capability of the code to less than its full distance. Therefore, essential to our construction is the use of flag qubits. We modify minimum weight perfect matching decoding to efficiently and scalably incorporate information from measurements of the flag qubits and correct up to the full code distance while respecting the limited connectivity. Simulations show that high threshold values for both codes can be obtained using our decoding protocol. Further, our decoding scheme can be adapted to other topological code families.},

Flag circuits use extra ancilla qubits to signal when errors resulting from \$v\$ faults in the circuit have weight greater than \$v\$. The flag error correction protocol is applicable to stabilizer codes of arbitrary distance which satisfy a set of conditions and uses fewer qubits than other schemes such as Shor, Steane and Knill error correction. We give examples of infinite code families which satisfy these conditions and analyze the behaviour of distance-three and -five examples numerically. Requiring fewer resources than Shor error correction, flag error correction could potentially be used in low-overhead fault-tolerant error correction protocols using low density parity check quantum codes of large code length.},

Logical Pauli group operators can be implemented on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a commonly-studied category of codes, by applying a series of physical Pauli X and Z gates. Logical operators of this form are fault-tolerant because each qubit is acted upon by at most one gate, limiting the spread of errors, and are referred to as transversal logical operators. Identifying transversal logical operators outside the Pauli group is less well understood. Pauli operators are the first level of the Clifford hierarchy which is deeply connected to fault-tolerance and universality. In this work, we study transversal logical operators composed of single- and multi-qubit diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates. We demonstrate algorithms for identifying all transversal diagonal logical operators on a CSS code that are more general or have lower computational complexity than previous methods. We also show a method for constructing CSS codes that have a desired diagonal logical Clifford hierarchy operator implemented using single qubit phase gates. Our methods rely on representing operators composed of diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates as diagonal XP operators and this technique may have broader applications.},

We can use the degree of consensus among the ensemble as a confidence measure for a layered decoding scheme, in which a small ensemble flags high-risk cases to be checked by a larger, more accurate ensemble.

In these settings, the code distance scales superlinearly with the linear system size, while the number of logical qubits within the degenerate ground space exhibits a complicated functional dependence that undergoes large fluctuations within a linear envelope. Here, we extend the cubic code to systems with open boundary conditions and crystal lattice defects. We characterize the condensation of topological excitations in the vicinity of these boundaries and defects, finding that their inclusion can introduce local string-like operators and enhance the mobility of otherwise fractonic excitations. Despite this, we use these boundaries and defects to define new encodings where the number of logical qubits scales linearly without fluctuations, and the code distance scales superlinearly, with the linear system size.

Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the "teraquop regime" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably. We perform the same estimates for the rotated surface code, and find a threshold of \$0.2{\textbackslash}\%-0.3{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the honeycomb code compared to a threshold of \$0.5{\textbackslash}\%-0.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the surface code in a controlled-not circuit model. In a circuit model with native two-body measurements, the honeycomb code achieves a threshold of \$1.5{\textbackslash}\% {\textless} p {\textless}2.0{\textbackslash}\%\$, where \$p\$ is the collective error rate of the two-body measurement gate - including both measurement and correlated data depolarization error processes.

	abstract = {The ubiquity of stabilizer circuits in the design and operation of quantum computers makes techniques to verify their correctness essential. The simulation of stabilizer circuits, which aims to replicate their behavior using a classical computer, is known to be efficient and provides a means of testing correctness. However, simulation is limited in its ability to examine the exponentially large space of possible measurement outcomes. We propose a comprehensive set of efficient classical algorithms to fully characterize and exhaustively verify stabilizer circuits with Pauli unitaries conditioned on parities of measurements. We introduce, as a practical characterization, a general form for such circuits and provide an algorithm to find a general form of any stabilizer circuit. We then provide an algorithm for checking the equivalence of stabilizer circuits. When circuits are not equivalent our algorithm suggests modifications for reconciliation. Next, we provide an algorithm that characterizes the logical action of a (physical) stabilizer circuit on an encoded input. All of our algorithms provide relations of measurement outcomes among corresponding circuit representations. Finally, we provide an analytic description of the logical action induced by measuring a stabilizer group, with application in correctness proofs of code-deformation protocols including lattice surgery and code switching.},

	abstract = {Stabilizer channels are stabilizer circuits that implement logical operations while mapping from an input stabilizer code to an output stabilizer code. They are widely used to implement fault tolerant error correction and logical operations in stabilizer codes such as surface codes and LDPC codes, and more broadly in subsystem, Floquet and space-time codes. We introduce a rigorous and general formalism to analyze the fault tolerance properties of any stabilizer channel under a broad class of noise models. This includes rigorous but easy-to-work-with definitions and algorithms for the fault distance and hook faults for stabilizer channels. The generalized notion of hook faults which we introduce, defined with respect to an arbitrary subset of a circuit's faults rather than a fixed phenomenological noise model, can be leveraged for fault-tolerant circuit design. Additionally, we establish necessary conditions such that channel composition preserves the fault distance. We apply our framework to design and analyze fault tolerant stabilizer channels for surface codes, revealing novel aspects of fault tolerant circuits.},

As a result, implementations of these operations must either use error-correcting codes with more complicated error correction procedures or gate teleportation and magic states, which are prepared at the logical level, increasing overhead to a degree that precludes near-term implementation. In this work, we implement a small quantum algorithm, one-qubit addition, fault-tolerantly on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer, using the [[8,3,2]] colour code. By removing unnecessary error-correction circuits and using low-overhead techniques for fault-tolerant preparation and measurement, we reduce the number of error-prone two-qubit gates and measurements to 36.

              To achieve universal quantum computation via general fault-tolerant schemes, stabilizer operations must be supplemented with other non-stabilizer quantum resources. Motivated by this necessity, we develop a resource theory for magic quantum channels to characterize and quantify the quantum ‘magic’ or non-stabilizerness of noisy quantum circuits. For qudit quantum computing with odd dimension
              d
              , it is known that quantum states with non-negative Wigner function can be efficiently simulated classically. First, inspired by this observation, we introduce a resource theory based on completely positive-Wigner-preserving quantum operations as free operations, and we show that they can be efficiently simulated via a classical algorithm. Second, we introduce two efficiently computable magic measures for quantum channels, called the mana and thauma of a quantum channel. As applications, we show that these measures not only provide fundamental limits on the distillable magic of quantum channels, but they also lead to lower bounds for the task of synthesizing non-Clifford gates. Third, we propose a classical algorithm for simulating noisy quantum circuits, whose sample complexity can be quantified by the mana of a quantum channel. We further show that this algorithm can outperform another approach for simulating noisy quantum circuits, based on channel robustness. Finally, we explore the threshold of non-stabilizerness for basic quantum circuits under depolarizing noise.},

	abstract = {Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small-to-medium size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We provide both a fully explicit description of Hastings's method and propose a substantially simplified weight reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph and lifted product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor, but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes in a photonic quantum computing architecture based on GKP qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight reduction method substantially improves code performance.},

We present a constructive theory for anyon condensation and, in tandem, illustrate our theory explicitly with examples of fault-tolerant logical operations for the color-code model. We show that different condensation processes are associated with a general class of domain walls, which can exist in both space- and time-like directions. This class includes semi-transparent domain walls that condense certain bosonic subsets of anyons. We use our theory to classify topological objects and design novel fault-tolerant logic gates for the color code. As a final example, we also argue that dynamical `Floquet codes' can be viewed as a series of condensation operations. We propose a general construction for realising planar dynamically driven codes based on condensation operations on the color code. We use our construction to introduce a new Calderbank-Shor Steane-type Floquet code that we call the Floquet color code.},

By creating and moving anyons along Borromean rings in spacetime, anyon interferometry detects an intrinsically non-Abelian braiding process. Furthermore, tunnelling non-Abelions around a torus creates all 22 ground states, as well as an excited state with a single anyon—a peculiar feature of non-Abelian topological order.

In this paper, we study the problems of Qubit-Allocation (mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement (routing qubits from one location to another for entanglement). We observe that there can be variation in the error rates of different qubits and links, which can impact the decisions for qubit movement and qubit allocation. We analyze publicly available characterization data for the IBM-Q20 to quantify the variation and show that there is indeed significant variability in the error rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We show that the device variability has a significant impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x. We also evaluate our policies on the IBM-Q5 machine and demonstrate that our proposal significantly improves the reliability of real systems (up to 1.9X).},

	abstract = {A massive gap exists between current quantum computing (QC) prototypes, and the size and scale required for many proposed QC algorithms. Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate "quantum supremacy", i.e., an advantage over classical computing. Tools like ours provide significant improvements in program reliability and execution time, and offer high leverage in accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy.},

	abstract = {Due to little considerations in the hardware constraints, e.g., limited connections between physical qubits to enable two-qubit gates, most quantum algorithms cannot be directly executed on the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and control. To address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based Bidirectional heuristic search algorithm (SABRE), which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt, globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.},

	abstract = {When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, in 1997, it had a conventional structure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with its own P\&L responsibilities. Believing that conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs laid off the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P\&L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization. Although such a structure is common for small entrepreneurial firms, Apple—remarkably—retains it today, even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1997. In this article the authors discuss the innovation benefits and leadership challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational model in the belief that it may be useful for other companies competing in rapidly changing environments.},

To this end, we run numerical simulations of the decoder applied to three families of hypergraph product code: topological codes, fixed-rate random codes and a new class of codes that we call semi-topological codes. Our new code families share properties of both topological and random hypergraph product codes, with a construction that allows for a finely-controlled trade-off between code threshold and stabilizer locality. Our results indicate thresholds across all three families of hypergraph product code, and provide evidence of exponential suppression in the low error regime. For the Toric code, we observe a threshold in the range \$9.9{\textbackslash}pm0.2{\textbackslash}\%\$. This result improves upon previous quantum decoders based on belief propagation, and approaches the performance of the minimum weight perfect matching algorithm. We expect semi-topological codes to have the same threshold as Toric codes, as they are identical in the bulk, and we present numerical evidence supporting this observation.},

Yet, to make the step to large-scale quantum computation, an extensible qubit system has to be developed. In classical semiconductor technology, this was made possible by the invention of the integrated circuit, which allowed to interconnect large numbers of components without having to solder to each and every one of them. Similarly, we expect that the scaling of interconnections and control lines with the number of qubits will be a central bottleneck in creating large-scale quantum technology. Here, we define the quantum Rent exponent p to quantify the progress in overcoming this challenge at different levels throughout the quantum computing stack. We further discuss the concept of quantum extensibility as an indicator of a platform’s potential to reach the large quantum volume needed for universal quantum computing and review extensibility limits faced by different qubit implementations on the way towards truly large-scale qubit systems.},

In a transitional era between noisy small-scale and fully fault-tolerant systems, we envisage a scenario in which we are only able to error correct a small fraction of the qubits required to perform an interesting computation. In this work, we develop concrete constructions of logical operations on a joint system of a collection of noisy and a collection of error-corrected logical qubits. Within this setting and under Pauli noise assumptions, we provide analytical evidence that brick-layered circuits display on average slower concentration to the "useless" uniform distribution with increasing circuit depth compared to fully noisy circuits. We corroborate these findings by numerical demonstration of slower decoherence with an increasing fraction of error-corrected qubits under a noise model inspired by a real device. We find that this advantage only comes when the number of error-corrected qubits passes a specified threshold which depends on the number of couplings between error-corrected and noisy registers.},

It is the promise of quantum materials for quantum information science superimposed with the potential of new computational quantum algorithms to discover new quantum materials that inspires this Review. We anticipate that quantum materials to be discovered and developed in the next years will transform the areas of quantum information processing including communication, storage, and computing. Simultaneously, efforts toward developing new quantum algorithmic approaches for quantum simulation and advanced calculation methods for many-body quantum systems enable major advances toward functional quantum materials and their deployment. The advent of quantum computing brings new possibilities for eliminating the exponential complexity that has stymied simulation of correlated quantum systems on high-performance classical computers. Here, we review new algorithms and computational approaches to predict and understand the behavior of correlated quantum matter. The strongly interdisciplinary nature of the topics covered necessitates a common language to integrate ideas from these fields. We aim to provide this common language while weaving together fields across electronic structure theory, quantum electrodynamics, algorithm design, and open quantum systems. Our Review is timely in presenting the state-of-the-art in the field toward algorithms with nonexponential complexity for correlated quantum matter with applications in grand-challenge problems. Looking to the future, at the intersection of quantum information science and algorithms for correlated quantum matter, we envision seminal advances in predicting many-body quantum states and describing excitonic quantum matter and large-scale entangled states, a better understanding of high-temperature superconductivity, and quantifying open quantum system dynamics.},

In order to harness the power of near-term quantum computers for simulations of larger systems, it is desirable to develop hybrid quantum-classical methods where the quantum computation is restricted to a small portion of the system. This is of particular relevance for molecules and solids where an active region requires a higher level of theoretical accuracy than its environment. Here, we present a quantum embedding theory for the calculation of strongly-correlated electronic states of active regions, with the rest of the system described within density functional theory. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach by investigating several defect quantum bits in semiconductors that are of great interest for quantum information technologies. We perform calculations on quantum computers and show that they yield results in agreement with those obtained with exact diagonalization on classical architectures, paving the way to simulations of realistic materials on near-term quantum computers.},

To date the required single-site measurements and cooling remain problematic, while only ensemble measurements have been achieved. Here we simulate a two-site Hubbard Hamiltonian at low effective temperatures with single-site resolution using subsurface dopants in silicon. We measure quasi-particle tunnelling maps of spin-resolved states with atomic resolution, finding interference processes from which the entanglement entropy and Hubbard interactions are quantified. Entanglement, determined by spin and orbital degrees of freedom, increases with increasing valence bond length. We find separation-tunable Hubbard interaction strengths that are suitable for simulating strongly correlated phenomena in larger arrays of dopants, establishing dopants as a platform for quantum simulation of the Hubbard model.},

Here, we fabricate 3 × 3 arrays of single/few-dopant quantum dots with finite disorder and demonstrate tuning of the electron ensemble using gates and probe the many-body states using quantum transport measurements. By controlling the lattice constants, we tune the hopping amplitude and long-range interactions and observe the finite-size analogue of a transition from metallic to Mott insulating behavior.

Here we use a trapped atomic ion system to perform a quantum simulation of a conical intersection. The ion’s internal state serves as the electronic state, and the motion of the atomic nuclei is encoded into the motion of the ions. The simulated electronic potential is constructed by applying state-dependent optical forces to the ion. We experimentally observe a clear manifestation of the geometric phase using adiabatic state preparation followed by motional state measurement. Our experiment shows the advantage of combining spin and motion degrees for quantum simulation of chemical reactions.},

	abstract = {The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) proposal1,2 lays out a blueprint for a universal quantum computer that uses mobile ions as qubits. Analogous to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which stores and processes imaging information as movable electrical charges in coupled pixels, a QCCD computer stores quantum information in the internal state of electrically charged ions that are transported between different processing zones using dynamic electric fields. The promise of the QCCD architecture is to maintain the low error rates demonstrated in small trapped-ion experiments3–5 by limiting the quantum interactions to multiple small ion crystals, then physically splitting and rearranging the constituent ions of these crystals into new crystals, where further interactions occur. This approach leverages transport timescales that are fast relative to the coherence times of the qubits, the insensitivity of the qubit states of the ion to the electric fields used for transport, and the low crosstalk afforded by spatially separated crystals. However, engineering a machine capable of executing these operations across multiple interaction zones with low error introduces many difficulties, which have slowed progress in scaling this architecture to larger qubit numbers. Here we use a cryogenic surface trap to integrate all necessary elements of the QCCD architecture—a scalable trap design, parallel interaction zones and fast ion transport—into a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer that has a system performance consistent with the low error rates achieved in the individual ion crystals. We apply this approach to realize a teleported CNOT gate using mid-circuit measurement6, negligible crosstalk error and a quantum volume7 of 26 = 64. These results demonstrate that the QCCD architecture provides a viable path towards high-performance quantum computers.},

Due to sheer design complexity, it is nearly impossible to detect and fix all bugs before manufacture. Post-silicon validation is a major challenge for future systems. Today, it is largely viewed as an art with very few systematic solutions. As a result, post-silicon validation is an emerging research topic with several exciting opportunities for major innovations in electronic design automation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the post-silicon validation problem and how it differs from traditional pre-silicon verification and manufacturing testing. We also discuss major postsilicon validation challenges and recent advances.},

	abstract = {Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are a promising construction for drastically reducing the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) architectures. However, all of the known hardware implementations of these codes require advanced technologies, such as long-range qubit connectivity, high-weight stabilizers, or multi-layered chip layouts. An alternative approach to reduce the hardware overhead of fault-tolerance is to use bosonic cat qubits where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed by design. In this work, we combine both approaches and propose an architecture based on cat qubits concatenated in classical LDPC codes correcting for phase-flips. We find that employing such phase-flip LDPC codes provides two major advantages. First, the hardware implementation of the code can be realised using short-range qubit interactions in 2D and low-weight stabilizers, which makes it readily compatible with current superconducting circuit technologies. Second, we demonstrate how to implement a fault-tolerant universal set of logical gates with a second layer of cat qubits while maintaining the local connectivity. We conduct a numerical brute force optimisation of these classical codes to find the ones with the best encoding rate for algorithmically relevant code distances. We discover that some of the best codes benefit from a cellular automaton structure. This allows us to define families of codes with high encoding rates and distances. Finally, we numerically assess the performance of our codes under circuit-level noise. Assuming a physical phase-flip error probability \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}approx 0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$, our \$[165+8{\textbackslash}ell, 34+2{\textbackslash}ell, 22]\$ code family allows to encode \$100\$ logical qubits with a total logical error probability (including both logical phase-flip and bit-flip) per cycle and per logical qubit \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_L {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}\$ on a \$758\$ cat qubit chip.},

But errors typically fluctuate over time, and the most widely used tools for characterizing them assume static error modes and rates. This mismatch can cause unheralded failures, misidentified error modes, and wasted experimental effort. Here, we demonstrate a spectral analysis technique for resolving time dependence in quantum processors. Our method is fast, simple, and statistically sound. It can be applied to time-series data from any quantum processor experiment. We use data from simulations and trapped-ion qubit experiments to show how our method can resolve time dependence when applied to popular characterization protocols, including randomized benchmarking, gate set tomography, and Ramsey spectroscopy. In the experiments, we detect instability and localize its source, implement drift control techniques to compensate for this instability, and then demonstrate that the instability has been suppressed.},

Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we leverage the van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions of the Rydberg atoms to obtain the zero-temperature phase diagram for a uniform chain and a dimer model. For the uniform chain, we can influence the boundaries between ordered phases and a Luttinger liquid phase. For the dimerized case, a new type of bond-order-density-wave phase is identified. This demonstrates the versatility of the Rydberg platform in studying physics involving short- and long-ranged interactions simultaneously.},

The nature of the underlying symmetry being broken determines many of the qualitative properties of the phase; this is illustrated by the case of discrete versus continuous symmetry breaking. Indeed, in contrast to the discrete case, the breaking of a continuous symmetry leads to the emergence of gapless Goldstone modes controlling, for instance, the thermodynamic stability of the ordered phase. Here, we realize a two-dimensional dipolar XY model -- which exhibits a continuous spin-rotational symmetry -- utilizing a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator. We demonstrate the adiabatic preparation of correlated low-temperature states of both the XY ferromagnet and the XY antiferromagnet. In the ferromagnetic case, we characterize the presence of long-range XY order, a feature prohibited in the absence of long-range dipolar interaction. Our exploration of the many-body physics of XY interactions complements recent works utilizing the Rydberg-blockade mechanism to realize Ising-type interactions exhibiting discrete spin rotation symmetry.},

As such, one expects physical intuition to be highly influential in the understanding and design of many quantum algorithms, particularly simulation of physical systems. Surprisingly, this has been challenging, with current Hamiltonian simulation algorithms remaining abstract and often the result of sophisticated but unintuitive constructions. We contend that physical intuition can lead to optimal simulation methods by showing that a focus on simple single-qubit rotations elegantly furnishes an optimal algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation, a universal problem that encapsulates all the power of quantum computation. Specifically, we show that the query complexity of implementing time evolution by a \$d\$-sparse Hamiltonian \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ for time-interval \$t\$ with error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(td{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{max\}\}+{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}log\{(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}\}\{{\textbackslash}log\{{\textbackslash}log\{(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}\}\})\$, which matches lower bounds in all parameters. This connection is made through general three-step "quantum signal processing" methodology, comprised of (1) transducing eigenvalues of \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ into a single ancilla qubit, (2) transforming these eigenvalues through an optimal-length sequence of single-qubit rotations, and (3) projecting this ancilla with near unity success probability.},

Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithms computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model. Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrary gates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences of fundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, {\textbackslash}emph\{Quantum Inf. Comput.\}, {\textbackslash}textbf\{6\}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using a limited set of gates in time which is \$O({\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ or \$O({\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}epsilon)\$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant average depth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations. Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for Lithium hydride.},

	abstract = {Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation on quantum devices. In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs (e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the simulation of real-space Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equations on current trapped-ion and neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era.},

In this work, we derive the non-Markovian dynamics between TLS and qubits during a SWAP-like two-qubit gate and the associated average gate fidelity for frequency-tunable Transmon qubits. This gate dependent error model facilitates using qubits as sensors to simultaneously learn practical imperfections in both the qubit's environment and control waveforms. We combine the-state-of-art machine learning algorithm with Moir{\textbackslash}'\{e\}-enhanced swap spectroscopy to achieve robust learning using noisy experimental data. Deep neural networks are used to represent the functional map from experimental data to TLS parameters and are trained through an evolutionary algorithm.

Representing the control structure of such programs can be a challenge. Here we explore two such fault-tolerant subroutines and analyze the performance of the subroutines using Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) as their underlying intermediate representation. First, we look at QIR's ability to leverage the LLVM compiler toolchain to unroll the quantum iteration logic required to perform magic state distillation on the \$[[5,1,3]]\$ quantum error-correcting code as originally introduced by Bravyi and Kitaev [Phys. Rev. A 71, 022316 (2005)]. This allows us to not only realize the first implementation of a real-time magic state distillation protocol on quantum hardware, but also demonstrate QIR's ability to optimize complex program structures without degrading machine performance. Next, we investigate a different fault-tolerant protocol that was first introduced by Paetznick and Svore [arXiv:1311.1074 (2013)], that reduces the amount of non-Clifford gates needed for a particular algorithm. We look at four different implementations of this two-stage repeat-until-success algorithm to analyze the performance changes as the results of programming choices. We find the QIR offers a viable representation for a compiled high-level program that performs nearly as well as a hand-optimized version written directly in quantum assembly. Both of these results demonstrate QIR's ability to accurately and efficiently expand the complexity of fault-tolerant protocols that can be realized today on quantum hardware.},

	abstract = {Pricing financial derivatives, in particular European-style options at different time-maturities and strikes, means a relevant problem in finance. The dynamics describing the price of vanilla options when constant volatilities and interest rates are assumed, is governed by the Black-Scholes model, a linear parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the pay-off of the option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we present a digital quantum algorithm to solve Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer by mapping it to the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation. The non-Hermitian nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding its propagator into an enlarged Hilbert space by using only one additional ancillary qubit. Moreover, due to the election of periodic boundary conditions, which are needed for an efficient diagonalization of the discretized momentum operator, we duplicate the initial condition, which substantially improves the stability and performance of the protocol. The algorithm shows a feasible approach for using Hamiltonian simulation techniques to solve the price dynamics of financial derivatives on a digital quantum computer. Our approach differs from those based on Monte Carlo integration, exclusively focused on sampling the solution assuming the dynamics is known. Assuming a bounded truncation error, our algorithm remarkably provides an exponential speedup with respect to classical numerical methods when simulating the dynamics, reducing the complexity from \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{n\})\$ to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}text\{poly\}(n))\$. We report expected accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using 10 qubits and 94 entangling gates to simulate its dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an expected success probability of the post-selection procedure due to the embedding protocol above 60\%.},

One construction is based on codes that generalize the triorthogonal codes, allowing any of these gates to be induced at the logical level by transversal \$T\$. We present a randomized construction of generalized triorthogonal codes obtaining an asymptotic distillation efficiency \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}rightarrow 1\$. We also present a Reed-Muller based construction of these codes which obtains a worse \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ but performs well at small sizes. Additionally, we present protocols based on checking the stabilizers of \$CCZ\$ magic states at the logical level by transversal gates applied to codes; these protocols generalize the protocols of 1703.07847. Several examples, including a Reed-Muller code for \$T\$-to-Toffoli distillation, punctured Reed-Muller codes for \$T\$-gate distillation, and some of the check based protocols, require a lower ratio of input gates to output gates than other known protocols at the given order of error correction for the given code size. In particular, we find a \$512\$ T-gate to \$10\$ Toffoli gate code with distance \$8\$ as well as triorthogonal codes with parameters \$[[887,137,5]],[[912,112,6]],[[937,87,7]]\$ with very low prefactors in front of the leading order error terms in those codes.},

Traditionally, the method for decomposing a single-qubit unitary into a discrete set of gates is Solovay-Kitaev decomposition, which in practice produces a sequence of depth O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}c(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)), where c{\textasciitilde}3.97 is the state-of-the-art. The proven lower bound is c=1, however an efficient algorithm that saturates this bound is unknown.

For a given single-qubit rotation, our protocol significantly lowers the length of the approximating sequence and the number of required resource states (ancillary qubits).

	abstract = {Call Me By Your Name (Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer) has received backlash for portraying a 'borderline pedophilic' and potentially abusive relationship in a positive manner. Personally I think these gray elements of the film only add to the enticingly 'taboo' nature of the relationship initially set up by its homosexuality; but I know there are many who disagree. And yes, Oliver does know he cannot stay with Elio but I maintain that - as I said at the end of this video - the main antagonist in this film is anxiety surrounding heteronormativity. Oliver knows that this is the only chance he has to experience this kind of love. The two moments which humaised Oliver's complex dilemma for me were 1. when he said "Do you have any idea how glad I am we slept together? " and 2. When he reflects on his actions in the 'fire dream' sequence shown at the end of this video. In both of these moments we empathise with his struggle, and so he is not an 'antagonist' in the traditional sense because we can understand his actions.

Instead, I wanted to focus on the sensual experience created by director Guadagnino, which I believe to be the driving force of Call Me By Your Name's timeless quality. As Sufjan Stevens wrote in his hit song Mystery of Love for the film's soundtrack, the film is about Seeing Without Eyes - a thesis I explore in terms of both direction and narratology in this video essay.

Also, watch André Aciman - author of the novel - talk about the film's ending. He talks about how the way I interpreted it in this video is completely different - but potentially better - than the way he intended when writing the book:    • André Aciman: The Meaning and Message...  . A fascinating insight into Reader Response - this was THE most pivotal scene in the film for me, and it remains totally ambiguous. I think Stulbarg's performance and Guadagnino's direction really elevated it from the way it was written in the novel (and copied into the screenplay by Ivory - which is obviously also interesting to look at). Fascinating stuff.

Yes, I know I completely mispronounce Anchise. Hard sound, everyone! Not soft. I cringe every time I watch myself say it - and I had to edit this video.

I would love to discuss in the comments! Or feel free to reach me on my social media:

Most such codes do not permit a straightforward implementation of non-Clifford logical operations, which are necessary to define a universal gate set. As a result, implementations of these operations must either use error-correcting codes with more complicated error correction procedures or gate teleportation and magic states, which are prepared at the logical level, increasing overhead to a degree that precludes near-term implementation. In this work, we implement a small quantum algorithm, one-qubit addition, fault-tolerantly on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer, using the [[8,3,2]] colour code. By removing unnecessary error-correction circuits and using low-overhead techniques for fault-tolerant preparation and measurement, we reduce the number of error-prone two-qubit gates and measurements to 36.

              We provide an approach for compiling quantum simulation circuits that appear in Trotter, qDRIFT and multi-product formulas to Clifford and non-Clifford operations that can reduce the number of non-Clifford operations. The total number of gates, especially CNOT, reduce in many cases. We show that it is possible to implement an exponentiated sum of commuting Paulis with at most
              m
              (controlled)-rotation gates, where
              m
              is the number of distinct non-zero eigenvalues (ignoring sign). Thus we can collect mutually commuting Hamiltonian terms into groups satisfying one of several symmetries identified in this work. This allows an inexpensive simulation of the entire group of terms. We further show that the cost can in some cases be reduced by partially allocating Hamiltonian terms to several groups and provide a polynomial time classical algorithm that can greedily allocate the terms to appropriate groupings.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new approach to learn Hamiltonians through a resource that we call the pseudo-Choi state, which encodes the Hamiltonian in a state using a procedure that is analogous to the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. We provide an efficient method for generating these pseudo-Choi states by querying a time evolution unitary of the form \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-iHt\}\$ and its inverse, and show that for a Hamiltonian with \$M\$ terms the Hamiltonian coefficients can be estimated via classical shadow tomography within error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ in the \$2\$-norm using \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}frac\{M\}\{t{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash}right)\$ queries to the state preparation protocol, where \$t {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2{\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}lVert H {\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}rVert\}\$. We further show an alternative approach that eschews classical shadow tomography in favor of quantum mean estimation that reduces this cost (at the price of many more qubits) to \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}frac\{M\}\{t{\textbackslash}epsilon\}{\textbackslash}right)\$. Additionally, we show that in the case where one does not have access to the state preparation protocol, the Hamiltonian can be learned using \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}4M\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash}right)\$ copies of the pseudo-Choi state. The constant \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ depends on the norm of the Hamiltonian, and the scaling in terms of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ can be improved quadratically if using pseudo-Choi states of the normalized Hamiltonian. Finally, we show that our learning process is robust to errors in the resource states and to errors in the Hamiltonian class. Specifically, we show that if the true Hamiltonian contains more terms than we believe are present in the reconstruction, then our methods give an indication that there are Hamiltonian terms that have not been identified and will still accurately estimate the known terms in the Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {Leakage of quantum information out of computational states into higher energy states represents a major challenge in the pursuit of quantum error correction (QEC). In a QEC circuit, leakage builds over time and spreads through multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the exponential suppression of logical error with scale, challenging the feasibility of QEC as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate the execution of a distance-3 surface code and distance-21 bit-flip code on a Sycamore quantum processor where leakage is removed from all qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a ten-fold reduction in steady-state leakage population on the data qubits encoding the logical state and an average leakage population of less than \$1 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ throughout the entire device. The leakage removal process itself efficiently returns leakage population back to the computational basis, and adding it to a code circuit prevents leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles, restoring a fundamental assumption of QEC. With this demonstration that leakage can be contained, we resolve a key challenge for practical QEC at scale.},

In order to correct for both phase and amplitude errors specific to virtual transitions and leakage outside of the qubit manifold, we implement "half derivative" an experimental simplification of derivative reduction by adiabatic gate (DRAG) control theory. The phase errors are lowered by about a factor of five using this method to \${\textbackslash}sim 1.6{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ per gate, and can be tuned to zero.

In its simplest form, the mechanism relies on the low bandwidth of control pulses of long duration. Here we perform a higher-order quantum-mechanical treatment that allows for higher precision and shorter times. In particular, we identify three kinds of off-resonant effects: i) simultaneous unwanted driven couplings (e.g. due to drive crosstalk), ii) additional (initially undriven) transitions such as those in an infinite ladder system, and iii) sideband frequencies of the driving waveform such as we find in corrections to the rotating wave approximation. With a framework that is applicable to all three cases, in addition to the known adiabatic error responsible for a shift of the energy levels we typically see in the spectroscopy of such systems, we derive error terms in a controlled expansion corresponding to higher order adiabatic effects and diabatic excitations. We show, by also expanding the driving waveform in a basis of different order derivatives of a trial function (typically a Gaussian) these different error terms can be corrected for in a systematic way hence strongly improving quantum control of systems with dense spectra.},

In this article we review the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) framework. DRAG is multi-transition variant of counterdiabatic driving, where multiple low-lying gapped states in an adiabatic evolution can be avoided simultaneously, greatly reducing operation times compared to the adiabatic limit. In its essence, the method corresponds to a convergent version of the superadiabatic expansion where multiple counterdiabaticity conditions can be met simultaneously. When transitions are strongly crowded, the system of equations can instead be favorably solved by an average Hamiltonian (Magnus) expansion, suggesting the use of additional sideband control. We give some examples of common systems where DRAG and variants thereof can be applied to improve performance.},

We give a self-contained summary of the SW method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the SW transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H\_\{eff\} such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the SW transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H\_\{eff\}. We then specialize the SW method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the SW method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n-th order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

On the other hand 1-local Hamiltonian is in P, and hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.},

They harness non-local regularities of noisy control trajectories and facilitate transfer learning between tasks. To leverage these powerful capabilities for quantum control optimization, we propose a new control framework to simultaneously optimize the speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization. The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in average-gate-error over baseline stochastic-gradient-descent solutions and up to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis counterparts.},

Although significant progress has been made over the previous two decades, substantial engineering efforts are required to scale these devices so they can be used to solve many problems of interest. Unfortunately, much of this exciting field is described using technical jargon and concepts from physics that are unfamiliar to a classically trained electromagnetic engineer. As a result, this work is often difficult for engineers to become engaged in. We hope to lower the barrier to this field by providing an accessible review of one of the most prevalently used quantum bits (qubits) in superconducting circuit systems, the transmon qubit. Most of the physics of these systems can be understood intuitively with only some background in quantum mechanics. As a result, we avoid invoking quantum mechanical concepts except where it is necessary to ease the transition between details in this work and those that would be encountered in the literature. We believe this leads to a gentler introduction to this fascinating field, and hope that more researchers from the classical electromagnetic community become engaged in this area in the future.},

Quantum error correction1,2 offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016)\% compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)\%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10−6 logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10−7 excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We present strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of barren plateaus are also classically simulable, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. This sheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of the information processing capabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren plateau-free landscapes and on the possibility of superpolynomial advantages from running them on quantum hardware. We end by discussing caveats in our arguments, the role of smart initializations, and by highlighting new opportunities that our perspective raises.},

	abstract = {We present a 1D repetition code based on the so-called cat qubits as a viable approach toward hardware-efficient universal and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The cat qubits that are stabilized by a two-photon driven-dissipative process exhibit a tunable noise bias where the effective bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed with the average number of photons. We propose a realization of a set of gates on the cat qubits that preserve such a noise bias. Combining these base qubit operations, we build, at the level of the repetition cat qubit, a universal set of fully protected logical gates. This set includes single-qubit preparations and measurements, not, controlled-not, and controlled-controlled-not (Toffoli) gates. Remarkably, this construction avoids the costly magic state preparation, distillation, and injection. Finally, all required operations on the cat qubits could be performed with slight modifications of existing experimental setups.},

	abstract = {Quantum error correction is crucial for scalable quantum information processing applications. Traditional discrete-variable quantum codes that use multiple two-level systems to encode logical information can be hardware-intensive. An alternative approach is provided by bosonic codes, which use the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information. Two promising features of bosonic codes are that syndrome measurements are natively analog and that they can be concatenated with discrete-variable codes. In this work, we propose novel decoding methods that explicitly exploit the analog syndrome information obtained from the bosonic qubit readout in a concatenated architecture. Our methods are versatile and can be generally applied to any bosonic code concatenated with a quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of quasi-single-shot protocols as a novel approach that significantly reduces the number of repeated syndrome measurements required when decoding under phenomenological noise. To realize the protocol, we present a first implementation of time-domain decoding with the overlapping window method for general QLDPC codes, and a novel analog single-shot decoding method. Our results lay the foundation for general decoding algorithms using analog information and demonstrate promising results in the direction of fault-tolerant quantum computation with concatenated bosonic-QLDPC codes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15465},
	abstract = {In existing general-purpose architectures for surface-code-based fault-tolerant quantum computers, the cost of a quantum computation is determined by the circuit volume, i.e., the number of qubits multiplied by the number of non-Clifford gates. We introduce an architecture using non-2D-local connections in which the cost does not scale with the number of qubits, and instead only with the number of logical operations. Each logical operation has an associated active volume, such that the cost of a quantum computation can be quantified as a sum of active volumes of all operations. For quantum computations with thousands of logical qubits, the active volume can be orders of magnitude lower than the circuit volume. Importantly, the architecture does not require all-to-all connectivity between N logical qubits. Instead, each logical qubit is connected to O(log N) other sites. As an example, we show that, using the same number of logical qubits, a 2048-bit factoring algorithm can be executed 44 times faster than on a general-purpose architecture without non-local connections. With photonic qubits, long-range connections are available and we show how photonic components can be used to construct a fusion-based active-volume quantum computer.},

	abstract = {Measurement-free quantum error correction (MFQEC) offers an alternative to standard measurement-based QEC in platforms with an unconditional qubit reset gate. We revisit the question of fault tolerance (FT) for a measurement-free variant of the Steane code that leverages multi-qubit gates and redundant syndrome extraction, finding previously overlooked phase-flip errors that undermine FT. We then construct a revised MFQEC circuit that is resistant to all single-qubit errors, but which nonetheless cannot tolerate certain correlated errors. In order to investigate FT systematically, we introduce an efficient method to classically simulate MFQEC circuits with (i) Clifford gates for syndrome extraction, (ii) syndrome-controlled Pauli operations for decoding, and (iii) a Pauli noise model. We thereby find a pseudothreshold of \${\textbackslash}sim0.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ for our revised MFQEC Steane code under a restricted noise model previously considered in the literature. We then relax noise model assumptions to identify general requirements for FT with multi-qubit gates, finding that existing multi-qubit neutral atom gates are incompatible with fault-tolerant syndrome extraction in a straightforward implementation of both measurement-based and measurement-free variants of the Steane code. Decomposing multi-qubit gates into two-qubit gates similarly spoils FT. Finally, we discuss the theoretical ingredients that are necessary to recover FT for MFQEC codes, including single-shot FT and a recent proposal by Heu\{{\textbackslash}ss\}en {\textbackslash}textit\{et al.\}{\textasciitilde}[arXiv:2307.13296] to achieve FT by ``copying'' errors onto an ancilla register.

Significant improvements have been made recently to simulate the time-evolution operator \$U(t) = e{\textasciicircum}\{i{\textbackslash}mathcal\{{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\}t\}\$ where \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\}\$ is the electronic structure Hamiltonian, or to simulate \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\}\$ directly (when written as a linear combination of unitaries) by using block encoding or "qubitization" techniques. A fundamental measure quantifying the practical implementation complexity of these quantum algorithms is the so-called "1-norm" of the qubit-representation of the Hamiltonian, which can be reduced by writing the Hamiltonian in factorized or tensor-hypercontracted forms for instance. In this work, we investigate the effect of classical pre-optimization of the electronic structure Hamiltonian representation, via single-particle basis transformation, on the 1-norm. Specifically, we employ several localization schemes and benchmark the 1-norm of several systems of different sizes (number of atoms and active space sizes). We also derive a new formula for the 1-norm as a function of the electronic integrals, and use this quantity as a cost function for an orbital-optimization scheme that improves over localization schemes. This paper gives more insights about the importance of the 1-norm in quantum computing for quantum chemistry, and provides simple ways of decreasing its value to reduce the complexity of quantum algorithms.},

However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected ``logical'' qubits, where information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy, poses significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Utilizing logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral atom arrays, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities, arbitrary connectivity, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout. Operating this logical processor with various types of encodings, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface code distance from d=3 to d=7, preparation of color code qubits with break-even fidelities, fault-tolerant creation of logical GHZ states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 color code qubits. Finally, using three-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling.

Quantum process tomography is a standard technique for estimating these errors but is both time consuming (when one wants to learn only a few key parameters) and usually inaccurate without resources such as perfect state preparation and measurement, which might not be available. With the goal of efficiently and accurately estimating specific errors using minimal resources, we develop a parameter estimation technique, which can gauge key systematic parameters (specifically, amplitude and off-resonance errors) in a universal single-qubit gate set with provable robustness and efficiency. In particular, our estimates achieve the optimal efficiency, Heisenberg scaling, and do so without entanglement and entirely within a single-qubit Hilbert space. Our main theorem making this possible is a robust version of the phase estimation procedure of Higgins et al. [B. L. Higgins et al., New J. Phys. 11, 073023 (2009)].},

Here, we simulate the dynamics of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using 16 qubits on a digital superconducting quantum processor. We observe separations in the spreading velocities of charge and spin densities in the highly excited regime, a regime that is beyond the conventional quasiparticle picture. To minimize systematic errors, we introduce an accurate gate calibration procedure that is fast enough to capture temporal drifts of the gate parameters. We also employ a sequence of error-mitigation techniques to reduce decoherence effects and residual systematic errors. These procedures allow us to simulate the time evolution of the model faithfully despite having over 600 two-qubit gates in our circuits.

	abstract = {The required precision to perform quantum simulations beyond the capabilities of classical computers imposes major experimental and theoretical challenges. Here, we develop a characterization technique to benchmark the implementation precision of a specific quantum simulation task. We infer all parameters of the bosonic Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of excitations in a two-dimensional grid of nearest-neighbour coupled superconducting qubits. We devise a robust algorithm for identification of Hamiltonian parameters from measured times series of the expectation values of single-mode canonical coordinates. Using super-resolution and denoising methods, we first extract eigenfrequencies of the governing Hamiltonian from the complex time domain measurement; next, we recover the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian via constrained manifold optimization over the orthogonal group. For five and six coupled qubits, we identify Hamiltonian parameters with sub-MHz precision and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our approach enables us to distinguish and quantify the effects of state preparation and measurement errors and show that they are the dominant sources of errors in the implementation. Our results quantify the implementation accuracy of analog dynamics and introduce a diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.},

With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.},

Our algorithm separates the gate parameter \${\textbackslash}varphi\${\textasciitilde}(single-qubit Z phase) that is susceptible to time-dependent error from the target gate parameter \${\textbackslash}theta\${\textasciitilde}(swap-angle between {\textbar}10{\textgreater} and {\textbar}01{\textgreater} states) that is largely free of time-dependent error. Our method achieves an accuracy of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ radians in standard deviation for learning \${\textbackslash}theta\$ in superconducting-qubit experiments, outperforming existing alternative schemes by two orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate the increased robustness in learning time-dependent gate parameters through fast Fourier transformation and sequential phase difference. We show both theoretically and numerically that there is an interesting transition of the optimal metrology variance scaling as a function of circuit depth \$d\$ from the pre-asymptotic regime \$d {\textbackslash}ll 1/{\textbackslash}theta\$ to Heisenberg limit \$d {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$. Remarkably, in the pre-asymptotic regime our method's estimation variance on time-sensitive parameter \${\textbackslash}varphi\$ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg limit as a function of depth, \${\textbackslash}text\{Var\}({\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}varphi\}){\textbackslash}approx 1/d{\textasciicircum}4\$.

	abstract = {Demonstrating small error rates by integrating quantum error correction (QEC) into an architecture of quantum computing is the next milestone towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Encoding logical qubits with superconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate for FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which we call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by cosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components in Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized error DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome values for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by dynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating probable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We investigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with quantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the period of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore, Q3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size to realize FTQC. Our scheme is versatile for mitigating MBBEs, i.e., temporal variations of error properties, on a wide range of physical devices and FTQC architectures since it relies only on the standard features of topological stabilizer codes.},

We analyze the error accumulated in observables in this setting and show that, due to stochastic error cancellation, with high probability the error scales as the square root of the number of qubits instead of linearly. We explore the concentration phenomenon of this error as well as its implications for local observables in the thermodynamic limit.},

	abstract = {Technologies that rely on quantum bits (qubits) require long coherence times and high-fidelity operations1. Superconducting qubits are one of the leading platforms for achieving these objectives2,3. However, the coherence of superconducting qubits is affected by the breaking of Cooper pairs of electrons4–6. The experimentally observed density of the broken Cooper pairs, referred to as quasiparticles, is orders of magnitude higher than the value predicted at equilibrium by the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory of superconductivity7–9. Previous work10–12 has shown that infrared photons considerably increase the quasiparticle density, yet even in the best-isolated systems, it remains much higher10 than expected, suggesting that another generation mechanism exists13. Here we provide evidence that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays contributes to this observed difference. The effect of ionizing radiation leads to an elevated quasiparticle density, which we predict would ultimately limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits of the type measured here to milliseconds. We further demonstrate that radiation shielding reduces the flux of ionizing radiation and thereby increases the energy-relaxation time. Albeit a small effect for today’s qubits, reducing or mitigating the impact of ionizing radiation will be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.},

Multi-tenancy has a promise of allowing better utilization of the quantum computer hardware, but also opens up the quantum computer to new types of security attacks. As this and other recent research shows, it is possible to perform a fault injection attack using crosstalk on quantum computers when a victim and attacker circuits are instantiated as co-tenants on the same quantum computer. To ensure such attacks do not happen, this paper proposes that new techniques should be developed to help catch malicious circuits before they are loaded onto quantum computer hardware. Following ideas from classical computers, a compile-time technique can be designed to scan quantum computer programs for mali-cious or suspicious code patterns before they are compiled into quantum circuits that run on a quantum computer. This paper presents ongoing work which demonstrates how crosstalk can affect Grover's algorithm, and then presents suggestions of how quantum programs could be analyzed to catch circuits that generate large amounts of crosstalk with malicious intent.},

We find that interpolating between optimized control pulses for different quantum operations does not immediately yield a high-fidelity intermediate operation. To solve this problem, we propose a method to optimize control pulses specifically to provide good interpolations. We pick several reference operations in the gate family of interest and optimize pulses that implement these operations, then iteratively re-optimize the pulses to guide their shapes to be similar for operations that are closely related. Once this set of reference pulses is calibrated, we can use a straightforward linear interpolation method to instantly obtain high-fidelity pulses for arbitrary gates in the continuous operation space. We demonstrate this procedure on the three-parameter Cartan decomposition of two-qubit gates to obtain control pulses for any arbitrary two-qubit gate (up to single-qubit operations) with consistently high fidelity. Compared to previous neural network approaches, the method is 7.7x more computationally efficient to calibrate the pulse space for the set of all single-qubit gates. Our technique generalizes to any number of gate parameters and could easily be used with advanced pulse optimization algorithms to allow for better translation from simulation to experiment.},

              We propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm that uses a fault-tolerant (FT) gate-set, and is hence suitable for implementation on a future error-corrected quantum computer. VQE quantum circuits are typically designed for near-term, noisy quantum devices and have continuously parameterized rotation gates as the central building block. On the other hand, an FT quantum computer (FTQC) can only implement a discrete set of logical gates, such as the so-called Clifford+
              T
              gates. We show that the energy minimization of VQE can be performed with such an FT discrete gate-set, where we use the Ross–Selinger algorithm to transpile the continuous rotation gates to the error-correctable Clifford+
              T
              gate-set. We find that there is no loss of convergence when compared to the one of parameterized circuits if an adaptive accuracy of the transpilation is used in the VQE optimization. State preparation with VQE requires only a moderate number of
              T
              -gates, depending on the system size and transpilation accuracy. We demonstrate these properties on emulators for two prototypical spin models with up to 16 qubits. This is a promising result for the integration of VQE and more generally variational algorithms in the emerging FT setting, where they can form building blocks of the general quantum algorithms that will become accessible in an FTQC.},

	abstract = {Near-term quantum computing (QC) systems have limited qubit counts, high gate (instruction) error rates, and typically support a minimal instruction set having one type of two-qubit gate (2Q). To reduce program instruction counts and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates (Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. However, having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the best expressivity with acceptable calibration time. We develop NuOp, a flexible compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model. Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude. With several vendors proposing rich gate families as means to higher fidelity, our work has potential to provide valuable instruction set design guidance for near-term QC systems.},

	abstract = {Crosstalk is a major source of noise in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems and is a fundamental challenge for hardware design. When multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead. On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to performance. Our work makes the case for software mitigation of crosstalk errors.},

	abstract = {Near-term quantum computers contain noisy devices, which makes it difficult to infer the correct answer even if a program is run for thousands of trials. On current machines, qubit measurements tend to be the most error-prone operations (with an average error-rate of 4\%) and often limit the size of quantum programs that can be run reliably on these systems. As quantum programs create and manipulate correlated states, all the program qubits are measured in each trial and thus, the severity of measurement errors increases with the program size. The fidelity of quantum programs can be improved by reducing the number of measurement operations. We present JigSaw, a framework that reduces the impact of measurement errors by running a program in two modes. First, running the entire program and measuring all the qubits for half of the trials to produce a global (albeit noisy) histogram. Second, running additional copies of the program and measuring only a subset of qubits in each copy, for the remaining trials, to produce localized (higher fidelity) histograms over the measured qubits. JigSaw then employs a Bayesian post-processing step, whereby the histograms produced by the subset measurements are used to update the global histogram. Our evaluations using three different IBM quantum computers with 27 and 65 qubits show that JigSaw improves the success rate on average by 3.6x and up-to 8.4x. Our analysis shows that the storage and time complexity of JigSaw scales linearly with the number of qubits and trials, making JigSaw applicable to programs with hundreds of qubits.},

	abstract = {Near-term quantum computers do not have the ability to perform error correction. Such Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can produce incorrect output as the computation is subjected to errors. The applications on a NISQ machine try to infer the correct output by running the same program thousands of times and logging the output. If the error rates are low and the errors are not correlated, then the correct answer can be inferred as the one appearing with the highest frequency. Unfortunately, quantum computers are subjected to correlated errors, which can cause an incorrect answer to appear more frequently than the correct answer. We observe that recent work on qubit mapping (including the recent work on variation-aware mapping) tries to obtain the best possible qubit allocation and uses it for all the trials. This approach significantly increases the vulnerability to correlated errors -- if the mapping becomes susceptible to a particular form of error, then all the trials will get subjected to the same error, which can cause the same wrong answer to appear as the output for a significant fraction of the trials. To mitigate the vulnerability to such correlated errors, this paper leverages the concept of diversity and proposes an Ensemble of Diverse Mappings (EDM). EDM uses diversity in qubit allocation to run copies of an input program with a diverse set of mappings, thus steering the trials towards making different mistakes. By combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, EDM amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect answers. Our experiments with ibmq-melbourne (14-qubit) machine shows that EDM improves the inference quality by 2.3x compared to the current state-of-the-art mapping algorithms.},

	abstract = {Transient errors from the dynamic NISQ noise landscape are challenging to comprehend and are especially detrimental to classes of applications that are iterative and/or long-running, and therefore their timely mitigation is important for quantum advantage in real-world applications. The most popular examples of iterative long-running quantum applications are variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Iteratively, VQA's classical optimizer evaluates circuit candidates on an objective function and picks the best circuits towards achieving the application's target. Noise fluctuation can cause a significant transient impact on the objective function estimation of the VQA iterations / tuning candidates. This can severely affect VQA tuning and, by extension, its accuracy and convergence. This paper proposes QISMET: Quantum Iteration Skipping to Mitigate Error Transients, to navigate the dynamic noise landscape of VQAs. QISMET actively avoids instances of high fluctuating noise which are predicted to have a significant transient error impact on specific VQA iterations. To achieve this, QISMET estimates transient error in VQA iterations and designs a controller to keep the VQA tuning faithful to the transient-free scenario. By doing so, QISMET efficiently mitigates a large portion of the transient noise impact on VQAs and is able to improve the fidelity by 1.3x-3x over a traditional VQA baseline, with 1.6-2.4x improvement over alternative approaches, across different applications and machines. Further, to diligently analyze the effects of transients, this work also builds transient noise models for target VQA applications from observing real machine transients. These are then integrated with the Qiskit simulator.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12472},
	abstract = {Numerous reports claim that quantum advantage, which should emerge as a direct consequence of the advent of quantum computers, will herald a new era of chemical research because it will enable scientists to perform the kinds of quantum chemical simulations that have not been possible before. Such simulations on quantum computers, promising a significantly greater accuracy and speed, are projected to exert a great impact on the way we can probe reality, predict the outcomes of chemical experiments, and even drive design of drugs, catalysts, and materials. In this work we review the current status of quantum hardware and algorithm theory and examine whether such popular claims about quantum advantage are really going to be transformative. We go over subtle complications of quantum chemical research that tend to be overlooked in discussions involving quantum computers. We estimate quantum computer resources that will be required for performing calculations on quantum computers with chemical accuracy for several types of molecules. In particular, we directly compare the resources and timings associated with classical and quantum computers for the molecules H\$\_2\$ for increasing basis set sizes, and Cr\$\_2\$ for a variety of complete active spaces (CAS) within the scope of the CASCI and CASSCF methods. The results obtained for the chromium dimer enable us to estimate the size of the active space at which computations of non-dynamic correlation on a quantum computer should take less time than analogous computations on a classical computer. Using this result, we speculate on the types of chemical applications for which the use of quantum computers would be both beneficial and relevant to industrial applications in the short term.},

	abstract = {Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) trapped-ion devices are subject to errors which can significantly impact the accuracy of calculations if left unchecked. A form of error mitigation called zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) can decrease an algorithm's sensitivity to these errors without increasing the number of required qubits. Here, we explore different methods for integrating this error mitigation technique into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for calculating the ground state of the HeH+ molecule at 0.8 Angstrom in the presence of realistic noise. Using the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) trapped-ion device, we test three methods of scaling noise for extrapolation: time-stretching the two-qubit gates, scaling the sideband amplitude parameter, and inserting two-qubit gate identity operations into the ansatz circuit. We find time-stretching and sideband amplitude scaling fail to scale the noise on our particular hardware in a way that can be directly extrapolated to zero noise. Scaling our noise with global gate identity insertions and extrapolating after variational optimization, we achieve an estimate of the ground state energy within -0.004 +- 0.04 Hartree; outside chemical accuracy, but greatly improved over our non-error-mitigated estimate with error 0.127 +- 0.008 Hartree. Our results show that the efficacy of this error mitigation technique depends on choosing the correct implementation for a given device architecture.},

The exact synthesis problem for this gate set is the problem of constructing a circuit for a given such matrix. Existing methods produce circuits consisting of \$O(2{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}log(n)k)\$ gates, where \$n\$ is the dimension of the matrix. In this paper, we provide two improved synthesis methods. First, we show that a technique introduced by Kliuchnikov in 2013 for Clifford+\$T\$ circuits can be straightforwardly adapted to Toffoli-Hadamard circuits, reducing the complexity of the synthesized circuit from \$O(2{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}log(n)k)\$ to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}log(n)k)\$. Then, we present an alternative synthesis method of similarly improved cost, but whose application is restricted to circuits on no more than three qubits. Our results also apply to orthogonal matrices over the dyadic fractions, which correspond to circuits using the 2-qubit gate \$H{\textbackslash}otimes H\$, rather than the usual single-qubit Hadamard gate \$H\$.},

When embedding these and other constant-rate qLDPC codes into 2D, a significant number of nonlocal connections are required, posing difficulties for some quantum computing architectures. In this work, we introduce a fault-tolerance scheme that aims to alleviate the effects of implementing this nonlocality by measuring generators acting on spatially distant qubits less frequently than those which do not. We investigate the performance of a simplified version of this scheme, where the measured generators are randomly selected. When applied to hypergraph product codes and a modified small-set-flip decoding algorithm, we prove that for a sufficiently high percentage of generators being measured, a threshold still exists. We also find numerical evidence that the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed even when a large constant fraction of generators are not measured.},

However, the accuracy needed to outperform classical methods has not been achieved so far. Here, using 18 superconducting qubits, we provide an experimental blueprint for an accurate condensed-matter simulator and demonstrate how to investigate fundamental electronic properties. We benchmark the underlying method by reconstructing the single-particle band structure of a one-dimensional wire. We demonstrate nearly complete mitigation of decoherence and readout errors, and measure the energy eigenvalues of this wire with an error of approximately 0.01 rad, whereas typical energy scales are of the order of 1 rad. Insight into the fidelity of this algorithm is gained by highlighting the robust properties of a Fourier transform, including the ability to resolve eigenenergies with a statistical uncertainty of 10−4 rad. We also synthesize magnetic flux and disordered local potentials, which are two key tenets of a condensed-matter system. When sweeping the magnetic flux we observe avoided level crossings in the spectrum, providing a detailed fingerprint of the spatial distribution of local disorder. By combining these methods we reconstruct electronic properties of the eigenstates, observing persistent currents and a strong suppression of conductance with added disorder. Our work describes an accurate method for quantum simulation5,6 and paves the way to study new quantum materials with superconducting qubits.},

We consider in particular fermionic atoms in programmable tweezer arrays and develop different protocols to implement nonlocal gates, guaranteeing Fermi statistics at the hardware level. We use this gate set, together with Rydberg-mediated interaction gates, to find efficient circuit decompositions for digital and variational quantum simulation algorithms, illustrated here for molecular energy estimation.

Having a nonzero correlation length, the AKLT state cannot be exactly prepared by a constant-depth unitary circuit composed of local gates. In this work, we demonstrate that this no-go limit can be evaded by augmenting a constant-depth circuit with fusion measurements, such that the total preparation time is independent of system size and entirely deterministic. We elucidate our preparation scheme using the language of tensor networks, and furthermore show that the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry of the AKLT state directly affords this speed-up over previously known preparation methods. To demonstrate the practical advantage of measurement-assisted preparation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we carry out our protocol on an IBM Quantum processor. We measure both the string order and entanglement spectrum of prepared AKLT chains and, employing these as metrics, find improved results over the known (purely unitary) sequential preparation approach. We conclude with a demonstration of quantum teleportation using the AKLT state prepared by our measurement-assisted scheme. This work thus serves to provide an efficient strategy to prepare a specific resource in the form of the AKLT state and, more broadly, experimentally demonstrates the possibility for realizable improvement in state preparation afforded by measurement-based circuit depth reduction strategies on NISQ-era devices.},

Extrapolating to circuit depths which can no longer be emulated classically, this suggests a region of advantage in quantum expressiveness in the representation of physical ground-states.},

	abstract = {Quantum simulation traditionally relies on unitary dynamics, inherently imposing efficiency constraints on the generation of intricate entangled states. In principle, these limitations can be superseded by non-unitary, dynamic circuits. These circuits exploit measurements alongside conditional feed-forward operations, providing a promising approach for long-range entangling gates, higher effective connectivity of near-term hardware, and more efficient state preparations. Here, we explore the utility of shallow dynamic circuits for creating long-range entanglement on large-scale quantum devices. Specifically, we study two tasks: CNOT gate teleportation between up to 101 qubits by feeding forward 99 mid-circuit measurement outcomes, and the preparation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with genuine entanglement. In the former, we observe that dynamic circuits can outperform their unitary counterparts. In the latter, by tallying instructions of compiled quantum circuits, we provide an error budget detailing the obstacles that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of dynamic circuits. Looking forward, we expect dynamic circuits to be useful for generating long-range entanglement in the near term on large-scale quantum devices.},

	abstract = {The cloud-based environments in which today's and future quantum computers will operate, raise concerns about the security and privacy of user's intellectual property. Quantum circuits submitted to cloud-based quantum computer providers represent sensitive or proprietary algorithms developed by users that need protection. Further, input data is hard-coded into the circuits, and leakage of the circuits can expose users' data. To help protect users' circuits and data from possibly malicious quantum computer cloud providers, this work presented the first hardware architecture for a trusted execution environment for quantum computers. To protect the user's circuits and data, the quantum computer control pulses are obfuscated with decoy control pulses. While digital data can be encrypted, analog control pulses cannot and this paper proposed the novel decoy pulse approach to obfuscate the analog control pulses. The proposed decoy pulses can easily be added to the software by users. Meanwhile, the hardware components of the architecture proposed in this paper take care of eliminating, i.e. attenuating, the decoy pulses inside the superconducting quantum computer's dilution refrigerator before they reach the qubits. The hardware architecture also contains tamper-resistant features to protect the trusted hardware and users' information. The work leverages a new metric of variational distance to analyze the impact and scalability of hardware protection. The variational distance of the circuits protected with our scheme, compared to unprotected circuits, is in the range of only \$0.16\$ to \$0.26\$. This work demonstrates that protection from possibly malicious cloud providers is feasible and all the hardware components needed for the proposed architecture are available today.},

Due to a result of Regev and Schiff [ICALP '08 pp. 773], we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order \$o(2{\textasciicircum}\{-n/2\})\$ (where \$N=2{\textasciicircum}n\$ is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] or quantum machine learning [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 130503 (2014)] that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of "active" gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.},

The idea is to turn each circuit element into a set of low-weight gauge generators that enforce the input-output relations of that circuit element. Using this prescription, we can map an arbitrary stabilizer code into a new subsystem code with the same distance and number of encoded qubits but where all the generators have constant weight, at the cost of adding some ancilla qubits. With an additional overhead of ancilla qubits, the new code can also be made spatially local. Applying our construction to certain concatenated stabilizer codes yields families of subsystem codes with constant-weight generators and with minimum distance \$d = n{\textasciicircum}\{1-{\textbackslash}epsilon\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}epsilon = O(1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}log n\})\$. For spatially local codes in \$D\$ dimensions we nearly saturate a bound due to Bravyi and Terhal and achieve \$d = n{\textasciicircum}\{1-{\textbackslash}epsilon-1/D\}\$.

Practically realizing such an algorithm as a program for a quantum computer requires an efficient implementation of the data structure whose operations correspond to unitary operators that manipulate quantum superpositions of data. To correctly operate in superposition, an implementation must satisfy three properties -- reversibility, history independence, and bounded-time execution. Standard implementations, such as the representation of an abstract set as a hash table, fail these properties, calling for tools to develop specialized implementations. In this work, we present Core Tower, the first language for quantum programming with random-access memory. Core Tower enables the developer to implement data structures as pointer-based, linked data. It features a reversible semantics enabling every valid program to be translated to a unitary quantum circuit. We present Boson, the first memory allocator that supports reversible, history-independent, and constant-time dynamic memory allocation in quantum superposition. We also present Tower, a language for quantum programming with recursively defined data structures. Tower features a type system that bounds all recursion using classical parameters as is necessary for a program to execute on a quantum computer. Using Tower, we implement Ground, the first quantum library of data structures, including lists, stacks, queues, strings, and sets. We provide the first executable implementation of sets that satisfies all three mandated properties of reversibility, history independence, and bounded-time execution.},

	abstract = {Analog quantum algorithms are formulated in terms of Hamiltonians rather than unitary gates and include quantum adiabatic computing, quantum annealing, and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are promising candidates for near-term quantum applications, but they often require fine tuning via the annealing schedule or variational parameters. In this work, we explore connections between these analog algorithms, as well as limits in which they become approximations of the optimal procedure.Notably, we explore how the optimal procedure approaches a smooth adiabatic procedure but with a superposed oscillatory pattern that can be explained in terms of the interactions between the ground state and first excited state that effect the coherent error cancellation of diabatic transitions. Furthermore, we provide numeric and analytic evidence that QAOA emulates this optimal procedure with the length of each QAOA layer equal to the period of the oscillatory pattern. Additionally, the ratios of the QAOA bangs are determined by the smooth, non-oscillatory part of the optimal procedure. We provide arguments for these phenomena in terms of the product formula expansion of the optimal procedure. With these arguments, we conclude that different analog algorithms can emulate the optimal protocol under different limits and approximations. Finally, we present a new algorithm for better approximating the optimal protocol using the analytic and numeric insights from the rest of the paper. In practice, numerically, we find that this algorithm outperforms standard QAOA and naive quantum annealing procedures.},

We study these classical overheads for the surface code under a phenomenological phase-flip noise model with imperfect measurements. We find substantial improvements in the runtime of the global decoder and the communication bandwidth by using the pre-decoder. For instance, to achieve a logical failure probability of \$f = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ using qubits with physical error rate \$p = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ and a distance \$d=22\$ code, we find that the bandwidth cost is reduced by a factor of \$1000\$, and the time taken by a matching decoder is sped up by a factor of \$200\$.

In our approach, logic gates operate via logical Pauli measurements that preserve both the protection of the LDPC codes as well as the low overheads in terms of the required number of additional qubits. Compared with surface codes with the same code distance, we estimate order-of-magnitude improvements in the overheads for processing around one hundred logical qubits using this approach.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03011},
	abstract = {The anticipated applications of quantum computers span across science and industry, ranging from quantum chemistry and many-body physics to optimization, finance, and machine learning. Proposed quantum solutions in these areas typically combine multiple quantum algorithmic primitives into an overall quantum algorithm, which must then incorporate the methods of quantum error correction and fault tolerance to be implemented correctly on quantum hardware. As such, it can be difficult to assess how much a particular application benefits from quantum computing, as the various approaches are often sensitive to intricate technical details about the underlying primitives and their complexities. Here we present a survey of several potential application areas of quantum algorithms and their underlying algorithmic primitives, carefully considering technical caveats and subtleties. We outline the challenges and opportunities in each area in an "end-to-end" fashion by clearly defining the problem being solved alongside the input-output model, instantiating all "oracles," and spelling out all hidden costs. We also compare quantum solutions against state-of-the-art classical methods and complexity-theoretic limitations to evaluate possible quantum speedups. The survey is written in a modular, wiki-like fashion to facilitate navigation of the content. Each primitive and application area is discussed in a standalone section, with its own bibliography of references and embedded hyperlinks that direct to other relevant sections. This structure mirrors that of complex quantum algorithms that involve several layers of abstraction, and it enables rapid evaluation of how end-to-end complexities are impacted when subroutines are altered.},

	abstract = {Large-scale quantum computers have the potential to hold computational capabilities beyond conventional computers for certain problems. However, the physical qubits within a quantum computer are prone to noise and decoherence, which must be corrected in order to perform reliable, fault-tolerant quantum computations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing such computations. QEC continuously generates a continuous stream of data that decoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 MHz in superconducting quantum computers. A little known fact of QEC is that if the decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered and the quantum computer runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog problem. That is: the current leading proposal for fault-tolerant quantum computation is not scalable. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our parallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed, leading to a slow-down of the logical clock speed. However, the slow-down is now only polynomial in code size, averting the exponential slowdown. We numerically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code, showing no noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders and demonstrating the parallelization speedup.},

	abstract = {Logical qubits can be protected from decoherence by performing QEC cycles repeatedly. Algorithms for fault-tolerant QEC must be compiled to the specific hardware platform under consideration in order to practically realize a quantum memory that operates for in principle arbitrary long times. All circuit components must be assumed as noisy unless specific assumptions about the form of the noise are made. Modern QEC schemes are challenging to implement experimentally in physical architectures where in-sequence measurements and feed-forward of classical information cannot be reliably executed fast enough or even at all. Here we provide a novel scheme to perform QEC cycles without the need of measuring qubits that is fully fault-tolerant with respect to all components used in the circuit. Our scheme can be used for any low-distance CSS code since its only requirement towards the underlying code is a transversal CNOT gate. Similarly to Steane-type EC, we coherently copy errors to a logical auxiliary qubit but then apply a coherent feedback operation from the auxiliary system to the logical data qubit. The logical auxiliary qubit is prepared fault-tolerantly without measurements, too. We benchmark logical failure rates of the scheme in comparison to a flag-qubit based EC cycle. We map out a parameter region where our scheme is feasible and estimate physical error rates necessary to achieve the break-even point of beneficial QEC with our scheme. We outline how our scheme could be implemented in ion traps and with neutral atoms in a tweezer array. For recently demonstrated capabilities of atom shuttling and native multi-atom Rydberg gates, we achieve moderate circuit depths and beneficial performance of our scheme while not breaking fault tolerance. These results thereby enable practical fault-tolerant QEC in hardware architectures that do not support mid-circuit measurements.},

Moreover, we introduce a recipe that guarantees Fock basis states are mapped to computational basis states in qubit space, a desirable property for many applications in quantum computing. Based on this formalism, we introduce the Bonsai algorithm, which takes as input the potentially limited topology of the qubit connectivity of a quantum device and returns a tailored fermion-to-qubit mapping that reduces the SWAP overhead with respect to other paradigmatic mappings. We illustrate the algorithm by producing mappings for the heavy-hexagon topology widely used in IBM quantum computers. The resulting mappings have a favourable Pauli weight scaling \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\})\$ on this connectivity, while ensuring that no SWAP gates are necessary for single excitation operations.},

The \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PREPARE\}\$ circuit generates a quantum state which encodes the coefficients of the terms in the Hamiltonian as probability amplitudes and plays a crucial role in the state-of-the-art efficient implementations of quantum phase estimation. We employ the automatic quantum circuit encoding algorithm [Shirakawa \${\textbackslash}textit\{et al.\}\$, arXiv:2112.14524] to construct \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PREPARE\}\$ circuits, which requires classical simulations of quantum circuits of \$O({\textbackslash}log N)\$ qubits with \$N\$ being the number of qubits of the Hamiltonian.

We demonstrate our method by investigating the number of \$T\$-gates of the obtained \${\textbackslash}texttt\{PREPARE\}\$ circuits for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians of various molecules, which shows a constant-factor reduction compared to previous approaches that do not use ancillary qubits. Since the number of available logical qubits and \$T\$ gates will be limited at the early stage of the fault-tolerant quantum computing, the proposed method is particularly of use for performing the quantum phase estimation with such limited capability.},

Z-gates can correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse shaping techniques such as DRAG.

The error threshold of this code matches what can be achieved with random codes (hashing) for every single-qubit Pauli noise channel; it is the first explicit code shown to have this universal property. We present numerical evidence that the threshold even exceeds this hashing bound for an experimentally relevant range of noise parameters. Focusing on the common situation where qubit dephasing is the dominant noise, we show that this code has a practical, high-performance decoder and surpasses all previously known thresholds in the realistic setting where syndrome measurements are unreliable. We go on to demonstrate the favourable sub-threshold resource scaling that can be obtained by specialising a code to exploit structure in the noise.

We propose a strategy to run an entire QSP protocol on noisy quantum hardware by carefully reducing overhead costs at each step. To illustrate the approach, we consider the application of Hamiltonian simulation for which QSP implements a polynomial approximation of the time evolution operator. We test the protocol by running the algorithm on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer powered by Honeywell. In particular, we compute the time dependence of bipartite entanglement entropies for Ising spin chains and find good agreements with exact numerical simulations. To make the best use of the device, we determine optimal experimental parameters by using a simplified error model for the hardware and numerically studying the trade-off between Hamiltonian simulation time, polynomial degree, and total accuracy.

However, rigorous estimates of the threshold for generic errors are typically orders of magnitude worse than the threshold for stochastic Pauli errors. Specifically, coherent errors have a particularly harmful impact on the encoded space because they can map encoded states to superpositions of logical and error states. Further, coherent errors can add up and interfere over multiple rounds of error correction or between syndrome measurements, which may result in significantly worse errors than expected under a stochastic Pauli error model. In this paper, we present an algorithm which decoheres noise at the logical level, projecting the state of the system onto a logical state with a well-defined error. The algorithm does not significantly increase the depth of the logical circuit (and usually does not lead to any increase in depth), and applies generally to most fault-tolerant gadgets and error correction steps.},

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, introduced in this context by Macridin, Spentzouris, Amundson and Harnik building on the work of Somma, provides a guide with which to evaluate the efficacy of two field-space bases, the eigenstates of the field operator, as used by Jordan, Lee and Preskill, and eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator, to describe \$0+1\$- and \$d+1\$-dimensional scalar field theory. We show how techniques associated with improved actions, which are heavily utilized in Lattice QCD calculations to systematically reduce lattice-spacing artifacts, can be used to reduce the impact of the field digitization in \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4\$, but are found to be inferior to a complete digitization-improvement of the Hamiltonian using a Quantum Fourier Transform. When the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is satisfied, digitization errors scale as \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}log{\textbar}{\textbackslash}log {\textbar}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dig\}{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}sim n\_Q\$ (number of qubits describing the field at a given spatial site) for the low-lying states, leaving the familiar power-law lattice-spacing and finite-volume effects that scale as \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}log {\textbar}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm latt\}{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}sim N\_Q\$ (total number of qubits in the simulation). For localized(delocalized) field-space wavefunctions, it is found that \$n\_Q{\textbackslash}sim4(7)\$ qubits per spatial lattice site are sufficient to reduce theoretical digitization errors below error contributions associated with approximation of the time-evolution operator and noisy implementation on near-term quantum devices.},

	abstract = {Simulation of fermionic many-body systems on a quantum computer requires a suitable encoding of fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits. Here we revisit the Superfast Encoding introduced by Kitaev and one of the authors. This encoding maps a target fermionic Hamiltonian with two-body interactions on a graph of degree \$d\$ to a qubit simulator Hamiltonian composed of Pauli operators of weight \$O(d)\$. A system of \$m\$ fermi modes gets mapped to \$n=O(md)\$ qubits. We propose Generalized Superfast Encodings (GSE) which require the same number of qubits as the original one but have more favorable properties. First, we describe a GSE such that the corresponding quantum code corrects any single-qubit error provided that the interaction graph has degree \$d{\textbackslash}ge 6\$. In contrast, we prove that the original Superfast Encoding lacks the error correction property for \$d{\textbackslash}le 6\$. Secondly, we describe a GSE that reduces the Pauli weight of the simulator Hamiltonian from \$O(d)\$ to \$O({\textbackslash}log\{d\})\$. The robustness against errors and a simplified structure of the simulator Hamiltonian offered by GSEs can make simulation of fermionic systems within the reach of near-term quantum devices. As an example, we apply the new encoding to the fermionic Hubbard model on a 2D lattice.},

	abstract = {Modular quantum processor architectures are envisioned as a promising solution for the scalability of quantum computing systems beyond the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices era. Based upon interconnecting tens to hundreds of quantum cores via a quantum intranet, this approach unravels the pressing limitations of densely qubit-packed monolithic processors, mainly by mitigating the requirements of qubit control and enhancing qubit isolation, and therefore enables executing large-scale algorithms on quantum computers. In order to optimize such architectures, it is crucial to analyze the quantum state transfers occurring via inter-core communication networks, referred to as inter-core qubit traffic. This would also provide insights to improve the software and hardware stack for multi-core quantum computers. To this aim, we present a pioneering characterization of the spatio-temporal inter-core qubit traffic in large-scale circuits. The programs are executed on an all-to-all connected multi-core architecture that supports up to around 1000 qubits. We characterize the qubit traffic based on multiple performance metrics to assess the computational process and the communication overhead. Based on the showcased results, we conclude on the scalability of the presented algorithms, provide a set of guidelines to improve mapping quantum circuits to multi-core processors, and lay the foundations of benchmarking large-scale multi-core architectures.},

Most of these learning algorithms either assume quantum access to data -- making it unclear if quantum speed-ups still exist without making these strong assumptions, or are heuristic in nature with no provable advantage over classical algorithms. In this paper, we establish a rigorous quantum speed-up for supervised classification using a general-purpose quantum learning algorithm that only requires classical access to data. Our quantum classifier is a conventional support vector machine that uses a fault-tolerant quantum computer to estimate a kernel function. Data samples are mapped to a quantum feature space and the kernel entries can be estimated as the transition amplitude of a quantum circuit. We construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely-believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Meanwhile, the quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics.},

	abstract = {With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a supervised machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such "quantum models" are sometimes called "quantum neural networks", it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises and extends the idea of systematically rephrasing supervised quantum models as a kernel method. With this, a lot of near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers capable of solving classically intractable problems are under construction, and intermediate-scale devices are approaching completion. Current efforts to design large-scale devices require allocating immense resources to error correction, with the majority dedicated to the production of high-fidelity ancillary states known as magic-states. Leading techniques focus on dedicating a large, contiguous region of the processor as a single “magic-state distillation factory” responsible for meeting the magic-state demands of applications. In this work we design and analyze a set of optimized factory architectural layouts that divide a single factory into spatially distributed factories located throughout the processor. We find that distributed factory architectures minimize the space-time volume overhead imposed by distillation. Additionally, we find that the number of distributed components in each optimal configuration is sensitive to application characteristics and underlying physical device error rates. More specifically, we find that the rate at which T-gates are demanded by an application has a significant impact on the optimal distillation architecture. We develop an optimization procedure that discovers the optimal number of factory distillation rounds and number of output magic states per factory, as well as an overall system architecture that interacts with the factories. This yields between a 10x and 20x resource reduction compared to commonly accepted single factory designs. Performance is analyzed across representative application classes such as quantum simulation and quantum chemistry.},

As non-local operators lead to a slower quantum simulation, recent works have proposed ways of encoding fermionic systems locally. In this work, we show that locality may in fact be too strict of a condition and the size of operators can be reduced by encoding the system quasi-locally. We give examples relevant to lattice models of condensed matter and systems relevant to quantum gravity such as SYK models. Further, we provide a general construction for designing codes to suit the problem and resources at hand and show how one particular class of quasi-local encodings can be thought of as arising from truncating the state preparation circuit of a local encoding.

In quantum simulation, a complicated Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of a quantum system is decomposed into its constituent terms, where the effect of each term during time-evolution is individually computed. For many physical systems, the Hamiltonian has a large number of terms, constraining the scalability of established simulation methods. To address this limitation we introduce a new scheme that approximates the actual Hamiltonian with a sparser Hamiltonian containing fewer terms. By stochastically sparsifying weaker Hamiltonian terms, we benefit from a quadratic suppression of errors relative to deterministic approaches. Relying on optimality conditions from convex optimisation theory, we derive an appropriate probability distribution for the weaker Hamiltonian terms, and compare its error bounds with other probability ansatzes for some electronic structure Hamiltonians. Tuning the sparsity of our approximate Hamiltonians allows our scheme to interpolate between two recent random compilers: qDRIFT and randomized first order Trotter. Our scheme is thus an algorithm that combines the strengths of randomised Trotterisation with the efficiency of qDRIFT, and for intermediate gate budgets, outperforms both of these prior methods.},

	abstract = {Using error correcting codes and fault tolerant techniques, it is possible, at least in theory, to produce logical qubits with significantly lower error rates than the underlying physical qubits. Suppose, however, that the gates that act on these logical qubits are only approximation of the desired gate. This can arise, for example, in synthesizing a single qubit unitary from a set of Clifford and \$T\$ gates; for a generic such unitary, any finite sequence of gates only approximates the desired target. In this case, errors in the gate can add coherently so that, roughly, the error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ in the unitary of each gate must scale as \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}lesssim 1/N\$, where \$N\$ is the number of gates. If, however, one has the option of synthesizing one of several unitaries near the desired target, and if an average of these options is closer to the target, we give some elementary bounds showing cases in which the errors can be made to add incoherently by averaging over random choices, so that, roughly, one needs \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}lesssim 1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}\$. We remark on one particular application to distilling magic states where this effect happens automatically in the usual circuits.},

While the simulation of Hamiltonians has been studied extensively, scaling these simulations to larger or more complex systems is often challenging and may require approximations or new simulation methods altogether. DDs offer such an alternative that has not yet been applied to Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of DDs for this task. To this end, we review the basics of DDs such as their construction and present how the relevant operations for Hamiltonian simulation are implemented in this data structure—leading to the ﬁrst DD-based Hamiltonian simulation approach. Based on several series of evaluations and comparisons, we then discuss insights about the performance of this complementary approach. Overall, these studies show that DDs indeed may offer a promising new data structure which, for certain examples, can provide orders of magnitudes of improvement compared to the state-of-the-art, yet also comes with its own, fundamentally different, limitations.},

	abstract = {For superconducting qubits, microwave pulses drive rotations around the Bloch sphere. The phase of these drives can be used to generate zero-duration arbitrary "virtual" Z-gates which, combined with two \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}pi/2\}\$ gates, can generate any SU(2) gate. Here we show how to best utilize these virtual Z-gates to both improve algorithms and correct pulse errors. We perform randomized benchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and Z-gates and show that the error per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard finite-duration X and Y gates. Z-gates can correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse shaping techniques such as DRAG. We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping to minimize leakage and Z-gates to correct rotation errors (DRAGZ) realizes a 13.3{\textasciitilde}ns \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}pi/2\}\$ gate characterized by low error (\$1.95[3]{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$) and low leakage (\$3.1[6]{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$). Ultimately leakage is limited by the finite temperature of the qubit, but this limit is two orders-of-magnitude smaller than pulse errors due to decoherence.},

	doi = {10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00050},
	abstract = {Running quantum programs is fraught with challenges on on today's noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Many of these challenges originate from the error characteristics that stem from rapid decoherence and noise during measurement, qubit connections, crosstalk, the qubits themselves, and transformations of qubit state via gates. Not only are qubits not “created equal”, but their noise level also changes over time. IBM is said to calibrate their quantum systems once per day and reports noise levels (errors) at the time of such calibration. This information is subsequently used to map circuits to higher quality qubits and connections up to the next calibration point. This work provides evidence that there is room for improvement over this daily calibration cycle. It contributes a technique to measure noise levels (errors) related to qubits immediately before executing one or more sensitive circuits and shows that just-in-time noise measurements can benefit late physical qubit mappings. With this just-in-time recalibrated transpilation, the fidelity of results is improved over IBM's default mappings, which only uses their daily calibrations. The framework assess two major sources of noise, namely readout errors (measurement errors) and two-qubit gate/connection errors. Experiments indicate that the accuracy of circuit results improves by 3-304\% on average and up to 400\% with on-the-fly circuit mappings based on error measurements just prior to application execution.},

This reduction in quantumness is essential, as it simplifies the Hamiltonian and shortens physical circuit-depth, overcoming constraints imposed by limited error correction. We improve the performance of both digital and analog quantum computers on ground state and finite temperature molecular simulations, not only outperforming the Hartree-Fock solution, but also achieving consistent improvements as we ascend the quantum magic ladder.

In this work, we test the PTA’s accuracy at predicting the logical error rate by simulating the 5-qubit code using a 9-qubit circuit with realistic decoherence and unitary gate errors. We find evidence for good agreement with exact simulation, with the PTA overestimating the logical error rate by a factor of 2 to 3.

However, the long-range connectivity required to implement such codes makes their physical realization challenging. Here, we propose a hardware-efficient scheme to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation with high-rate qLDPC codes on reconfigurable atom arrays, directly compatible with recently demonstrated experimental capabilities. Our approach utilizes the product structure inherent in many qLDPC codes to implement the non-local syndrome extraction circuit via atom rearrangement, resulting in effectively constant overhead in practically relevant regimes. We prove the fault tolerance of these protocols, perform circuit-level simulations of memory and logical operations with these codes, and find that our qLDPC-based architecture starts to outperform the surface code with as few as several hundred physical qubits at a realistic physical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. We further find that less than 3000 physical qubits are sufficient to obtain over an order of magnitude qubit savings compared to the surface code, and quantum algorithms involving thousands of logical qubits can be performed using less than \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ physical qubits. Our work paves the way for explorations of low-overhead quantum computing with qLDPC codes at a practical scale, based on current experimental technologies.},

Here we present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory based on a family of LDPC codes with a high encoding rate that achieves an error threshold of \$0.8{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the standard circuit-based noise model. This is on par with the surface code which has remained an uncontested leader in terms of its high error threshold for nearly 20 years. The full syndrome measurement cycle for a length-\$n\$ code in our family requires \$n\$ ancillary qubits and a depth-7 circuit composed of nearest-neighbor CNOT gates. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph that consists of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. As a concrete example, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for ten million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$. We argue that achieving the same level of error suppression on 12 logical qubits with the surface code would require more than 4000 physical qubits.

	abstract = {Perturbation theory is an important technique for reducing computational cost and providing physical insights in simulating quantum systems with classical computers. Here, we provide a quantum algorithm to obtain perturbative energies on quantum computers. The benefit of using quantum computers is that we can start the perturbation from a Hamiltonian that is classically hard to solve. The proposed algorithm uses quantum signal processing (QSP) to achieve this goal. Along with the perturbation theory, we construct a technique for ground state preparation with detailed computational cost analysis, which can be of independent interest. We also estimate a rough computational cost of the algorithm for simple chemical systems such as water clusters and polyacene molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of such estimates for practical applications of QSP. Unfortunately, we find that the proposed algorithm, at least in its current form, does not exhibit practical numbers despite of the efficiency of QSP compared to conventional quantum algorithms. However, perturbation theory itself is an attractive direction to explore because of its physical interpretability; it provides us insights about what interaction gives an important contribution to the properties of systems. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional approaches based on the quantum phase estimation algorithm, where we can only obtain values of energy. From this aspect, this work is a first step towards ``explainable'' quantum simulation on fault-tolerant quantum computers.},

While current error-correcting strategies focus on correcting errors in quantum states or quantum gates, these fine-grained error-correction methods can incur significant overhead for quantum algorithms of increasing complexity. We present a first step in achieving error correction at the level of quantum algorithms by combining a unified perspective on modern quantum algorithms via quantum signal processing (QSP). An error model of under- or over-rotation of the signal processing operator parameterized by \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textless} 1\$ is introduced. It is shown that while Pauli \$Z\$-errors are not recoverable without additional resources, Pauli \$X\$ and \$Y\$ errors can be arbitrarily suppressed by coherently appending a noisy `recovery QSP.' Furthermore, it is found that a recovery QSP of length \$O(2{\textasciicircum}k c{\textasciicircum}\{k{\textasciicircum}2\} d)\$ is sufficient to correct any length-\$d\$ QSP with \$c\$ unique phases to \$k{\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$-order in error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$. Allowing an additional assumption, a lower bound of \${\textbackslash}Omega(cd)\$ is shown, which is tight for \$k = 1\$, on the length of the recovery sequence.

Almost all molecular properties can be expressed an energy derivative, including molecular forces, which are essential for applications such as molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we introduce new quantum algorithms for computing molecular energy derivatives with significantly lower complexity than prior methods. Under cost models appropriate for noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, we demonstrate how low-rank factorization and other tomography schemes can be optimized for energy derivative calculations. We numerically demonstrate that our techniques reduce the number of circuit repetitions required by many orders of magnitude for even modest systems, and that the cost of estimating an entire force vector may in some systems be lower than the cost of estimating the energy. In the context of fault-tolerant algorithms, we develop new methods of estimating energy derivatives with Heisenberg limited scaling, incorporating state-of-the-art techniques for block encoding fermionic operators. In contrast to our near-term results, we find that the cost of estimating forces with any of our Heisenberg-limited methods is bounded by the cost of estimating energies, due to inner loops requiring either energy estimation or reflections around the ground state. This implies that applications such as geometry optimization, coupling parameter estimation, and spectral prediction may be practical on fault-tolerant quantum devices, but tractable molecular dynamics simulations of large-scale systems requires further algorithmic advances.},

	abstract = {When estimating the eigenvalues of a given observable, even fault-tolerant quantum computers will be subject to errors, namely algorithmic errors. These stem from approximations in the algorithms implementing the unitary passed to phase estimation to extract the eigenvalues, e.g. Trotterisation or qubitisation. These errors can be tamed by increasing the circuit complexity, which may be unfeasible in early-stage fault-tolerant devices. Rather, we propose in this work an error mitigation strategy that enables a reduction of the algorithmic errors up to any order, at the cost of evaluating the eigenvalues of a set of observables implementable with limited resources. The number of required observables is estimated and is shown to only grow polynomially with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, and in some cases, linearly with the desired order of error mitigation. Our results show error reduction of several orders of magnitude in physically relevant cases, thus promise accurate eigenvalue estimation even in early fault-tolerant devices with limited number of qubits.},

	abstract = {We give a novel procedure for approximating general single-qubit unitaries from a finite universal gate set by reducing the problem to a novel magnitude approximation problem, achieving an immediate improvement in sequence length by a factor of 7/9. Extending the works arXiv:1612.01011 and arXiv:1612.02689, we show that taking probabilistic mixtures of channels to solve fallback (arXiv:1409.3552) and magnitude approximation problems saves factor of two in approximation costs. In particular, over the Clifford+\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$ gate set we achieve an average non-Clifford gate count of \$0.23{\textbackslash}log\_2(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)+2.13\$ and T-count \$0.56{\textbackslash}log\_2(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)+5.3\$ with mixed fallback approximations for diamond norm accuracy \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$. This paper provides a holistic overview of gate approximation, in addition to these new insights. We give an end-to-end procedure for gate approximation for general gate sets related to some quaternion algebras, providing pedagogical examples using common fault-tolerant gate sets (V, Clifford+T and Clifford+\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$). We also provide detailed numerical results for Clifford+T and Clifford+\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$ gate sets. In an effort to keep the paper self-contained, we include an overview of the relevant algorithms for integer point enumeration and relative norm equation solving. We provide a number of further applications of the magnitude approximation problems, as well as improved algorithms for exact synthesis, in the Appendices.},

	abstract = {Accurate control of quantum systems requires a precise measurement of the parameters that govern the dynamics, including control fields and interactions with the environment. Parameters will drift in time and experiments interleave protocols that perform parameter estimation, with protocols that measure the dynamics of interest. Here we specialize to a system made of qubits where the dynamics correspond to a quantum computation. We propose setting aside some qubits, which we call spectator qubits, to be measured periodically during the computation, to act as probes of the changing experimental and environmental parameters. By using control strategies that minimize the sensitivity of the qubits involved in the computation, we can acquire sufficient information from the spectator qubits to update our estimates of the parameters and improve our control. As a result, we can increase the length of experiments where the dynamics of the data qubits are highly reliable. In particular, we simulate how spectator qubits can keep the error level of operations on data qubits below a 10−4 threshold in two scenarios involving coherent errors: a classical magnetic field gradient dynamically decoupled with sequences of two or four π-pulses, and laser beam instability detected via crosstalk with neighboring atoms in an ion trap.},

	abstract = {"Classical shadows" are estimators of an unknown quantum state, constructed from suitably distributed random measurements on copies of that state [Nature Physics 16, 1050-1057]. Here, we analyze classical shadows obtained using random matchgate circuits, which correspond to fermionic Gaussian unitaries. We prove that the first three moments of the Haar distribution over the continuous group of matchgate circuits are equal to those of the discrete uniform distribution over only the matchgate circuits that are also Clifford unitaries; thus, the latter forms a "matchgate 3-design." This implies that the classical shadows resulting from the two ensembles are functionally equivalent. We show how one can use these matchgate shadows to efficiently estimate inner products between an arbitrary quantum state and fermionic Gaussian states, as well as the expectation values of local fermionic operators and various other quantities, thus surpassing the capabilities of prior work. As a concrete application, this enables us to apply wavefunction constraints that control the fermion sign problem in the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm (QC-AFQMC) [Nature 603, 416-420], without the exponential post-processing cost incurred by the original approach.},

Our construction extends the circuit-to-code construction of Bacon, Flammia, Harrow and Shi [2], revisited recently by Gottesman [16], to include intermediate and multi-qubit measurements. With this correspondence, we reduce the problem of correcting faults in a circuit to the well-studied problem of correcting errors in a stabilizer code. More precisely, a most likely error decoder for the spacetime code can be transformed into a most likely fault decoder for the circuit. We give efficient algorithms to construct the outcome and spacetime codes. We also identify conditions under which these codes are LDPC, and give an algorithm to generate low-weight checks, which can then be combined with effcient LDPC code decoders.},

	abstract = {The requirements for fault-tolerant quantum error correction can be simplified by leveraging structure in the noise of the underlying hardware. In this work, we identify a new type of structured noise motivated by neutral atom qubits, biased erasure errors, which arises when qubit errors are dominated by detectable leakage from only one of the computational states of the qubit. We study the performance of this model using gate-level simulations of the XZZX surface code. Using the predicted erasure fraction and bias of metastable \${\textasciicircum}\{171\}\$Yb qubits, we find a threshold of 8.2\%, which is 1.9 times higher than the threshold for unbiased erasures, and 7.5 times higher than the threshold for depolarizing errors. Surprisingly, the improved threshold is achieved without bias-preserving controlled-not gates, and instead results from the lower noise entropy in this model. We also introduce an XZZX cluster state construction for measurement-based error correction, hybrid-fusion, that is optimized for this noise model. By combining fusion operations and deterministic entangling gates, this construction preserves the intrinsic symmetry of the XZZX code, leading to a higher threshold of 10.3\% and enabling the use of rectangular codes with fewer qubits.},

Prior to fault-tolerant quantum computing, robust error mitigation strategies are necessary to continue this growth. Here, we study physical simulation within the seniority-zero electron pairing subspace, which affords both a computational stepping stone to a fully correlated model, and an opportunity to validate recently introduced ``purification-based'' error-mitigation strategies. We compare the performance of error mitigation based on doubling quantum resources in time (echo verification) or in space (virtual distillation), on up to \$20\$ qubits of a superconducting qubit quantum processor. We observe a reduction of error by one to two orders of magnitude below less sophisticated techniques (e.g. post-selection); the gain from error mitigation is seen to increase with the system size. Employing these error mitigation strategies enables the implementation of the largest variational algorithm for a correlated chemistry system to-date. Extrapolating performance from these results allows us to estimate minimum requirements for a beyond-classical simulation of electronic structure. We find that, despite the impressive gains from purification-based error mitigation, significant hardware improvements will be required for classically intractable variational chemistry simulations.},

Our parameterized ansatz circuits realize the Givens rotation approach to non-interacting fermion evolution, which we variationally optimize to prepare the Hartree-Fock wavefunction. This ubiquitous algorithmic primitive corresponds to a rotation of the orbital basis and is required by many proposals for correlated simulations of molecules and Hubbard models.

Changing the signs of the stabilizer generators allows us to change how the coherent errors interfere, leading to a quantum error correcting code which performs as well as a classical repetition code of equivalent distance against these errors. We demonstrate a factor of 4 improvement of the logical memory in a distance-3 logical qubit implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer.

	abstract = {Scalable realization of quantum computing to attain substantial speedups over classical computing requires fault tolerance. Conventionally, protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) demand excessive space overhead of physical qubits per logical qubit. A more recent protocol to achieve constant-space-overhead FTQC using quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes thus attracts considerable attention but suffers from another drawback: it incurs polynomially long time overhead. To address these problems, we here introduce an alternative approach using a concatenation of multiple small-size quantum codes for the constant-space-overhead FTQC rather than a single large-size quantum LDPC code. We develop techniques for concatenating different quantum Hamming codes with growing sizes. As a result, we construct a low-overhead protocol to achieve constant space overhead and only quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead simultaneously. Our protocol accomplishes FTQC even if a decoder has non-constant runtime, unlike the existing constant-space-overhead protocol. These results establish a foundation for FTQC realizing a large class of quantum speedups within feasibly bounded space overhead yet negligibly short time overhead. This achievement opens a promising avenue for the low-overhead FTQC based on code concatenation.},

The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we explain how two variants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome extraction sequences. We then numerically demonstrate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude, and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.},

This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ⊕L, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a “canonical form” that requires at most O(n2/logn) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

However, fully fault-tolerant quantum error correction is too resource intensive for existing quantum computers. In this context we develop the \$[[k+2,k,2]]\$ quantum error detection code, for implementations on existing trapped-ion computers. Encoding \$k\$ logical qubits into \$k+2\$ physical qubits, this code presents fault-tolerant state initialisation and syndrome measurement circuits that can detect any single-qubit error. It provides a universal set of local and global logical rotations that, notably, have physical support on only two qubits. A high-fidelity -- though non fault-tolerant -- compilation of this universal gate set is possible thanks to the two-qubit physical rotations present in trapped-ion computers with all-to-all connectivity. Given the particular structure of the logical operators, we nickname it the Iceberg code. On the 12-qubit Quantinuum H1-2 hardware we demonstrate the protection of circuits of 8 logical qubits with up to 256 layers, saturate the logical quantum volume of \$2{\textasciicircum}8\$, and show the positive effect of increasing the frequency of syndrome measurements within the circuit.

In this work, we introduce a more general and conceptually simpler circuit decomposition method that allows for synthesis into protocols that probabilistically implement quantum circuits over several universal gate sets including, but not restricted to, the Clifford+\$T\$ gate set. The protocol, which we call Probabilistic Quantum Circuits with Fallback (PQF), implements a walk on a discrete Markov chain in which the target unitary is an absorbing state and in which transitions are induced by multi-qubit unitaries followed by measurements. In contrast to RUS protocols, the presented PQF protocols terminate after a finite number of steps. Specifically, we apply our method to the Clifford+\$T\$, Clifford+\$V\$, and Clifford+\${\textbackslash}pi/12\$ gate sets to achieve decompositions with expected gate counts of \${\textbackslash}log\_b(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)+O({\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)))\$, where \$b\$ is a quantity related to the expansion property of the underlying universal gate set.},

	abstract = {Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) currently stand as the most efficient techniques for implementing functions of block encoded matrices, a central task that lies at the heart of most prominent quantum algorithms. However, current QSP approaches face several challenges, such as the restrictions imposed on the family of achievable polynomials and the difficulty of calculating the required phase angles for specific transformations. In this paper, we present a Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP) approach, employing general SU(2) rotations as our signal processing operators, rather than relying solely on rotations in a single basis. Our approach lifts all practical restrictions on the family of achievable transformations, with the sole remaining condition being that \${\textbar}P{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leq 1\$, a restriction necessary due to the unitary nature of quantum computation. Furthermore, GQSP provides a straightforward recursive formula for determining the rotation angles needed to construct the polynomials in cases where \$P\$ and \$Q\$ are known. In cases where only \$P\$ is known, we provide an efficient optimization algorithm capable of identifying in under a minute of GPU time, a corresponding \$Q\$ for polynomials of degree on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}7\$. We further illustrate GQSP simplifies QSP-based strategies for Hamiltonian simulation, offer an optimal solution to the \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-approximate fractional query problem that requires \$O({\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}delta\} + {\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}large{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}))\$ queries to perform where \$O(1/{\textbackslash}delta)\$ is a proved lower bound, and introduces novel approaches for implementing bosonic operators.

In this work, we quantitatively connect the entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically, we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of \$k\$--regular graph states on \$n\$ qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is increased from \$1\$ to \$n-1\$, there is a sharp transition from an easy regime with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at \$k=3\$, and a transition back to easy and low entanglement at \$k=n-3\$.

	abstract = {Quantum technologies have the potential to solve computationally hard problems that are intractable via classical means. Unfortunately, the unstable nature of quantum information makes it prone to errors. For this reason, quantum error correction is an invaluable tool to make quantum information reliable and enable the ultimate goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes currently stand as the most promising candidates to build error corrected qubits given their two-dimensional architecture, a requirement of only local operations, and high tolerance to quantum noise. Decoding algorithms are an integral component of any error correction scheme, as they are tasked with producing accurate estimates of the errors that affect quantum information, so that it can subsequently be corrected. A critical aspect of decoding algorithms is their speed, since the quantum state will suffer additional errors with the passage of time. This poses a connundrum-like tradeoff, where decoding performance is improved at the expense of complexity and viceversa. In this review, a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art surface code decoding algorithms is provided. The core operation of these methods is described along with existing variants that show promise for improved results. In addition, both the decoding performance, in terms of error correction capability, and decoding complexity, are compared.

	abstract = {Contemporary quantum computers have relatively high levels of noise, making it difficult to use them to perform useful calculations, even with a large number of qubits. Quantum error correction is expected to eventually enable fault-tolerant quantum computation at large scales, but until then it will be necessary to use alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of errors. We propose a near-term friendly strategy to mitigate errors by entangling and measuring \$M\$ copies of a noisy state \${\textbackslash}rho\$. This enables us to estimate expectation values with respect to a state with dramatically reduced error, \${\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}M/ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Tr\}({\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}M)\$, without explicitly preparing it, hence the name "virtual distillation". As \$M\$ increases, this state approaches the closest pure state to \${\textbackslash}rho\$, exponentially quickly. We analyze the effectiveness of virtual distillation and find that it is governed in many regimes by the behavior of this pure state (corresponding to the dominant eigenvector of \${\textbackslash}rho\$). We numerically demonstrate that virtual distillation is capable of suppressing errors by multiple orders of magnitude and explain how this effect is enhanced as the system size grows. Finally, we show that this technique can improve the convergence of randomized quantum algorithms, even in the absence of device noise.},

Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes. In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a \$c{\textasciicircum}3\$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential for game-changing runtime speed-ups for important matrix-arithmetic problems. A prominent toolbox for that is the quantum singular-value transformation (QSVT) formalism in the setting of coherent access to the input matrix via a unitary block encoding and Chebyshev approximations to a target matrix function. Nonetheless, physical implementations for useful end-user applications require large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we present a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Monte Carlo simulation of generic matrix functions tailored to early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. Our algorithms randomize over the Chebyshev polynomials but keep the matrix oracle quantum, and are assisted by a variant of the Hadamard test that removes the need for post-selection. As a result, they feature a similar statistical overhead to the fully-quantum case of standard QSVT and do not incur any degradation in circuit depth. On the contrary, the average circuit depth is significantly smaller. We apply our technique to four specific use cases: partition-function estimation via quantum Markov-chain Monte Carlo and via imaginary-time evolution; end-to-end linear system solvers; and ground-state energy estimation. For these cases, we prove significant advantages of average over maximal depths, including quadratic speed-ups on costly parameters and even the removal of an approximation-error dependence. These translate into equivalent reductions of noise sensitivity, because the detrimental effect of noise scales with the average (and not the maximal) query depth, as we explicitly show for depolarizing noise and coherent errors. All in all, our framework provides a practical pathway towards early fault-tolerant quantum linear-algebra applications.},

However, hardware errors in noisy near-term devices remain a major obstacle for applications. Ideas based on the randomization of Suzuki-Trotter product formulas have been shown to be a powerful approach to reducing the errors of quantum simulation and lowering the gate count. In this paper, we study the performance of non-unitary simulation channels and consider the error structure of channels constructed from a weighted average of unitary circuits. We show that averaging over just a few simulation circuits can significantly reduce the Trotterization error for both single-step short-time and multi-step long-time simulations. We focus our analysis on two approaches for constructing circuit ensembles for averaging: (i) permuting the order of the terms in the Hamiltonian and (ii) applying a set of global symmetry transformations. We compare our analytical error bounds to empirical performance and show that empirical error reduction surpasses our analytical estimates in most cases. Finally, we test our method on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum computer accessed via the Amazon Braket cloud platform, and benchmark the performance of the averaging approach.},

While quantum error correction ultimately promises fault-tolerant operation, the required qubit overhead and error thresholds are daunting, and many codes break down under correlated noise. Recent proposals have suggested a complementary approach based on co-located, auxiliary 'spectator' qubits. These act as in-situ probes of noise, and enable real-time, coherent corrections of the resulting errors on the data qubits. Here, we use an array of cesium spectator qubits to correct correlated phase errors on an array of rubidium data qubits. Crucially, by combining in-sequence readouts, data processing, and feed-forward operations, these correlated errors are suppressed within the execution of the quantum circuit. The protocol is broadly applicable to quantum information platforms, and our approach establishes key tools for scaling neutral-atom quantum processors: mid-circuit readout of atom arrays, real-time processing and feed-forward, and coherent mid-circuit reloading of atomic qubits.},

The major outstanding challenge has been to reduce errors in entangling operations mediated through Rydberg interactions. Here we report the realization of two-qubit entangling gates with 99.5\% fidelity on up to 60 atoms in parallel, surpassing the surface code threshold for error correction. Our method employs fast single-pulse gates based on optimal control, atomic dark states to reduce scattering, and improvements to Rydberg excitation and atom cooling. We benchmark fidelity using several methods based on repeated gate applications, characterize the physical error sources, and outline future improvements. Finally, we generalize our method to design entangling gates involving a higher number of qubits, which we demonstrate by realizing low-error three-qubit gates.

Rydberg arrays have emerged as a prominent platform in this context with impressive system sizes and proposals suggesting how error-correction thresholds could be significantly improved by detecting leakage errors with single-atom resolution, a form of erasure error conversion. However, two-qubit entanglement fidelities in Rydberg atom arrays have lagged behind competitors and this type of erasure conversion is yet to be realized for matter-based qubits in general. Here we demonstrate both erasure conversion and high-fidelity Bell state generation using a Rydberg quantum simulator. We implement erasure conversion via fast imaging of alkaline-earth atoms, which leaves atoms in a metastable state unperturbed and yields additional information independent of the final qubit readout. When excising data with observed erasure errors, we achieve a lower-bound for the Bell state generation fidelity of \$\{{\textbackslash}geq\} 0.9971{\textasciicircum}\{+10\}\_\{-13\}\$, which improves to \$\{{\textbackslash}geq\}0.9985{\textasciicircum}\{+7\}\_\{-12\}\$ when correcting for remaining state preparation errors. We further demonstrate erasure conversion in a quantum simulation experiment for quasi-adiabatic preparation of long-range order across a quantum phase transition, where we explicitly differentiate erasure conversion of preparation and Rydberg decay errors. We unveil the otherwise hidden impact of these errors on the simulation outcome by evaluating correlations between erasures and the final readout as well as between erasures themselves. Our work demonstrates the capability for Rydberg-based entanglement to reach fidelities in the \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 0.999\$ regime, with higher fidelities a question of technical improvements, and shows how erasure conversion can be utilized in NISQ devices.},

We also investigate the large-system limit, the sensitivity of the reconstruction to error, and the case when correlation functions are only known for observables on a fixed sub-region. Numerical demonstrations support the results for finite one-dimensional spin chains (though caution must be taken when extrapolating to infinite-size systems in higher dimensions).

This design takes advantage of the locality of materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding that preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and present a compiler that transforms density functional theory data into quantum circuit instructions -- connecting the physics of the material to the simulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple levels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of the specific target material. We present numerical results for materials spanning a wide structural and technological range. Our results demonstrate a reduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard prior methods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian. For example our results improve resource requirements for Strontium Vanadate (SrVO\$\_3\$) from 864 to 180 qubits for a \$3{\textbackslash}times3{\textbackslash}times3\$ lattice, and the circuit depth of a single Trotter or variational layer from \$7.5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ to depth \$884\$. Although this is still beyond current hardware, our results show that materials simulation may be feasible on quantum computers without necessarily requiring scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers, provided quantum algorithm design incorporates understanding of the materials and applications.},

	abstract = {We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. Our setting is motivated by the practical situation in which one desires to learn a quantum process governed by classical parameters that are out of one's control, e.g., in learning astronomical processes, studying disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a by-product we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a number of copies which depend on the dimension of the quantum register, but not on the dimension of the classical one. We give concrete examples of processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically motivated scenarios like systems subject to Hamiltonians with random perturbations or data-dependent phase-shifts.},

	abstract = {Quantum Entanglement is a fundamentally important resource in Quantum Information Science; however, generating it in practice is plagued by noise and decoherence, limiting its utility. Entanglement distillation and forward error correction are the tools we employ to combat this noise, but designing the best distillation and error correction circuits that function well, especially on today's imperfect hardware, is still challenging. Here, we develop a simulation algorithm for distillation circuits with gate-simulation complexity of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1)\$ steps, providing for drastically faster modeling compared to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(n)\$ Clifford simulators or \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}n)\$ wavefunction simulators over \$n\$ qubits. This new simulator made it possible to not only model but also optimize practically interesting purification circuits. It enabled us to use a simple discrete optimization algorithm to design purification circuits from \$n\$ raw Bell pairs to \$k\$ purified pairs and study the use of these circuits in the teleportation of logical qubits in second-generation quantum repeaters. The resulting purification circuits are the best-known purification circuits for finite-size noisy hardware and can be fine-tuned for specific hardware error models. Furthermore, we design purification circuits that shape the correlations of errors in the purified pairs such that the performance of the error-correcting code used in teleportation or other higher-level protocols is greatly improved. Our approach of optimizing multiple layers of the networking stack, both the low-level entanglement purification, and the forward error correction on top of it, are shown to be indispensable for the design of high-performance second-generation quantum repeaters.},

We show that this leads to an exponential improvement in gate complexity for simulating some classes of diagonally dominant Hamiltonian. Additionally we show that this can reduce the gate-complexity scaling for simulating \$N\$-site Hubbard models for time \$t\$ with arbitrary long-range interactions as well as reduce the cost of quantum chemistry simulations within a similar-sized plane-wave basis to \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(N{\textasciicircum}2t)\$ from \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{11/3\}t)\$.

This paper sets out to rectify this lack: using the recently developed tools of quantum singular value transformation and oblivious amplitude amplification, we provide a quantum algorithm to implement the Petz recovery channel when given the ability to perform the channel that one wishes to reverse. Moreover, we prove that, in some sense, our quantum algorithm's usage of the channel implementation cannot be improved by more than a quadratic factor.

Using this framework we show how to perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction for any stabilizer code with arbitrary distance using exponentially fewer qubits than conventional methods when qubit measurement and reset are relatively slow compared to a round of error correction. We further take advantage of the exponential saving provided by our construction to fault-tolerantly measure multiple stabilizers using a single gadget.

	abstract = {Near-term quantum simulators are mostly based on qubit-based architectures. However, their imperfect nature significantly limits their practical application. The situation is even worse for simulating fermionic systems, which underlie most of material science and chemistry, as one has to adopt fermion-to-qubit encodings which create significant additional resource overhead and trainability issues. Thanks to recent advances in trapping and manipulation of neutral atoms in optical tweezers, digital fermionic quantum simulators are becoming viable. A key question is whether these emerging fermionic simulators can outperform qubit-based simulators for characterizing strongly correlated electronic systems. Here, we perform a comprehensive comparison of resource efficiency between qubit and fermionic simulators for variational ground-state emulation of fermionic systems in both condensed matter systems and quantum chemistry problems. We show that the fermionic simulators indeed outperform their qubit counterparts with respect to resources for quantum evolution (circuit depth), as well as classical optimization (number of required parameters and iterations). In addition, they show less sensitivity to the random initialization of the circuit. The relative advantage of fermionic simulators becomes even more pronounced as interaction becomes stronger, or tunneling is allowed in more than one dimension, as well as for spinful fermions. Importantly, this improvement is scalable, i.e., the performance gap between fermionic and qubit simulators only grows for bigger system sizes.},

The central requirement for fault tolerance is expressed in terms of an error threshold. Whereas the actual threshold depends on many details, a common target is the approximately 1\% error threshold of the well-known surface code2,3. Reaching two-qubit gate fidelities above 99\% has been a long-standing major goal for semiconductor spin qubits. These qubits are promising for scaling, as they can leverage advanced semiconductor technology4. Here we report a spin-based quantum processor in silicon with single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities, all of which are above 99.5\%, extracted from gate-set tomography. The average single-qubit gate fidelities remain above 99\% when including crosstalk and idling errors on the neighbouring qubit. Using this high-fidelity gate set, we execute the demanding task of calculating molecular ground-state energies using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm5. Having surpassed the 99\% barrier for the two-qubit gate fidelity, semiconductor qubits are well positioned on the path to fault tolerance and to possible applications in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

In particular we present a scalable quantum architecture design that employs specialization of the system into memory and computational regions, each individually optimized to match hardware support to the available parallelism. Through careful application and system analysis, we find that our new architecture can yield up to a factor of thirteen savings in area due to specialization. In addition, by providing a memory hierarchy design for quantum computers, we can increase time performance by a factor of eight.

The noise affecting spin qubits has further peculiarities such as the strong bias towards dephasing. In this work we consider state-of-the-art error correction codes that require only nearest-neighbour connectivity and are amenable to fast decoding via minimum-weight perfect matching.

In this work, we propose an alternative algorithm where device-level pulse shapes are variationally optimized for the state preparation rather than using an abstract-level quantum circuit. In doing so, the coherence time required for the state preparation is drastically reduced. We numerically demonstrate this by directly optimizing pulse shapes which accurately model the dissociation of H2 and HeH+, and we compute the ground state energy for LiH with four transmons where we see reductions in state preparation times of roughly three orders of magnitude compared to gate-based strategies.},

We experimentally demonstrate that such complex many-body dynamics can be efficiently studied in a 3D spinor Bose–Hubbard model quantum simulator, consisting of antiferromagnetic spinor Bose–Einstein condensates confined in cubic optical lattices. We find dynamics and scaling effects beyond the scope of existing theories at superfluid–insulator quantum phase transitions, and highlight spin populations as a good observable to probe the quantum critical dynamics. Our data indicate that the scaling exponents are independent of the nature of the quantum phase transitions. We also conduct numerical simulations in lower dimensions using time-dependent Gutzwiller approximations, which qualitatively describe our observations.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most important problems in quantum computation, and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) is an efficient way to simulate a general class of Hamiltonians. However, the QSVT circuit typically involves multiple ancilla qubits and multi-qubit control gates. In order to simulate a certain class of n-qubit random Hamiltonians, we propose a drastically simplified quantum circuit that we refer to as the minimal QSVT circuit, which uses only one ancilla qubit and no multi-qubit controlled gates. We formulate a simple metric called the quantum unitary evolution score (QUES), which is a scalable quantum benchmark and can be verified without any need for classical computation. Under the globally depolarized noise model, we demonstrate that QUES is directly related to the circuit fidelity, and the potential classical hardness of an associated quantum circuit sampling problem. Under the same assumption, theoretical analysis suggests there exists an ‘optimal’ simulation time topt ≈ 4.81, at which even a noisy quantum device may be sufficient to demonstrate the potential classical hardness.},

Many platforms are being developed towards this goal, in particular based on trapped ions2–4, superconducting circuits5–7, neutral atoms8–11 or molecules12,13. All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states11, to implement an iconic many-body problem—the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries—square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.},

Especially, it is difficult to resolve whether the perturbation is small or if the actual result of the simulation is in fact very different from the ideal system we intend to study. Here, we show that in specific systems a measurement of additional correlators can be used to verify the reliability of the quantum simulation. The procedure only requires additional measurements on the quantum simulator itself. We demonstrate the method theoretically in the case of a single spin connected to a bosonic environment.},

	abstract = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is vital for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While most conventional QEM schemes assume discrete gate-based circuits with noise appearing either before or after each gate, the assumptions are inappropriate for describing realistic noise that may have strong gate-dependence and complicated nonlocal effects, and general computing models such as analog quantum simulators. To address these challenges, we first extend the scenario, where each computation process, being either digital or analog, is described by a continuous time evolution. For noise from imperfections of the engineered Hamiltonian or additional noise operators, we show it can be effectively suppressed by a novel stochastic QEM method. Since our method only assumes accurate single qubit controls, it is applicable to all digital quantum computers and various analog simulators. Meanwhile, errors in the mitigation procedure can be suppressed by leveraging the Richardson extrapolation method. As we numerically test our method with various Hamiltonians under energy relaxation and dephasing noise and digital quantum circuits with additional two-qubit crosstalk, we show an improvement of simulation accuracy by two orders. We assess the resource cost of our scheme and conclude the feasibility of accurate quantum computing with NISQ devices.},

            Quantum error correction offers a promising path for performing high fidelity quantum computations. Although fully fault-tolerant executions of algorithms remain unrealized, recent improvements in control electronics and quantum hardware enable increasingly advanced demonstrations of the necessary operations for error correction. Here, we perform quantum error correction on superconducting qubits connected in a heavy-hexagon lattice. We encode a logical qubit with distance three and perform several rounds of fault-tolerant syndrome measurements that allow for the correction of any single fault in the circuitry. Using real-time feedback, we reset syndrome and flag qubits conditionally after each syndrome extraction cycle. We report decoder dependent logical error, with average logical error per syndrome measurement in Z(X)-basis of {\textasciitilde}0.040 ({\textasciitilde}0.088) and {\textasciitilde}0.037 ({\textasciitilde}0.087) for matching and maximum likelihood decoders, respectively, on leakage post-selected data.},

By encoding better quality input states for our distillation procedure, we can reduce the considerable resource cost of producing magic states. We demonstrate an error-suppressed encoding scheme for a two-qubit input magic state, that we call the CZ state, on an array of superconducting qubits. Using a complete set of projective logical Pauli measurements, that are also tolerant to a single circuit error, we propose a circuit that demonstrates a magic state prepared with infidelity \$(1.87 {\textbackslash}pm 0.16) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. Additionally, the yield of our scheme increases with the use of adaptive circuit elements that are conditioned in real time on mid-circuit measurement outcomes. We find our results are consistent with variations of the experiment, including where we use only post-selection in place of adaptive circuits, and where we interrogate our output state using quantum state tomography on the data qubits of the code. Remarkably, the error-suppressed preparation experiment demonstrates a fidelity exceeding that of the preparation of the same unencoded magic-state on any single pair of physical qubits on the same device.},

In this paper we present a reconfigurable analog accelerator for solving systems of linear equations. Commonly perceived downsides of analog computing, such as low precision and accuracy, limited problem sizes, and difficulty in programming are all compensated for using methods we discuss. Based on a prototyped analog accelerator chip we compare the performance and energy consumption of the analog solver against an efficient digital algorithm running on a CPU, and find that the analog accelerator approach may be an order of magnitude faster and provide one third energy savings, depending on the accelerator design. Due to the speed and efficiency of linear algebra algorithms running on digital computers, an analog accelerator that matches digital performance needs a large silicon footprint. Finally, we conclude that problem classes outside of systems of linear equations may hold more promise for analog acceleration.},

	abstract = {Logical gates constitute the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively studied in the literature, explicit constructions and detailed analyses of thresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far been limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for platform-independent logical gate definitions, flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis, and exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource overheads. Central to our framework is the description of logical gates holistically in a way which treats space and time on a similar footing. Focusing on schemes based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, but platform-independent representations of topological logic gates -- called logical blocks -- and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient mapping from an abstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical instructions for both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation (FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate set implemented with FBQC, and verify that their thresholds are consistent with the bulk memory threshold. We find that boundaries, defects, and twists can significantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary conditions potentially halving the resource requirements. Motivated by the favorable logical error rates for boundaryless computation, we introduce a novel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer further resource reductions.},

Here we discuss an efficient tomographic protocol for reconstructing reduced density matrices and entanglement spectra for spin systems. The key step is a parametrization of the reduced density matrix in terms of an entanglement Hamiltonian involving only quasilocal few-body terms. This ansatz is fitted to, and can be independently verified from, a small number of randomized measurements. By analysing data from trapped-ion quantum simulators for quench dynamics of a one-dimensional long-range Ising model, we demonstrate the ability of the protocol to measure the time evolution of the entanglement spectrum, in agreement with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, we develop the protocol as a testbed for predictions of entanglement structure in quantum field theories, which we illustrate for conformal field theory in quench dynamics, as well as the Bisognano–Wichmann theorem for ground states. In theoretical simulations, we demonstrate favourable scaling of sampling efficiency with subsystem size. Although the post-processing might ultimately be exponential, our protocol addresses the bottleneck of exponential sampling complexity in the investigation of entanglement structure in quantum simulation, and brings subsystems of tens of spins into reach for present experiments},

Using the concept of detecting regions, we design time-dynamic QEC circuits directly instead of designing static QEC codes to decompose into circuits. In particular, we improve on the standard circuit constructions for the surface code, presenting new circuits that can embed on a hexagonal grid instead of a square grid, that can use ISWAP gates instead of CNOT or CZ gates, that can exchange qubit data and measure roles, and that move logical patches around the physical qubit grid while executing. All these constructions use no additional entangling gate layers and display essentially the same logical performance, having teraquop footprints within 25\% of the standard surface code circuit. We expect these circuits to be of great interest to quantum hardware engineers, because they achieve essentially the same logical performance as standard surface code circuits while relaxing demands on hardware.},

	abstract = {Magic state distillation is a resource intensive subroutine that consumes noisy input states to produce high-fidelity resource states that are used to perform logical operations in practical quantum-computing architectures. The resource cost of magic state distillation can be reduced by improving the fidelity of the raw input states. To this end, we propose an initialization protocol that offers a quadratic improvement in the error rate of the input magic states in architectures with biased noise. This is achieved by preparing an error-detecting code which detects the dominant errors that occur during state preparation. We obtain this advantage by exploiting the native gate operations of an underlying qubit architecture that experiences biases in its noise profile. We perform simulations to analyze the performance of our protocol with the XZZX surface code. Even at modest physical parameters with a two-qubit gate error rate of 0.7\% and total probability of dominant errors in the gate O(103) larger compared to that of nondominant errors, we find that our preparation scheme delivers magic states with logical error rate O(10−8) after a single round of the standard 15-to-1 distillation protocol, two orders of magnitude lower than using conventional state preparation. Our approach therefore promises considerable savings in overheads with near-term technology.},

In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z\_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.},

With \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}({\textbackslash}lambda / {\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ repetitions of these circuits one can use phase estimation to sample in the molecular eigenbasis, where \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ is the 1-norm of Hamiltonian coefficients and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is the target precision. This is the lowest complexity that has been shown for quantum computations of chemistry within an arbitrary basis. Furthermore, up to logarithmic factors, this matches the scaling of the most efficient prior block encodings that can only work with orthogonal basis functions diagonalizing the Coloumb operator (e.g., the plane wave dual basis). Our key insight is to factorize the Hamiltonian using a method known as tensor hypercontraction (THC) and then to transform the Coulomb operator into an isospectral diagonal form with a non-orthogonal basis defined by the THC factors. We then use qubitization to simulate the non-orthogonal THC Hamiltonian, in a fashion that avoids most complications of the non-orthogonal basis. We also reanalyze and reduce the cost of several of the best prior algorithms for these simulations in order to facilitate a clear comparison to the present work. In addition to having lower asymptotic scaling spacetime volume, compilation of our algorithm for challenging finite-sized molecules such as FeMoCo reveals that our method requires the least fault-tolerant resources of any known approach. By laying out and optimizing the surface code resources required of our approach we show that FeMoCo can be simulated using about four million physical qubits and under four days of runtime, assuming \$1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$s cycle times and physical gate error rates no worse than \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$.},

Thus, it is now a real possibility, and of central importance at this time, to assess the potential impact of quantum computers on real problems of interest. One of the earliest and most compelling applications for quantum computers is Feynman’s idea of simulating quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. Such systems are found across chemistry, physics, and materials science. The particular way in which quantum computing extends classical computing means that one cannot expect arbitrary simulations to be sped up by a quantum computer, thus one must carefully identify areas where quantum advantage may be achieved. In this review, we briefly describe central problems in chemistry and materials science, in areas of electronic structure, quantum statistical mechanics, and quantum dynamics that are of potential interest for solution on a quantum computer. We then take a detailed snapshot of current progress in quantum algorithms for ground-state, dynamics, and thermal-state simulation and analyze their strengths and weaknesses for future developments.},

First, Stim improves the asymptotic complexity of deterministic measurement from quadratic to linear by tracking the \{{\textbackslash}em inverse\} of the circuit's stabilizer tableau. Second, Stim improves the constant factors of the algorithm by using a cache-friendly data layout and 256 bit wide SIMD instructions.

Recent works have succeeded in recovering the Hamiltonian of an isolated quantum system with local interactions from long-ranged correlators of a single eigenstate. Here, we show that such Hamiltonians can be recovered from local observables alone, using computational and measurement resources scaling linearly with the system size. In fact, to recover the Hamiltonian acting on each finite spatial domain, only observables within that domain are required. The observables can be measured in a Gibbs state as well as a single eigenstate; furthermore, they can be measured in a state evolved by the Hamiltonian for a long time, allowing us to recover a large family of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We derive an estimate for the statistical recovery error due to approximation of expectation values using a finite number of samples, which agrees well with numerical simulations.

The first contribution comes from a noncontextual approximation to the Hamiltonian, and is computed classically. The second contribution is obtained by using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique to compute a contextual correction on a quantum processor. In general the VQE computation of the contextual correction uses fewer qubits and measurements than the VQE computation of the original problem. Varying the number of qubits used for the contextual correction adjusts the quality of the approximation. We simulate CS-VQE on tapered Hamiltonians for small molecules, and find that the number of qubits required to reach chemical accuracy can be reduced by more than a factor of two. The number of terms required to compute the contextual correction can be reduced by more than a factor of ten, without the use of other measurement reduction schemes. This indicates that CS-VQE is a promising approach for eigenvalue computations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

We also present a suite of classical simulation algorithms with broader applicability and significantly improved performance over the previous state-of-the-art. A new feature is the capability to simulate circuits composed of Clifford gates and arbitrary diagonal gates, extending the reach of a previous algorithm specialized to the Clifford+T gate set. We implemented the new simulation methods and used them to simulate quantum algorithms with 40-50 qubits and over 60 non-Clifford gates, without resorting to high-performance computers. We report a simulation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in which we process superpositions of \${\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}6\$ stabilizer states and sample from the full n-bit output distribution, improving on previous simulations which used \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ stabilizer states and sampled only from single-qubit marginals.

	abstract = {We study how parallelism can speed up quantum simulation. A parallel quantum algorithm is proposed for simulating the dynamics of a large class of Hamiltonians with good sparse structures, called uniform-structured Hamiltonians, including various Hamiltonians of practical interest like local Hamiltonians and Pauli sums. Given the oracle access to the target sparse Hamiltonian, in both query and gate complexity, the running time of our parallel quantum simulation algorithm measured by the quantum circuit depth has a doubly (poly-)logarithmic dependence \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{polylog\}{\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ on the simulation precision \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$. This presents an exponential improvement over the dependence \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{polylog\}(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ of previous optimal sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm without parallelism. To obtain this result, we introduce a novel notion of parallel quantum walk, based on Childs' quantum walk. The target evolution unitary is approximated by a truncated Taylor series, which is obtained by combining these quantum walks in a parallel way. A lower bound \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}log (1/{\textbackslash}epsilon))\$ is established, showing that the \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-dependence of the gate depth achieved in this work cannot be significantly improved. Our algorithm is applied to simulating three physical models: the Heisenberg model, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and a quantum chemistry model in second quantization. By explicitly calculating the gate complexity for implementing the oracles, we show that on all these models, the total gate depth of our algorithm has a \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{polylog\}{\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ dependence in the parallel setting.},

	abstract = {Standard error correction techniques only provide a quantum memory and need extra gadgets to perform computation. Central to quantum algorithms are small angle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on the work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A, 91, 042315 (2015)] by compressing their circuit. Additionally, we present a method of diluting magic states that reduces costs associated with very small angle rotations. We quantify performance by the expected number of noisy magic states consumed per rotation, and compare with other protocols. For modest size angles, our protocols offer a factor 24 improvement over the best known gate synthesis protocols and a factor 2 over the Duclos-Cianci and Poulin protocol. For very small angle rotations, the dilution protocol dramatically reduces costs, giving several orders magnitude improvement over competitors. There also exists an intermediary regime of small, but not very small, angles where our approach gives a marginal improvement over gate synthesis. We discuss how different performance metrics may alter these conclusions.},

To have any hope of doing so, we must layer contemporary resource reduction techniques with best-in-class error mitigation methods; in particular, we combine the techniques of qubit tapering and the contextual subspace variational quantum eigensolver with several error mitigation strategies comprised of measurement-error mitigation, symmetry verification, zero-noise extrapolation and dual-state purification. We benchmark these strategies across a suite of eight 27-qubit IBM Falcon series quantum processors, taking preparation of the HCl molecule's ground state as our testbed.},

	abstract = {We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure devices that are consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and non-local transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations to ensure robustness against non-uniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in Pikulin {\textbackslash}textit\{et al.\} [arXiv:2103.12217]. This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and non-local transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as determined by large-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred micro-electron-volts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and re-opening of the bulk gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at {\textbackslash}textit\{both\} ends of the devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20-\$60{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$eV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero modes.},

	abstract = {Quantum signal processing (QSP) represents a real scalar polynomial of degree \$d\$ using a product of unitary matrices of size \$2{\textbackslash}times 2\$, parameterized by \$(d+1)\$ real numbers called the phase factors. This innovative representation of polynomials has a wide range of applications in quantum computation. When the polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial series, a natural question is whether the phase factors have a well defined limit as the degree \$d{\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$. While the phase factors are generally not unique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so that the limit is well defined in the \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}1\$ space. This generalization of QSP, called the infinite quantum signal processing, can be used to represent a large class of non-polynomial functions. Our analysis reveals a surprising connection between the regularity of the target function and the decay properties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and efficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}1\$ space. The algorithm uses only double precision arithmetic operations, and provably converges when the \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}1\$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the target function is upper bounded by a constant that is independent of \$d\$. This is also the first numerically stable algorithm for finding phase factors with provable performance guarantees in the limit \$d{\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06431},
	abstract = {Practical quantum computing will require error rates that are well below what is achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction offers a path to algorithmically-relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, where increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low in order for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here, we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across multiple code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, both in terms of logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle (\$2.914{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 0.016{\textbackslash}\%\$ compared to \$3.028{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 0.023{\textbackslash}\%\$). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a \$1.7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ logical error per round floor set by a single high-energy event (\$1.6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ when excluding this event). We are able to accurately model our experiment, and from this model we can extract error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark the first experimental demonstration where quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

We find that, although Nobel laureates were energetic producers from the outset, producing works that garner unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize follow relatively similar patterns as ordinary scientists, being characterized by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations. We also uncovered notable variations along their careers, often associated with the Nobel prize, including shifting coauthorship structure in the prize-winning work, and a significant but temporary dip in the impact of work they produce after winning the Nobel. Together, these results document quantitative patterns governing the careers of scientific elites, offering an empirical basis for a deeper understanding of the hallmarks of exceptional careers in science.},

However, comparatively little attention has been paid to estimating the expectation values of other observables with respect to said ground states, which is important for many industrial applications. In this work we present a novel expectation value estimation (EVE) quantum algorithm which can be applied to estimate the expectation values of arbitrary observables with respect to any of the system's eigenstates. In particular, we consider two variants of EVE: std-EVE, based on standard quantum phase estimation, and QSP-EVE, which utilizes quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques. We provide rigorous error analysis for both both variants and minimize the number of individual phase factors for QSPEVE. These error analyses enable us to produce constant-factor quantum resource estimates for both std-EVE and QSP-EVE across a variety of molecular systems and observables. For the systems considered, we show that QSP-EVE reduces (Toffoli) gate counts by up to three orders of magnitude and reduces qubit width by up to 25\% compared to std-EVE. While estimated resource counts remain far too high for the first generations of fault-tolerant quantum computers, our estimates mark a first of their kind for both the application of expectation value estimation and modern QSP-based techniques.},

            Exploring the potential applications of quantum computers in material design and drug discovery is attracting more and more attention after quantum advantage has been demonstrated using Gaussian boson sampling. However, quantum resource requirements in material and (bio)molecular simulations are far beyond the capacity of near-term quantum devices. In this work, multiscale quantum computing is proposed for quantum simulations of complex systems by integrating multiple computational methods at different scales of resolution. In this framework, most computational methods can be implemented in an efficient way on classical computers, leaving the critical portion of the computation to quantum computers. The simulation scale of quantum computing strongly depends on available quantum resources. As a near-term scheme, we integrate adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithms, second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory and Hartree–Fock theory within the framework of the many-body expansion fragmentation approach. This new algorithm is applied to model systems consisting of hundreds of orbitals with decent accuracy on the classical simulator. This work should encourage further studies on quantum computing for solving practical material and biochemistry problems.},

	abstract = {Building error-corrected quantum computers relies crucially on measuring and modeling noise on candidate devices. In particular, optimal error correction requires knowing the noise that occurs in the device as it executes the circuits required for error correction. As devices increase in size we will become more reliant on efficient models of this noise. However, such models must still retain the information required to optimize the algorithms used for error correction. Here we propose a method of extracting detailed information of the noise in a device running syndrome extraction circuits. We introduce and execute an experiment on a superconducting device using 39 of its qubits in a surface code doing repeated rounds of syndrome extraction, but omitting the mid-circuit measurement and reset. We show how to extract from the 20 data qubits the information needed to build noise models of various sophistication in the form of graphical models. These models give efficient descriptions of noise in large-scale devices and are designed to illuminate the effectiveness of error correction against correlated noise. Our estimates are furthermore precise: we learn a consistent global distribution where all one- and two-qubit error rates are known to a relative error of 0.1\%. By extrapolating our experimentally learned noise models towards lower error rates, we demonstrate that accurate correlated noise models are increasingly important for successfully predicting sub-threshold behavior in quantum error correction experiments.},

	abstract = {Real-world applications of computing can be extremely time-sensitive. It would be valuable if we could accelerate such tasks by performing some of the work ahead of time. Motivated by this, we propose a cost model for quantum algorithms that allows quantum precomputation; i.e., for a polynomial amount of "free" computation before the input to an algorithm is fully specified, and methods for taking advantage of it. We analyze two families of unitaries that are asymptotically more efficient to implement in this cost model than in the standard one. The first example of quantum precomputation, based on density matrix exponentiation, could offer an exponential advantage under certain conditions. The second example uses a variant of gate teleportation to achieve a quadratic advantage when compared with implementing the unitaries directly. These examples hint that quantum precomputation may offer a new arena in which to seek quantum advantage.},

Understanding the limits of classical computing in simulating quantum systems is an important component of addressing this question. We introduce a method to simulate layered quantum circuits consisting of parametrized gates, an architecture behind many variational quantum algorithms suitable for near-term quantum computers. A neural-network parametrization of the many-qubit wavefunction is used, focusing on states relevant for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For the largest circuits simulated, we reach 54 qubits at 4 QAOA layers, approximately implementing 324 RZZ gates and 216 RX gates without requiring large-scale computational resources. For larger systems, our approach can be used to provide accurate QAOA simulations at previously unexplored parameter values and to benchmark the next generation of experiments in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.},

However, large-scale simulation of chemical systems on quantum computers is currently hindered due to a mismatch between the computational resource needs of the program and those available in today's technology. In this paper we argue that significant new optimizations can be discovered by co-designing the application, compiler, and hardware. We show that multiple optimization objectives can be coordinated through the key abstraction layer of Pauli strings, which are the basic building blocks of computational chemistry programs. In particular, we leverage Pauli strings to identify critical program components that can be used to compress program size with minimal loss of accuracy. We also leverage the structure of Pauli string simulation circuits to tailor a novel hardware architecture and compiler, leading to significant execution overhead reduction by up to 99\%. While exploiting the high-level domain knowledge reveals significant optimization opportunities, our hardware/software framework is not tied to a particular program instance and can accommodate the full family of computational chemistry problems with such structure. We believe the co-design lessons of this study can be extended to other domains and hardware technologies to hasten the onset of quantum advantage.},

The theory of quantum fault tolerance can provide an answer in the long term, but in the coming era of `NISQ' machines we must seek to mitigate errors rather than completely remove them. This review surveys the diverse methods that have been proposed for quantum error mitigation, assesses their in-principle efficacy, and then describes the hardware demonstrations achieved to date. We identify the commonalities and limitations among the methods, noting how mitigation methods can be chosen according to the primary type of noise present, including algorithmic errors.

Here we demonstrate the utility of zero-noise extrapolation for practically relevant quantum circuits using up to 26 qubits, circuit depths of 120 and 1,080 CNOT gates. We study the scaling of the method for canonical examples of product states and entangling Clifford circuits of increasing size, and extend it to simulating the quench dynamics of two-dimensional Ising spin lattices with varying couplings. These experiments reveal that the accuracy of physically relevant observables after error mitigation substantially exceeds previously expected values. Furthermore, we show that the efficacy of error mitigation is greatly enhanced by additional error suppression techniques and native gate decomposition that reduce the circuit time. By combining these methods, the accuracy of our quantum simulation surpasses the classical approximations obtained from an established tensor network method. These results establish the potential of a useful quantum advantage using noisy, digital quantum processors.},

However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down.

We devise a robust algorithm for identification of Hamiltonian parameters from measured times series of the expectation values of single-mode canonical coordinates.

	abstract = {We propose a novel computing approach, dubbed “Race Logic”, in which information, instead of being represented as logic levels, as is done in conventional logic, is represented as a timing delay. Under this new information representation, computations can be performed by observing the relative propagation times of signals injected into the circuit (i.e. the outcome of races). Race Logic is especially suited for solving problems related to the traversal of directed acyclic graphs commonly used in dynamic programming algorithms. The main advantage of this novel approach is that information processing (minmax and addition operations) can be very efficiently expressed through the manipulation of the natural delay chaining inherent to digital designs, which then results in superior latency, throughput, and energy efficiency. To verify this hypothesis, we designed several Race Logic implementations of a DNA global sequence alignment engine and compared it to the state-of-the-art conventional systolic array implementation. Our synthesized design shows that synchronous Race Logic is up to 4× faster when both approaches are mapped to a 0.5μm CMOS standard cell technology. At the same time the throughput for sequence matching per circuit area is about 3× higher at 5× lower power density for 20-long-symbol DNA sequences.},

However, physical resource requirements to implement useful error-corrected quantum algorithms are prohibitive in the current era of NISQ devices. As an alternative path to performing universal quantum computation, within the NISQ era limitations, we propose to merge digital single-qubit operations with analog multi-qubit entangling blocks in an approach we call digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC). Along these lines, although the techniques may be extended to any resource, we propose to use unitaries generated by the ubiquitous Ising Hamiltonian for the analog entangling block and we prove its universal character. We construct explicit DAQC protocols for efficient simulations of arbitrary inhomogeneous Ising, two-body, and \$M\$-body spin Hamiltonian dynamics by means of single-qubit gates and a fixed homogeneous Ising Hamiltonian. Additionally, we compare a sequential approach where the interactions are switched on and off (stepwise{\textasciitilde}DAQC) with an always-on multi-qubit interaction interspersed by fast single-qubit pulses (banged DAQC). Finally, we perform numerical tests comparing purely digital schemes with DAQC protocols, showing a remarkably better performance of the latter. The proposed DAQC approach combines the robustness of analog quantum computing with the flexibility of digital methods.},

Specifically, we show that a \$d\$-sparse Hamiltonian \$H\$ acting on \$n\$ qubits can be simulated for time \$t\$ with precision \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ using \$O{\textbackslash}big({\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}tau/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}\{{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}tau/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}{\textbackslash}big)\$ queries and \$O{\textbackslash}big({\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}tau/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}\{{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}tau/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}n{\textbackslash}big)\$ additional 2-qubit gates, where \${\textbackslash}tau = d{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}{\textbar}\{H\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}max\} t\$. Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of "oblivious amplitude amplification" that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the error.},

Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product \${\textbackslash}tau\$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on \${\textbackslash}tau\$.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithmic framework for quantum-inspired classical algorithms on close-to-low-rank matrices, generalizing the series of results started by Tang's breakthrough quantum-inspired algorithm for recommendation systems [STOC'19]. Motivated by quantum linear algebra algorithms and the quantum singular value transformation (SVT) framework of Gily{\textbackslash}'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe [STOC'19], we develop classical algorithms for SVT that run in time independent of input dimension, under suitable quantum-inspired sampling assumptions. Our results give compelling evidence that in the corresponding QRAM data structure input model, quantum SVT does not yield exponential quantum speedups. Since the quantum SVT framework generalizes essentially all known techniques for quantum linear algebra, our results, combined with sampling lemmas from previous work, suffice to generalize all recent results about dequantizing quantum machine learning algorithms. In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis. Our improvements come from identifying the key feature of the quantum-inspired input model that is at the core of all prior quantum-inspired results: \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}2\$-norm sampling can approximate matrix products in time independent of their dimension. We reduce all our main results to this fact, making our exposition concise, self-contained, and intuitive.},

The QSVT framework has garnered substantial recent interest from the quantum algorithms community, as it was demonstrated by [GSLW19] to encapsulate many existing algorithms naturally phrased as an application of a matrix function. First, we posit that the lifting of quantum singular processing (QSP) to QSVT is better viewed not through Jordan's lemma (as was suggested by [GSLW19]) but as an application of the cosine-sine decomposition, which can be thought of as a more explicit and stronger version of Jordan's lemma. Second, we demonstrate that the constructions of bounded polynomial approximations given in [GSLW19], which use a variety of ad hoc approaches drawing from Fourier analysis, Chebyshev series, and Taylor series, can be unified under the framework of truncation of Chebyshev series, and indeed, can in large part be matched via a bounded variant of a standard meta-theorem from [Trefethen, 2013]. We hope this work finds use to the community as a companion guide for understanding and applying the powerful framework of [GSLW19].},

Central to quantum algorithms are small angle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on the work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A, 91, 042315 (2015)] by compressing their circuit. Additionally, we present a method of diluting magic states that reduces costs associated with very small angle rotations. We quantify performance by the expected number of noisy magic states consumed per rotation, and compare with other protocols. For modest size angles, our protocols offer a factor 24 improvement over the best known gate synthesis protocols and a factor 2 over the Duclos-Cianci and Poulin protocol. For very small angle rotations, the dilution protocol dramatically reduces costs, giving several orders magnitude improvement over competitors. There also exists an intermediary regime of small, but not very small, angles where our approach gives a marginal improvement over gate synthesis. We discuss how different performance metrics may alter these conclusions.},

For the \${\textbar}CCZ{\textbackslash}rangle\$ factory we apply the surface code lattice surgery construction techniques described by Fowler et al. to the fault-tolerant Toffoli. The resulting factory has a footprint of \$12d {\textbackslash}times 6d\$ (where \$d\$ is the code distance) and produces one \${\textbar}CCZ{\textbackslash}rangle\$ every \$5.5d\$ surface code cycles. Our \${\textbar}T{\textbackslash}rangle\$ state factory uses the \${\textbar}CCZ{\textbackslash}rangle\$ factory's output and a catalyst \${\textbar}T{\textbackslash}rangle\$ state to exactly transform one \${\textbar}CCZ{\textbackslash}rangle\$ state into two \${\textbar}T{\textbackslash}rangle\$ states. It has a footprint 25\% smaller than the factory of Fowler et al. but outputs \${\textbar}T{\textbackslash}rangle\$ states twice as quickly. We show how to generalize the catalyzed transformation to arbitrary phase angles, and note that the case \${\textbackslash}theta=22.5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ produces a particularly efficient circuit for producing \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}{\textbackslash}rangle\$ states. Compared to using the \$12d {\textbackslash}times 8d {\textbackslash}times 6.5d\$ \${\textbar}T{\textbackslash}rangle\$ factory of Fowler et al., our \${\textbar}CCZ{\textbackslash}rangle\$ factory can quintuple the speed of algorithms that are dominated by the cost of applying Toffoli gates, including Shor's algorithm and the chemistry algorithm of Babbush et al.. Assuming a physical gate error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, our CCZ factory can produce \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ states on average before an error occurs. This is sufficient for classically intractable instantiations of the chemistry algorithm, but for more demanding algorithms such as Shor's algorithm the mean number of states until failure can be increased to \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ by increasing the factory footprint {\textasciitilde}20\%.},

	abstract = {The standard approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation is to store information in a quantum error correction code, such as the surface code, and process information using a strategy that can be summarized as distill-then-synthesize. In the distill step, one performs several rounds of distillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such magic state provides one good T gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the optimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many T gates interleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood for multiqubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth analysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and multiqubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation protocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This is because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the same number of T-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic error suppression. This general class includes all circuits primarily dominated by control-control-Z gates, such as adders and modular exponentiation routines used in Shor's algorithm. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a costly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional results on the multiqubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient algorithm for synthesizing unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling as optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing controlled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly optimal. We observe that the gate-synthesis cost, measured by T-count, is often strictly subadditive. Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also presented.},

Our protocol achieves this by using Bayesian inference in concert with Lieb-Robinson bounds and interactive quantum learning methods to achieve compressed simulations for characterization. Whereas Fisher information analysis shows that current methods which employ short-time evolution are suboptimal, interactive quantum learning allows us to overcome this limitation. We illustrate the efficiency of our bootstrapping protocol by showing numerically that an 8-qubit Ising model simulator can be used to calibrate and control a 50 qubit Ising simulator while using only about 750 kilobits of experimental data.},

	abstract = {Indistinguishability of particles is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics1. For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date—including fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons—this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged2,3. However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions4–8. Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well-developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals9–22, the experimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for decades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors offer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. Whereas efforts on conventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of quasiparticles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly manipulating the many-body wavefunction by means of unitary gates. Building on predictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons9,10, we implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol23 to create and braid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect of using the anyons for quantum computation and use braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides new insights about non-Abelian braiding and, through the future inclusion of error correction to achieve topological protection, could open a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

This allows us to simulate small but numerous terms using QDrift while simulating the larger terms using a high-order Trotter-Suzuki formula. We prove rigorous bounds on the diamond distance between the composite channel and the ideal simulation channel and show under what conditions the cost of implementing the composite channel is asymptotically upper bounded by the methods that comprise it for both probabilistic partitioning of terms and deterministic partitioning. Finally, we discuss strategies for determining partitioning schemes as well as methods for incorporating different simulation methods within the same framework.},

However, most prior work exploring algorithms for block-encoding, time-evolving, and sampling in the eigenbasis of electronic structure Hamiltonians has either focused on modeling finite-sized systems, or has required a large number of plane wave basis functions. In this work, we extend methods for quantum simulation with Bloch orbitals constructed from symmetry-adapted atom-centered orbitals so that one can model periodic {\textbackslash}textit\{ab initio\} Hamiltonians using only a modest number of basis functions. We focus on adapting existing algorithms based on combining qubitization with tensor factorizations of the Coulomb operator. Significant modifications of those algorithms are required to obtain an asymptotic speedup leveraging translational (or, more broadly, Abelian) symmetries. We implement block encodings using known tensor factorizations and a new Bloch orbital form of tensor hypercontraction. Finally, we estimate the resources required to deploy our algorithms to classically challenging model materials relevant to the chemistry of Lithium Nickel Oxide battery cathodes within the surface code.},

	abstract = {It is crucial to reduce the resources required to run quantum algorithms and simulate physical systems on quantum computers due to coherence time limitations. With regards to Hamiltonian simulation, a significant effort has focused on building efficient algorithms using various factorizations and truncations, typically derived from the Hamiltonian alone. We introduce a new paradigm for improving Hamiltonian simulation and reducing the cost of ground state problems based on ideas recently developed for classical chemistry simulations. The key idea is that one can find efficient ways to reduce resources needed by quantum algorithms by making use of two key pieces of information: the Hamiltonian operator and an approximate ground state wavefunction. We refer to our algorithm as the \${\textbackslash}textit\{Self-consistent Quantum Iteratively Sparsified Hamiltonian\}\$ (SQuISH). By performing our scheme iteratively, one can drive SQuISH to create an accurate wavefunction using a truncated, resource-efficient Hamiltonian. Utilizing this truncated Hamiltonian provides an approach to reduce the gate complexity of ground state calculations on quantum hardware. As proof of principle, we implement SQuISH using configuration interaction for small molecules and coupled cluster for larger systems. Through our combination of approaches, we demonstrate how SQuISH performs on a range of systems, the largest of which would require more than 200 qubits to run on quantum hardware. Though our demonstrations are on a series of electronic structure problems, our approach is relatively generic and hence likely to benefit additional applications where the size of the problem Hamiltonian creates a computational bottleneck.},

However, it has been unclear whether they can outperform classical algorithms or not. To reveal their limitations, we must seek a technique to benchmark them on large-scale problems. Here we propose a perturbative approach for efficient benchmarking of variational quantum algorithms. The proposed technique performs perturbative expansion of a circuit consisting of Clifford and Pauli rotation gates, which is enabled by exploiting the classical simulatability of Clifford circuits. Our method can be applied to a wide family of parameterized quantum circuits consisting of Clifford gates and single-qubit rotation gates. The approximate optimal parameter obtained by the method can also serve as an initial guess for further optimizations on a quantum device. As the first application of the method, we perform a benchmark of so-called hardware-efficient-type ansatzes when they are applied to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) of one-dimensional hydrogen chains up to H24, which corresponds to a 48-qubit system using a standard workstation. This is the largest scale benchmark of the VQE to the best of our knowledge and reveals the limitation of hardware-efficient-type ansatzes.},

While quantum error correction ultimately promises fault-tolerant operation, the required qubit overhead and error thresholds are daunting, and many codes break down under correlated noise. Recent proposals have suggested a complementary approach based on co-located, auxiliary 'spectator' qubits. These act as in-situ probes of noise, and enable real-time, coherent corrections of the resulting errors on the data qubits. Here, we use an array of cesium spectator qubits to correct correlated phase errors on an array of rubidium data qubits. Crucially, by combining in-sequence readouts, data processing, and feed-forward operations, these correlated errors are suppressed within the execution of the quantum circuit. The protocol is broadly applicable to quantum information platforms, and our approach establishes key tools for scaling neutral-atom quantum processors: mid-circuit readout of atom arrays, real-time processing and feed-forward, and coherent mid-circuit reloading of atomic qubits.},

Here we demonstrate a quantum processor with dynamic, non-local connectivity, in which entangled qubits are coherently transported in a highly parallel manner across two spatial dimensions, between layers of single- and two-qubit operations. Our approach makes use of neutral atom arrays trapped and transported by optical tweezers; hyperfine states are used for robust quantum information storage, and excitation into Rydberg states is used for entanglement generation3–5. We use this architecture to realize programmable generation of entangled graph states, such as cluster states and a seven-qubit Steane code state6,7. Furthermore, we shuttle entangled ancilla arrays to realize a surface code state with thirteen data and six ancillary qubits8 and a toric code state on a torus with sixteen data and eight ancillary qubits9. Finally, we use this architecture to realize a hybrid analogue–digital evolution2 and use it for measuring entanglement entropy in quantum simulations10–12, experimentally observing non-monotonic entanglement dynamics associated with quantum many-body scars13,14.

This has driven the development of measurement-based schemes for performing logical operations in these codes, known as lattice surgery and code deformation. In parallel, gauge fixing has emerged as a measurement-based method for performing universal gate sets in subsystem stabilizer codes. In this work, we show that lattice surgery and code deformation can be expressed as special cases of gauge fixing, permitting a simple and rigorous test for fault-tolerance together with simple guiding principles for the implementation of these operations.

However, for the systems considered, the MSF constitutes a negligible fraction of the total footprint of the quantum computer, allowing for the use of multiple MSFs to produce magic states in parallel.

In our approach, logic gates operate via logical Pauli measurements that preserve both the protection of the LDPC codes as well as the low overheads in terms of the required number of additional qubits. Compared with surface codes with the same code distance, we estimate order-of-magnitude improvements in the overheads for processing around one hundred logical qubits using this approach.

	abstract = {Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) has dominated headlines in recent years, with the longer-term vision of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation (FTQC) offering significant potential albeit at currently intractable resource costs and quantum error correction (QEC) overheads. For problems of interest, FTQC will require millions of physical qubits with long coherence times, high-fidelity gates, and compact sizes to surpass classical systems. Just as heterogeneous specialization has offered scaling benefits in classical computing, it is likewise gaining interest in FTQC. However, systematic use of heterogeneity in either hardware or software elements of FTQC systems remains a serious challenge due to the vast design space and variable physical constraints. This paper meets the challenge of making heterogeneous FTQC design practical by introducing HetArch, a toolbox for designing heterogeneous quantum systems, and using it to explore heterogeneous design scenarios. Using a hierarchical approach, we successively break quantum algorithms into smaller operations (akin to classical application kernels), thus greatly simplifying the design space and resulting tradeoffs. Specializing to superconducting systems, we then design optimized heterogeneous hardware composed of varied superconducting devices, abstracting physical constraints into design rules that enable devices to be assembled into standard cells optimized for specific operations. Finally, we provide a heterogeneous design space exploration framework which reduces the simulation burden by a factor of 10{\textasciicircum}4 or more and allows us to characterize optimal design points. We use these techniques to design superconducting quantum modules for entanglement distillation, error correction, and code teleportation, reducing error rates by 2.6x, 10.7x, and 3.0x compared to homogeneous systems.},

	abstract = {Trapped ions (TI) are a leading candidate for building Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubits, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. We built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.},

In this work, we use mid-circuit measurement and feed-forward to implement deterministic non-unitary dynamics on Quantinuum's H1 programmable ion-trap quantum computer. Enabled by these capabilities, we demonstrate for the first time a constant-depth procedure for creating a toric code ground state in real-time. In addition to reaching high stabilizer fidelities, we create a non-Abelian defect whose presence is confirmed by transmuting anyons via braiding. This work clears the way towards creating complex topological orders in the lab and exploring deterministic non-unitary dynamics via measurement and feed-forward.},

It consists of classical importance sampling of initial states and a measurement of the Loschmidt echo with a quantum simulator. We use the method as a quantum-inspired classical algorithm and simulate the protocol with matrix product states to analyze the requirements on a quantum simulator. This way, we show that a finite temperature phase transition in the long-range transverse field Ising model can be characterized in trapped ion quantum simulators. We propose a concrete measurement protocol for the Loschmidt echo and discuss the influence of measurement noise, dephasing, as well as state preparation and measurement errors.

However, in most practical situations, this Hamiltonian is not precisely known, and ultimately all there is are data obtained from measurements on the system. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable, data-driven approach to learning families of interacting many-body Hamiltonians from dynamical data, by bringing together techniques from gradient-based optimization from machine learning with efficient quantum state representations in terms of tensor networks. Our approach is highly practical, experimentally friendly, and intrinsically scalable to allow for system sizes of above 100 spins. In particular, we demonstrate on synthetic data that the algorithm works even if one is restricted to one simple initial state, a small number of single-qubit observables, and time evolution up to relatively short times. For the concrete example of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model our algorithm exhibits an error constant in the system size and scaling as the inverse square root of the size of the data set.},

Furthermore, we show that our protocol can characterize the dynamics of systems with algebraically decaying interactions. The implementation of the protocol requires only the preparation of product states and single-qubit measurements.

Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2021, arXiv:2004.07266) recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ needed) of this problem for geometrically local \$N\$-qubit Hamiltonians. In the high-temperature (low \${\textbackslash}beta\$) regime, their algorithm has sample complexity poly\$(N, 1/{\textbackslash}beta,1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$ and can be implemented with polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity. In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ with sample complexity \$S = O({\textbackslash}log N/({\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}varepsilon){\textasciicircum}\{2\})\$ and time complexity linear in the sample size, \$O(S N)\$.

Identifying its quantum counterpart would be appealing to both theoretical and practical quantum applications. A conventional approach to quantum speedups in optimization relies on the quantum acceleration of intermediate steps of classical algorithms, while keeping the overall algorithmic trajectory and solution quality unchanged. We propose Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), which is derived from the path integral of dynamical systems referring to the continuous-time limit of classical gradient descent algorithms, as a truly quantum counterpart of classical gradient methods where the contribution from classically-prohibited trajectories can significantly boost QHD's performance for non-convex optimization. Moreover, QHD is described as a Hamiltonian evolution efficiently simulatable on both digital and analog quantum computers. By embedding the dynamics of QHD into the evolution of the so-called Quantum Ising Machine (including D-Wave and others), we empirically observe that the D-Wave-implemented QHD outperforms a selection of state-of-the-art gradient-based classical solvers and the standard quantum adiabatic algorithm, based on the time-to-solution metric, on non-convex constrained quadratic programming instances up to 75 dimensions. Finally, we propose a "three-phase picture" to explain the behavior of QHD, especially its difference from the quantum adiabatic algorithm.},

	abstract = {In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.},

The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98\% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937\% to 4.15\%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.},

Extracting the full potential of computation and realizing quantum algorithms with a super-polynomial speedup will most likely require major advances in quantum error correction technology. Meanwhile, achieving a computational advantage in the near term may be possible by combining multiple QPUs through circuit knitting techniques, improving the quality of solutions through error suppression and mitigation, and focusing on heuristic versions of quantum algorithms with asymptotic speedups. For this to happen, the performance of quantum computing hardware needs to improve and software needs to seamlessly integrate quantum and classical processors together to form a new architecture that we are calling quantum-centric supercomputing. Long term, we see hardware that exploits qubit connectivity in higher than 2D topologies to realize more efficient quantum error correcting codes, modular architectures for scaling QPUs and parallelizing workloads, and software that evolves to make the intricacies of the technology invisible to the users and realize the goal of ubiquitous, frictionless quantum computing.},

These algorithms interpolate between the classical algorithm \$({\textbackslash}beta=1)\$ and the standard quantum algorithm (\${\textbackslash}beta=0\$) and achieve a tradeoff \$ND= O(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{2\})\$. These algorithms bring quantum speedups for Monte Carlo methods closer to realization, as they can provide speedups with shallower circuits. The first algorithm (Power law AE) uses power law schedules in the framework introduced by Suzuki et al {\textbackslash}cite\{S20\}. The algorithm works for \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}in (0,1]\$ and has provable correctness guarantees when the log-likelihood function satisfies regularity conditions required for the Bernstein Von-Mises theorem. The second algorithm (QoPrime AE) uses the Chinese remainder theorem for combining lower depth estimates to achieve higher accuracy. The algorithm works for discrete \${\textbackslash}beta =q/k\$ where \$k {\textbackslash}geq 2\$ is the number of distinct coprime moduli used by the algorithm and \$1 {\textbackslash}leq q {\textbackslash}leq k-1\$, and has a fully rigorous correctness proof.

For CSS codes that can implement Clifford gates transversally it suffices to provide one additional non-Clifford gate, such as the T-gate, to achieve universality. Common methods to implement fault-tolerant T-gates like magic state distillation generate a significant hardware overhead that will likely prevent their practical usage in the near-term future. Recently methods have been developed to mitigate the effect of noise in shallow quantum circuits that are not protected by error correction. Error mitigation methods require no additional hardware resources but suffer from a bad asymptotic scaling and apply only to a restricted class of quantum algorithms. In this work, we combine both approaches and show how to implement encoded Clifford+T circuits where Clifford gates are protected from noise by error correction while errors introduced by noisy encoded T-gates are mitigated using the quasi-probability method. As a result, Clifford+T circuits with a number of T-gates inversely proportional to the physical noise rate can be implemented on small error-corrected devices without magic state distillation. We argue that such circuits can be out of reach for state-of-the-art classical simulation algorithms.},

We prove that this technique can recover the noiseless state under the assumption of noise not affecting the checks. The method does not incur any encoding overhead and instead chooses the checks based on the input circuit. We provide an algorithm for obtaining such checks for an arbitrary target circuit. Since the method applies to any circuit and input state, it can be easily combined with other error mitigation techniques. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods using extensive numerical simulations on 1850 random input circuits composed of Clifford gates and non-Clifford single-qubit rotations, a class of circuits encompassing most commonly considered variational algorithm circuits.

However, it has been unclear whether they can outperform classical algorithms or not. To reveal their limitations, we must seek a technique to benchmark them on large-scale problems. Here we propose a perturbative approach for efficient benchmarking of variational quantum algorithms. The proposed technique performs perturbative expansion of a circuit consisting of Clifford and Pauli rotation gates, which is enabled by exploiting the classical simulatability of Clifford circuits. Our method can be applied to a wide family of parameterized quantum circuits consisting of Clifford gates and single-qubit rotation gates. The approximate optimal parameter obtained by the method can also serve as an initial guess for further optimizations on a quantum device. As the first application of the method, we perform a benchmark of so-called hardware-efficient-type ansatzes when they are applied to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) of one-dimensional hydrogen chains up to H24, which corresponds to a 48-qubit system using a standard workstation. This is the largest scale benchmark of the VQE to the best of our knowledge and reveals the limitation of hardware-efficient-type ansatzes.},

Quantum process tomography is a standard technique for estimating these errors, but is both time consuming, (when one only wants to learn a few key parameters), and is usually inaccurate without resources like perfect state preparation and measurement, which might not be available. With the goal of efficiently and accurately estimating specific errors using minimal resources, we develop a parameter estimation technique, which can gauge key systematic parameters (specifically, amplitude and off-resonance errors) in a universal single-qubit gate-set with provable robustness and efficiency. In particular, our estimates achieve the optimal efficiency, Heisenberg scaling, and do so without entanglement and entirely within a single-qubit Hilbert space. Our main theorem making this possible is a robust version of the phase estimation procedure of Higgins et al. [B. L. Higgins, New J. Phys. 11, 073023 (2009)].},

We present techniques for derandomising algorithms to decrease randomness resource requirements and improve efficiency. One key object in doing this is a k-design, which is a distribution on the unitary group whose kth moments match those of the unitarily invariant Haar measure. We show that for a natural model of a random quantum circuit, the distribution of random circuits quickly converges to a 2-design. We then present an efficient unitary k-design construction for any k, provided the number of qubits n satisfies k = O(n/log n). In doing this, we provide an efficient construction of a quantum tensor product expander, which is a generalisation of a quantum expander which in turn generalises classical expanders. We then discuss applications of k-designs. We show that they can be used to improve the efficiency of many existing algorithms and protocols and also find new applications to derandomising large deviation bounds. In particular, we show that many large deviation bound results for Haar random unitaries carry over to k-designs for k = poly(n). In the second part of the thesis, we present some learning and testing algorithms for the Clifford group. We find an optimal algorithm for identifying an unknown Clifford operation. We also give an algorithm to test if an unknown operation is close to a Clifford or far from every Clifford.},

	abstract = {A unitary t-design is a set of unitaries that is "evenly distributed" in the sense that the average of any t-th order polynomial over the design equals the average over the entire unitary group. In various fields -- e.g. quantum information theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on matrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices to sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This results in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent unitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford group. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a 4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which the Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for various applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex signal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true 4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor power of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the 4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer code -- a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error correction codes. The action of the Clifford group on this stabilizer code can be decomposed explicitly into previously known irreps of the discrete symplectic group. We give various constructions of exact complex projective 4-designs or approximate 4-designs of arbitrarily high precision from Clifford orbits. Building on results from coding theory, we give strong evidence suggesting that these orbits actually constitute complex projective 5-designs.},

This class of Hamiltonians is very general and is believed to capture fundamental interactions of physics. Our algorithm simulates the time evolution of such a Hamiltonian on \$n\$ qubits for time \$T\$ up to error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ using \${\textbackslash}mathcal O( nT {\textbackslash}mathrm\{polylog\} (nT/{\textbackslash}epsilon))\$ gates with depth \${\textbackslash}mathcal O(T {\textbackslash}mathrm\{polylog\} (nT/{\textbackslash}epsilon))\$. Our algorithm is the first simulation algorithm that achieves gate cost quasilinear in \$nT\$ and polylogarithmic in \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\$. Our algorithm also readily generalizes to time-dependent Hamiltonians and yields an algorithm with similar gate count for any piecewise slowly varying time-dependent bounded local Hamiltonian. We also prove a matching lower bound on the gate count of such a simulation, showing that any quantum algorithm that can simulate a piecewise constant bounded local Hamiltonian in one dimension to constant error requires \${\textbackslash}tilde {\textbackslash}Omega(nT)\$ gates in the worst case. The lower bound holds even if we only require the output state to be correct on local measurements. To our best knowledge, this is the first nontrivial lower bound on the gate complexity of the simulation problem. Our algorithm is based on a decomposition of the time-evolution unitary into a product of small unitaries using Lieb-Robinson bounds. In the appendix, we prove a Lieb-Robinson bound tailored to Hamiltonians with small commutators between local terms, giving zero Lieb-Robinson velocity in the limit of commuting Hamiltonians. This improves the performance of our algorithm when the Hamiltonian is close to commuting.},

	abstract = {In the Schr\{{\textbackslash}"o\}dinger picture, the state of a quantum system evolves in time and the quantum speed limit describes how fast the state of a quantum system evolves from an initial state to a final state. However, in the Heisenberg picture the observable evolves in time instead of the state vector. Therefore, it is natural to ask how fast an observable evolves in time. This can impose a fundamental bound on the evolution time of the expectation value of quantum mechanical observables. We obtain the quantum speed limit time-bound for observable for closed systems, open quantum systems and arbitrary dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss various applications of these bounds. Our results can have several applications ranging from setting the speed limit for operator growth, correlation growth, quantum thermal machines, quantum control and many body physics.},

	abstract = {A critical milestone on the path to useful quantum computers is quantum supremacy - a demonstration of a quantum computation that is prohibitively hard for classical computers. A leading near-term candidate, put forth by the Google/UCSB team, is sampling from the probability distributions of randomly chosen quantum circuits, which we call Random Circuit Sampling (RCS). In this paper we study both the hardness and verification of RCS. While RCS was defined with experimental realization in mind, we show complexity theoretic evidence of hardness that is on par with the strongest theoretical proposals for supremacy. Specifically, we show that RCS satisfies an average-case hardness condition - computing output probabilities of typical quantum circuits is as hard as computing them in the worst-case, and therefore \#P-hard. Our reduction exploits the polynomial structure in the output amplitudes of random quantum circuits, enabled by the Feynman path integral. In addition, it follows from known results that RCS satisfies an anti-concentration property, making it the first supremacy proposal with both average-case hardness and anti-concentration.},

We analyze the mean and variance of the {\textbackslash}Tcount required to use our techniques and provide new lower bounds for the T-count for ancilla free synthesis of small single-qubit axial rotations. We further show that our techniques can use ancillas to beat these lower bounds with high probability.

The second contribution is a quantum circuit for the Toffoli gate which can detect a single σz error occurring with probability p in any one of eight T gates required to produce the Toffoli gate. By postselecting circuits that did not detect an error, the posterior error probability is suppressed to lowest order from 4p (or 7p, without the first contribution) to 28p2 for this enhanced construction.

This leads to a two step process: pre-distillation of multiqubit resource states, followed by implementation of the parity check. These protocols can prepare single-qubit magic states that enable direct injection of single-qubit axial rotations without subsequent gate-synthesis and its associated overhead.

We provide a non-interactive protocol for certifying ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. This certification protocol can be applied to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: For example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can encode universal quantum computation in such ground states. Moreover, our certification protocol is applicable to ground states encodings of IQP circuits demonstration of quantum supremacy. These can be certified efficiently when the error is polynomially bounded.},

This paper provides a holistic overview of gate approximation, in addition to these new insights. We give an end-to-end procedure for gate approximation for general gate sets related to some quaternion algebras, providing pedagogical examples using common fault-tolerant gate sets (V, Clifford+T and Clifford+\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$).

This significantly reduces the space-time cost of distillation, as well as the number of qubits. In extreme cases, it can cost less to distill a magic state than to perform a logical Clifford gate on full-distance logical qubits.},

The space overhead, defined as the ratio between the physical qubits to the number of output magic states, is asymptotically constant, while both the number of input magic states used per output state and the \$T\$-gate depth of the circuit scale linearly in the logarithm of the target error \${\textbackslash}delta\$ (up to \${\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}log 1/{\textbackslash}delta\$). Unlike other distillation protocols, this protocol achieves this performance without concatenation and the input magic states are injected at various steps in the circuit rather than all at the start of the circuit. The protocol can be modified to distill magic states for other gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, with the same asymptotic performance. The protocol relies on the construction of weakly self-dual CSS codes with many logical qubits and large distance, allowing us to implement control-SWAPs on multiple qubits. We call this code the "inner code". The control-SWAPs are then used to measure properties of the magic state and detect errors, using another code that we call the "outer code". Alternatively, we use weakly-self dual CSS codes which implement controlled Hadamards for the inner code, reducing circuit depth. We present several specific small examples of this protocol.},

	abstract = {Randomized benchmarking refers to a collection of protocols that in the past decade have become central methods for characterizing quantum gates. These protocols aim at efficiently estimating the quality of a set of quantum gates in a way that is resistant to state preparation and measurement errors. Over the years many versions have been developed, however a comprehensive theoretical treatment of randomized benchmarking has been missing. In this work, we develop a rigorous framework of randomized benchmarking general enough to encompass virtually all known protocols as well as novel, more flexible extensions. Overcoming previous limitations on error models and gate sets, this framework allows us, for the first time, to formulate realistic conditions under which we can rigorously guarantee that the output of any randomized benchmarking experiment is well described by a linear combination of matrix exponential decays. We complement this with a detailed analysis of the fitting problem associated with randomized benchmarking data. We introduce modern signal processing techniques to randomized benchmarking, prove analytical sample complexity bounds, and numerically evaluate performance and limitations. In order to reduce the resource demands of this fitting problem, we introduce novel, scalable postprocessing techniques to isolate exponential decays, significantly improving the practical feasibility of a large set of randomized benchmarking protocols. These postprocessing techniques overcome shortcomings in efficiency of several previously proposed methods such as character benchmarking and linear-cross entropy benchmarking. Finally, we discuss, in full generality, how and when randomized benchmarking decay rates can be used to infer quality measures like the average fidelity. On the technical side, our work substantially extends the recently developed Fourier-theoretic perspective on randomized benchmarking by making use of the perturbation theory of invariant subspaces, as well as ideas from signal processing.},

Over the past twenty years, the field has matured from a predominantly basic research endeavor to one that increasingly explores the engineering of larger-scale superconducting quantum systems. Here, we review several foundational elements -- qubit design, noise properties, qubit control, and readout techniques -- developed during this period, bridging fundamental concepts in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and contemporary, state-of-the-art applications in gate-model quantum computation.},

	abstract = {Quantum computation and information is one of the most exciting developments in science and technology of the last twenty years. To achieve large scale quantum computers and communication networks it is essential not only to overcome noise in stored quantum information, but also in general faulty quantum operations. Scalable quantum computers require a far-reaching theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation. This comprehensive text, written by leading experts in the field, focuses on quantum error correction and thoroughly covers the theory as well as experimental and practical issues. The book is not limited to a single approach, but reviews many different methods to control quantum errors, including topological codes, dynamical decoupling and decoherence-free subspaces. Basic subjects as well as advanced theory and a survey of topics from cutting-edge research make this book invaluable both as a pedagogical introduction at the graduate level and as a reference for experts in quantum information science.},

	abstract = {In quantum electrodynamics, the matter degrees of freedom are coupled to the radiation field through a local, gauge-invariant interaction density. Due to the linear structure of this coupling, the problem of constructing a complete formal representation of the reduced matter dynamics can be solved exactly if the electromagnetic radiation field is initially in a Gaussian state. This chapter combines field theoretical methods with superoperator and influence functional techniques to derive an exact, relativistic representation for the reduced density matrix of the matter degrees of freedom which completely describes the influence of the electromagnetic radiation field on the matter dynamics. Several applications are treated, such as the suppression of the quantum coherence of charged particles caused by the emission of bremsstrahlung and the decoherence of many-particle states.},

The presentation is based on the idea to consider the state of a relativistic quantum system as a functional on the set of space-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski space. This idea leads to a manifest covariant time-evolution equation, known as Schwinger–Tomonaga equation, and allows a relativistic formulation of the projection postulate of quantum measurement theory. This postulate is used to study a number of applications to local and non-local measurements, to the erasing of local information, and to the restrictions on the measurability of non-local quantities imposed by the causality principle. The relativistic projection postulate further enables the discussion of many important problems from a unified perspective, such as EPR-type experiments, measurements of Bell state operators, exchange measurements, and quantum teleportation.},

For this problem the expansion of the master equation is carried out to all orders in the system-reservoir coupling. As specific cases the damped Jaynes–Cummings model and the spontaneous decay into a photonic band gap are studied. The model is used to exemplify the breakdown of the expansion in the strong coupling regime, and to illustrate the emergence of completely positive master equations which are not in Lindblad form and involve negative decay rates. The chapter also treats the non-Markovian dynamics in quantum Brownian motion and in the spin-boson model, and illustrates the stochastic unravelling of non-Markovian quantum processes.},

In the non-Markovian regime, these master equations involve a retarded memory kernel, i.e. a time-convolution integral taken over the history of the reduced system. The chapter also describes an alternative method of particular relevance in many applications, which is based on a time-local quantum master equation, and which is known as the time-convolutionless projection operator method.

This example illustrates the interplay between incoherent processes and quantum interference effects which leads to the emergence of Lévy-type distributions for the atomic waiting time.

The mathematical description of the collection of sub-ensembles thus created leads to probability distributions on projective Hilbert space. The chapter develops an appropriate mathematical framework which enables the general formulation of such a distribution, and leads to the concepts of stochastic state vectors and stochastic density matrices.

	abstract = {The goal of digital quantum simulation is to approximate the dynamics of a given target Hamiltonian via a sequence of quantum gates, a procedure known as Trotterization. The quality of this approximation can be controlled by the so called Trotter step, that governs the number of required quantum gates per unit simulation time. The stroboscopic dynamics generated by Trotterization is effectively described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we propose Floquet Hamiltonian learning to reconstruct the experimentally realized Floquet Hamiltonian order-by-order in the Trotter step. This procedure is efficient, i.e., it requires a number of measurements that scales polynomially in the system size, and can be readily implemented in state-of-the-art experiments. With numerical examples, we propose several applications of our method in the context of verification of quantum devices: from the characterization of the distinct sources of errors in digital quantum simulators to determining the optimal operating regime of the device. We show that our protocol provides the basis for feedback-loop design and calibration of new types of quantum gates. Furthermore it can be extended to the case of non-unitary dynamics and used to learn Floquet Liouvillians, thereby offering a way of characterizing the dissipative processes present in NISQ quantum devices.},

In a wide class of use cases the precise engineering of a Hamiltonian is required both for the implementation of gate-based quantum information processing as well as for reliable quantum memories. Inferring the experimentally realized Hamiltonian through a scalable number of measurements constitutes the challenging task of Hamiltonian learning. In particular, assessing the quality of the implementation of topological codes is essential for quantum error correction. Here, we introduce a neural-net-based approach to this challenge. We capitalize on a family of exactly solvable models to train our algorithm and generalize to a broad class of experimentally relevant sources of errors. We discuss how our algorithm scales with system size and analyze its resilience toward various noise sources.},

	abstract = {As the size of quantum devices continues to grow, the development of scalable methods to characterise and diagnose noise is becoming an increasingly important problem. Recent methods have shown how to efficiently estimate Hamiltonians in principle, but they are poorly conditioned and can only characterize the system up to a scalar factor, making them difficult to use in practice. In this work we present a Bayesian methodology, called Bayesian Hamiltonian Learning (BHL), that addresses both of these issues by making use of any or all, of the following: well-characterised experimental control of Hamiltonian couplings, the preparation of multiple states, and the availability of any prior information for the Hamiltonian. Importantly, BHL can be used online as an adaptive measurement protocol, updating estimates and their corresponding uncertainties as experimental data become available. In addition, we show that multiple input states and control fields enable BHL to reconstruct Hamiltonians that are neither generic nor spatially local. We demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our method with numerical simulations on up to 100 qubits. These practical results are complemented by several theoretical contributions. We prove that a \$k\$-body Hamiltonian \$H\$ whose correlation matrix has a spectral gap \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ can be estimated to precision \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ with only \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}{\textbackslash}bigl(n{\textasciicircum}\{3k\}/({\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash}Delta){\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}{\textbackslash}bigr)\$ measurements. We use two subroutines that may be of independent interest: First, an algorithm to approximate a steady state of \$H\$ starting from an arbitrary input that converges factorially in the number of samples; and second, an algorithm to estimate the expectation values of \$m\$ Pauli operators with weight \${\textbackslash}le k\$ to precision \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ using only \$O({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} 3{\textasciicircum}k {\textbackslash}log m)\$ measurements, which quadratically improves a recent result by Cotler and Wilczek.},

In this paper, we discuss strategies for surface-code quantum computing on small, intermediate and large scales. They are strategies for space-time trade-offs, going from slow computations using few qubits to fast computations using many qubits. Our schemes are based on surface-code patches, which not only feature a low space cost compared to other surface-code schemes, but are also conceptually simple, simple enough that they can be described as a tile-based game with a small set of rules. Therefore, no knowledge of quantum error correction is necessary to understand the schemes in this paper, but only the concepts of qubits and measurements. As an example, assuming a physical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ and a code cycle time of 1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s, a classically intractable 100-qubit quantum computation with a \$T\$ count of \$10{\textasciicircum}8\$ and a \$T\$ depth of \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ can be executed in 4 hours using 55,000 qubits, in 22 minutes using 120,000 qubits, or in 1 second using 330,000,000 qubits.},

To address this issue, we propose a postselection-based algorithm to efficiently prepare resource states for gate teleportation. Our algorithm achieves fault tolerance, demonstrating the exponential suppression of logical errors with code distance, and it applies to any stabilizer codes. We provide analytical derivations and numerical simulations of the fidelity and success probability of the algorithm. We benchmark the method on surface code and show a factor of 100 to 10,000 reduction in space-time overhead compared to existing methods. Overall, our approach presents a promising path to reducing the resource requirement for quantum algorithms on error-corrected and noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.},

By parametrically oscillating the bus at the qubit-qubit detuning we enable a resonant exchange (XX+YY) interaction. We use this interaction to implement a 183ns two-qubit iSWAP gate between qubits separated in frequency by 854MHz with a measured average fidelity of 0.9823(4) from interleaved randomized benchmarking. This gate may be an enabling technology for surface code circuits and for analog quantum simulation.},

	abstract = {We develop a quantum filter diagonalization method (QFD) that lies somewhere between the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the phase estimation algorithm (PEA) in terms of required quantum circuit resources and conceptual simplicity. QFD uses a set of of time-propagated guess states as a variational basis for approximate diagonalization of a sparse Pauli Hamiltonian. The variational coefficients of the basis functions are determined by the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure by classically solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in the space of time-propagated guess states. The matrix elements of the subspace Hamiltonian and subspace metric matrix are each determined in quantum circuits by a one-ancilla extended swap test, i.e., statistical convergence of a one-ancilla PEA circuit. These matrix elements can be determined by many parallel quantum circuit evaluations, and the final Ritz estimates for the eigenvectors can conceptually be prepared as a linear combination over separate quantum state preparation circuits. The QFD method naturally provides for the computation of ground-state, excited-state, and transition expectation values. We numerically demonstrate the potential of the method by classical simulations of the QFD algorithm for an N=8 octamer of BChl-a chromophores represented by an 8-qubit ab initio exciton model (AIEM) Hamiltonian. Using only a handful of time-displacement points and a coarse, variational Trotter expansion of the time propagation operators, the QFD method recovers an accurate prediction of the absorption spectrum.},

The majority of quantum algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction using \$N\$ Gaussian orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}4)\$ second-quantized terms. We avoid this overhead and extend methods to the condensed phase by utilizing a dual form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential operator, leading to a Hamiltonian representation with \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ second-quantized terms. Using this representation we can implement single Trotter steps of the Hamiltonians with linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the basis allow us to deploy Trotter and Taylor series based simulations with respective circuit depths of \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{7/2\})\$ and \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{8/3\})\$ for fixed charge densities - both are large asymptotic improvements over all prior results. Variational algorithms also require significantly fewer measurements to find the mean energy in this basis, ameliorating a primary challenge of that approach. We conclude with a proposal to simulate the uniform electron gas (jellium) using a low depth variational ansatz realizable on near-term quantum devices. From these results we identify simulations of low density jellium as a promising first setting to explore quantum supremacy in electronic structure.},

Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, which have tens to hundreds of noisy physical qubits, are gradually becoming available, but it is still challenging to achieve useful quantum advantages in meaningful tasks at this moment. On the other hand, the full fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) based on the quantum error correction (QEC) code remains far beyond realization due to its extremely large requirement of high-precision physical qubits. In this study, we propose a quantum computing architecture to close the gap between NISQ and FTQC. Our architecture is based on erroneous arbitrary rotation gates and error-corrected Clifford gates implemented by lattice surgery. We omit the typical distillation protocol to achieve direct analog rotations and small qubit requirements, and minimize the remnant errors of the rotations by a carefully-designed state injection protocol. Our estimation based on numerical simulations shows that, for early-FTQC devices that consist of \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ physical qubits with physical error probability \$p = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$, we can perform roughly \$1.72 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ Clifford operations and \$3.75 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ arbitrary rotations on 64 logical qubits. Such computations cannot be realized by the existing NISQ and FTQC architectures on the same device, as well as classical computers. We hope that our proposal and the corresponding development of quantum algorithms based on it bring new insights on realization of practical quantum computers in future.},

	abstract = {The future development of quantum technologies relies on creating and manipulating quantum systems of increasing complexity, with key applications in computation, simulation and sensing. This poses severe challenges in the efficient control, calibration and validation of quantum states and their dynamics. Although the full simulation of large-scale quantum systems may only be possible on a quantum computer, classical characterization and optimization methods still play an important role. Here, we review different approaches that use classical post-processing techniques, possibly combined with adaptive optimization, to learn quantum systems, their correlation properties, dynamics and interaction with the environment. We discuss theoretical proposals and successful implementations across different multiple-qubit architectures such as spin qubits, trapped ions, photonic and atomic systems, and superconducting circuits. This Review provides a brief background of key concepts recurring across many of these approaches with special emphasis on the Bayesian formalism and neural networks.},

	abstract = {In this paper we provide a framework for combining multiple quantum simulation methods, such as Trotter-Suzuki formulas and QDrift into a single composite channel that builds upon older coalescing ideas for reducing gate counts. The central idea behind our approach is to use a partitioning scheme that allocates a Hamiltonian term to the Trotter or QDrift part of a channel within the simulation. This allows us to simulate small but numerous terms using QDrift while simulating the larger terms using a high-order Trotter-Suzuki formula. We prove rigorous bounds on the diamond distance between the composite channel and the ideal simulation channel and show under what conditions the cost of implementing the composite channel is asymptotically upper bounded by the methods that comprise it for both probabilistic partitioning of terms and deterministic partitioning. Finally, we discuss strategies for determining partitioning schemes as well as methods for incorporating different simulation methods within the same framework.},

	abstract = {The Eastin-Knill theorem states that no quantum error correcting code can have a universal set of transversal gates. For CSS codes that can implement Clifford gates transversally it suffices to provide one additional non-Clifford gate, such as the T-gate, to achieve universality. Common methods to implement fault-tolerant T-gates like magic state distillation generate a significant hardware overhead that will likely prevent their practical usage in the near-term future. Recently methods have been developed to mitigate the effect of noise in shallow quantum circuits that are not protected by error correction. Error mitigation methods require no additional hardware resources but suffer from a bad asymptotic scaling and apply only to a restricted class of quantum algorithms. In this work, we combine both approaches and show how to implement encoded Clifford+T circuits where Clifford gates are protected from noise by error correction while errors introduced by noisy encoded T-gates are mitigated using the quasi-probability method. As a result, Clifford+T circuits with a number of T-gates inversely proportional to the physical noise rate can be implemented on small error-corrected devices without magic state distillation. We argue that such circuits can be out of reach for state-of-the-art classical simulation algorithms.},

	abstract = {Simulating the dynamics of quantum systems is an important application of quantum computers and has seen a variety of implementations on current hardware. We show that by introducing quantum gates implementing unitary transformations generated by the symmetries of the system, one can induce destructive interference between the errors from different steps of the simulation, effectively giving faster quantum simulation by symmetry protection. We derive rigorous bounds on the error of a symmetry-protected simulation algorithm and identify conditions for optimal symmetry protection. In particular, when the symmetry transformations are chosen as powers of a unitary, the error of the algorithm is approximately projected to the so-called quantum Zeno subspaces. We prove a bound on this approximation error, exponentially improving a recent result of Burgarth, Facchi, Gramegna, and Pascazio. We apply the symmetry protection technique to the simulations of the XXZ Heisenberg interactions with local disorder and the Schwinger model in quantum field theory. For both systems, the technique can reduce the simulation error by several orders of magnitude over the unprotected simulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that the technique can also protect simulation against other types of coherent, temporally correlated errors, such as the \$1/f\$ noise commonly found in solid-state experiments.},

We analyze the performance of a large-scale digital simulator, and find that fidelity of around 70\% is realizable for π-pulse infidelities below 10−5 in traps subject to realistic rates of heating and dephasing. This scalability relies on fast gates: entangling gates faster than the trap period.},

The availability of exponential quantum advantage then centers on whether features of the physical problem that enable efficient heuristic quantum state preparation also enable efficient solution by classical heuristics. Through numerical studies of quantum state preparation and empirical complexity analysis (including the error scaling) of classical heuristics, in both ab initio and model Hamiltonian settings, we conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for ground-state quantum chemistry through polynomial speedups, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem.},

The number of measurements is independent of the system size, and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables, and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians.

However, the depth of most algorithms, such as product formulas, scales with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, and can therefore be challenging to implement on near-term, as well as early fault-tolerant quantum devices. An efficient solution is given by the stochastic compilation protocol known as qDrift, which builds random product formulas by sampling from the Hamiltonian according to the coefficients. In this work, we unify the qDrift protocol with importance sampling, allowing us to sample from arbitrary probability distributions, while controlling both the bias, as well as the statistical fluctuations. We show that the simulation cost can be reduced while achieving the same accuracy, by considering the individual simulation cost during the sampling stage. Moreover, we incorporate recent work on composite channel and compute rigorous bounds on the bias and variance, showing how to choose the number of samples, experiments, and time steps for a given target accuracy. These results lead to a more efficient implementation of the qDrift protocol, both with and without the use of composite channels.

	abstract = {In recent decades, the rapid development of quantum technologies has led to a new era of programmable platforms, enabling the realizations of quantum simulation and quantum computation. This dissertation is motivated by recent experimental progress on controlling individual quantum degrees of freedom in systems such as trapped ions and Rydberg atom arrays. By tailoring the interactions in these quantum systems, we study analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, including non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and nontrivial topological physics.

In the first part of the dissertation, we study slow quantum many-body dynamics in trapped-ion systems and Rydberg atom arrays. We first show that either the long-range interactions or an additional symmetry-breaking field can give rise to a confining potential. Such a potential can couple domain wall quasiparticles into mesonic or baryonic bound states. These confined quasiparticles strongly suppress the quantum information dynamics and lead to slow thermalization. In thelimit of strict domain-wall confinement, the full Hilbert space is fragmented into exponentially many disconnected subspaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that thermalization can be halted by quantum engineering a uniformly increasing field in the trapped-ion quantum simulator.

The second part of the dissertation focuses on topologically relevant phenomena in quantum simulators. We first study the effect of experimentally relevant disorder in 2D Rydberg atom arrays. We find that there are three distinct localization regimes due to the presence of nontrivial topological bands. We further study the non-equilibrium dynamics of Abelian anyons in a one-dimensional system. We show that the interplay of anyonic statistics and interactions can give rise to spatially asymmetric quantum dynamics. Finally, we use Nielsen’s geometric approach to quantify circuit complexity in topological models. We find that the circuit complexities of ground states and non-equilibrium steady states both exhibit nonanalytical behavior at topological transition points.},

	abstract = {The manifold of pure quantum states is a complex projective space endowed with the unitary-invariant geometry of Fubini and Study. According to the principles of geometric quantum mechanics, the detailed physical characteristics of a given quantum system can be represented by specific geometrical features that are selected and preferentially identified in this complex manifold. Here we construct a number of examples of such geometrical features as they arise in the state spaces for spin-1/2, spin-1, and spin-3/2 systems, and for pairs of spin-1/2 systems. A study is undertaken on the geometry of entangled states, and a natural measure is assigned to the degree of entanglement of a given state for a general multi-particle system. The properties of this measure are analysed for the entangled states of a pair of spin-1/2 particles. With the specification of a quantum Hamiltonian, the resulting Schrodinger trajectory induces a Killing field, which is quasiergodic on a toroidal subspace of the energy surface. When the dynamical trajectory is lifted orthogonally to Hilbert space, it induces a geometric phase shift on the wave function. The uncertainty of an observable in a given state is the length of the gradient vector of the level surface of the expectation of the observable in that state, a fact that allows us to calculate higher order corrections to the Heisenberg relations. A general mixed state is determined by a probability density function on the state space, for which the associated first moment is the density matrix. The advantage of a general state is in its applicability in various attempts to go beyond the standard quantum theory.},

Approaching this for problems that go beyond testing the performance of a quantum device is an important step, and quantum simulation of many-body quench dynamics is one of the most promising candidates for early practical quantum advantage. We analyse the requirements for quantitatively reliable quantum simulation beyond the capabilities of existing classical methods for analogue quantum simulators with neutral atoms in optical lattices and trapped ions. Considering the primary sources of error in analogue devices and how they propagate after a quench in studies of the Hubbard or long-range transverse field Ising model, we identify the level of error expected in quantities we extract from experiments. We conclude for models that are directly implementable that regimes of practical quantum advantage are attained in current experiments with analogue simulators. We also identify the hardware requirements to reach the same level of accuracy with future fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation. Verification techniques are already available to test the assumptions we make here, and demonstrating these in experiments will be an important next step.},

We give a self-contained summary of the SW method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the SW transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H\_\{eff\} such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the SW transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H\_\{eff\}. We then specialize the SW method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the SW method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n-th order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

We then show that certain very simple spin-lattice models are universal in this very strong sense. Examples include the Heisenberg and XY models on a 2D square lattice (with non-uniform coupling strengths). We go on to fully classify all two-qubit interactions, determining which are universal and which can only simulate more restricted classes of models.

On the other hand 1-local Hamiltonian is in P, and hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere.

We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition in (2 + 1) dimensions13. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation14, experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations.

	abstract = {Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Recent experimental results suggest that continuous-time analog quantum simulation would be advantageous over gate-based digital quantum simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Size Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However, programming such analog quantum simulators is much more challenging due to the lack of a unified interface between hardware and software, and the only few known examples are all hardware-specific. In this paper, we design and implement SimuQ, the first domain-specific language for Hamiltonian simulation that supports pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum simulators. Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users will specify the target Hamiltonian evolution with a Hamiltonian modeling language, and the programmability of analog simulators is specified through a new abstraction called the abstract analog instruction set by hardware providers. Through a solver-based compilation, SimuQ will generate the pulse-level instruction schedule on the target analog simulator for the desired Hamiltonian evolution, which has been demonstrated on pulse-controlled superconducting (Qiskit Pulse) and neutral-atom (QuEra Bloqade) quantum systems, as well as on normal circuit-based digital quantum machines. Moreover, we also demonstrate the advantage of analog compilation over digital compilation on IBM machines, the use of SimuQ for resource estimation for hypothetical machines, and a scalability test of SimuQ's compilation.},

An experimental setup that transduces data from a physical system to a stable quantum memory, and processes that data using a quantum computer, could have significant advantages over conventional experiments in which the physical system is measured and the outcomes are processed using a classical computer. We prove that, in various tasks, quantum machines can learn from exponentially fewer experiments than those required in conventional experiments. The exponential advantage holds in predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics. In some tasks, the quantum processing needed to achieve the exponential advantage can be modest; for example, one can simultaneously learn about many noncommuting observables by processing only two copies of the system. Conducting experiments with up to 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrate that a substantial quantum advantage can be realized using today's relatively noisy quantum processors.

In contrast, under widely accepted complexity theory assumptions, classical algorithms that do not learn from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter. Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct classical description of a many-body quantum state that can be constructed in feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the state. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results in a variety of scenarios, including Rydberg atom systems, 2D random Heisenberg models, symmetry-protected topological phases, and topologically ordered phases.},

	abstract = {Learning a many-body Hamiltonian from its dynamics is a fundamental problem in physics. In this work, we propose the first algorithm to achieve the Heisenberg limit for learning an interacting \$N\$-qubit local Hamiltonian. After a total evolution time of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$, the proposed algorithm can efficiently estimate any parameter in the \$N\$-qubit Hamiltonian to \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-error with high probability. The proposed algorithm is robust against state preparation and measurement error, does not require eigenstates or thermal states, and only uses \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{polylog\}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$ experiments. In contrast, the best previous algorithms, such as recent works using gradient-based optimization or polynomial interpolation, require a total evolution time of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})\$ experiments. Our algorithm uses ideas from quantum simulation to decouple the unknown \$N\$-qubit Hamiltonian \$H\$ into noninteracting patches, and learns \$H\$ using a quantum-enhanced divide-and-conquer approach. We prove a matching lower bound to establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.},

In contrast to analogue quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realizing the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus enabling the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. We focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analogue quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting the symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and additionally, by measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic errors for the energies, thus taking a step towards verifying quantum simulation.},

In particular, ensembles of such randomly distributed, but pure, quantum states underlie our understanding of complexity in quantum circuits1 and black holes2, and have been used for benchmarking quantum devices3,4 in tests of quantum advantage5,6. However, creating random ensembles has necessitated a high degree of spatio-temporal control7–12 placing such studies out of reach for a wide class of quantum systems. Here we solve this problem by predicting and experimentally observing the emergence of random state ensembles naturally under time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, which we use to implement an efficient, widely applicable benchmarking protocol. The observed random ensembles emerge from projective measurements and are intimately linked to universal correlations built up between subsystems of a larger quantum system, offering new insights into quantum thermalization13. Predicated on this discovery, we develop a fidelity estimation scheme, which we demonstrate for a Rydberg quantum simulator with up to 25 atoms using fewer than 104 experimental samples. This method has broad applicability, as we demonstrate for Hamiltonian parameter estimation, target-state generation benchmarking, and comparison of analogue and digital quantum devices. Our work has implications for understanding randomness in quantum dynamics14 and enables applications of this concept in a much wider context4,5,9,10,15–20.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily{\textbackslash}'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Trotter formulas have emerged as a leading approach for simulating quantum dynamics on quantum computers, owing to their ability to exploit locality and commutator structure of the Hamiltonian. However, a major problem facing Trotter formulas is their inability to achieve poly-logarithmic scaling with the error tolerance. We address this problem by providing a well-conditioned extrapolation scheme that takes data from Trotter-Suzuki simulations obtained for specifically chosen Trotter step sizes and estimates the value that would be seen in the limit where the Trotter step size goes to zero. We show this leads, even for the first order Trotter formula, to \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ scaling for phase estimation and \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(t{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ scaling for estimating time-evolved expectation values for simulation time \$t\$ and error tolerance \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$. This is better scaling with the error tolerance than the best known un-extrapolated Trotter formulas. Additionally, we provide a new approach for phase estimation that is unbiased and also provide a new approach for estimating the Trotter error on a quantum computer through extrapolation which yields a new way to independently assess the errors in a Trotter simulation.},

To assess the potential for near-term quantum computers to simulate many-body systems we develop a model-independent formalism to straightforwardly compute bounds on the number of Trotter steps needed to accurately simulate the system's time evolution based on the first-order commutator scaling. We apply this formalism to two closely related many-body models prominent in condensed matter physics, the Hubbard and t-J models. We find that, while a naive comparison of the Trotter depth first seems to favor the Hubbard model, careful consideration of the model parameters and the allowable error for accurate simulation leads to a substantial advantage in favor of the t-J model.

The analysis hinges on proving new norm inequalities, including a quantum analogue of the classical Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, which we derive by giving an improved algorithm for optimizing local Hamiltonians. Overall, our results highlight the potential for ML models to predict the output of complex quantum dynamics much faster than the time needed to run the process itself.},

While native interactions between trapped ion spins are typically pairwise, many quantum algorithms and quantum spin models naturally feature couplings between triplets, quartets or higher orders of spins. Here we formulate and analyze a mechanism that extends the standard M{\textbackslash}o\{\}lmer-S{\textbackslash}o\{\}rensen pairwise entangling gate and generates a controllable and programmable coupling between \$N\$ spins of trapped ions. We show that spin-dependent optical forces applied at twice the motional frequency generate a coordinate-transformation of the collective ion motion in phase-space, rendering displacement forces that are nonlinear in the spin operators. We formulate a simple framework that enables a systematic and faithful construction of high-order spin Hamiltonians and gates, including the effect of multiple modes of motion, and characterize the performance of such operations under realistic conditions.},

Due to a result of Regev and Schiff (ICALP ’08 733), we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order (where is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion Harrow et al (2009 Phys. Rev. Lett.103 150502) or quantum machine learning Rebentrost et al (2014 Phys. Rev. Lett.113 130503) that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of ‘active’ gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.},

Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2021, arXiv:2004.07266) recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ needed) of this problem for geometrically local \$N\$-qubit Hamiltonians. In the high-temperature (low \${\textbackslash}beta\$) regime, their algorithm has sample complexity poly\$(N, 1/{\textbackslash}beta,1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$ and can be implemented with polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity. In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ with sample complexity \$S = O({\textbackslash}log N/({\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}varepsilon){\textasciicircum}\{2\})\$ and time complexity linear in the sample size, \$O(S N)\$. Furthermore, we prove a matching lower bound showing that our algorithm's sample complexity is optimal, and hence our time complexity is also optimal. In the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to learn \$H\$ from a real-time evolution unitary \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-it H\}\$ in a small \$t\$ regime with similar sample and time complexity.},

Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) have been designed for the short-term regime. However, as problems scale, VQE results are generally scrambled by noise on present-day hardware. While error mitigation techniques alleviate these issues to some extent, there is a press-ing need to develop algorithmic approaches with higher robustness to noise. Here, we explore the robustness properties of the recently introduced quantum computed moments (QCM) approach to ground state energy problems, and show through an analytic example how the underlying energy estimate explicitly ﬁlters out incoherent noise. Motivated by this observation, we implement QCM for a model of quantum magnetism on IBM Quantum hardware to examine the noise-ﬁltering ef-fect with increasing circuit depth. We ﬁnd that QCM maintains a remarkably high degree of error robustness where VQE completely fails. On instances of the quantum magnetism model up to 20 qubits for ultra-deep trial state circuits of up to ∼ 500 CNOTs, QCM is still able to extract accurate energy estimates. The observation is bolstered by an extensive set of experimental results. To match this accuracy, VQE would need hardware improvement by some 2 orders of magnitude on error rates.},

Surmounting the limitations of internode gates will require a range of techniques, including improvements in entanglement generation, the use of entanglement distillation, and optimized software and compilers, and it remains unclear how improvements to these components interact to affect overall system performance, what performance from each is required, or even how to quantify the performance of each. In this paper, we employ a `co-design' inspired approach to quantify overall MNQC performance in terms of hardware models of internode links, entanglement distillation, and local architecture. In the case of superconducting MNQCs with microwave-to-optical links, we uncover a tradeoff between entanglement generation and distillation that threatens to degrade performance. We show how to navigate this tradeoff, lay out how compilers should optimize between local and internode gates, and discuss when noisy quantum links have an advantage over purely classical links. Using these results, we introduce a roadmap for the realization of early MNQCs which illustrates potential improvements to the hardware and software of MNQCs and outlines criteria for evaluating the landscape, from progress in entanglement generation and quantum memory to dedicated algorithms such as distributed quantum phase estimation. While we focus on superconducting devices with optical interconnects, our approach is general across MNQC implementations.},

For each SPT phase, our algorithm runs a quantum circuit which emulates RG flow: an arbitrary input ground state wavefunction in the phase is mapped to a unique minimally-entangled reference state, thereby allowing for efficient phase identification. This construction is enabled by viewing a generic input state in the phase as a collection of coherent `errors' applied to the reference state, and engineering a quantum circuit to efficiently detect and correct such errors. Importantly, the error correction threshold is proven to coincide exactly with the phase boundary. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of condensed matter physics, machine learning, and near-term quantum algorithms.},

Taking this correspondence relationship as a bridge, we incorporate Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle into quantum multiparameter estimation by giving a trade-off relation between the measurement inaccuracies for estimating different parameters. For pure quantum states, this trade-off relation is tight, so it can reveal the true quantum limits on individual estimation errors in such cases. We apply our approach to derive the trade-off between attainable errors of estimating the real and imaginary parts of a complex signal encoded in coherent states and obtain the joint measurements attaining the trade-off relation. We also show that our approach can be readily used to derive the trade-off between the errors of jointly estimating the phase shift and phase diffusion without explicitly parametrizing quantum measurements.},

The Holevo Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) provides the most fundamental, simultaneously attainable bound for multiparameter estimation problems. A general closed form for the HCRB is not known given that it requires a complex optimization over multiple variables. In this work, we develop an analytic approach to solving the HCRB for two parameters. Our analysis reveals the role of the HCRB and its interplay with alternative bounds in estimation theory. For more parameters, we generate a lower bound to the HCRB. Our work greatly reduces the complexity of determining the HCRB to solving a set of linear equations that even numerically permits a quadratic speedup over previous state-of-the-art approaches. We apply our results to compare the performance of different probe states in magnetic field sensing and characterize the performance of state tomography on the code space of noisy bosonic error-correcting codes. The sensitivity of state tomography on noisy binomial code states can be improved by tuning two coding parameters that relate to the number of correctable phase and amplitude damping errors.

Optimization is defined relative to a cost function, which in the present study is the Bayesian mean squared error of the estimated phase for a given prior distribution; i.e., we optimize for a finite dynamic range of the interferometer. In analogous variational optimizations of optical atomic clocks, we use the Allan deviation for a given Ramsey interrogation time as the relevant cost function for the long-term instability. Remarkably, even low-depth quantum circuits yield excellent results that closely approach the fundamental quantum limits for optimal Ramsey interferometry and atomic clocks. The quantum metrological schemes identified here are readily applicable to atomic clocks based on optical lattices, tweezer arrays, or trapped ions. While in the present work variationally optimized circuits are found with classical simulations, optimization can also be performed “on” the (physical) quantum sensor, also in regimes not accessible to classical computations and in the presence of imperfections.},

Using entanglement for quantum enhancement will allow us to construct the next generation of sensors that can approach the fundamental limits of precision allowed by quantum physics. However, determining how state-of-the-art sensing platforms may be used to converge to these ultimate limits is an outstanding challenge. Here we merge concepts from the field of quantum information processing with metrology, and successfully implement experimentally a programmable quantum sensor operating close to the fundamental limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics. We achieve this by using low-depth, parametrized quantum circuits implementing optimal input states and measurement operators for a sensing task on a trapped-ion experiment. With 26 ions, we approach the fundamental sensing limit up to a factor of 1.45 ± 0.01, outperforming conventional spin-squeezing with a factor of 1.87 ± 0.03. Our approach reduces the number of averages to reach a given Allan deviation by a factor of 1.59 ± 0.06 compared with traditional methods not using entanglement-enabled protocols. We further perform on-device quantum-classical feedback optimization to ‘self-calibrate’ the programmable quantum sensor with comparable performance. This ability illustrates that this next generation of quantum sensor can be used without previous knowledge of the device or its noise environment.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number of qubits present in the system. We develop a new "Singular value transformation" algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a certain "non-commutative" measurement problem and propose a new method for singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. "Singular value transformation" is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups. We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which often gives optimal bounds.},

Since the original suggestion, concrete proposals have appeared for simulating molecular and materials chemistry through quantum computation, as a potential ``killer application''. Indications of potential exponential quantum advantage in artificial tasks have increased interest in this application, thus, it is critical to understand the basis for potential exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry. Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation. We conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for quantum chemistry, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem.},

Our analysis, based on matrix product density operators, of the transverse-field Ising model with depolarizing noise, reveals both advantages and inherent problems associated with zero-noise extrapolation when simulating non-equilibrium many-body dynamics. On the one hand, interestingly, noise alters systematically the behavior of the Loschmidt echo at the dynamical phase transition times, doubling the number of non-analytic points, and hence inducing an error that, inherently, cannot be mitigated. On the other, zero-noise extrapolation may be employed to recover quantum revivals of the Loschmidt echo, which would be completely missed in the absence of mitigation, and to retrieve faithfully noise-free inter-site correlations. Our results, which are in good agreement with those obtained using quantum simulators, reveal the potential of matrix product density operators for the investigation of the performance of quantum devices with a large number of qubits and deep noisy quantum circuits.},

	abstract = {Structural rearrangements play a central role in the organization and function of complex biomolecular systems. In principle, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations enable us to investigate these thermally activated processes with an atomic level of resolution. In practice, an exponentially large fraction of computational resources must be invested to simulate thermal fluctuations in metastable states. Path sampling methods focus the computational power on sampling the rare transitions between states. One of their outstanding limitations is to efficiently generate paths that visit significantly different regions of the conformational space. To overcome this issue, we introduce a new algorithm for MD simulations that integrates machine learning and quantum computing. First, using functional integral methods, we derive a rigorous low-resolution spatially coarse-grained representation of the system’s dynamics, based on a small set of molecular configurations explored with machine learning. Then, we use a quantum annealer to sample the transition paths of this low-resolution theory. We provide a proof-of-concept application by simulating a benchmark conformational transition with all-atom resolution on the D-Wave quantum computer. By exploiting the unique features of quantum annealing, we generate uncorrelated trajectories at every iteration, thus addressing one of the challenges of path sampling. Once larger quantum machines will be available, the interplay between quantum and classical resources may emerge as a new paradigm of high-performance scientific computing. In this work, we provide a platform to implement this integrated scheme in the field of molecular simulations.},

	abstract = {The so-called welded tree problem provides an example of a black-box problem that can be solved exponentially faster by a quantum walk than by any classical algorithm. Given the name of a special ENTRANCE vertex, a quantum walk can find another distinguished EXIT vertex using polynomially many queries, though without finding any particular path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior. Our no-go result suggests that, for some problems, quantum algorithms must necessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to outperform classical computation.},

To this end, we develop a framework for quantum resource estimation, abstracting the layers of the stack, to estimate resources required across these layers for large-scale quantum applications. Using a tool that implements this framework, we assess three scaled quantum applications and find that hundreds of thousands to millions of physical qubits are needed to achieve practical quantum advantage. We identify three qubit parameters, namely size, speed, and controllability, that are critical at scale to rendering these applications practical.

On the one hand, for generic homogeneous linear ODEs, by proving worst-case lower bounds, we show that quantum algorithms suffer from computational overheads due to two types of ``non-quantumness'': real part gap and non-normality of the coefficient matrix. We then show that ODEs in the absence of both types of ``non-quantumness'' are equivalent to quantum dynamics, and reach the conclusion that quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics work best. We generalize our results to the inhomogeneous case and find that existing generic quantum ODE solvers cannot be substantially improved. To obtain these lower bounds, we propose a general framework for proving lower bounds on quantum algorithms that are amplifiers, meaning that they amplify the difference between a pair of input quantum states. On the other hand, we show how to fast-forward quantum algorithms for solving special classes of ODEs which leads to improved efficiency. More specifically, we obtain quadratic to exponential improvements in terms of the evolution time \$T\$ and the spectral norm of the coefficient matrix for the following classes of ODEs: inhomogeneous ODEs with a negative definite coefficient matrix, inhomogeneous ODEs with a coefficient matrix having an eigenbasis that can be efficiently prepared on a quantum computer and eigenvalues that can be efficiently computed classically, and the spatially discretized inhomogeneous heat equation and advection-diffusion equation.

Its implementation requires efficient quantum simulation algorithms. The Lie-Trotter-Suzuki approximation algorithm, also well known as the Trotterization, is a basic algorithm in quantum dynamic simulation. A multi-product algorithm that is a linear combination of multiple Trotterizations has been proposed to improve the approximation accuracy. Implementing such multi-product Trotterization in quantum computers however remains experimentally challenging and its success probability is limited. Here, we modify the multi-product Trotterization and combine it with the oblivious amplitude amplification to simultaneously reach a high simulation precision and high success probability. We experimentally implement the modified multi-product algorithm in an integrated-photonics programmable quantum simulator in silicon, which allows the initialization, manipulation and measurement of four-qubit states and a sequence of linearly combined controlled-unitary gates, to emulate the dynamics of a coupled electron and nuclear spins system. Theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement, and they both show the modified multi-product algorithm can simulate Hamiltonian dynamics with a higher precision than conventional Trotterizations and a nearly deterministic success probability. We certificate the multi-product algorithm in a small-scale quantum simulator based on linear combinations of operations, and this work promises the practical implementations of quantum dynamics simulations.},

We address the challenge of probing the physics of Majorana fermions while having only access to the original composite spin degrees of freedom. Specifically, we propose to detect the properties of the chiral spin liquid phase using gap spectroscopy and edge quenches in the presence of the Floquet drive. The resulting chiral edge signal, which relates to the thermal Hall effect associated with Majorana fermions, is found to be robust for realistically-prepared states.

	abstract = {Quantum dynamics can be simulated on a quantum computer by exponentiating elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an implementation of Trotter steps has gate complexity depending on the total Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with complexity sublinear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encoding and one based on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suffices to use \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}n{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}+{\textbackslash}frac\{n{\textasciicircum}\{2/3\}\}\{{\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{2/3\}\}{\textbackslash}right)n{\textasciicircum}\{1+o(1)\}\$ gates to simulate uniform electron gas with \$n\$ spin orbitals and \${\textbackslash}eta\$ electrons in second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of values, showing that generic \$n\$-qubit \$2\$-local Hamiltonians with commuting terms require at least \${\textbackslash}Omega(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ gates to evolve with accuracy \${\textbackslash}epsilon={\textbackslash}Omega(1/poly(n))\$ for time \$t={\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}epsilon)\$. Our proof is based on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal unitaries within the Hamming weight-\$2\$ subspace, which may be of independent interest. Our result thus suggests the use of Hamiltonian structural properties as both necessary and sufficient to implement Trotter steps with lower gate complexity.},

We demonstrate how highly optimised schemes originally derived for exactly two operators \$A\_\{1,2\}\$ can be applied to such generic Suzuki-Trotter decompositions, providing a formal proof of correctness as well as numerical evidence of efficiency. A comprehensive review of existing symmetric decomposition schemes up to order \$n{\textbackslash}le4\$ is presented and complemented by a number of novel schemes, including both real and complex coefficients. We derive the theoretically most efficient unitary and non-unitary 4th order decompositions. The list is augmented by several exceptionally efficient schemes of higher order \$n{\textbackslash}le8\$. Furthermore we show how Taylor expansions can be used on classical devices to reach machine precision at a computational effort at which state of the art Trotterization schemes do not surpass a relative precision of{\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$.

Therefore, investigating their design has become key in quantum computing research. Previous works have shown that choosing an effective parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) or ansatz for VQAs is crucial to their overall performance, especially on near-term devices. In this paper, we utilize pulse-level access to quantum machines and our understanding of their two-qubit interactions to optimize the design of two-qubit entanglers in a manner suitable for VQAs. Our analysis results show that pulse-optimized ansatze reduce state preparation times by more than half, maintain expressibility relative to standard PQCs, and are more trainable through local cost function analysis. Our algorithm performance results show that in three cases, our PQC configuration outperforms the base implementation. Our algorithm performance results, executed on IBM Quantum hardware, demonstrate that our pulse-optimized PQC configurations are more capable of solving MaxCut and Chemistry problems compared to a standard configuration.},

	abstract = {The Poisson equation has many applications across the broad areas of science and engineering. Most quantum algorithms for the Poisson solver presented so far either suffer from lack of accuracy and/or are limited to very small sizes of the problem, and thus have no practical usage. Here we present an advanced quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation with high accuracy and dynamically tunable problem size. After converting the Poisson equation to a linear system through the finite difference method, we adopt the HHL algorithm as the basic framework. Particularly, in this work we present an advanced circuit that ensures the accuracy of the solution by implementing non-truncated eigenvalues through eigenvalue amplification, as well as by increasing the accuracy of the controlled rotation angular coefficients, which are the critical factors in the HHL algorithm. Consequently, we are able to drastically reduce the relative error in the solution while achieving higher success probability as the amplification level is increased. We show that our algorithm not only increases the accuracy of the solutions but also composes more practical and scalable circuits by dynamically controlling problem size in NISQ devices. We present both simulated and experimental results and discuss the sources of errors. Finally, we conclude that though overall results on the existing NISQ hardware are dominated by the error in the CNOT gates, this work opens a path to realizing a multidimensional Poisson solver on near-term quantum hardware.},

We then use circuit learning based on gradient descent to work out the intrinsic connection between the control phase transition and the quantum speed limit imposed by unitary dynamics.

We encode both electronic states and candidate molecular geometries as a superposition of many-qubit states, leading to quantum advantage. The histogram formed by outcomes of repeated measurements gives the global minimum of the energy surface. We demonstrate that the circuit depth scales as O (n\_e{\textasciicircum}2 poly(log n\_e)) for the electron number n\_e, which can be reduced to O (n\_e poly(log n\_e)) if extra O (n\_e log n\_e) qubits are available. We corroborate the scheme via numerical simulations. The new efficient scheme will be helpful for achieving scalability of practical quantum chemistry on quantum computers. As a special case of the scheme, a classical system composed only of charged particles is admitted.

Here we show efficient simulations of QCs with a method inspired by density functional theory (DFT), a widely used approach to study many-electron systems. We demonstrate accurate simulations of various QCs with universal gate sets, reaching up to a billion qubits in size, using only laptop calculations. Our simulations can predict marginal single-qubit probabilities (SQPs) with over 90{\textbackslash}\% accuracy, using memory and computational resources linear in qubit number despite the formal exponential cost of SQPs. We achieve these results by adopting a mean-field description of QCs, and formulating optimal single- and two-qubit gate functionals \$-\$ analogs of exchange-correlation functionals in DFT \$-\$ to evolve the SQPs without computing the QC wave function. Our findings pave the way for accurate simulations of large QCs and provide a blueprint to adapt electronic structure methods to QC simulations.},

So far, mostly classical computational efforts have been dedicated to the simulation, prediction or de novo design of biomolecules, in order to improve the understanding of their function or to develop novel therapeutics. At a higher level of complexity, the progress of omics disciplines (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) has prompted researchers to develop informatics means to describe and annotate new biomolecules identified with a resolution down to the single cell, but also with a high-throughput speed. Machine learning approaches have been implemented to both the modelling studies and the handling of biomedical data. Quantum computing (QC) approaches hold the promise to resolve, speed up or refine the analysis of a wide range of these computational problems. Here, we review and comment on recently developed QC algorithms for biocomputing, with a particular focus on multi-scale modelling and genomic analyses. Indeed, differently from other computational approaches such as protein structure prediction, these problems have been shown to be adequately mapped onto quantum architectures, the main limit for their immediate use being the number of qubits and decoherence effects in the available quantum machines. Possible advantages over the classical counterparts are highlighted, along with a description of some hybrid classical/quantum approaches, which could be the closest to be realistically applied in biocomputation.},

	abstract = {We introduce a versatile method for preparing a quantum state whose amplitudes are given by some known function. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require handcrafted reversible arithmetic circuits, or quantum memory loads, to encode the function values. Instead, we use a template quantum eigenvalue transformation circuit to convert a low cost block encoding of the sine function into the desired function. Our method uses only 4 ancilla qubits (3 if the approximating polynomial has definite parity), providing order-of-magnitude qubit count reductions compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using a similar number of Toffoli gates if the function can be well represented by a polynomial or Fourier approximation. Like black-box methods, the complexity of our approach depends on the 'L2-norm filling-fraction' of the function. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method for preparing states commonly used in quantum algorithms, such as Gaussian and Kaiser window states.},

	abstract = {Quantum chemistry calculations constitute an important application of quantum annealing (QA). For practical applications in quantum chemistry, it is essential to estimate the ground-state energy of the Hamiltonian with chemical accuracy. However, there is no known method for guaranteeing the accuracy of the energy estimated via QA. Here, we propose a method for guaranteeing the accuracy of the energy estimated via QA using the Weinstein and Temple bounds. In our scheme, before QA is performed, the energies of the ground state and first excited state must be preestimated with some error bars (corresponding to the possible estimation error) via classical computation with some approximations. We show that, if the expectation value and standard deviation of the energy of the state after QA are lower than certain threshold values (that we can calculate from the preestimation), the ground-state energy estimated by QA is closer to the ground-state energy than the preestimation. As the expectation value and standard deviation of the energy can be experimentally measured via QA, our results pave the way for accurate estimation of the ground-state energy using QA.},

Our study is based on a non-universal quantum computing model known as deterministic quantum computing with one qubit (DQC1).

In this work we exploit the recently proposed digital-analog quantum computation paradigm, in which the versatility of programmable universal quantum computers and the error resilience of quantum simulators are combined to improve platforms for quantum computation. We show that the digital-analog paradigm is suited to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm due to the algorithm's variational resilience against the coherent errors introduced by the scheme. By performing large-scale simulations and providing analytical bounds for its performance in devices with finite single-qubit operation time we observe regimes of single-qubit operation speed in which the considered variational algorithm provides a significant improvement over nonvariational counterparts in the digital-analog scheme.},

Simultaneously measuring sets of Pauli operators allows for fewer measurements and an overall speedup of the measurement process. Using results from coloring random graphs, we give evidence for an upper bound on the expected minimum number of simultaneously measurable parts necessary to partition a set of Pauli operators. By expanding our gate set to allow multiqubit Clifford gates before measurement, we were able to cut down the number of measurements considerably compared to previous approaches. We conjecture that this improvement is, in general, linear with respect to the lengths of the Pauli operators. We conclude by demonstrating the feasibility of this approach by implementing the variational quantum eigensolver on the Aspen-4-4Q-A quantum processor unit. In doing so, we calculate the ground-state energies of H2 using fewer measurements than is possible with single-qubit gates with no statistically significant difference in accuracy.},

The majority of quantum algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction using \$N\$ Gaussian orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}4)\$ second-quantized terms. We avoid this overhead and extend methods to the condensed phase by utilizing a dual form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential operator, leading to a Hamiltonian representation with \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ second-quantized terms. Using this representation we can implement single Trotter steps of the Hamiltonians with linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the basis allow us to deploy Trotter and Taylor series based simulations with respective circuit depths of \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{7/2\})\$ and \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{8/3\})\$ for fixed charge densities - both are large asymptotic improvements over all prior results. Variational algorithms also require significantly fewer measurements to find the mean energy in this basis, ameliorating a primary challenge of that approach. We conclude with a proposal to simulate the uniform electron gas (jellium) using a low depth variational ansatz realizable on near-term quantum devices. From these results we identify simulations of low density jellium as a promising first setting to explore quantum supremacy in electronic structure.},

Although time-dependent phenomena associated with classical, thermally driven phase transitions have been extensively studied in systems ranging from the early Universe to Bose–Einstein condensates2–5, understanding critical real-time dynamics in isolated, non-equilibrium quantum systems remains a challenge6. Here we use a Rydberg atom quantum simulator with programmable interactions to study the quantum critical dynamics associated with several distinct QPTs.

In the present study, instead of considering infinitely long-time scale, we aim to provide a framework to understand the long but finite time behavior, namely the transient dynamics. In the analysis, we focus on the Floquet-Magnus (FM) expansion that gives a formal expression of the effective Hamiltonian on the system. Although in general the full series expansion is not convergent in the thermodynamics limit, we give a clear relationship between the FM expansion and the transient dynamics. More precisely, we rigorously show that a truncated version of the FM expansion accurately describes the exact dynamics for a finite-time scale. Our result reveals a reliable time scale of the validity of the FM expansion, which can be comparable to the experimental time scale. Furthermore, we discuss several dynamical phenomena, such as the effect of small integrability breaking, efficient numerical simulation of periodically driven systems, dynamical localization and thermalization. Especially on thermalization, we discuss generic scenario of the prethermalization phenomenon in periodically driven systems.},

Several theoretical1,2 and experimental3–5 attempts have been made to use quantum computers to solve chemistry problems, with early proof-of-principle realizations done digitally. An appealing alternative to the digital approach is analogue quantum simulation, which does not require a scalable quantum computer and has already been successfully applied to solve condensed matter physics problems6–8. However, not all available or planned setups can be used for quantum chemistry problems, because it is not known how to engineer the required Coulomb interactions between them. Here we present an analogue approach to the simulation of quantum chemistry problems that relies on the careful combination of two technologies: ultracold atoms in optical lattices and cavity quantum electrodynamics. In the proposed simulator, fermionic atoms hopping in an optical potential play the role of electrons, additional optical potentials provide the nuclear attraction, and a single-spin excitation in a Mott insulator mediates the electronic Coulomb repulsion with the help of a cavity mode. We determine the operational conditions of the simulator and test it using a simple molecule. Our work opens up the possibility of efficiently computing the electronic structures of molecules with analogue quantum simulation.},

Our first example is verification of analog quantum simulators as Hamiltonian learning, where the input Hamiltonian as the design goal is compared with the parent Hamiltonian for the quantum states prepared on the device. The second example discusses cross-device verification on the quantum level (i.e., by comparing quantum states prepared on different quantum devices). We focus in particular on protocols using randomized measurements, and we propose establishing a central data repository, where existing experimental devices and platforms can be compared. In our final example, we address verification of the output of a quantum device from a computer science perspective, addressing the question of how a user of a quantum processor can be certain of the correctness of its output, and propose minimal demonstrations on present-day devices.},

	abstract = {Quantum simulations consist in the intentional reproduction of physical or unphysical models into another more controllable quantum system. Beyond establishing communication vessels between unconnected fields, they promise to solve complex problems which may be considered as intractable for classical computers. From a historic perspective, two independent approaches have been pursued, namely, digital and analog quantum simulations. The former usually provide universality and flexibility, while the latter allows for better scalability. Here, we review recent literature merging both paradigms in the context of superconducting circuits, yielding: digital-analog quantum simulations. In this manner, we aim at getting the best of both approaches in the most advanced quantum platform involving superconducting qubits and microwave transmission lines. The discussed merge of quantum simulation concepts, digital and analog, may open the possibility in the near future for outperforming classical computers in relevant problems, enabling the reach of a quantum advantage.},

Here we review the theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the preparation of complex equilibrium states, the study of dynamical processes in these many-body interacting quantum systems, and the use of this platform for optimization and other tasks.

As a next step along the development of this technology, it is now important to discuss ‘practical quantum advantage’, the point at which quantum devices will solve problems of practical interest that are not tractable for traditional supercomputers. Many of the most promising short-term applications of quantum computers fall under the umbrella of quantum simulation: modelling the quantum properties of microscopic particles that are directly relevant to modern materials science, high-energy physics and quantum chemistry. This would impact several important real-world applications, such as developing materials for batteries, industrial catalysis or nitrogen fixing. Much as aerodynamics can be studied either through simulations on a digital computer or in a wind tunnel, quantum simulation can be performed not only on future fault-tolerant digital quantum computers but also already today through special-purpose analogue quantum simulators. Here we overview the state of the art and future perspectives for quantum simulation, arguing that a first practical quantum advantage already exists in the case of specialized applications of analogue devices, and that fully digital devices open a full range of applications but require further development of fault-tolerant hardware. Hybrid digital–analogue devices that exist today already promise substantial flexibility in near-term applications.},

	abstract = {Random circuit sampling has become a popular means for demonstrating the superiority of quantum computers over classical supercomputers. While quantum chips are evolving rapidly, classical sampling algorithms are also getting better and better. The major challenge is to generate bitstrings exhibiting an XEB fidelity above that of the quantum chips. Here we present a classical sampling algorithm for producing the probability distribution of any given random quantum circuit, where the fidelity can be rigorously bounded. Specifically, our algorithm performs rejection sampling after the introduced very recently multi-tensor contraction algorithm. We show that the fidelity can be controlled by partially contracting the dominant paths in the tensor network and by adjusting the number of batches used in the rejection sampling. As a demonstration, we classically produced 1 million samples with the fidelity bounded by 0.2\%, based on the 20-cycle circuit of the Sycamore 53-qubit quantum chip. Though this task was initially estimated to take 10,000 years on the Summit supercomputer, it took about 14.5 days using our algorithm on a relatively small cluster with 32 GPUs (Tesla V100 16GB). Furthermore, we estimate that for the Zuchongzhi 56-qubit 20-cycle circuit one can produce 1M samples with fidelity 0.066\% using the Selene supercomputer with 4480 GPUs (Tesla A100 80GB) in about 4 days.},

Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

Our algorithm solves this with a query complexity \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textbackslash}big(t+{\textbackslash}log(\{1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\}){\textbackslash}big)\$ to both oracles that is optimal with respect to all parameters in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic regime, and also with low overhead, using at most two additional ancilla qubits. This approach to Hamiltonian simulation subsumes important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are \$d\$-sparse or a linear combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space and gate complexity, such as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also motivates useful new instances, such as where \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ is a density matrix. A key technical result is `qubitization', which uses the controlled version of these oracles to embed any \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ in an invariant \${\textbackslash}text\{SU\}(2)\$ subspace. A large class of operator functions of \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ can then be computed with optimal query complexity, of which \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-i{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}t\}\$ is a special case.},

	abstract = {The algorithmic error of digital quantum simulations is usually explored in terms of the spectral norm distance between the actual and ideal evolution operators. In practice, this worst-case error analysis may be unnecessarily pessimistic. To address this, we develop a theory of average-case performance of Hamiltonian simulation with random initial states. We relate the average-case error to the Frobenius norm of the multiplicative error and give upper bounds for the product formula (PF) and truncated Taylor series methods. As applications, we estimate average-case error for digital Hamiltonian simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and \$k\$-local Hamiltonians. In particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with \$n\$ spins, the error is quadratically reduced from \${\textbackslash}mathcal O(n)\$ in the worst case to \${\textbackslash}mathcal O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\})\$ on average for both the PF method and the Taylor series method.

	abstract = {Quantum computation and communication are important branches of quantum information science. However, noise in realistic quantum devices fundamentally limits the utility of these quantum technologies. A conventional approach towards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information processing is to use multi-qubit quantum error correction (QEC), that is, to encode a logical quantum bit (or a logical qubit) redundantly over many physical qubits such that the redundancy can be used to detect errors. The required resource overhead associated with the use of conventional multi-qubit QEC schemes, however, is too high for these schemes to be realized at scale with currently available quantum devices. Recently, bosonic (or continuous-variable) quantum error correction has risen as a promising hardware-efficient alternative to multi-qubit QEC schemes. In this thesis, I provide an overview of bosonic QEC and present my contributions to the field. Specifically, I present the benchmark and optimization results of various single-mode bosonic codes against practically relevant excitation loss errors. I also demonstrate that fault-tolerant bosonic QEC is possible by concatenating a single-mode bosonic code with a multi-qubit error-correcting code. Moreover, I discuss the fundamental aspects of bosonic QEC using the framework of quantum communication theory. In particular, I present improved bounds on important communication-theoretic quantities such as the quantum capacity of bosonic Gaussian channels. Furthermore, I provide explicit bosonic error correction schemes that nearly achieve the fundamental performance limit set by the quantum capacity. I conclude the thesis with discussions on the importance of non-Gaussian resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing.},

This paper addresses the situation when this private belief, rather than a classical probability distribution, is instead a quantum mixed state. In the resulting quantum scoring rule setting, the principal chooses both a scoring function and a measurement function, and the agent responds with their reported density matrix. Several characterizations of quantum scoring rules are presented, which reveal a familiar structure based on convex analysis. Spectral scores, where the measurement function is given by the spectral decomposition of the reported density matrix, have particularly elegant structure and connect to quantum information theory. Turning to property elicitation, eigenvectors of the belief are elicitable, whereas eigenvalues and entropy have maximal elicitation complexity. The paper concludes with a discussion of other quantum information elicitation settings and connections to the literature.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

The most established methods are the Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, for which rigorous bounds on the circuit size depend on the number of terms \$L\$ in the system Hamiltonian and the size of the largest term in the Hamiltonian \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$. Consequently, Trotter-Suzuki is only practical for sparse Hamiltonians. Trotter-Suzuki is a deterministic compiler but it was recently shown that randomised compiling offers lower overheads. Here we present and analyse a randomised compiler for Hamiltonian simulation where gate probabilities are proportional to the strength of a corresponding term in the Hamiltonian. This approach requires a circuit size independent of \$L\$ and \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$, but instead depending on \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ the absolute sum of Hamiltonian strengths (the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ norm). Therefore, it is especially suited to electronic structure Hamiltonians relevant to quantum chemistry. Considering propane, carbon dioxide and ethane, we observe speed-ups compared to standard Trotter-Suzuki of between \$306{\textbackslash}times\$ and \$1591{\textbackslash}times\$ for physically significant simulation times at precision \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$.

While the majority of quantum simulation algorithms are deterministic, a recent surge of ideas has shown that randomization can greatly benefit algorithmic performance. In this work, we introduce a scheme for quantum simulation that unites the advantages of randomized compiling on the one hand and higher-order multi-product formulas, as they are used for example in linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) algorithms or quantum error mitigation, on the other hand. In doing so, we propose a framework of randomized sampling that is expected to be useful for programmable quantum simulators and present two new multi-product formula algorithms tailored to it. Our framework reduces the circuit depth by circumventing the need for oblivious amplitude amplification required by the implementation of multi-product formulas using standard LCU methods, rendering it especially useful for early quantum computers used to estimate the dynamics of quantum systems instead of performing full-fledged quantum phase estimation. Our algorithms achieve a simulation error that shrinks exponentially with the circuit depth. To corroborate their functioning, we prove rigorous performance bounds as well as the concentration of the randomized sampling procedure. We demonstrate the functioning of the approach for several physically meaningful examples of Hamiltonians, including fermionic systems and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which the method provides a favorable scaling in the effort.},

This is particularly relevant for today's noisy intermediate scale quantum devices, where the minimization of the circuit depth is a central optimization task. Here, we introduce an adaptive Trotterization scheme providing a controlled solution of the quantum many-body dynamics of local observables. Our quantum algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-time step Trotterization schemes in a quantum quench and even allows for a controlled asymptotic long-time error, where Trotterized dynamics generically enters challenging regimes. This adaptive method can also be generalized to protect various other kinds of symmetries, which we illustrate by preserving the local Gauss's law in a lattice gauge theory. We discuss the requirements imposed by experimental resources, and point out that our adaptive Trotterization scheme can be of use also in numerical approaches based on Trotterization such as in time-evolving block decimation methods.},

The quantum circuit is composed of an encoder which prepares the optimal sensing state and a decoder which gives an output distribution containing information of the signal. We optimize the full circuit to maximize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Furthermore, this learning algorithm can be run on real hardware scalably by using the "parameter-shift" rule which enables gradient evaluation on noisy quantum circuits, avoiding the exponential cost of quantum system simulation. We demonstrate up to 13.12x SNR improvement over existing fixed protocol (GHZ), and 3.19x Classical Fisher Information (CFI) improvement over the classical limit on 15 qubits using IBM quantum computer.

A full-featured Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) model is used to describe the quantum circuit including its embedded classical computation. This integrated approach eliminates the need to evaluate and store a potentially prohibitive volume of classical data within the quantum program in order to explore multiple solution paths. It enables a new type of quantum algorithm that requires fewer round-trips between an external classical driver program and the execution of the quantum program, significantly reducing computational latency, as much of the classical computation can be performed during the coherence time of quantum program execution. We review practical challenges to implementing this approach along with developments underway to address these challenges.

Our modification does not require additional ancilla qubits. Then, we demonstrate how many operations can be parallelized, leading to a further linear decrease in the parallel depth of the circuit, at the cost of a small constant factor increase in number of qubits required. Thirdly, we modify the term order in the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, significantly reducing the error at given Trotter-Suzuki timestep. A final improvement modifies the Hamiltonian to reduce errors introduced by the non-zero Trotter-Suzuki timestep. All of these techniques are validated using numerical simulation and detailed gate counts are given for realistic molecules.},

	abstract = {Simulating the dynamics of quantum systems is an important application of quantum computers and has seen a variety of implementations on current hardware. We show that by introducing quantum gates implementing unitary transformations generated by the symmetries of the system, one can induce destructive interference between the errors from different steps of the simulation, effectively giving faster quantum simulation by symmetry protection. We derive rigorous bounds on the error of a symmetry-protected simulation algorithm and identify conditions for optimal symmetry protection. In particular, when the symmetry transformations are chosen as powers of a unitary, the error of the algorithm is approximately projected to the so-called quantum Zeno subspaces. We prove a bound on this approximation error, exponentially improving a recent result of Burgarth, Facchi, Gramegna, and Pascazio. We apply the symmetry protection technique to the simulations of the XXZ Heisenberg interactions with local disorder and the Schwinger model in quantum field theory. For both systems, the technique can reduce the simulation error by several orders of magnitude over the unprotected simulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that the technique can also protect simulation against other types of coherent, temporally correlated errors, such as the \$1/f\$ noise commonly found in solid-state experiments.},

              We study the problem of simulating the dynamics of spin systems when the initial state is supported on a subspace of low energy of a Hamiltonian
              H
              . This is a central problem in physics with vast applications in many-body systems and beyond, where the interesting physics takes place in the low-energy sector. We analyze error bounds induced by product formulas that approximate the evolution operator and show that these bounds depend on an effective low-energy norm of
              H
              . We find improvements over the best previous complexities of product formulas that apply to the general case, and these improvements are more significant for long evolution times that scale with the system size and/or small approximation errors. To obtain these improvements, we prove exponentially decaying upper bounds on the leakage to high-energy subspaces due to the product formula. Our results provide a path to a systematic study of Hamiltonian simulation at low energies, which will be required to push quantum simulation closer to reality.},

Perhaps most importantly, when you use this framework, you will be able to focus on others’ introductions, instead of stewing about what you should say about yourself.},

	abstract = {Quantum technology has the potential to revolutionize how we acquire and process experimental data to learn about the physical world. An experimental setup that transduces data from a physical system to a stable quantum memory, and processes that data using a quantum computer, could have significant advantages over conventional experiments in which the physical system is measured and the outcomes are processed using a classical computer. We prove that, in various tasks, quantum machines can learn from exponentially fewer experiments than those required in conventional experiments. The exponential advantage holds in predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics. In some tasks, the quantum processing needed to achieve the exponential advantage can be modest; for example, one can simultaneously learn about many noncommuting observables by processing only two copies of the system. Conducting experiments with up to 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrate that a substantial quantum advantage can be realized using today's relatively noisy quantum processors. Our results highlight how quantum technology can enable powerful new strategies to learn about nature.},

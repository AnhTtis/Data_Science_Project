    Circuit quantum electrodynamics enables the combined use of qubits and oscillator modes. Despite a variety of available gate sets, many hybrid qubit-boson (i.e., qubit-oscillator) operations are realizable only through optimal control theory, which is oftentimes intractable and uninterpretable. We introduce an analytic approach with rigorously proven error bounds for realizing specific classes of operations via two matrix product formulas commonly used in Hamiltonian simulation, the Lie--Trotter--Suzuki and Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff product formulas. We show how this technique can be used to realize a number of operations of interest, including polynomials of annihilation and creation operators, namely $(a)^p (a^\dagger)^q$ for integer $p, q$.  We show examples of this paradigm including obtaining universal control within a subspace of the entire Fock space of an oscillator, state preparation of a fixed photon number in the cavity, simulation of the Jaynes--Cummings Hamiltonian,  and simulation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect.  This work demonstrates how techniques from Hamiltonian simulation can be applied to better control hybrid qubit-boson devices.

    "abstract": "We present a framework for the formal meta-theory of lambda calculi in first-order syntax, with two sorts of names, one to represent both free and bound variables, and the other for constants, and by using Stoughton's multiple substitutions.  On top of the framework we formalize Girard's proof of the Strong Normalization Theorem for both the simply-typed lambda calculus and System T.  As to the latter, we also present a simplification of the original proof.  The whole development has been machine-checked using the Agda system.",

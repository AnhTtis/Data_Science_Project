We start by reviewing the development of machine learning methods for stochastic optimal control problems, also called simply stochastic control (SC) problems. SC is a long-standing topic that studies stochastic dynamic systems that are controlled so as to achieve optimal performance. It has  applications in many areas, including but not limited to engineering, economics, and mathematical finance. Some existing methods have been reviewed in, {\it e.g.}, works by Pham and co-authors \cite{pham2005some,germain2021neuralfinance}. In this section, we shall focus on reviewing methods based on deep learning for solving standard SC problems, or problems with delay and mean-field type SC problems, BSDE-based deep learning algorithms, primal-dual approaches, and PDE-based algorithms. We focus here on the algorithms and we refer to  Appendix~\ref{sec:DLtools} for more some basic introduction to neural networks and deep learning. %

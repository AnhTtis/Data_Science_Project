\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we explore the use of neural networks to predict the linear field of an N-body simulation given its final nonlinear field for a fixed set of cosmological parameters. We see that this inverse problem is ill-defined because of the many-to-one nature of the function between the linear field and the nonlinear field in numerical simulations. However, we show that neural networks are able to do recover a linear field which matches the original linear field for a wide range of scales, including scales affected by the nonlinear physics of gravitational clustering. The final simulation state is also accurately recovered after first being inverse mapped by our model, and then being forward mapped back to the final state. We empirically demonstrate that the model generalizes reasonably well to OOD cosmological parameters. This indicates that despite the ill-defined nature of the inverse-mapping problem, neural networks can still be successfully trained to accurately predict the linear fields at large and medium scales.

\section{Future Work}
In this work, we showed that neural networks are successful in predicting the initial states of the N-body simulation at a wide range of scales, going down to small scales where nonlinear gravitational effects kick in. The inherent one-to-many mapping between the final states and the initial states at smaller scales makes it impossible for N-body simulators to make such predictions. However, inverse neural network models, such as the one presented in this work, can be trained to predict approximate initial states of N-body simulations which are correct for a wide range of scales. These approximate initial states could then be used as initializations by further downstream sampling-based methods (e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Active Learning, etc.) to refine their search for better initial states which are correct at even smaller scales.

Other directions for future work involve training on larger set of cosmological parameters, improving OOD performance, and uncertainty quantification for the initial states.

% However, the ability to correctly make predictions at large scales can prove useful for sampling-based methods. Inverse models, such as the one presented in this work, can be trained to predict approximate initial states of N-body simulations which are correct at large scales. These approximate initial states could then be used as initializations for sampling-based methods that are commonly used.

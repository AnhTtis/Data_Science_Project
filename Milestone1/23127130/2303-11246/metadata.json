    "abstract": "We investigate in this article regular Heyting algebras by means of Esakia duality. In particular, we provide some characterisations of Esakia spaces which are dual to regular Heyting algebras and we show that there are continuum-many varieties of Heyting algebras generated by regular Heyting algebras. We also study several logical applications of these classes of objects and we use them to provide novel topological completeness theorems for inquisitive logic, $\\mathtt{DNA}$-logics and dependence logic.",

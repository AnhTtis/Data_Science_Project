\section{Concluding Remarks}
In this paper, we present learning context-aware classifier as a means to capture and leverage useful contextual information in different samples, improving the performance by dynamically forming specific descriptors for individual latent distributions. 
The feasibility is verified by an oracle case and the model is then required to approximate the oracle during training, so as to adapt to diverse contexts during testing. 
Besides, an entropy-aware distillation loss is proposed to better mine those under-exploited informative hints. In general, our method can be easily applied to generic segmentation models, boosting both small and large ones with favorable improvements without compromising the efficiency, manifesting the potential for being a general yet effective module for semantic segmentation.
% We hope our study can provide new thought for inspiring future research in the community.

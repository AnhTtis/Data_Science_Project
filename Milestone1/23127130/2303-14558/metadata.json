    "abstract": "MASTER OT J004527.52+503213.8 (hereafter MASTER J004527) is a dwarf nova discovered by the MASTER project in 2013. At 18:20 UTC on 24 October 2020, brightening of this object was reported to vsnet-alert (24843 by Denisenko). This was the second report of a superoutburst after its discovery. Photometric observations were made using the 23.5-cm Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope at Okayama University of Science observatory soon after the alert through 4 November 2020. In this work, we present the photometric data from our observation, and the analysis of the light curves of MASTER J004527 during the 2020 outburst. We propose a method to determine the period of superhumps by polynomial fitting, which can be applied to a light curve with many missing data. In addition to our own data, we incorporate other all sky survey data of the outburst to better understand the properties of the superhumps. Based on our observations, we conclude that MASTER J004527 is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova, since no early superhumps occurred.",

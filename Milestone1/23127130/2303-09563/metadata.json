    "abstract": "In this paper, we show that the holographic dark energy density hides in the solutions of Lovelock gravity for black holes. Using the obtained mass and temperature we find density equations. We propose a physical interpretation of the rescaled Lovelock couplings as a topological mass that describes the Lovelock branch. In addition to this, we present new solutions that satisfy the energy conditions according to the Lovelock coupling and the horizon curvatures. This work can be extended to the equation of the state ω_{Λ} of dark energy in third-order Lovelock gravity. We show that the value \"-1\" represents a stable equilibrium of ω_{Λ}.",

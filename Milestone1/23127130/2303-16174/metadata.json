    "abstract": "The previous paper of this series shows that the q-model categories of $\\mathcal{G}$-multipointed $d$-spaces and of $\\mathcal{G}$-flows are Quillen equivalent. In this paper, the same result is established by replacing the reparametrization category $\\mathcal{G}$ by the reparametrization category $\\mathcal{M}$. Unlike the case of $\\mathcal{G}$, the execution paths of a cellular $\\mathcal{M}$-multipointed $d$-space can have stop intervals. The technical tool to overcome this obstacle is the notion of globular naturalization. It is the globular analogue of Raussen's naturalization of a directed path in the geometric realization of a precubical set. The notion of globular naturalization working both for $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$, the proof of the Quillen equivalence we obtain is valid for the two reparametrization categories. Together with the results of the first paper of this series, we then deduce that $\\mathcal{G}$-multipointed $d$-spaces and $\\mathcal{M}$-multipointed $d$-spaces have Quillen equivalent q-model structures. Finally, we prove that the saturation hypothesis can be added without any modification in the main theorems of the paper.",

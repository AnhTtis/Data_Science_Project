    "abstract": "We study Seshadri constants of certain ample vector bundles on projective varieties. Our main motivation is the following question: Under what conditions are the Seshadri constants of ample vector bundles at least 1 at all points of the variety. We exhibit some conditions under which this question has an affirmative answer. We primarily consider ample bundles on projective spaces and Hirzebruch surfaces. We also show that Seshadri constants of ample vector bundles can be arbitrarily small.",

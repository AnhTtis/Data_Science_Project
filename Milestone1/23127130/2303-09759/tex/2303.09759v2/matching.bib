abstract = {Mechanism design has traditionally assumed that the set of participants are fixed and known to the mechanism (the market owner) in advance. However, in practice, the market owner can only directly reach a small number of participants (her neighbours). Hence the owner often needs costly promotions to recruit more participants in order to get desirable outcomes such as social welfare or revenue maximization. In this paper, we propose to incentivize existing participants to invite their neighbours to attract more participants. However, they would not invite each other if they are competitors. We discuss how to utilize the conflict of interest between the participants to incentivize them to invite each other to form larger markets. We will highlight the early solutions and open the floor for discussing the fundamental open questions in the settings of auctions, coalitional games, matching and voting.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effect of an underlying social network over agents in a well-known multi-agent resource allocation problem; the housing market. We first show that, when a housing market takes place over a social network with more than two agents and these agents have an option to avoid forwarding information about it to their followers, there does not exist an exchange mechanism that simultaneously satisfies strategy-proofness, Pareto efficiency, and individual rationality. It is also impossible to find a strategy-proof exchange mechanism that always chooses an outcome in a weakened core. These results highlight the difficulty of taking into account the agents' incentive of information diffusion in the resource allocation. To overcome these negative results, we consider two different ways of restricting the problem; limiting the domain of preferences and the structure of social networks.},

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {This article deals with the allocation of objects where each agent receives a single item. Starting from an initial endowment, the agents can be better off by exchanging their objects. However, not all trades are likely because some participants are unable to communicate. By considering that the agents are embedded in a social network, we propose to study the possible allocations emerging from a sequence of simple swaps between pairs of neighbors in the network. This model raises natural questions regarding ( i ) the reachability of a given full allocation, ( ii ) the ability of an agent to obtain a given object, and ( iii ) the search of Pareto-efficient allocations. We investigate the complexity of these problems by providing, according to the structure of the social network, polynomial and NP-complete cases.},

We present an {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}m){\$}algorithm, based on Gale's Top Trading Cycles Method, for finding a maximum cardinality Pareto optimal matching, where n is the number of agents and m is the total length of the preference lists. By contrast, we show that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality Pareto optimal matching is NP-hard, though approximable within a factor of 2. We then show that there exist Pareto optimal matchings of all sizes between a minimum and maximum cardinality Pareto optimal matching. Finally, we introduce the concept of a signature, which allows us to give a characterization, checkable in linear time, of instances that admit a unique Pareto optimal matching.",

A matching M is Pareto optimal if there exists no other matching M0 such that all agents have a house in M0 not worse than in M and at least one agent has a better house in M0.In a dynamic market where agents and houses can be added or removed at any time, a Pareto optimal matching may lose its optimality. In this paper, we give an O(m) time algorithm to maintain a maximum cardinality and Pareto optimal matching, where m is the total size of all preference lists. Furthermore, we show that a Pareto optimal matching can be transformed to any other Pareto optimal matching through a certain constructed graph in linear time.},

abstract = {This paper studies an auction design problem for a seller to sell a commodity in a social network, where each individual (the seller or a buyer) can only communicate with her neighbors. The challenge to the seller is to design a mechanism to incentivize the buyers, who are aware of the auction, to further propagate the information to their neighbors so that more buyers will participate in the auction and hence, the seller will be able to make a higher revenue. We propose a novel auction mechanism, called information diffusion mechanism (IDM), which incentivizes the buyers to not only truthfully report their valuations on the commodity to the seller, but also further propagate the auction information to all their neighbors. In comparison, the direct extension of the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in social networks can also incentivize the information diffusion, but it will decrease the seller's revenue or even lead to a deficit sometimes. The formalization of the problem has not yet been addressed in the literature of mechanism design and our solution is very significant in the presence of large-scale online social networks.},

abstract = {We study a cooperative game setting where players form a network and each player only knows the existence of the players to whom she connects. Initially, only a subset of the players are in the game. Our goal is to design a reward distribution mechanism to incentivize the players to use their connections to invite more players to join the game. We show that the existing solutions such as the Shapley value cannot achieve this. Hence, to combat this problem, we propose a solution called weighted permission Shapley value (inspired by permission structure and the weighted Shapley value). Under this solution, for each player, inviting all her neighbors is a dominant strategy in all monotone games. We further prove that the solution is unique for tree networks. Our solution offers the very first attempt to incentivize the players to invite others to form a larger coalition in cooperative games.},

abstract="We study whether Pareto-optimal stable matchings can be reached via pairwise swaps in one-to-one matching markets with initial assignments. We consider housing markets, marriage markets, and roommate markets as well as three different notions of swap rationality. Our main results are as follows. While it can be efficiently determined whether a Pareto-optimal stable matching can be reached when defining swaps via blocking pairs, checking whether this is the case for all such sequences is computationally intractable. When defining swaps such that all involved agents need to be better off, even deciding whether a Pareto-optimal stable matching can be reached via some sequence is intractable. This confirms and extends a conjecture made by Damamme et al. (2015), who have furthermore shown that convergence to a Pareto-optimal matching is guaranteed in housing markets with single-peaked preferences. We show that in marriage and roommate markets, single-peakedness is not sufficient for this to hold, but the stronger restriction of one-dimensional Euclidean preferences is.",

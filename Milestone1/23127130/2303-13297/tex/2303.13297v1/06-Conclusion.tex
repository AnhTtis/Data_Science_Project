\lvv{This work explores the relation of model generalization and domain diversity, aiming to guarantee and further enhance the efficacy of domain augmentation strand. We then propose a framework to enable each diversified domain contribute to generalization by casting DG as 
a convex game between domains.
Heuristic analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our rationality and effectiveness.}
Note that we mainly focus on the mixup-based domain augmentation techniques for clarity, while the extension of DCG to other GAN-based techniques needs to be further explored. Besides, it also remains an open problem to design a more efficient strategy to avoid the decrease in training efficiency caused by meta-learning. 
Nevertheless, we believe our work can inspire the future work of enriching domain diversity 
with improved generalization capability.

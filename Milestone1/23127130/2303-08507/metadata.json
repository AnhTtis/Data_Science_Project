    "abstract": "We introduce a game where players selfishly choose a resource and endure a cost depending on the number of players choosing nearby resources. We model the influences among resources by a weighted graph, directed or not. These games are generalizations of well-known games like Wardrop and congestion games. We study the conditions of equilibria existence and their efficiency if they exist. We conclude with studies of games whose influences among resources can be modelled by simple graphs.",

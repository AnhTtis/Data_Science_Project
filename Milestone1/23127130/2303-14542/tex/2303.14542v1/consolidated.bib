 abstract = {The identifiers chosen by programmers as function names contain valuable information. They are often the starting point for program understanding activities, especially when high-level views, like the call graph, are available. In this paper, the lexical, syntactic and semantic structure of function identifiers is analyzed by means of a segmentation technique, a regular language and a conceptual classification. The application of these analyses to a database of procedural programs suggests some potential uses of the results, ranging from support for program understanding to the evolution towards standard and more maintainable forms of programs},

@inproceedings{Caprile1999,
 abstract = {The identifiers chosen by programmers as function names contain valuable information. They are often the starting point for program understanding activities, especially when high-level views, like the call graph, are available. In this paper, the lexical, syntactic and semantic structure of function identifiers is analyzed by means of a segmentation technique, a regular language and a conceptual classification. The application of these analyses to a database of procedural programs suggests some potential uses of the results, ranging from support for program understanding to the evolution towards standard and more maintainable forms of programs},

Several different application area's are mentioned:
1) forward engineering, help in choosing identifiers
2) reverse engineering, restructure identifiers of a program
3) re-documenting an existing source
4) traceability improvement
5) migration support (towards oo)
6) dictionary based reverse engineering tools},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis on social media such as Twitter has become a very important and challenging task. Due to the characteristics of such data—tweet length, spelling errors, abbreviations, and special characters—the sentiment analysis task in such an environment requires a non-traditional approach. Moreover, social media sentiment analysis is a fundamental problem with many interesting applications. Most current social media sentiment classification methods judge the sentiment polarity primarily according to textual content and neglect other information on these platforms. In this paper, we propose a neural network model that also incorporates user behavioral information within a given document (tweet). The neural network used in this paper is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is evaluated on two datasets provided by the SemEval-2016 Workshop. The proposed model outperforms current baseline models (including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines), which shows that going beyond the content of a document (tweet) is beneficial in sentiment classification, because it provides the classifier with a deep understanding of the task.}

Presently, the greater part of the work is proceeding on recognizing sentiments by concentrating on syntax and vocabulary. In addition, the task identified with natural language processing and for computing the exceptional and remarkable outcomes Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been utilized. Keeping in mind the end goal to capture the long-term dependencies CNNs, need to rely on assembling multiple layers. In this Paper for the improvement in understanding the sentiments, we constructed a joint architecture which places of RNN at first for capturing long-term dependencies with CNNs using global average pooling layer while on top a word embedding method using GloVe procured by unsupervised learning in the light of substantial twitter corpora to deal with this problem. Experimentations exhibit better execution when it is compared with the baseline model on the twitter’s corpora which tends to perform dependable results for the analysis of sentiment benchmarks by achieving 90.59% on Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus, 89.46% on Sentiment Strength Twitter Data and 88.72% on Health Care Reform Dataset respectively. Empirically, our work turned to be an efficient architecture with slight hyperparameter tuning which capable us to reduce the number of parameters with higher performance and not merely relying on convolutional multiple layers by constructing the RNN layer followed by convolutional layer to seizure long-term dependencies.}

abstract = {Aspect-level sentiment classification is a fine-grained task in sentiment analysis. Since it provides more complete and in-depth results, aspect-level sentiment analysis has received much attention these years. In this paper, we reveal that the sentiment polarity of a sentence is not only determined by the content but is also highly related to the concerned aspect.
For instance, “The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.”, for aspect taste, the polarity is positive while for service, the polarity is negative. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the connection between an aspect and the content of a sentence. To this end, we propose an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory Network for aspect-level sentiment classification. The attention mechanism can concentrate on different parts of a sentence when different aspects are taken as input. We experiment on the SemEval 2014 dataset and results show that our model achieves state-ofthe-art performance on aspect-level sentiment classification.},

Instead, we evaluate MLMs out of the box via their pseudo-log-likelihood scores (PLLs), which are computed by masking tokens one by one. We show that PLLs outperform scores from autoregressive language models like GPT-2 in a variety of tasks. By rescoring ASR and NMT hypotheses, RoBERTa reduces an end-to-end LibriSpeech model{'}s WER by 30{\%} relative and adds up to +1.7 BLEU on state-of-the-art baselines for low-resource translation pairs, with further gains from domain adaptation. We attribute this success to PLL{'}s unsupervised expression of linguistic acceptability without a left-to-right bias, greatly improving on scores from GPT-2 (+10 points on island effects, NPI licensing in BLiMP). One can finetune MLMs to give scores without masking, enabling computation in a single inference pass. In all, PLLs and their associated pseudo-perplexities (PPPLs) enable plug-and-play use of the growing number of pretrained MLMs; e.g., we use a single cross-lingual model to rescore translations in multiple languages. We release our library for language model scoring at https://github.com/awslabs/mlm-scoring.",

Previous studies have generally focused on extracting better representations of the relational arguments. In order to solve the task, it is however additionally necessary to capture what events are expected to cause or follow each other. Current discourse relation classifiers fall short in this respect. We here show that this shortcoming can be effectively addressed by using the bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) proposed by Devlin et al. (2019), which were trained on a next-sentence prediction task, and thus encode a representation of likely next sentences. The BERT-based model outperforms the current state of the art in 11-way classification by 8{\%} points on the standard PDTB dataset. Our experiments also demonstrate that the model can be successfully ported to other domains: on the BioDRB dataset, the model outperforms the state of the art system around 15{\%} points.",

    "abstract": "The paper discusses the limitations of deep learning models in identifying and utilizing features that remain invariant under a bijective transformation on the data entries, which we refer to as combinatorial patterns. We argue that the identification of such patterns may be important for certain applications and suggest providing neural networks with information that fully describes the combinatorial patterns of input entries and allows the network to determine what is relevant for prediction. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we present a combinatorial convolutional neural network for word classification.",

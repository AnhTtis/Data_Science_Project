\begin{abstract}
Singing voice synthesis (SVS), as a specific task for generating the vocal singing voice from a music score, has drawn much attention in recent years. SVS faces the challenge that the singing has various pronunciation flexibility conditioned on the same music score. Most of the previous works of SVS can not well handle the misalignment between the music score and actual singing. In this paper, we propose an acoustic feature processing strategy, named \textbf{\textit{PHONEix}}, with a phoneme distribution predictor, to alleviate the gap between the music score and the singing voice, which can be easily adopted in different SVS systems. Extensive experiments in various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our \textbf{\textit{PHONEix}} in both objective and subjective evaluations.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we introduce for the first time an improved AFP strategy \textit{\textbf{PHONEix}} to an SVS system. It helps narrow the gap between theoretical music score input and actual singing. In it, a novel \textbf{phoneme distribution predictor} is integrated to give phoneme proportions in each note. Therefore, the phoneme duration becomes a learnable feature to fit the complex pronunciation in singing. The prior encoder module can be quickly adapted to different acoustic models. If given a large SVS dataset, it would be promising work to pre-train a phoneme distribution predictor to annotate phoneme time sequences in raw datasets.

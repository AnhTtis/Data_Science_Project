\section{Trajectory and Procedure Data}
\label{sec:dataset}
\subsection{Trajectory Data}
In this paper, we use a trajectory dataset that is generated using the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) multisensor fusion tracker \cite{jagodnik2008fusion}.
This tracker collects radar detections from multiple sensors (primary radar, mode A/C and S transponders, wide area multilateration systems, and ADS-B receivers) and fuses them into a set of flight tracks.
Each track contains timestamped entries of the target address (used to group entries into flights), aircraft ID (if available), latitude and longitude (in WGS84), pressure altitude, geometric altitude (if available), and horizontal and vertical velocities.
The data were collected for six months starting March 2012 from three locations: Central Florida, New York City, and Southern California.
We train our models using data from %\todo{is JFK the only data used?} 
the vicinity of John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK), located within the New York Class B airspace that includes Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR) and LaGuardia Airport (KLGA).

We process the track data as follows. First, the latitude-longitude-altitude coordinates of each position measurement are transformed to the local east-north-up (ENU) coordinates centered at the airport.
Next, we extract trajectories that enter into the airspace defined as 25 NM from the airport center. Based on the change in distance to the airport and altitude over time, the trajectories are sorted into arrivals, departures, and overflights
Finally, we separate the trajectories based on the runways: 04L/22R, 04R/22L, 13L/31R, and 13R/31L.
Fig. \ref{fig:jfk_arrivals_hist} shows the lateral view of a log-histogram of all arrival flight tracks to KJFK.
The origin indicates the center of the airport and the blue lines indicate the runways in use.

\subsection{Flight Procedure Data}
To model flight procedures, we use the standard flight procedures published by the air navigation service providers (e.g., the FAA). 
The procedures are defined as a set of waypoints, which are fixed points in 2D space (latitude and longitude). Each aircraft is instructed to fly from one waypoint to the next along the procedure.
Arrival traffic involves two types of standard flight procedures: standard terminal arrival routes (STARs) and instrument approach procedures (IAPs).
A STAR connects the end of an airway from the en-route airspace to the vicinity of the airport.
An IAP is a sequence of predetermined maneuvers used for the final approach. It allows the pilots to align the aircraft with the runway, make their final descent, and land safely in low visibility conditions. 
For the integration of multiple traffic approaches and the smooth transition of each aircraft from a STAR to an IAP, air traffic controllers (ATC) often provide radar vectoring (i.e., guide aircraft by assigning headings, altitudes, and speeds).

For KJFK, only the final approach and radar vectoring stages fall in the range of 25 NM from the airport.
Since there are no standard procedures published for radar vectoring, we take the nominal paths extracted from the actual trajectory set as the radar vector procedures.
To extract the nominal paths, we cluster the trajectory set using $k$-means and then select the ones representative of the flight patterns.
Fig. \ref{fig:jfk_04R_orginal_paths} shows the arrival traffic to runway 04R of KJFK and the associated procedures overlaid on them.
The radar vector procedures are indicated with blue dotted lines, while the IAP is indicated with a white dashed line with orange edges.

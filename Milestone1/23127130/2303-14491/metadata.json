    "abstract": "Data videos are becoming increasingly popular in society and academia. Yet little is known about how to create endings that strengthen a lasting impression and persuasion. To fulfill the gap, this work aims to develop guidelines for data video endings by drawing inspiration from cinematic arts. To contextualize cinematic endings in data videos, 111 film endings and 105 data video endings are first analyzed to identify four common styles using the framework of ending punctuation marks. We conducted expert interviews (N=11) and formulated 20 guidelines for creating cinematic endings in data videos. To validate our guidelines, we conducted a user study where 24 participants were invited to design endings with and without our guidelines, which are evaluated by experts and the general public. The participants praise the clarity and usability of the guidelines, and results show that the endings with guidelines are perceived to be more understandable, impressive, and reflective.",

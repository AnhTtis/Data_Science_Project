Quantifier elimination (QE) is an important problem that has numerous
applications. Unfortunately, QE is computationally very hard. Earlier
we introduced a generalization of QE called \ti{partial} QE (or PQE
for short). PQE allows to unquantify a \ti{part} of the formula.  The
appeal of PQE is twofold. First, many important problems can be solved
in terms of PQE. Second, PQE can be drastically faster than QE if only
a small part of the formula gets unquantified.  To make PQE practical,
one needs an algorithm for verifying the solution produced by a PQE
solver. In this paper, we describe a very simple SAT-based verifier
called \Vp and provide some experimental results.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}
We present an algorithm called \Vp for verifying a solution to Partial
Quantifier Elimination (PQE). The advantage of \Vp is that it does
need to know how this solution was obtained (e.g. if a particular
proof system was employed).  So, \Vp can be used to debug an \ti{any}
PQE algorithm.  A flaw of \Vp is that its performance strongly depends
on the presence of so-called unremovable boundary points of the
formula at hand. If this formula has no such points, \Vp can
efficiently verify solutions to very large PQE problems. Otherwise,
its performance is, in general, limited to small problems of 70-80
variables.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
We have presented a novel personalization framework for task-oriented dialog systems, {\ourmodel}, that can seamlessly adapt to newly emerging unseen user profiles in the unsupervised fashion.
{\ourmodel} stands out as the first unsupervised framework for personalized task-oriented dialog systems that can effectively adapt its conversation flows and linguistic styles, disambiguate nuances, and make meaningful recommendations according to the profile of the active user.
The key idea behind the proposed framework is using a novel zero-shot generalizable reward function that guides the policy of the personalized model to adapt its responses for the given user without compromising the task completion accuracy.
Our experimental evaluation uses up to 180 diverse user profiles for five tasks including conducting full personalized dialogs. 
Interestingly, our proposed framework outperforms all the existing personalization models using quantitative as well as qualitative analysis. Furthermore, we also trained  a fully supervised-GPT model for comparison and it turned out that {\ourmodel}, trained using only 20 labeled training examples, achieves better or competitive performance.

Based on real data and on a collaboration with industry, we show that a collaborative approach between companies offers important benefits. We propose to develop partnerships between shipping companies and to synchronize their shipments. Four operational collaborative schemes with different objectives are developed. The first one focuses on minimizing shipping costs for shippers. The second and third ones minimize the carrier{\textquoteright}s costs and the environmental cost, respectively. The fourth one is a combination of all three. The results of our computational experiments demonstrate that collaboration lead to significant cost reductions.},

	abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(mdlogn) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m\~{}n and d\~{}logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2{\texttimes}106 edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

Design/methodology/approach {\textendash} Joint route planning is a measure that companies can take to decrease the costs of their distribution activities. Essentially, this can either be achieved through horizontal cooperation or through outsourcing distribution to a logistics service provider. The synergy value is defined as the difference between distribution costs in the original situation where all entities perform their orders individually, and the costs of a system where all orders are collected and route schemes are set up simultaneously to exploit economies of scale. This paper provides estimates of synergy values, both in a constructed benchmark case and in a number of real-world cases. Findings {\textendash} It turns out that synergy values of 30 per cent are achievable. Furthermore, intuition is developed on how the synergy values depend on characteristics of the distribution problem under consideration. Practical implications {\textendash} The developed intuition on the nature of synergy values can help practitioners to find suitable combinations of distribution systems, since synergy values can quickly be assessed based on the characteristics of the distribution problem, without solving large and difficult vehicle routing problems. Originality/value {\textendash} This paper addresses a major impediment to horizontal cooperation: estimating operational savings upfront.},

	abstract = {On-demand mobility sharing, provided by one or several transportation network companies (TNCs), is realized by real-time optimization algorithms to connect trips among tens of thousands of drivers and fellow passengers. In a market of mobility sharing comprised of TNCs, there are two competing principles, the economies of network scale and the healthy competition between TNCs, which can lead to "segmentation" of market. To understand the substantiality and relationship of the two competing principles, we need to answer how much efficiency loss is generated due to the segmentation of market, and which factors are related to it. Here we show how four critical factors of market structure and characteristics of mobility sharing services -- density of trips (thickness), maximum detour allowed for sharing (tightness), market shares (unevenness), and spatial segregation of the TNCs (dissolvedness) -- are associated with the efficiency loss, represented as the difference in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) under different market structures. We found that 1) while VMT shows a simple power function with thickness, the corresponding exponent term can be expressed as a non-monotonic function with tightness -- essentially showing how economies and diseconomies of scale in this market arise, and appearing a very similar form to the Lennard--Jones model in inter-molecular potentials; and 2) the efficiency loss is higher when unevenness is closer to 0.5 (50-50 market share) and dissolvedness is larger. Our results give a comprehensive analysis of how the inefficiency of market segmentation is generated, and how potentially it may be avoided through market mechanism design.},

In this paper, we first introduce a unified theoretical framework to describe the shared mobility market, and then use it to propose four market structure designs to dissolve the market segmentation to different extents. Using a formal analysis framework, we analyze the following aspects of the two status quo and four proposed market structures: demand and supply information collection, service delivery and payment flow.

In this paper, a carrier collaboration problem in pickup and delivery service (CCPPD) is studied. CCPPD has two important issues which are the optimal reallocation of transportation requests among the carriers to maximize a total profit of the alliance and a fair allocation of the profit among the carriers so as to maintain the stability of the alliance. In this study, the profit allocation among carriers is addressed under a centralized collaboration framework. We propose three profit allocation mechanisms which are based on Shapley value, the proportional allocation concept, and the contribution of each carrier in offering and serving requests, respectively. All the mechanisms ensure that the allocation is in the core if the latter is not empty. They are evaluated and compared with numerical experiments on randomly generated instances.},

	abstract = {Transportation planning is an important part of the supply chain or wood flow chain in forestry. There are often several forest companies operating in the same region and collaboration between two or more companies is rare. However, there is an increasing interest in collaborative planning as the potential savings are large, often in the range 5{\textendash}15\%. There are several issues to agree on before such collaborative planning can be used in practice. A key question is how the total cost or savings should be distributed among the participants. In this paper, we study a large application in southern Sweden with eight forest companies involved in a collaboration. We investigate a number of sharing mechanisms based on economic models including Shapley value, the nucleolus, separable and non-separable costs, shadow prices and volume weights. We also propose a new allocation method, with the aim that the participants relative profits are as equal as possible. We use two planning models, the first is based on direct flows between supply and demand points and the second includes backhauling. We also study how several time periods and geographical distribution of the supply and demand nodes affect the solutions. Better planning within each company can save about 5\% and collaboration can increase this about another 9\% to a total of 14\%. The proposed allocation method is shown to be a practical approach to share the overall cost/savings.},

trading partners, and second, regulatory limitations to entry. To assess the importance of these features, we use the model to simulate the effect of changes in 
entry, alternative matching technologies, and different market density. We use the geographical features of the matching process to back out unobserved demand 
through a matching simulation. The matching function exhibits increasing returns to scale, which is important to understand the impact of changes in this market 
and has welfare implications. For instance, although alternative dispatch platforms can be more efficient than street-hailing, platform competition is harmful because it reduces effective density.},

	abstract = {For city regulators, whether to encourage or discourage competition between transportation network companies (TNCs) is a debatable question. As a typical two-sided market, the competition between TNCs can lead to market fragmentation and loss of matching efficiency between passengers and drivers, whereas a monopoly market may result in the dominant TNC abusing its market power. Prior studies explored this question mostly using mathematical equilibrium models, but few have comprehensively investigated it based on empirical analysis from a spatiotemporal perspective. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework to analyze the competition between TNCs using the most accessible ride-hailing order data from New York City. XGBoost-based SHAP regression model is utilized to capture an interpretable overview of the interweaved associations within the competitive market. On the one hand, from the TNC's point of view, this study identifies the association between the key decision variables of TNCs with their market shares. It is found that passenger fare is more powerful than driver wage in influencing market shares, and big TNCs are often beneficiaries of fare competition. On the other hand, from the perspective of regulators, we analyze how the interests of passengers and drivers may vary with competition intensity. The results suggest more intensive market competition generally benefits the interests of both passengers and drivers, but it should be within a certain limit because excessive competition can make it economically unsustainable for TNCs to operate. These findings add empirical evidence to prior studies and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the competition among TNCs. Several implications are proposed for improved regulation of the ride-hailing market.},

	abstract = {In the freight transport sector, competing companies horizontally collaborate through establishing Collaborative Transport Networks (CTNs). Fruitful implementation of CTNs will leverage environmental and socio-economic goals of sustainable development in the freight transport sector. The benefits of CTNs in horizontal collaborative settings have been widely demonstrated through several modelling approaches. However, in practice, the real applications of CTNs have been challenging and most did not achieve satisfactory performances. Some studies have addressed this issue by identifying different barriers to CTN implementation. However, a conceptual framework for the barriers is not well-established. In addition, the literature lacks a decision-making framework for the CTN implementation which considers the different barriers. To address this gap, this paper conducted a literature review of the barriers to CTN implementation. In total, 31 different barriers were identified. A conceptual barrier framework is developed by grouping the 31 barriers into five categories: the business model, information sharing, the human factors, the Collaborative Decision Support Systems (CDSSs), and the market. The paper additionally proposes a stage-gate model integrating the conceptual barrier framework into the CTN implementation decision-making process. The current work contributes to the existing literature by developing both theoretical and practical understandings of the barriers to implementing CTNs and will support decision makers in CTN implementation to maximize the CTN benefits and minimize the risk of CTN failure.},

To compute the value of the characteristic function of this game, an optimization problem formulated as a stochastic dynamic program is introduced. Due to high computational effort of stochastic dynamic programming and calculation of the Shapley value, a tailor-made solution procedure is developed. This procedure combines methods of approximate dynamic programming to find an approximate value of the characteristic function and an estimation algorithm for the Shapley value.

	abstract = {Over the last 10~years, ride-hailing companies (such as Uber and Grab) have proliferated in cities around the world. While generally beneficial from an economic viewpoint, having a plurality of operators that serve a given demand for point-to-point trips might induce traffic inefficiencies due to the lack of coordination between operators when serving trips. In fact, the efficiency of vehicle fleet management depends, among other things, density of the demand in the city, and in this sense having multiple operators in the market can be seen as a disadvantage. There is thus a tension between having a plurality of operators in the market, and the overall traffic efficiency. To this date, there is no systematic analysis of this trade-off, which is fundamental to design the best future urban mobility landscape. In this paper, we present the first systematic, data-driven characterization of the cost of non-coordination in urban on-demand mobility markets by proposing a simple, yet realistic, model. This model uses trip density and average traffic speed in a city as its input, and provides an accurate estimate of the additional number of vehicles that should circulate due to the lack of coordination between operators{\textemdash}the cost of non-coordination. We plot such cost across different cities{\textemdash}Singapore, New York (limited to the borough of Manhattan in this work), San Francisco, Vienna and Curitiba{\textemdash}and show that due to non-coordination, each additional operator in the market can increase the total number of circulating vehicles by up to 67\%. Our findings could support city policy makers to make data supported decisions when regulating urban on-demand mobility markets in their cities. At the same time, our results outline the need of a more proactive government participation and the need for new, innovative solutions that would enable a better coordination of on-demand mobility operators.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as {\textquotedblleft}modularity{\textquotedblright} over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

Demand management strategies, such as land use, transit, and auto pricing policies, are also needed. These measures, however, have historically faced political challenges and have been difficult to implement. Emerging ridesharing systems now suggest the possibility of a new demand management strategy that may be more politically palatable and reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT). To date, however, little research has evaluated their potential travel effects, especially on a regional scale. This study used the San Francisco, California, Bay Area activity-based travel demand model to simulate business-as-usual, transit-oriented development, and auto pricing scenarios with and without high, medium, and low ridesharing participation levels. The analysis suggests that relatively large VMT reductions are possible from moderate and high participation levels, but at low participation levels, VMT reductions are negligible. Moderate dynamic ridesharing alone compares favorably, with a 9\% reduction in VMT, to transit-oriented development and auto pricing scenarios. The analysis also suggests a potentially promising policy combination: a moderately used regional dynamic ridesharing system with a 10- to 30-cent increase in the per mile cost of auto travel, which together may reduce VMT on the order of 11\% to 19\%.},

	abstract = {Taxi services are a vital part of urban transportation, and a considerable contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad hoc heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network, which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40\% or more. This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split fares, hinting toward a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service. Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is low.},

By sharing rides, drivers offer free seats in their vehicles to passengers who want to travel in similar directions. Traditional ridesharing approaches are suitable for long-distance travel, especially inter-city travel, yet they are not flexible enough for short routes within cities. The aim of our research is to develop a service that enables dynamic ridesharing as part of sustainable urban mobility. Dynamic ridesharing refers to a service that automatically matches ride requests and ride offers on short notice without prior agreement between driver and passenger. We present the implementation and evaluation of a dynamic ridesharing service. The implementation part requires an automated matching algorithm that checks whether a driver can take a passenger with him without violating the maximum detour constraint he has set. As this matching algorithm needs to automatically match a relatively large number of ride offers and ride requests in real-time, we focused on building a high-performance algorithm. After implementing the algorithm, we evaluated its performance on a data set with random ride offers in and around the Munich city that is matched with different ride requests. For 10,000 rides in the system, it took less than 0.4seconds on average to identify the best match.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a general model for describing the equilibrium state of a ride-sourcing market with an arbitrary number of platforms competing with each other. As the number of platforms increases, the market changes from monopoly to duopoly, oligopoly, and finally perfect competition, bringing about two different effects on system efficiency. On the one hand, as in other service markets, competition in the ride-sourcing markets prevents a monopolist platform from extracting excessive profit by distorting its operating strategies from socially efficient levels. On the other hand, competition between platforms leads to market fragmentation, thereby increasing matching frictions and passengers’ waiting time. To well characterize these two opposite driven forces, we develop a game-theoretical model to find out the Nash equilibrium solutions of a competitive ride-sourcing market, at which no platform can increase its profits by unilaterally changing its own strategy. Then we try to quantify the price (efficiency gain or loss) of competition and fragmentation by establishing an upper bound of the inefficiency ratio, i.e., the ratio of social welfare under a social optimum to social welfare under a competitive Nash equilibrium. We show that the results of market equilibrium, including the inefficiency ratio, are jointly governed by the degree of market fragmentation and competition among platforms. In particular, we find that some key market measures, such as consumer surplus, platform profits, social welfare, display diverse trends of changes with respect to the number of platforms, as the on-demand matching between passengers and drivers exhibits increasing, constant, and decreasing returns to scale.}

These companies connect passengers and drivers in real time and are disruptively changing the transportation industry. As pioneers in a general sharing economy context, ridesourcing shared transportation platforms consist of a typical two-sided market. On the demand side, passengers are sensitive to the price and quality of the service. On the supply side, drivers, as freelancers, make working decisions flexibly based on their income from the platform and many other factors. Diverse variables and factors in the system are strongly endogenous and interactively dependent. How to design and operate ridesourcing systems is vital{\textemdash}and challenging{\textemdash}for all stakeholders: passengers/users, drivers/service providers, platforms, policy makers, and the general public.

This framework can aid understanding of the interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables, their changes in response to platforms{\textquoteright} operational strategies and decisions, multiple system objectives, and market equilibria in a dynamic manner. Under the proposed general framework, we summarize important research problems and the corresponding methodologies that have been and are being developed and implemented to address these problems. We conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on these problems in different areas from diverse perspectives, including (1) demand and pricing, (2) supply and incentives, (3) platform operations, and (4) competition, impacts, and regulations.

	abstract = {Information and communication technologies have opened the way to new solutions for urban mobility that provide better ways to match individuals with on-demand vehicles. However, a fundamental unsolved problem is how best to size and operate a fleet of vehicles, given a certain demand for personal mobility. Previous studies1{\textendash}5 either do not provide a scalable solution or require changes in human attitudes towards mobility. Here we provide a network-based solution to the following {\textquoteleft}minimum fleet problem{\textquoteright}, given a collection of trips (specified by origin, destination and start time), of how to determine the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all the trips without incurring any delay to the passengers. By introducing the notion of a {\textquoteleft}vehicle-sharing network{\textquoteright}, we present an optimal computationally efficient solution to the problem, as well as a nearly optimal solution amenable to real-time implementation. We test both solutions on a dataset of 150 million taxi trips taken in the city of New York over one year6. The real-time implementation of the method with near-optimal service levels allows a 30 per cent reduction in fleet size compared to current taxi operation. Although constraints on driver availability and the existence of abnormal trip demands may lead to a relatively larger optimal value for the fleet size than that predicted here, the fleet size remains robust for a wide range of variations in historical trip demand. These predicted reductions in fleet size follow directly from a reorganization of taxi dispatching that could be implemented with a simple urban app; they do not assume ride sharing7{\textendash}9, nor require changes to regulations, business models, or human attitudes towards mobility to become effective. Our results could become even more relevant in the years ahead as fleets of networked, self-driving cars become commonplace10{\textendash}14.},

	abstract = {A dynamic ridesharing system is a platform that connects drivers who use their personal vehicles to travel with riders who are in need of transportation, on a short notice. Since each driver/rider may have several potential matches, to achieve a high performance level, the ridesharing operator needs to make the matching decisions based on a global view of the system that includes all active riders and drivers. Consequently, the ride-matching problem that needs to be solved can become computationally expensive, especially when the system is operating over a large region, or when it faces high demand levels during certain hours of the day. This paper develops a graph partitioning methodology based on the bipartite graph that arises in the one-to-one ride-matching problem. The proposed method decomposes the original graph into multiple sub-graphs with the goal of reducing the overall computational complexity of the problem as well as providing high quality solutions. We further show that this methodology can be extended to more complex ride-matching problems in a dynamic ride-sharing system. Using numerical experiments, we showcase the advantages of the new partitioning method for different forms of ride-matching problems. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the impact of different parameters on the quality of our solution.},

Though a growing literature addresses the question of how to make individual MoD platforms more efficient, much less is known about the cost of market fragmentation, i.e., the impact on overall welfare due to splitting demand between multiple independent platforms. Our work aims to quantify how much platform fragmentation degrades the efficiency of the system. In particular, we focus on a setting where demand is exogenously split between multiple platforms, and study the increase in supply rebalancing costs incurred by each platform to meet this demand, vis-{\`a}-vis the cost incurred by a centralized platform serving the aggregate demand. We show under a large-market scaling, this Price-of-Fragmentation undergoes a phase transition, wherein, depending on the nature of the exogenous demand, the additional cost due to fragmentation either vanishes or grows unbounded. We provide conditions that characterize which regime applies to any given system, and discuss implications of these findings on how such platforms should be regulated.},

	abstract = {Simulation studies suggest that pooled on-demand services (also referred to as Demand Responsive Transport, ridesharing, shared ride-hailing or shared ridesourcing services) have the potential to bring large benefits to urban areas while inducing limited time losses for their users. However, in reality, the large majority of users request individual rides (and not pooled rides) in existing on-demand services, leading to increases in motorised vehicle miles travelled. In this study, we investigate to what extent fare discounts, additional travel time, and the (un)willingness to share the ride with (different numbers of) other passengers play a role in the decision of individuals to share rides. To this end, we design a stated preference study targeting Dutch urban individuals. In our research, we (1) disentangle the sharing aspect from related time{\textendash}cost trade-offs (e.g. detours), (2) investigate preference heterogeneity regarding the studied attributes and identify distinct market segments, and (3) simulate scenarios to understand the impact of the obtained parameters in the breakdown between individual and pooled services. We find that less than one third of respondents have strong preferences against sharing their rides. Also, we find that different market segments vary not only in their values of the willingness to share, but also in how they perceive this willingness to share (per-ride or proportional to the in-vehicle time). Further, the scenario analysis demonstrates that the share of individuals who are willing to share rides depends primarily on the time{\textendash}cost trade-offs, rather than on the disutility stemming from pooling rides per se.},

	abstract = {In modern transportation systems, the potential for further decreasing the costs of fulfilling customer requests is severely limited while market competition is constantly reducing revenues. However, increased competitiveness through cost reductions can be achieved if freight carriers cooperate in order to balance their request portfolios. Participation in such coalitions can benefit the entire coalition, as well as each participant individually, thus reinforcing the market position of the partners. The work presented in this paper uniquely combines features of routing and scheduling problems and of cooperative game theory. In the first part, the profit margins resulting from horizontal cooperation among freight carriers are analysed. It is assumed that the structure of customer requests corresponds to that of a pickup and delivery problem with time windows for each freight carrier. In the second part, the possibilities of sharing these profit margins fairly among the partners are discussed. The Shapley value can be used to determine a fair allocation. Numerical results for real-life and artificial instances are presented.},

	abstract = {IntroductionAt the foundation of the theory of games is the assumption that the players of a game can evaluate, in their utility scales, every {\textquotedblleft}prospect{\textquotedblright} that might arise as a result of a play. In attempting to apply the theory to any field, one would normally expect to be permitted to include, in the class of {\textquotedblleft}prospects,{\textquotedblright} the prospect of having to play a game. The possibility of evaluating games is therefore of critical importance. So long as the theory is unable to assign values to the games typically found in application, only relatively simple situations{\textemdash}where games do not depend on other games{\textemdash}will be susceptible to analysis and solution.In the finite theory of von Neumann and Morgenstern difficulty in evaluation persists for the {\textquotedblleft}essential{\textquotedblright} games, and for only those. In this note we deduce a value for the {\textquotedblleft}essential{\textquotedblright} case and examine a number of its elementary properties. We proceed from a set of three axioms, having simple intuitive interpretations, which suffice to determine the value uniquely.Our present work, though mathematically self-contained, is founded conceptually on the von Neumann{\textemdash}Morgenstern theory up to their introduction of characteristic functions. We thereby inherit certain important underlying assumptions: (a) that utility is objective and transferable; (b) that games are cooperative affairs; (c) that games, granting (a) and (b), are adequately represented by their characteristic functions.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a model for the collaboration among independent freight forwarding entities. In the modern highly competitive transportation branch freight forwarders reduce their fulfillment costs by exploiting different execution modes (self-fulfillment and subcontraction). For self-fulfillment they use their own vehicles to execute the requests and for subcontracting they forward the orders to external freight carriers. Further enhancement of competitiveness can be achieved if the freight forwarders cooperate in coalitions in order to balance their request portfolios. Participation in such a coalition gains additional profit for the entire coalition and for each participant, therefore reinforcing the market position of the partners. The integrated operational transport problem as well as existing collaboration approaches are introduced. The presented model for collaboration is based on theoretical foundations in the field of combinatorial auctions and operational research game theory. It is applicable for coalitions of freight forwarders, especially for the collaboration of Profit Centres within large freight forwarding companies. The proposed theoretical approach and the presented collaboration model are suitable for a coalition of freight forwarding companies with nearly similar potential on the market.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544843},
	shorttitle = {T-share},
	abstract = {Taxi ridesharing can be of significant social and environmental benefit, e.g. by saving energy consumption and satisfying people's commute needs. Despite the great potential, taxi ridesharing, especially with dynamic queries, is not well studied. In this paper, we formally define the dynamic ridesharing problem and propose a large-scale taxi ridesharing service. It efficiently serves real-time requests sent by taxi users and generates ridesharing schedules that reduce the total travel distance significantly. In our method, we first propose a taxi searching algorithm using a spatio-temporal index to quickly retrieve candidate taxis that are likely to satisfy a user query. A scheduling algorithm is then proposed. It checks each candidate taxi and inserts the query's trip into the schedule of the taxi which satisfies the query with minimum additional incurred travel distance. To tackle the heavy computational load, a lazy shortest path calculation strategy is devised to speed up the scheduling algorithm. We evaluated our service using a {GPS} trajectory dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis during a period of 3 months. By learning the spatio-temporal distributions of real user queries from this dataset, we built an experimental platform that simulates user real behaviours in taking a taxi. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, our approach demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, our proposed service serves 25\% additional taxi users while saving 13\% travel distance compared with no-ridesharing (when the ratio of the number of queries to that of taxis is 6).},

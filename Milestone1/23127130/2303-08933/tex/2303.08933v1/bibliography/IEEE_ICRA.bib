abstract="The artificial neural networks that are used to recognize shapes typically use one or more layers of learned feature detectors that produce scalar outputs. By contrast, the computer vision community uses complicated, hand-engineered features, like SIFT [6], that produce a whole vector of outputs including an explicit representation of the pose of the feature. We show how neural networks can be used to learn features that output a whole vector of instantiation parameters and we argue that this is a much more promising way of dealing with variations in position, orientation, scale and lighting than the methods currently employed in the neural networks community. It is also more promising than the hand-engineered features currently used in computer vision because it provides an efficient way of adapting the features to the domain.",

abstract = {We propose a method for task allocation to multiple physical agents that works when tasks have temporal and spatial constraints and agents have different capacities. Assuming that the problem is over-constrained, we need to find allocations that maximize the number of tasks that can be done without violating any of the constraints. The contribution of this work is the study of a new multi-robot task allocation problem and the design and the experimental evaluation of our approach, an iterated local search that is suitable for time critical applications. We created test instances on which we experimentally show that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art approach to a related problem. Our approach improves the baseline's score on average by 2.35{\%} and up to 10.53{\%}, while responding in times shorter than the baseline's, on average, 1.6 s and up to 5.5 s shorter. Furthermore, our approach is robust to run replication and is not very sensitive to parameters tuning.},

abstract = {Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) are the most recent exciting advancement in deep learning field and their applications are quickly spreading in multi-cross-domains including bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, social networks, natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we expose and tackle some of the basic weaknesses of a GCNN model with a capsule idea presented in (Hinton et al., 2011) and propose our Graph Capsule Network (GCAPS-CNN) model. In addition, we design our GCAPS-CNN model to solve especially graph classification problem which current GCNN models find challenging. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed Graph Capsule Network can significantly outperforms both the existing state-of-art deep learning methods and graph kernels on graph classification benchmark datasets.},

@inproceedings{Vaswani2017,
abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel and flexible J-type air-based battery thermal management system (BTMS), by integrating conventional Z-type and U-type BTMS. With two controlling valves, the J-type BTMS can be adaptively controlled in real time to help balance the temperature uniformity and energy efficiency under various charging/discharging situations (especially extreme fast changing). Results of computational fluid dynamics simulations show that the J-type system performs better than the U-type and Z-type systems. To further improve the thermal performance of the proposed J-type BTMS, a surrogate-based multi-objective optimization is performed, with the consideration of the two major objectives, i.e., uniformity and energy efficiency. The concurrent surrogate selection (COSMOS) framework is adopted in this paper to determine the most suitable surrogate models. Optimization results show that: (i) the uniformity of the temperature distribution is improved by 38.6{\%} compared to the benchmark, (ii) the maximum temperature is reduced by 19.1{\%}, and (iii) the pressure drop is decreased by 14.5{\%}.},

abstract = {Swarm robotic search aims at searching targets using a large number of collaborating simple mobile robots, with applications to search and rescue and hazard localization. In this regard, decentralized swarm systems are touted for their coverage scalability, time efficiency, and fault tolerance. To guide the behavior of such swarm systems, two broad classes of approaches are available, namely, nature-inspired swarm heuristics and multi-robotic search methods. However, the ability to simultaneously achieve efficient scalability and provide fundamental insights into the exhibited behavior (as opposed to exhibiting a black-box behavior) remains an open problem. To address this problem, this paper extends the underlying search approach in batch-Bayesian optimization to perform search with embodied swarm agents operating in a (simulated) physical 2D arena. Key contributions lie in (1) designing an acquisition function that not only balances exploration and exploitation across the swarm but also allows modeling knowledge extraction over trajectories and (2) developing its distributed implementation to allow asynchronous task inference and path planning by the swarm robots. The resulting collective informative path planning approach is tested on target-search case studies of varying complexity, where the target produces a spatially varying (measurable) signal. Notably, superior performance, in terms of mission completion efficiency, is observed compared to exhaustive search and random walk baselines as well as a swarm optimization-based state-of-the-art method. Favorable scalability characteristics are also demonstrated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ASME. Wearable sensors are revolutionizing the health monitoring and medical diagnostics arena. Algorithms and software platforms that can convert the sensor data streams into useful/actionable knowledge are central to this emerging domain, with machine learning and signal processing tools dominating this space. While serving important ends, these tools are not designed to provide functional relationships between vital signs and measures of physical activity. This paper investigates the application of the metamodeling paradigm to health data to unearth important relationships between vital signs and physical activity. To this end, we leverage neural networks and a recently developed metamodeling framework that automatically selects and trains the metamodel that best represents the data set. A publicly available data set is used that provides the ECG data and the IMU data from three sensors (ankle/arm/chest) for ten volunteers, each performing various activities over one-minute time periods. We consider three activities, namely running, climbing stairs, and the baseline resting activity. For the following three extracted ECG features - heart rate, QRS time, and QR ratio in each heartbeat period - models with median error of {\textless} 25{\%} are obtained. Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing, facilitated by the metamodels, provides further important insights into the impact of the different physical activity parameters on the ECG features, and the variation across the ten volunteers.},

abstract = {This paper presents an advancement to an approach for model-independent surrogate-based optimization with adaptive batch sampling, known as Adaptive Model Refinement (AMR). While the original AMR method provides unique decisions with regards to "when" to sample and "how many" samples to add (to preserve the credibility of the optimization search process), it did not provide specific direction towards "where" to sample in the design variable space. This paper thus introduces the capability to identify optimum location to add new samples. The location of the infill points is decided by integrating a Gaussian Process-based criteria ("q-EI"), adopted from Bayesian optimization. The consideration of a penalization term to mitigate interaction among samples (in a batch) is crucial to effective integration of the q-EI criteria into AMR. The new AMR method, called AMR with Penalized Batch Bayesian Sampling (AMR-PBS) is tested on benchmark functions, demonstrating better performance compared to Bayesian EGO. In addition, it is successfully applied to design surface riblets for bio-inspired passive flow control (where high-fidelity samples are given by costly RANS CFD simulations), leading to a 10{\%} drag reduction over the corresponding baseline (i.e., riblet-free aerodynamic surface).},

abstract = {For dynamic systems that operate in the transitional range of Reynolds number (laminar to turbulent How), passive and active surface features can play an important role in maximizing the aerodynamic efficiency or control authority. This paper focuses on passive riblet-like features that are inspired by those naturally observed in marine animals. Unlike more conventional riblet geomtries, e.g., sawtooth and scalloped surface ridges, a smoother and parametrized riblet design is considered (defined by a bell-shaped function), studied and optimized to obtain maximum aerodynamic drag reduction. A CFD-based analysis is performed using RANS solvers to quantify the aerodynamic forces on a 3D airfoil section (NACA0012 airfoil is used), with the riblet-like features that run along the chord-wise direction on the top surface of the airfoil. To pursue optimization of the riblet geometry and spacing, surrogate modeling is performed first to alleviate the prohibitive computational cost of the CFD simulations, and a variable fidelity optimization method is used to subsequently maximize drag reduction for different angle of attack cases. Up to 6.6{\%} reduction in drag is observed with optimal riblet design, compared to the bare 3D airfoil section. Further insights are derived into the How physics driving the aerodynamic efficiency benefits of smooth riblets, with riblets of 0.5 height-to-spacing ratio (and that impedes upward momentum transfer) identified as particularly promising in our case studies.},

Although ANN and other surrogate models have been used to predict building energy loads in the past, there is a limited understanding of what type of model prescriptions impact their performance as well as how un-recorded impact factors (e.g., human behavior and building repair work) should be accounted for. Here, the recorded energy data of three university buildings, from 9/2013–12/2015, is cleaned and synchronized with the local weather data. The data is then classified into eight classes; weekends and weekdays of Fall/Winter/Spring/Summer semesters. Both Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) NNs are explored. Differing number of hidden layers and transfer function choices are also explored, leading to the choice of the hyperbolic-tangent-sigmoid transfer function and 60 hidden layers. Similarly, an automated surrogate modeling framework is used to select the best models from among a pool of Kriging, RBF, and SVR models. A baseline concept, that uses energy information from the previous day as an added input to the ANN, helps to account for otherwise unrecorded recent changes in the building behavior, leading to improvement in fidelity of up to 30{\%}.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper proposes a model predictive based approach for dynamic balance of a NAO H25 Humanoid robot. Due to the inherent mechanical properties of a humanoid robot, it has a huge potential to lose its stability during its movements. Using an integrated dynamic model leads to control three potential situations a humanoid robot may encounter, namely under-actuation, over-actuation, and fully-actuation. In this paper, by resorting to the so-called Zero-Momentum Point (ZMP) criterion for robots stability, an investigation is carried out on the stability equations and movement patterns in their relevant state space regarding to choosing ZMP as a sustainability criterion, to the end of achieving an appropriate path for robot's center of mass and two legs. In order to apply the concept of the Model-Predictive Control (MPC) based walking pattern, the ZMP state space equations are distributed along the horizon length, besides defining a specific cost function, which covers control input and ZMP path. Some linear constraints are applied to ZMP implementation and robot steps, which leads to optimize the cost function. This procedure is followed by evaluating how the weight of different parts of the cost function influences its performance. Implementation and simulation in MATLAB, Python, and ADAMS estimates and verifies the MPC performance.},

A humanoid is an unstable robotic mechanical system and the main and primary task of each humanoid is to maintain its balance. Moreover, NAO humanoid robot has 25 degrees-of-freedom with brushless DC actuators. The main challenges in the context of balancing of NAO humanoid are the high complexity of the robot and applying joint torque control approaches for NAO humanoid which is a position controlled robot. In this paper, for recovery and prediction the robot from external push, as the main contribution, the virtual leg model is proposed. The control objective is absorbing the external push and then recover the robot to its original configuration. PD controller is used to achieve the control objective. The performance and usage of these strategies and the model is validated by Webots. For each case study, an impulsive force is applied to NAO's torso with various magnitudes. The performance and validation of the proposed push recovery schemes are verified in the simulation. Moreover, the same results are obtained from the practical implementation of these strategies on NAO H25 humanoid robot.},

It is, however, challenging for swarm algorithms to offer scalability and efficiency, while preserving mathematical insights into the exhibited behavior. A new decentralized search method (called Bayes-Swarm), founded on batch Bayesian Optimization (BO) principles, is presented here to address these challenges. Unlike swarm heuristics approaches, Bayes-Swarm decouples the knowledge generation and task planning process, thus preserving insights into the emergent behavior. Key contributions lie in: 1) modeling knowledge extraction over trajectories, unlike in BO; 2) time-adaptively balancing exploration/exploitation and using an efficient local penalization approach to account for potential interactions among different robots' planned samples; and 3) presenting an asynchronous implementation of the algorithm. This algorithm is tested on case studies with bimodal and highly multimodal signal distributions. Up to 76 times better efficiency is demonstrated compared to an exhaustive search baseline. The benefits of exploitation/exploration balancing, asynchronous planning, and local penalization, and scalability with swarm size, are also demonstrated.},

@inproceedings{Bahdanau2017,
abstract = {We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a critic network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an actor network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.},

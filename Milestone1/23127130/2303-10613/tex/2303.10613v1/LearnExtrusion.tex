%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
%\vskip -0.23cm
Reverse engineering CAD models from raw geometry is a classic but strenuous research problem. 
%3D reverse engineering is one of the most sought-after geometric modeling technologies that has been widely recognized as a crucial step in many applications. 
Previous learning-based methods rely heavily on labels due to the supervised design patterns or reconstruct CAD shapes that are not easily editable. 
In this work, we introduce \emph{SECAD-Net}, an end-to-end neural network aimed at reconstructing compact and easy-to-edit CAD models in a self-supervised manner. 
Drawing inspiration from the modeling language that is most commonly used in modern CAD software, we propose to learn 2D sketches and 3D extrusion parameters from raw shapes, from which a set of extrusion cylinders can be generated by extruding each sketch from a 2D plane into a 3D body. %most common CAD modeling operations used  
By incorporating the Boolean operation (\ie, union), these cylinders can be combined to closely approximate the target geometry. 
We advocate the use of implicit fields for sketch representation, which allows for creating CAD variations by interpolating latent codes in the sketch latent space.
Extensive experiments on both ABC and Fusion 360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and show superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives including the closely related method for supervised CAD reconstruction. 
We further apply our approach to CAD editing and single-view CAD reconstruction. 
Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/BunnySoCrazy/SECAD-Net}.

% The code will be released to facilitate future research. %upon acceptance.

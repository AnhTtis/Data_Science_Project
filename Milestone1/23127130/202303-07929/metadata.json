    "abstract": "Naked eye recognition of age is usually based on comparison with the age of\nothers. However, this idea is ignored by computer tasks because it is difficult\nto obtain representative contrast images of each age. Inspired by the transfer\nlearning, we designed the Delta Age AdaIN (DAA) operation to obtain the feature\ndifference with each age, which obtains the style map of each age through the\nlearned values representing the mean and standard deviation. We let the input\nof transfer learning as the binary code of age natural number to obtain\ncontinuous age feature information. The learned two groups of values in Binary\ncode mapping are corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the\ncomparison ages. In summary, our method consists of four parts: FaceEncoder,\nDAA operation, Binary code mapping, and AgeDecoder modules. After getting the\ndelta age via AgeDecoder, we take the average value of all comparison ages and\ndelta ages as the predicted age. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our\nmethod achieves better performance with fewer parameters on multiple facial age\ndatasets.",

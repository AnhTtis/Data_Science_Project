abstract={Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Quantum systems produce atypical patterns that classical systems are thought not to produce efficiently, so it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that could enable machine learning that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent work has produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are still considerable.},

abstract={Neural networks enjoy widespread success in both research and industry and, with the advent of quantum technology, it is a crucial challenge to design quantum neural networks for fully quantum learning tasks. Here we propose a truly quantum analogue of classical neurons, which form quantum feedforward neural networks capable of universal quantum computation. We describe the efficient training of these networks using the fidelity as a cost function, providing both classical and efficient quantum implementations. Our method allows for fast optimisation with reduced memory requirements: the number of qudits required scales with only the width, allowing deep-network optimisation. We benchmark our proposal for the quantum task of learning an unknown unitary and find remarkable generalisation behaviour and a striking robustness to noisy training data.},

A logical input state is expressed as a superposition state (a wave packet) of molecular states, which is initially prepared by a designed femtosecond laser pulse. The free propagation of the wave packet for a specified time interval leads to the specified change in the relative phases among the molecular basis states, which corresponds to a computational result. The computational results are retrieved by means of quantum interferometry. Numerical tests are implemented in the vibrational states of the B state of I2 employing controlled-NOT gate, and 2 and 3qubits Fourier transforms. All the steps involved in the computational scheme, i.e., the initial preparation, gate operation, and detection steps, are achieved with extremely high precision.}",

abstract = {Multi-electron dynamics in atoms and molecules very often occur on sub- to few-femtosecond time scales. The available intensities of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulses have previously allowed the time-resolved investigation of two-photon, two-electron interactions. Here we study double and triple ionization of argon atoms involving the absorption of up to five XUV photons using a pair of intense attosecond pulse trains (APTs). By varying the time delay between the two APTs with attosecond precision and the spatial overlap with nanometer precision, we obtain information on complex nonlinear multi-photon ionization pathways. Our experimental and numerical results show that Ar2$+$ is predominantly formed by a sequential two-photon process, whereas the delay dependence of the Ar3$+$ ion yield exhibits clear signatures of the involvement of a simultaneous two-photon absorption process. Our experiment suggests that it is possible to investigate multi-electron dynamics using attosecond pulses for both pumping and probing the dynamics.},

abstract={Tunneling is one of the most fundamental and ubiquitous processes in the quantum world. The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel through a potential barrier has sparked a long-standing debate since the early days of quantum mechanics. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel scheme to accurately determine the tunneling time of an electron. In this scheme, a weak laser field is used to streak the tunneling current produced by a strong elliptically polarized laser field in an attoclock configuration, allowing us to retrieve the tunneling ionization time relative to the field maximum with a precision of a few attoseconds. This overcomes the difficulties in previous attoclock measurements wherein the Coulomb effect on the photoelectron momentum distribution has to be removed with theoretical models and it requires accurate information of the driving laser fields. We demonstrate that the tunneling time of an electron from an atom is close to zero within our experimental accuracy. Our study represents a straightforward approach toward attosecond time-resolved imaging of electron motion in atoms and molecules.},

abstract={Electron dynamics in water are of fundamental importance for a broad range of phenomena1--3, but their real-time study faces numerous conceptual and methodological challenges4--6. Here we introduce attosecond size-resolved cluster spectroscopy and build up a molecular-level understanding of the attosecond electron dynamics in water. We measure the effect that the addition of single water molecules has on the photoionization time delays7--9 of water clusters. We find a continuous increase of the delay for clusters containing up to four to five molecules and little change towards larger clusters. We show that these delays are proportional to the spatial extension of the created electron hole, which first increases with cluster size and then partially localizes through the onset of structural disorder that is characteristic of large clusters and bulk liquid water. These results indicate a previously unknown sensitivity of photoionization delays to electron-hole delocalization and indicate a direct link between electronic structure and attosecond photoionization dynamics. Our results offer new perspectives for studying electron-hole delocalization and its attosecond dynamics.},

abstract={Attosecond chronoscopy is central to the understanding of ultrafast electron dynamics in matter from gas to the condensed phase with attosecond temporal resolution. It has, however, not yet been possible to determine the timing of individual partial waves, and steering their contribution has been a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a polarization-skewed attosecond chronoscopy serving as a partial wave meter to reveal the role of each partial wave from the angle-resolved photoionization phase shifts in rare gas atoms. We steer the relative ratio between different partial waves and realize a magnetic-sublevel-resolved atomic phase shift measurement. Our experimental observations are well supported by time-dependent R-matrix numerical simulations and analytical soft-photon approximation analysis. The symmetry-resolved, partial-wave analysis identifies the transition rate and phase shift property in the attosecond photoelectron emission dynamics. Our findings provide critical insights into the ubiquitous attosecond optical timer and the underlying attosecond photoionization dynamics.},

abstract={Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data.},

pages={501-506},
abstract={Deep neural networks with applications from computer vision to medical diagnosis1--5 are commonly implemented using clock-based processors6--14, in which computation speed is mainly limited by the clock frequency and the memory access time. In the optical domain, despite advances in photonic computation15--17, the lack of scalable on-chip optical non-linearity and the loss of photonic devices limit the scalability of optical deep networks. Here we report an integrated end-to-end photonic deep neural network (PDNN) that performs sub-nanosecond image classification through direct processing of the optical waves impinging on the on-chip pixel array as they propagate through layers of neurons. In each neuron, linear computation is performed optically and the non-linear activation function is realized opto-electronically, allowing a classification time of under 570{\thinspace}ps, which is comparable with a single clock cycle of state-of-the-art digital platforms. A uniformly distributed supply light provides the same per-neuron optical output range, allowing scalability to large-scale PDNNs. Two-class and four-class classification of handwritten letters with accuracies higher than 93.8{\%} and 89.8{\%}, respectively, is demonstrated. Direct, clock-less processing of optical data eliminates analogue-to-digital conversion and the requirement for a large memory module, allowing faster and more energy efficient neural networks for the next generations of deep learning systems.},

abstract = {In spectroscopy, samples placed between a steady light source and a detector are characterized based on the relative intensities of light absorbed at different frequencies. Temporal behavior—the relaxation of a photoexcited state—can be indirectly inferred from the absorption band shapes. The advent of ultrafast laser technology has enabled increasingly sophisticated measurements directly in the time domain. Ott et al. (p. 716; see the Perspective by Lin and Chu) present an analytical framework to account for asymmetric band shapes, termed Fano profiles, on the basis of a phase shift in the temporal dipole response. An analytical framework bolstered by attosecond spectroscopy conveys a clear understanding of asymmetric spectral line shapes. [Also see Perspective by Lin and Chu] Symmetric Lorentzian and asymmetric Fano line shapes are fundamental spectroscopic signatures that quantify the structural and dynamical properties of nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids. This study introduces a universal temporal-phase formalism, mapping the Fano asymmetry parameter q to a phase ϕ of the time-dependent dipole response function. The formalism is confirmed experimentally by laser-transforming Fano absorption lines of autoionizing helium into Lorentzian lines after attosecond-pulsed excitation. We also demonstrate the inverse, the transformation of a naturally Lorentzian line into a Fano profile. A further application of this formalism uses quantum-phase control to amplify extreme-ultraviolet light resonantly interacting with He atoms. The quantum phase of excited states and its response to interactions can thus be extracted from line-shape analysis, with applications in many branches of spectroscopy.}}

Abstract = {The concerted motion of two or more bound electrons governs atomic(1)
   and molecular(2,3) non-equilibrium processes including chemical
   reactions, and hence there is much interest in developing a detailed
   understanding of such electron dynamics in the quantum regime. However,
   there is no exact solution for the quantum three-body problem, and as a
   result even the minimal system of two active electrons and a nucleus is
   analytically intractable(4). This makes experimental measurements of the
   dynamics of two bound and correlated electrons, as found in the helium
   atom, an attractive prospect. However, although the motion of single
   active electrons and holes has been observed with attosecond time
   resolution(5-7), comparable experiments on two-electron motion have so
   far remained out of reach. Here we show that a correlated two-electron
   wave packet can be reconstructed from a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beat
   among low-lying doubly excited states in helium. The beat appears in
   attosecond transient-absorption spectra(5,7-9) measured with
   unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and in the presence of an
   intensity-tunable visible laser field. We tune the coupling(10-12)
   between the two low-lying quantum states by adjusting the visible laser
   intensity, and use the Fano resonance as a phase-sensitive quantum
   interferometer(13) to achieve coherent control of the two correlated
   electrons. Given the excellent agreement with
   large-scalequantum-mechanical calculations for the helium atom, we
   anticipate that multidimensional spectroscopy experiments of the type we
   report here will provide benchmark data for testing fundamental few-body
   quantum dynamics theory in more complex systems. They might also provide
   a route to the site-specific measurement and control of metastable
   electronic transition states that are at the heart of fundamental
   chemical reactions.},

abstract={Recently, several quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed that may offer quantum speed-ups over their classical counterparts. Most of these algorithms are either heuristic or assume that data can be accessed quantum-mechanically, making it unclear whether a quantum advantage can be proven without resorting to strong assumptions. Here we construct a classification problem with which we can rigorously show that heuristic quantum kernel methods can provide an end-to-end quantum speed-up with only classical access to data. To prove the quantum speed-up, we construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Furthermore, we construct a family of parameterized unitary circuits, which can be efficiently implemented on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and use them to map the data samples to a quantum feature space and estimate the kernel entries. The resulting quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics.},

abstract = {Quantum kernels are considered as potential resources to illustrate benefits of quantum computing in machine learning. Considering the impact of hyperparameters on the performance of a classical machine learning model, it is imperative to identify promising hyperparameters using quantum kernel methods in order to achieve quantum advantages. In this work, we analyse and classify sentiments of textual data using a new quantum kernel based on linear and full entangled circuits as hyperparameters for controlling the correlation among words. We also find that the use of linear and full entanglement further controls the expressivity of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM). In addition, we also compare the efficiency of the proposed circuit with other quantum circuits and classical machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed fully entangled circuit outperforms all other fully or linearly entangled circuits in addition to classical algorithms for most of the features. In fact, as the feature increases the efficiency of our proposed fully entangled model also increases significantly.}

    "abstract": "Let a complex algebraic reductive group $\\bf G$ act on a complex algebraic manifold $\\bf X$. For a $\\bf G$-invariant subvariety $Ξ$ of the nilpotent cone $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathfrak{g}^*)\\subset \\mathfrak{g}^*$ we define a notion of $Ξ$-symplectic complexity of $\\bf X$. This notion generalizes the notion of complexity defined in [Vin86]. We prove several properties of this notion, and relate it to the notion of $Ξ$-complexity defined in [AG] motivated by its relation with representation theory.",

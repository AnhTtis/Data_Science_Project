    "abstract": "Like many other thermally isolated systems performing an adiabatic driving process, the quantum Ising chain presents an ill-defined decorrelation time. On the other hand, Kibble-Zurek mechanism uses a heuristic relaxation time to achieve its famous scaling. In previous work, a successful connection between this relaxation time and the upper bound of the oscillatory decorrelation time was made in the context of weak drivings. The problem however of having a well-defined decorrelation time, derived from first principles, that describes Kibble-Zurek mechanism is still open. A solution to this conundrum is proposed here by measuring the work using the time-averaged relaxation function of the system. This quantity offers a new and well-defined decorrelation time for thermally isolated systems by turning them similarly into systems performing an isothermal process. I recover with this the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the context of the finite-time and weak drivings, and new features in the context of slowly-varying processes.",

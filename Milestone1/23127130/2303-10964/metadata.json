    "abstract": "The data-driven Marchenko method is able to redatum wavefields to arbitrary locations in the subsurface, and can, therefore, be used to isolate zones of specific interest. This creates a new reflection response of the target zone without interference from over- or underburden reflectors. Consequently, the method is well suited to obtain a clear response of a subsurface reservoir, which can be advantageous in time-lapse studies. The clean isolated responses of a baseline and monitor survey can be more effectively compared, hence the retrieval of time-lapse characteristics is improved. This research aims to apply Marchenko-based isolation to a time-lapse marine dataset of the Troll field in Norway in order to acquire an unobstructed image of the primary reflections, and retrieve small time-lapse traveltime difference in the reservoir. It is found that the method not only isolates the primary reflections but can also recover internal multiples outside the recording time. Both the primaries and the multiples can then be utilised to find time-lapse traveltime differences. More accurate ways of time-lapse monitoring will allow for a better understanding of dynamic processes in the subsurface, such as observing saturation and pressure changes in a reservoir or monitoring underground storage of hydrogen and CO2.",

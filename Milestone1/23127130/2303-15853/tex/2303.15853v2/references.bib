@article{Bresolin09a,
	Abstract = {We have obtained deep multiobject optical spectra of 49 H II regions in the outer disk of the spiral galaxy M83 (=NGC 5236) with the FORS2 spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. The targets span the range in galactocentric distance between 0.64 and 2.64 times the R 25 isophotal radius (5.4-22.3 kpc), and 31 of them are located at R > R 25, thus belonging to the extreme outer disk of the galaxy, populated by UV complexes revealed recently by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite. In order to derive the nebular chemical abundances, we apply several diagnostics of the oxygen abundance, including R 23, [N II]/[O II], and the [O III] lambda4363 auroral line, which was detected in four H II regions. We find that, while inward of the optical edge the O/H ratio follows the radial gradient known from previous investigations, the outer abundance trend flattens out to an approximately constant value. The latter varies, according to the adopted diagnostic, between 12 + log(O/H) = 8.2 and 12 + log(O/H) = 8.6 (i.e., from approximately 1/3 of the solar oxygen abundance to nearly the solar value). An abrupt discontinuity in the radial oxygen abundance trend is also detected near the optical edge of the disk. These results are tentatively linked to the flat gas surface density in the outskirts of the galaxy, the relatively unevolved state of the extended disk of M83, and the redistribution of chemically enriched gas following a past galaxy encounter.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under program 079.B-0438.},

The galaxies in our sample have extended H I disks and/or interaction-related H I features that extend well beyond their primary stellar components. We report oxygen abundance gradients out to 2.5 times the optical radius for these galaxies which span a range of morphologies and masses. We analyze the underlying stellar and neutral H I gas distributions in the vicinity of the H II regions to understand the physical processes that give rise to the observed metal distributions in galaxies.

@article{Kubryk13a,
	Abstract = {We study radial migration and chemical evolution in a bar-dominated disc galaxy, by analysing the results of a fully self-consistent, high-resolution N-body+smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. We find different behaviours for gas and star particles. Gas within corotation is driven in the central regions by the bar, where it forms a pseudo-bulge (discy-bulge), but it undergoes negligible radial displacement outside the bar region. Stars undergo substantial radial migration at all times, caused first by transient spiral arms and later by the bar. Despite the important amount of radial migration occurring in our model, its impact on the chemical properties is limited. The reason is the relatively flat abundance profile, due to the rapid early evolution of the whole disc. We show that the implications of radial migration on chemical evolution can be studied to a good accuracy by post-processing the results of the N-body+SPH calculation with a simple chemical evolution model having detailed chemistry and a parametrized description of radial migration. We find that radial migration impacts on chemical evolution both directly (by moving around the long-lived agents of nucleosynthesis, like e.g. SNIa or asymptotic giant branch stars, and thus altering the abundance profiles of the gas) and indirectly (by moving around the long-lived tracers of chemical evolution and thus affecting stellar metallicity profiles, local age-metallicity relations and metallicity distributions of stars, etc.).},

@article{de-Avillez02a,
	Abstract = {We study the mixing of chemical species in the interstellar medium (ISM). Recent observations suggest that the distribution of species such as deuterium in the ISM may be far from homogeneous. This raises the question of how long it takes for inhomogeneities to be erased in the ISM, and how this depends on the length scale of the inhomogeneities. We added a tracer field to the three-dimensional, supernova-driven ISM model of de Avillez (2000) to study mixing and dispersal in kiloparsec-scale simulations of the ISM with different supernova rates and different inhomogeneity length scales. We find several surprising results. Classical mixing length theory fails to predict the very weak dependence of mixing time on length scale that we find on scales of 25-500 pc. Derived diffusion coefficients increase exponentially with time, rather than remaining constant. The variance of composition declines exponentially, with a time constant of tens of megayears, so that large differences fade faster than small ones. The time constant depends on the inverse square root of the supernova rate. One major reason for these results is that even with numerical diffusion exceeding physical values, gas does not mix quickly between hot and cold regions.},

	Abstract = {Metal production in galaxies traces star formation, and is highly concentrated towards the centres of galactic discs. This suggests that galaxies should have inhomogeneous metal distributions with strong radial gradients, but observations of present-day galaxies show only shallow gradients with little azimuthal variation, implying the existence of a redistribution mechanism. We study the role of gravitational instability-driven turbulence as a mixing mechanism by simulating an isolated galactic disc at high resolution, including metal fields treated as passive scalars. Since any cylindrical field can be decomposed into a sum of Fourier-Bessel basis functions, we set up initial metal fields characterized by these functions and study how different modes mix. We find both shear and turbulence contribute to mixing, but the mixing strongly depends on the symmetries of the mode. Non-axisymmetric modes have decay times smaller than the galactic orbital period because shear winds them up to small spatial scales, where they are erased by turbulence. The decay time-scales for axisymmetric modes are much greater, though for all but the largest scale inhomogeneities the mixing time-scale is still short enough to erase chemical inhomogeneities over cosmological times. These different time-scales provide an explanation for why galaxies retain metallicity gradients while there is almost no variation at a fixed radius. Moreover, the comparatively long time-scales required for mixing axisymmetric modes may explain the greater diversity of metallicity gradients observed in high redshift galaxies as compared to local ones: these systems have not yet reached equilibrium between metal production and diffusion.},

    "abstract": "We present the idea of a Banach algebra in n-Banach space and give some examples. The existence of an identity element in a n-Banach algebra is being discussed. We explain a set-theoretic property of invertible and non-invertible elements in a n-Banach algebra and define topological divisor of zero in n-Banach algebra. Finally, we introduce the notion of a complex homomorphism in a n-Banach algebra and derive Gleason, Kahane, Zelazko type theorem with the help of complex b-homomorphism in the case of n-Banach algebra.",

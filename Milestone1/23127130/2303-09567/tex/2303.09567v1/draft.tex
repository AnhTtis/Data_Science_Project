In this work we continue the study initiated in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw} by investigating AdS string stars in \ads{3} with NS-NS flux or with mixed RR and NS-NS fluxes. We study the solutions numerically, and also find the leading curvature correction to the (\ads{3}) Hagedorn temperature.

% We find that for finite RR flux, the profile of the string star is similar to that of higher-dimensional AdS string stars, with a maximal size of $\sqrt{l_s l_{ads}}$. However, for small RR flux and in particular for the pure NS-NS system, the behavior is significantly different. The back-reacted Kalb-Ramond field appears together with the metric at leading order, and the size of the profile reaches the AdS curvature scale.

% In three dimensional flat space no black hole/string correspondence can exist, as there are no Schwarzschild solutions. Nevertheless, we propose a hypothetical \ads{3} version of the correspondence principle, in which the BTZ black hole with a spatial winding condensate is continuously connected to thermal \ads{3} with temporal winding condensate, or an \ads{3} string star.

% Additionally, we find ``winding-string gas'' solutions for confining holographic theories such as the Witten model and determine the subleading correction to their Hagedorn temperature. Somewhat similar to the \ads{3} case, we speculate that these connect the deconfined saddle (a black brane) to the confined phase. We speculate that this saddle turns dominant (for some range of temperatures) once the geometry becomes strongly curved, which happens in the limit the field theory becomes weakly coupled over a large range of temperatures.

\section{Introduction}
In string theory, black holes are solutions of the low energy effective action, usually valid only for horizon size larger than the string scale $r_h \gg l_s$ (and small string coupling $g_s$). What is the correct description of a black hole microstate when it is adiabatically shrunk to the string scale?
The black hole/string transition or the correspondence principle \cite{Veneziano:1986zf,Susskind:1993ws,Horowitz:1996nw} is the idea that such stringy black holes are indistinguishable from high energy stringy bound states. In \cite{Horowitz:1997jc} a canonical ensemble version of this idea was explored (see also \cite{Damour:1999aw,Khuri:1999ez,Kutasov:2005rr,Giveon:2005jv,Chen:2021emg,Brustein:2021cza,Chen:2021dsw,Balthazar:2022szl,Bedroya:2022twb,Balthazar:2022hno}). As a thermodynamic phase of quantum gravity, the Euclidean black hole is a saddle of the string theory thermal partition on asymptotically $R^d \times S^1$.\footnote{Assuming the asymptotic circumference of the circle can be consistently frozen at the value $\beta$ \cite{Atick:1988si}.}
In terms of the temperature, this saddle is reliable for $\beta \gg l_s$. Slightly below the Hagedorn temperature of string theory $\beta_H$, 
Horowitz and Polchinski found 
\cite{Horowitz:1997jc} a new saddle, a condensate of strings winding around the thermal $S^1$ bound by gravitational interactions. We term such a saddle a ``string star'', imagining it describes a gravitational bound state of hot strings.
The black hole and the string star saddle are reliable at different regimes of temperatures, but a crude extrapolation to intermediate temperatures shows a qualitative agreement of their thermodynamic properties. The black hole/string transition can now be phrased as a precise conjecture: there exists a line of string theory backgrounds (well-defined only for small $g_s$) connecting the Euclidean black hole to the string star, and eventually (at the Hagedorn temperature $\beta=\beta_H$) to thermal $R^d\times S^1$. Technically, this line of saddles can be interpreted as a line of worldsheet CFTs connecting the Euclidean black hole to $R^d\times S^1$ through winding condensates.
In \cite{Chen:2021dsw} an argument was presented against the existence of such a line for $d>2$ type II string theory, via a worldsheet index argument. A refined version of the conjecture thus allows for the possibility of phase transitions along the line.


In \cite{Urbach:2022xzw} this discussion was extended to anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces, by studying the properties of \ads{d+1} string stars for $d>2$. An AdS string star is a thermal winding condensate in the middle of thermal \ads{d+1}. The saddle is reliable near the AdS Hagedorn temperature $\beta_c$, $\beta-\beta_c \ll \beta_c$. As the temperature increases the solution's size grows, with a maximal size of $L \sim \sqrt{l_{ads} l_s}$. Its amplitude and free energy decrease to zero at the Hagedorn temperature, where it merges with thermal \ads{d+1}. At lower temperatures, the solution size becomes small $L\sim l_s$, at which point a correspondence principle to Euclidean AdS black holes can be drawn similar to flat space. That is, a conjectured line of string theory backgrounds connecting the Euclidean AdS black hole solution and thermal AdS at the Hagedorn temperature via thermal winding-strings condensate. Unlike flat space, string theory on \ads{d+1} also has a holographic dual in terms of $d$-dimensional CFT. The black hole/string transition in terms of the holographic CFT would be a conjectured line of large $N$ saddles in the thermal partition function on $S^{d-1}$, connecting the deconfined phase to the confined phase at the Hagedorn temperature (defined by the $N=\infty$ spectrum \cite{Aharony:2003sx,Harmark:2021qma}) \cite{Sundborg:1999ue,Aharony:2003sx,Alvarez-Gaume:2005dvb}.

In this work, we continue our study of AdS string stars. The first extension is the study of \ads{3} string stars ($d=2$), presented in section \ref{sec:gen_prop_ads3}. This is an interesting test for the correspondence principle that is inherently different from the flat space case. The reason is that both black holes and string stars do not exist in asymptotically flat $R^2 \times S^1_\beta$. However, in \ads{3} black hole solutions do exist and are known by the name BTZ \cite{Banados:1992wn}. Similarly, string star solutions don't exist on flat $R^2\times S^1_\beta$. But in thermal \ads{3} we find that the \ads{3} curvature stabilizes the potential for the winding condensate. As a result, thermal \ads{3} allows for reliable string star solutions close to the Hagedorn temperature.
This is an interesting check that such a correspondence is possible for a more general setting, and may exist whenever black holes exist in a weakly coupled string theory.
However, contrary to higher dimensional small AdS black holes, a BTZ with small horizon radius $r_h \ll l_{ads}$ has very low temperature $\beta \gg l_{ads} \gg \beta_c$. As the BTZ gets smaller, its temperature continues to decrease further away from the Hagedorn temperature, and a simple black hole/string transition between them is impossible.

It is still possible to conjecture a different kind of correspondence.
Below temperature $\beta_c' = 4\pi^2 l_{ads}^2/\beta_c$ the BTZ solution has a tachyonic instability from strings winding the angular circle \cite{Berkooz:2007fe,Lin:2007gi,Rangamani:2007fz}. This is exactly the Hagedorn instability of thermal \ads{3}, after switching the two asymptotic circles. The natural candidate for a ``BTZ/string transition'' in \ads{3} would be conjectured line of saddles connecting the BTZ at $\beta_c'$ to thermal \ads{3} at $\beta_c$, with winding condensates at each end of the line \cite{Jafferis:2021ywg,Halder:2022ykw}. See figure \ref{fig:ads3_phase_diagram}. Notice that unlike at higher dimensions, in \ads{3} there exists a large temperature difference between the regimes of validity of the two saddles $\beta_c \ll \beta_c'$. As a result, no qualitative match can be extrapolated between the \ads{3} string star and small BTZs as a sanity check. We admit that the evidence for such a line is much weaker compared to higher dimensions.


Another interesting feature of \ads{3} string stars is the possibility in \ads{3} to turn on NS-NS flux \cite{Maldacena:1997re,Giveon:1998ns,Kutasov:1999xu,David:2002wn,Cho:2018nfn}. As the string is charged under the Kalb-Ramond field, the winding string field $\chi(x)$ is electrically charged in the effective two-dimensional description. Non-zero flux changes the solution at leading order. We study the properties of \ads{3} string stars for mixed RR and NS-NS fluxes, and for the pure NS-NS flux. Denoting the fraction of the NS-NS flux by $0\le \lambda \le 1$, the size of the RR flux is proportional to $\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}$. In section \ref{sec:finite_RR} we study string star solutions for finite RR flux. We find that the solutions are similar to those found in higher dimensions \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}. The NS-NS flux only contributes to the effective mass of the winding mode (at leading order in $\alpha'$), and the size of the solution is $L \sim \sqrt{l_s l_{ads}} \cdot (1-\lambda^2)^{-1/4}$. 
In section \ref{sec:small_RR} we study solutions for small RR flux $\sqrt{1-\lambda^2} \sim l_s/l_{ads}$ and for the pure NS-NS system. In this regime, the background NS-NS flux is high enough to (almost) flatten the potential for the winding mode, similar to long strings in \ads{3} with NS-NS flux \cite{Maldacena:1998uz,Seiberg:1999xz}. As a result, the size of the solution increases to the AdS scale. Moreover, 
the back-reacted NS-NS flux from the winding mode now appears at leading order, along with the metric.
Solving for the three fields together gives a new kind of string star solutions.

In section \ref{sec:sub_ads} we also discuss winding string condensates in a family of confining backgrounds which includes the D3 and D4 Witten models \cite{Witten:1998qj}, the Maldacena-Nu\~{n}ez \cite{Maldacena:2000yy} and the Klebanov-Strassler \cite{Klebanov:2000hb} backgrounds. 
These gravitational backgrounds are holographically dual to theories believed to be continuously related (at low energies) to confining field theories on flat space $R^{p+1}$ ($p=2,3$). The thermodynamics of these models was studied using a semiclassical bulk analysis 
\cite{Freedman:2000xb,Gubser:2001ri,Buchel:2001gw,Buchel:2001qi,Gubser:2001eg,Buchel:2001dg,Buchel:2003ah,Aharony:2006da,Aharony:2007vg,Buchel:2007vy,Buchel:2018bzp}.
The confined phase has a ``thermal'' background dual given by analytically continuing the boundary to $R^p\times S^1_\beta$. The deconfined phase has a black-brane dual.
In this work, we find a new saddle with a thermal winding strings condensate on top of the thermal background. The solution is homogeneous parallel to the spatial boundary directions $R^p$, and it is localized to the bulk IR region. We term this saddle a `winding-string gas'.
As before, it is reliable only close to the Hagedorn temperature of the holographic confining string $\beta-\beta_c \ll \beta_c$, and it is highly subdominant. We describe the properties of the solution and find the first correction to the Hagedorn temperature in these models due to the bulk curvature. It is possible to conjecture a black brane/string transition for these models, connecting the black brane saddle to the winding-string gas saddle. The phase diagram for the Witten models is similar to \ads{3}, discussed above. In this case, it is also natural to conjecture that the string winding gas is continuously related to the deconfined phase of pure $3+1$ Yang-Mills. 

Several future directions are possible. The \ads{3} calculation we performed was only at leading order in the winding condensate and at leading order in $\alpha'$. The worldsheet theory in the pure NS-NS case ($\lambda=1$) is known exactly \cite{Giveon:1998ns,Kutasov:1999xu,Maldacena:2000hw}, and it is therefore exciting to find the string star profile exactly in $\alpha'$ \cite{Jafferis:2021ywg,Halder:2022ykw,halder_private}.
Of course, ultimately one would like to find (for the pure NS-NS background) the entire line of worldsheet CFTs interpolating between the thermal \ads{3} and BTZ. At the moment it sounds improbable, as such a deformation away from $\beta - \beta_c \ll \beta_c$ will require the entire string spectrum that couples to the winding mode, and all the orders of their interactions.
Finally, the confining backgrounds solution gives interesting predictions on its holographic dual. It would be interesting to compare these predictions to the weakly coupled regime.

\section{General properties of the \titlemath{\ads{3}} string star} \label{sec:gen_prop_ads3}
\subsection{String stars in the presence of NS-NS fluxes} \label{sec:eft}
We start by describing the low energy effective field theory for the string winding mode in the presence of a general NS-NS background. This is an extension of the EFT for the winding mode together with the metric \cite{Atick:1988si,Horowitz:1997jc,Chen:2021dsw} to cases with non-zero Kalb-Ramond flux $H_3 \ne 0$.

We consider string theory in $D=d+1$ dimensions and a cosmological constant  $\Lambda = -d(d-1)/(2 l_{ads}^2)$, induced from the compactification on the other $9-d$ dimensions. The Euclidean $D=d+1$ dimensional low energy effective action of the massless NS-NS sector (still without winding modes) is \cite{Polchinski:1998rq}
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{NS} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_N} \int d^D x \sqrt{G} e^{-2\Phi}\left(-\mathcal{R}_D + 2\Lambda - 4 \partial_\mu \Phi \partial^\mu \Phi + \frac{1}{12}H_{\mu\nu\lambda}H^{\mu\nu\lambda} + O(\alpha') \right),
\end{equation}
with the $D$ dimensional gravitational constant $G_N \simeq l_s^{d-1} g^2_s$ ($g_s$ is the $D$ dimensional string coupling), and $H_{\mu\nu\lambda} = \partial_\mu B_{\nu\lambda} + \partial_\nu B_{\mu\lambda} + \partial_\lambda B_{\mu\nu}$ is the Kalb-Ramond field strength. We denote by $t\sim t+1$ a compact direction on which we will reduce the theory, and the rest of the directions by $x^i$, $i=1,...,d$. We will assume all the fields are invariant to $t$ translations. The metric and the Kalb-Ramond field decompose into
\begin{equation}\label{eq:g_decomp}
	G_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j + a_i dx^i dt + G_{tt} dt^2
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:B_A}
	B_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu = B_{ij} dx^i \wedge dx^j + A_i dt \wedge dx^i.
\end{equation}
We denote $F=dA$, and $G_{tt}=g_{tt} e^{2\varphi}$. We will consider a small deformation of a background solution with some $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $a_i = 0$, and assume that the leading deformation of it is in $\varphi$.
As a result we can set  $\mathcal{R}_D = \mathcal{R}_d - 2\partial_i \varphi \partial^i \varphi$ and $a_i=0$.\footnote{If we would not assume $a_i=0$, this field would mix with $A_i$, which should be important when studying fluctuations of the solution.} 
The obtained $d$-dimensional action is 
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{NS} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_N} \int d^d x\ \text{vol} \ e^{-2\Phi+\varphi}
	\left(-\mathcal{R}_d + 2\Lambda + 2 \partial_i \varphi \partial^i \varphi - 4 \partial_i \Phi \partial^i \Phi + \frac{1}{12}H_{ijk}H^{ijk} + \frac{g^{tt}}{4} F_{ij} F^{ij} + O(\alpha') \right),
\end{equation}
with $\text{vol} = \sqrt{g}\sqrt{g_{tt}}$, $g$ being the $d$-dimensional metric \eqref{eq:g_decomp}.
In the above formula, we suppressed the coupling of $\varphi$ to $F_{ij} F^{ij}$. In terms of the perturbation of $A_i$ this would be a derivative coupling and therefore subleading (see below).

We will now add the action of $\chi$, the string mode that winds once around the temporal circle. The new ingredient compared to \cite{Urbach:2022xzw} is that here we need to describe the coupling of the winding mode to the Kalb-Ramond field. The leading interaction comes from the electric coupling of the fundamental string to the Kalb-Ramond field. 
In our conventions for $A_i$, $\chi$ is electrically charged under the $U(1)$ winding with charge $g=\frac{1}{2\pi \alpha'}$.\footnote{To see this, notice the worldsheet action of the configuration $t(\sigma,\tau) = \frac{\sigma}{2\pi}, x^i(\sigma,\tau)=x^i(\tau)$ is
\begin{equation}
	S_B = \frac{i}{2\pi \alpha'} \int d\tau \dot x^i(\tau) B_{ti}(x^i).
\end{equation}}
Further defining $\phi_d = \Phi - \frac{1}{2} \varphi$, all the terms that include $\chi$ up to $O(\alpha')$ are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pre_action_d}
\begin{split}
	I_\chi &= \frac{1}{16\pi G_N} \int d^d x \ \text{vol} \  e^{-2\phi_d}
	\Bigg(
	|D\chi|^2 \\
	& + m^2\left(R(x)e^{\varphi(x)}\right)|\chi|^2 + \alpha'^{-1}\cdot(\text{Higher $\chi$ interactions})\\
	& 
	+ \left(g_1 \mathcal{R}_d  + g_2 \frac{g^{tt}}{2} F_{ij} F^{ij} + \frac{g_3}{12}H_{ijk}H^{ijk}\right)|\chi|^2 + O(|\chi|^4)+O(\alpha') \Bigg),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $R(x) \equiv \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{g_{tt}}$, $D_j = \partial_j - i g A_j$, and $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$ are some unknown $O(1)$ couplings.
For heterotic and type II string theories the winding mode mass and the (flat space) Hagedorn temperature $R_H=\frac{1}{2\pi}\beta_H$ are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:m2_def}
\begin{split}
	m^2_\text{Heterotic}(R) = \frac{R^2}{\alpha'^2}+\frac{1}{4R^2}
	-\frac{R^2_H}{\alpha'^2}-\frac{1}{4R^2_H}, \qquad & R_H^\text{Heterotic}/l_s = 1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\\
	m^2_\text{Type II}(R) = \frac{R^2-R^2_H}{\alpha'^2},\qquad &R_H^\text{Type II}/l_s = \sqrt{2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In these notations, we also define the effective mass for the winding mode as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:m_eff}
	m^2_\text{eff}(x) = m^2(x) + g^2 A_i A^i.
\end{equation}

In \eqref{eq:pre_action_d} we added the first winding mode, but neglected the rest of the higher winding modes and the rest of the massive string spectrum. This is consistent only when the mass of the winding mode is parametrically below the string scale $m^2_\text{eff} \ll \alpha'^{-1}$. In practice, we need to tune the temperature of the background to be close to the Hagedorn temperature $R-R_H \ll R_H$. The second line of \eqref{eq:pre_action_d} includes all the $\alpha'^{-1}$ terms. After fine-tuning the quadratic mass term to be small, we still have higher order terms starting at $\alpha'^{-1}|\chi|^4$. We will neglect these terms below by further assuming the profile of the winding mode is parametrically small $|\chi|\ll 1$. The field $\varphi$ couples to $\chi$ at leading order. Further assuming small back-reaction $|\varphi| \ll 1$ allows us to take only the leading $\alpha^{-1} \varphi |\chi|^2$ coupling coming from the mass term. Note that as we previously neglected the $|\chi|^4$ term, consistency further requires $|\varphi| \ll |\chi|^2$.
In the next section, we will further assume that the back-reaction of $A_i$ is small, and will expand it too to linear order.

In the third line of \eqref{eq:pre_action_d} we listed the first $\alpha'^0$ terms in the action. These correct the mass term by a curvature scale (which also controls the Kalb-Ramond flux) amount $\Delta m^2 \sim l_{curv}^{-2}$.\footnote{One can similarity write $\alpha'^0$ terms that correct the $\varphi |\chi|^2$ coupling, which are also subleading.} These terms are naively leading whenever the size of the winding mode profile is comparable to the curvature scale. Indeed some of the solutions we will find below won't satisfy this condition. Nevertheless, we will argue that these terms are negligible for these cases.
Finally, we neglected all the $O(\alpha')$ terms for $\chi$ in \eqref{eq:pre_action_d}. This is justified as long as the size of the solution $L$ is much larger than the string scale $L\gg l_s$.

We assumed above that $a_i=0$ and that the leading back-reaction from $\chi$ is only to $G_{tt}$ through $\varphi$.
We will now further assume that the background solution for the dilaton is $\phi_d = 0$ (or a constant that can be swallowed into $G_N$), with neglected back-reaction.\footnote{This assumption can be relaxed to a general (non-constant) dilaton background. In that case, the background dilaton will change the equation of motion whenever the size of the winding profile is comparable to the size of the dilaton profile. The back reaction of the dilaton is however always subleading, just like the spatial metric $g_{ij}$.} 
The explanation for both is that the dilaton and the spatial metric couple to $\chi$ (at leading order) by multiplying its kinetic term. This interaction is subleading compared to the $\alpha^{-1} \varphi |\chi|^2$ coupling by the assumptions above. Below we will see that unlike the dilaton and the metric, the back-reaction of the Kalb-Ramond field does couple (for non-zero background flux) to $\chi$ at the same (leading) order as $\varphi$.

After taking into account the above approximations and setting $\phi_d=0$ we find the total $d$-dimensional effective action
\begin{equation}\label{eq:action_d}
\begin{split}
	I_d &= I_\text{NS}+I_\chi\\
	& = \frac{1}{16\pi G_N} \int d^d x \ \text{vol} \  \Bigg(-\mathcal{R}_d + 2\Lambda + \frac{1}{12}H_{ijk}H^{ijk}
	% - 4 \partial_i \phi_d \partial^i \phi_d
	  \\
	& \qquad\qquad\qquad
	+\partial_i \varphi \partial^i \varphi   + \frac{g^{tt}}{4} F_{ij} F^{ij}
	+|D\chi|^2 + \left(m^2(R) + R\partial_R m^2(R)\  \varphi \right)|\chi|^2 \Bigg).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The corresponding equations of motion for $\chi$, $\varphi$ and $A_i$ respectively
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eqs_general}
\begin{split}
	\frac{1}{\text{vol}} \,  \partial_i \left(\text{vol} \left(\partial^i -i g A^i\right)\chi\right) - \left(m^2 + R\partial_R m^2 \varphi + i g A^j \left(\partial_j-i g A_j\right) \right) \chi & = 0,\\
	\frac{1}{\text{vol}} \partial_i \left(\text{vol} \,  \partial^i\varphi\right) - \frac{1}{2} R\partial_R m^2 |\chi|^2 &=0,\\
	\frac{1}{\text{vol}} \partial_i \left(\text{vol} \, g^{tt} \, F^{ij}\right) - i g \left(\chi^* \partial^j \chi-\chi\partial^j \chi^*\right) - 2g^2 A^j |\chi|^2 &= 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The mixed \titlemath{\ads{3}} background} \label{sec:eom}
In this section, we start the discussion of the \ads{3} string star.
We work in units of $l_{ads}=1$ and $\alpha' \equiv 1/k$ (and $g=\frac{k}{2\pi}$). The set of backgrounds we will consider are Euclidean 10d solutions of type IIB string theory with both NS and RR fluxes, and the geometry of (thermal) $AdS_3\times S^3\times M_4$, where $M_4$ can be a four torus $T^4$ or a $K3$ manifold \cite{Maldacena:1997re,David:2002wn,Cho:2018nfn}.
The thermal \ads{3} component is given by the following background
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mixed_NS_NS_sol}
\begin{split}
	ds^2 &= d\rho^2 + \sinh^2(\rho) d\phi^2 + \beta^2 \cosh^2(\rho) dt^2,\\
	B &= i \beta \lambda \sinh^2(\rho) d\phi \wedge dt,\\
	C &= i \beta \sqrt{1-\lambda^2} \sinh^2(\rho) d\phi \wedge dt,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $t\sim t+1$ and $0\le \lambda\le 1$.\footnote{The quantization of the fluxes (on $S^3$) requires both $\lambda \cdot k$, $\sqrt{1-\lambda^2} \cdot k$ to be integers. In this work, we expand at leading order in the large $k\gg1$ limit, and therefore this quantization is invisible \cite{Maldacena:1997re,Cho:2018nfn}.} The gauge fields $B,C$ also have fluxes from the $S^3$ component, which we omitted.
$\lambda = 0$ is the pure RR solution, for which string stars solutions were studied in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}, and $\lambda=1$ is the pure NS-NS solution. We note that the latter can be studied not only for type IIB but in any closed string theory, and it is also known exactly in $\alpha'$ via an $\text{SL}(2,R)$ WZW worldsheet description \cite{Giveon:1998ns,Kutasov:1999xu,Maldacena:2000hw}.

In these conventions we have the background gauge field \eqref{eq:B_A} is $A_\phi = i \lambda \beta \sinh^2(\rho)$ and $R(\rho) = R_0 \cosh(\rho)$, with $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{2\pi}$.
For convenience, we re-write \eqref{eq:m2_def}, \eqref{eq:m_eff} the winding mode mass, the Hagedorn temperature, and the effective mass
\begin{equation}\label{eq:type_II_m2}
	m^2(\rho) = k^2 \left(R_0^2 \cosh^2(\rho) -R_H^2 \right),\quad R_H^2 = 2/k, \quad R \partial_R m^2 = 2 k^2 R_0^2 \cosh^2(\rho),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:type_II_m_eff}
	m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) = k^2 \left(R_0^2 \left(\cosh^2(\rho) - \lambda^2 \sinh^2(\rho) \right) -R_H^2\right).
\end{equation}

We now turn back to our two-dimensional EFT \eqref{eq:action_d}. After gauge-fixing $A_\rho=0$, the general deviation from the background gauge field value \eqref{eq:mixed_NS_NS_sol} can be labeled by a scalar $a(x)$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:a_def}
	A_\phi = i \beta \left(\lambda \ \sinh^2(\rho) + a(\rho) \right).
\end{equation}
Following the discussion in the previous section, we assume small back-reaction $|a|\ll 1$ and consider only its leading coupling to $\chi$. Notice that the coupling of the (leading) cubic $a |\chi|^2$ interaction is $\lambda \beta^2 g^2 \sim \lambda k$, which is the same order as cubic $\varphi |\chi|^2$. Self-consistency requires us (for finite $\lambda$) to consider $a$ together with $\chi$ and $\varphi$. This is a new ingredient, unique for non-zero Kalb-Ramond flux.
Assuming $\chi,\varphi$ and $a$ are all spherically symmetric, the EFT action \eqref{eq:action_d} takes the form, to leading order in $a$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:on_shell_action}
\begin{split}
	I_\text{String star} -I_{\text{TAdS}_3} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_N} \int \text{vol} \ d\rho &\left( 
	(\varphi')^2-\frac{\beta^2}{2 \text{vol}^2} (a')^2+|\chi'|^2
	\right.\\
	& +
	\left. \left(m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) + 2k^2 R^2(\rho)\cdot \varphi - 2 k^2 R_0^2 \lambda \cdot a \right) |\chi|^2 \right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $\text{vol} = 2\pi R_0 \sinh(\rho) \cosh(\rho)$, and $I_{\text{TAdS}_3}$ is the on-shell action of the background solution \eqref{eq:mixed_NS_NS_sol}. Here and below, primes are derivatives with respect to $\rho$. 

By demanding a smooth gauge field we have $\partial_\rho(a(\rho)/\rho^2)\mid_{\rho=0}=0$. It is therefore convenient to redefine the deviation $a(x)$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zeta_def}
	a(\rho) = \lambda \sinh^2(\rho) \cdot \zeta(\rho).
\end{equation}
In this form, the boundary condition at $\rho=0$ is simply $\zeta'(\rho=0)=0$. The equations of motion for $\chi$, $\varphi$ and $\zeta$ \eqref{eq:eqs_general} are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mixed_full_eom}
\begin{split}
	\chi ''+ v(\rho) \, \chi ' - \left(m^2_\text{eff}(\rho)+ 2 k^2 R_0^2 \, \left(\cosh^2(\rho) \varphi - \lambda^2 \sinh^2(\rho) \ \zeta\right) \right) \chi & = 0, \\
	\varphi ''+ v(\rho) \, \varphi ' - k^2 R_0^2 \cosh^2(\rho) |\chi|^2 & = 0,
	\\
	\zeta''+ u(\rho)\zeta'
	 - 2 k^2 R_0^2 \cosh^2(\rho) \ |\chi|^2 &= 0,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vu}
	v(\rho) = \partial_\rho \log \text{vol} = \tanh(\rho) + \coth(\rho), \quad u(\rho) = 3\coth(\rho)-\tanh(\rho).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thermodynamics and the BTZ/string transition} \label{sec:thermo}
The \ads{3} string star is the bound state solution of \eqref{eq:mixed_full_eom}. Being a solution of the action, it is a Euclidean saddle of the (Euclidean) string theory partition function with asymptotic thermal \ads{3} boundary condition.
Substituting \eqref{eq:zeta_def} in \eqref{eq:Delta_I} gives the on-shell action of the \ads{3} string star saddle compared to that of thermal \ads{3}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Delta_I}
\begin{split}
	I_\text{String star} -I_{\text{TAdS}_3} = \frac{R_0}{8G_N} \int &\frac{\sinh(2\rho)}{2} \ d\rho \left( 
	(\varphi')^2-\lambda^2\frac{((\sinh^2(\rho) \zeta(\rho))')^2}{2\sinh^2(\rho)\cosh^2(\rho)}+|\chi'|^2
	\right.\\
	&+
	\left. \left(m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) + 2k^2 R_0^2 \cdot \left(\cosh^2(\rho) \varphi -\lambda^2 \sinh^2(\rho) \zeta \right) \right) |\chi|^2 \right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
As a Euclidean saddle, it has free energy of order $G_N^{-1}$, just like black holes. It is applicable (as we will see below) only near the Hagedorn temperature $R_0-R_H \ll R_H$. 

In $d=2$ the AdS black hole solution is known by the BTZ solution \cite{Banados:1992wn}. Its on-shell action, compared to the thermal \ads{3}, is (in units $l_{ads}=1$)
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{BTZ} -I_{\text{TAdS}_3} = -\frac{\pi}{4 G_N} \left(R_0^{-1}-1\right).
\end{equation}
Thus, thermal \ads{3} is canonically dominant for low temperatures $R_0 > 1$, while the BTZ is dominant for high temperatures $R_0 < 1$.
Whenever the string star saddle is reliable $R \sim R_H \ll 1$ the dominant saddle is the BTZ. The string star saddle is therefore non-perturbatively unstable, and exponentially subdominant canonically. As we will see numerically in figure \ref{fig:free_energy} below (and also in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}) the string star free energy \eqref{eq:Delta_I} is positive (note that the expression is not clearly positive due to the $\zeta$ kinetic term). Therefore it is subdominant also compared to the thermal \ads{3} solution.

For higher dimensional \ads{d+1} $d>2$ an AdS black hole/string transition was suggested between the AdS string star saddle and AdS black holes \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}. The argument was carried from the black hole/string transition previously suggested between the flat-space string star saddle (or the Horowitz-Polchinski solution) and the (Euclidean) Schwarzschild saddle \cite{Horowitz:1997jc,Chen:2021dsw}. The reason is that at the two ends of the correspondence point around $R_0 \sim l_s$, both the AdS black hole and the AdS string star are of size much smaller then the AdS scale and can be well approximated by their asymptotically flat counterparts.
\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{plots/schematic_plot_ads3_full.png}
	\caption{A conjectured phase diagram for \ads{3} (at large $k$). The Euclidean action as a function of the inverse temperature $R_0$ is sketched. The gray and black lines describe the thermal \ads{3} and the BTZ respectively. The string star saddle is the blue line close to the Hagedorn temperature $R_c$. Its dual, a BTZ winding condensate, is the blue line connected to the BTZ saddle at $R_c'$. A BTZ/string transition in \ads{3} would be a line of saddles connecting the two (dashed blue line).}
	\label{fig:ads3_phase_diagram}
\end{figure}

In $d=2$ however asymptotically flat Schwarzschild solutions simply don't exist, so a similar argument can't be drawn. Going back to \ads{d+1},  AdS black holes exist only for $R_0 < l_{ads}/\sqrt{d(d-2)}$. For small enough horizon radius $r_h / l_{ads} < \sqrt{\frac{d-2}{d}}$ the temperature grows as the radius shrinks, just like in flat space. 
% \begin{equation}
% 	\beta = \frac{4\pi l_{ads}^2 r_h}{d r_h^2 + (d-2)l_{ads}^2}.
% \end{equation}
This is not the case for $d=2$. The temperature of the BTZ solution always grows with the radius $R_0 = 1 / r_h$.
% We see that two different behaviors happens depend around $r_h/l_{ads} \sim \sqrt{\frac{d-2}{d}}$. For smaller radii, we have approximately flat space solutions, and for higher radii we have large AdS black holes. At $d=2$ this radius is zero, and we have $\beta = 2\pi l_{ads}^2/r_h$ as a large AdS black hole. Black holes now exist for any temperature. Specifically solutions with small radius $r_h \ll l_{ads}$ will correspond to very low temperatures $\beta \gg l_{ads}$, and specifically $\beta \gg \beta_H$...
As a result, any attempt to connect the \ads{3} string star to a small black hole close to the Hagedorn temperature is impossible, because at high temperatures only large black hole solutions exist.
A clue comes when we consider the asymptotic symmetries of the question. Any worldsheet with asymptotic $S^1_\phi \times S^1_\beta$ has two $U(1)$ windings. The thermal \ads{3} saddle breaks the $S^1_\phi$ winding spontaneously, while the BTZ saddle breaks the $S^1_\beta$ winding. The \ads{3} string star saddle on the other hand (spontaneously) breaks both winding symmetries. To connect the \ads{3} string star saddle to the BTZ we need to consider deformations of the BTZ by $S^1_\phi$ winding strings.

Denoting the \ads{3} Hagedorn temperature by $R_c$, the BTZ solution has a known instability at $R_c' = 1/R_c$ \cite{Berkooz:2007fe,Lin:2007gi,Rangamani:2007fz}. This instability is exactly the tachyon instability of the thermal \ads{3} at the AdS Hagedorn temperature after we switch the roles of the two asymptotic circles ($R_0 \mapsto 1/R_0$). In other words, below $R_0>R_c'$ strings winding around the $\phi$-circle are tachyonic. Considering the \ads{3} string star saddle after switching the circles we get a new saddle that describes a normalizable $\phi$-winding condensate in the BTZ background. This saddle also breaks both winding symmetries spontaneously, but it is connected (in its regime of validity $R_c'-R_0 \ll R_c'$) to the BTZ instead of the thermal \ads{3}. In terms of global symmetries pattern, it is therefore natural to speculate these two branches meet around $R_0 \sim 1$.\footnote{By `meet' we mean through a line of string theory backgrounds labeled by the asymptotic temperature $\beta = 2\pi R_0$. } 
This phase diagram for \ads{3} was also suggested in \cite{Halder:2022ykw}. A schematic plot of this suggested picture is drawn in figure \ref{fig:ads3_phase_diagram}.

% What is the interpretation of this ``correspondence principle''? One of the complications of our interpretation is that we first shrink the BTZ horizon to the string scale, and then consider a condensation of winding modes around it, then increase the temperature which probably increase the horizon size (although the meaning of it make less and less sense as the temperature is increased). So it is not a question about small black holes anymore. We note that everything here happens at the $AdS$ scale. Both the ``small'' BTZ solutions, the wavefunction of the winding strings and of the thermal winding strings.



\section{Sub-AdS solutions and confining strings} \label{sec:sub_ads}
\subsection{General discussion} \label{sec:gen_disc}
This section studies general properties of holographic thermal confining theories, in cases where the ``IR wall'' is geometrically realized by a contractible (non-thermal) cycle. Thermal $AdS_{d+1}$ is one such example \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}, in which an $S^{d-1}$ closes in the IR region. We start by showing that around such a background there exists a saddle of thermal winding string condensate that depends (to leading order) only on the curvature scale at the IR point at which the cycle closes.
The reason would be that for this background, the size of the solution would be much smaller than the characteristic curvature scale. In terms of AdS$_{d+1}$ these solutions satisfy $L \ll l_{ads}$ and were reviewed in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}. The analysis allows us to find the characteristic behavior of the solution and the leading correction to the Hagedorn temperature in the dual holographic theory.

The topology of the geometries we will study is $S^1_\beta \times \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathcal{M}$. $S^1_\beta$ asymptotes to the thermal cycle of the holographic theory, $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is made of a radial direction $r$ and a shrinking $S^{d-1}$, and $\mathcal{M}$ is some (perhaps non-compact) manifold. We further assume the solution preserves $SO(2) \times SO(d)$ symmetry. The string metric close to the shrinking point $r=0$ of the $S^{d-1}$ sphere is, to subleading order in $r^2$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:conf_ansatz}
	ds^2 = dr^2 + (2\pi R_0)^2 \left( 1 + \frac{r^2}{l^2}\right) dt^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2_{d-1} + ds^2_{\mathcal{M}}
\end{equation}
The Euclidean time direction satisfies $t \sim t +1$. Higher orders of the metric are assumed to be down by higher orders of $r^2/l^2$ with $l$ being the curvature scale of the (IR) geometry. As a result, we implicitly assume $l_s \ll r \ll l$. On general grounds the parameter $R_0$ is related linearly to the holographic theory temperature $\beta$. We also assume that for $r \ll l$ the internal space geometry $ds^2_\mathcal{M}$ is independent of $r$.
In this geometry, and for temperatures close to the Hagedorn temperature, we look for non-trivial winding solutions that are homogeneous both on $\mathcal{M}$ and on the closing $S^{d-1}$ sphere. In cases that $\mathcal{M}$ is non-compact these solutions are dual (in the holographic theory) to a gas of interacting (confining) strings, and so we term them ``winding-string gas'' solutions.


In the regime where the effective mass for the winding mode around $t$ satisfies $m^2(r=0) \sim O(l_s^{4}/l^2)$ we can self consistently use the flat metric \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz} in \eqref{eq:eqs_general}. The resulting equations for $\chi(r), \varphi(r)$ are 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conf_eom}
\begin{split}
	\chi ''+ \frac{d-1}{r} \, \chi ' - \left(m^2_\text{eff}(r)+ \frac{4}{\alpha'} \varphi \right) \chi & = 0, \\
	\varphi ''+ \frac{d-1}{r} \, \varphi ' - \frac{2}{\alpha'} |\chi|^2 & = 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
These equations are of the same form found in the near-Hagedorn limit at \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}.
At this order in $r/l$ it is enough to expand the (effective) mass to quadratic order in $r$ (we assume type II string theory):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conf_m_eff}
	m^2_\text{eff} (r) = \frac{1}{\alpha'^2}\left(R_0^2 - R_H^2 + \frac{R_0^2 r^2}{l^2} \right).
\end{equation}
The winding EFT regime of validity for the winding EFT is $(R_0^2-R_H^2)/R_H^2 \ll 1$. In this section, we further restrict ourselves to $(R_0^2-R_H^2)/R_H^2 \sim l_s/l$. We will denote this regime of temperatures as ``near-Hagedorn''.
We parameterize this limit explicitly by defining $R_0^2 - R_H^2 \equiv \delta \cdot l_s^{3}/l$.
We can further reparameterize 
\begin{equation}
	\chi(r) = \frac{l_s}{l} \cdot \hat \chi(r/L), \quad \varphi(r) = \frac{l_s}{l} \cdot \ \hat \varphi(r/L),
\end{equation}
 with $L^2=l_s l / \sqrt{2}$, to get ($x=r/L$)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conf_full_eom}
\begin{split}
	\hat \chi ''+ \frac{d-1}{x} \, \hat \chi ' - \left(\delta + x^2 + 4 \hat \varphi \right) \hat \chi & = 0, \\
	\hat \varphi ''+ \frac{d-1}{x} \, \hat \varphi ' - 2 |\hat \chi|^2 & = 0,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $'$ denote an $x$ derivative.
These equations were studied numerically in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}.
Because \eqref{eq:conf_full_eom} is dimensionless we find $|\chi|,|\varphi| \sim l_s/l$ and solution's size $L \sim \sqrt{l_s l}$. Because (for the original metric to be weakly curved) $l_s/l \ll 1$ the solutions for \eqref{eq:conf_full_eom} are all self-consistent. Specifically note that $l_s \ll L\ll l$, justifying the approximations for the metric.
Numerically it was found that the solution's size increases with the temperature \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}. 

The Hagedorn temperature of the theory is defined as the temperature where the linearized equations have a normalizable solution, giving rise to a normalizable zero mode in the partition function. At the order we work with, this is given by $\delta_c = -d$, and the corresponding normalizable mode is $\chi(r) = \exp(-r^2/(2 L^2))$. In other words, the leading curvature correction to the Hagedorn value for $R_0$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:R_c}
	R_c^2  = 2 \alpha' \left(1 - \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{l_s}{l} + O(l_s^2/l^2)\right).
\end{equation}

However, $R_0$ is not directly related to the holographic theory temperature $\beta$. In the examples below the geometry is given by an analytic continuation from a Lorentzian manifold with a boundary of $R^{p,1}$ for some $p$. The Lorentzian solutions take the general form
\begin{equation}
	ds^2 =  dr^2 + f(r)\left( -(dx^0)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^p (dx^i)^2\right) + (...),
\end{equation}
where $r$ is again the radial bulk direction, $x^0,...,x^p$ are parallel to the boundary $R^{p,1}$, and in the bracket we ignored the rest of the coordinates. The Euclidean solution is then taken by analytically continuing $x_0 = i \beta \cdot t$, with the same $t \sim t+1$ as in \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz}. Comparing to \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz} gives at $r=0$ $f(r=0) = 4\pi^2 R_0^2 / \beta^2$. The confining string tension $T_{st}$ is given by calculating the bulk worldsheet action in the $t, x^i$ IR plane ($r=0$) measured in units of the holographic boundary lengths given by $\beta$:
\begin{equation}
	T_{st} = \frac{1}{2\pi \alpha'}\sqrt{g_{tt} g_{xx}}\mid_{r=0} \cdot \frac{1}{\beta} = \frac{f(0)}{2\pi \alpha'}=\frac{2\pi R_0^2}{\alpha' \beta^2}.
\end{equation}
Together with \eqref{eq:R_c}, the leading curvature correction to the holographic Hagedorn temperature is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:conf_hag}
	\beta_c = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{T_{st}}} \left(1-\frac{d}{2\sqrt{2}} \frac{l_s}{l} + O(l_s^2/l^2) \right).
\end{equation}

\subsection{\titlemath{\ads{3}} with finite RR flux} \label{sec:finite_RR}
We now go back to study the \ads{3} string star solutions in the background \eqref{eq:mixed_NS_NS_sol}. Following the previous section we restrict the discussion to near-Hagedorn temperatures $R_0^2-R_H^2 \sim k^{-3/2}$. Defining \begin{equation}
	R_0^2 = R_H^2 + \delta \cdot k^{-3/2},
\end{equation}
the effective mass \eqref{eq:type_II_m_eff} to leading order in $\rho/l_{ads}$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
	m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) = \delta \cdot k^{1/2} + 2(1-\lambda^2) k\rho^2.
\end{equation}
This is the same form as in \eqref{eq:conf_m_eff}. We can follow the same steps as in the previous section and assume a small solution $k^{-1/2} \ll L \ll 1$. 

Because we took the winding mass to be of order $m^2 \sim k^{1/2}$, we can consistently neglect higher-curvature contributions to the mass which are of subleading order $\Delta m \sim 1$.
In this range we can approximate \eqref{eq:mixed_full_eom} to leading order in $\rho \ll 1$ and get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:finite_RR_eom}
\begin{split}
	\chi ''+ \frac{1}{\rho} \, \chi ' - \left(\delta \cdot k^{1/2} + 2(1-\lambda^2) k\rho^2 + 4 k \, \left(\varphi - \lambda^2 \rho^2 \ \zeta\right) \right) \chi & = 0, \\
	\varphi ''+ \frac{1}{\rho} \, \varphi ' - 2k |\chi|^2 & = 0,
	\\
	\zeta''+\frac{3}{\rho}\zeta'
	 - 4 k \ |\chi|^2 &= 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Although $\zeta$ and $\varphi$ couples to $\chi$ at the same order of $k$, here the $\zeta$ coupling is smaller by a factor of $\rho^2 \sim L^2 \ll 1$. As a result, $\zeta$ can be neglected in this limit. 
The resulting equations for $\chi$ and $\varphi$ exactly coincide with \eqref{eq:conf_eom}, for the case $d=2$ and the effective mass ``curvature scale'' $l = 1/\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}$. The solution has an amplitude
\begin{equation}
	|\chi|,|\varphi| \sim k^{-1/2} \sqrt{1-\lambda^2},
\end{equation}
and characteristic size
\begin{equation}
	L \sim k^{-1/4} (1-\lambda^2)^{-1/4}.
\end{equation}
In this geometry $\beta = 2\pi R_0$ and therefore, following \eqref{eq:conf_hag}, the leading correction to the \ads{3} Hagedorn temperature is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:finite_RR_R_c}
	R_c^2 = \frac{2}{k} - \frac{2^{3/2} \sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}{k^{3/2}} + O(k^{-2}).
\end{equation}
In \cite{Urbach:2022xzw} the leading correction for the Hagedorn temperature in $AdS_5\times S^5$ was matched with an integrability analysis of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM \cite{Harmark:2021qma}.
It would be interesting to find a way to similarly compare \eqref{eq:finite_RR_R_c} to the recent integrability results for the pure RR \ads{3} case ($\lambda=0$) \cite{Cavaglia:2021eqr,Ekhammar:2021pys,Cavaglia:2022xld,Frolov:2021bwp}.

The thermodynamic stability of these solutions was studied in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}. $\zeta$ is negligible in \eqref{fig:free_energy} and the string star free energy can be shown to be positive. This saddle is therefore non-perturbatively unstable compared to the thermal \ads{3} saddle (and to the BTZ saddle).

This discussion is self-consistent only when the size of the solution is smaller than the AdS curvature scale, $L \ll 1$, or $1-\lambda^2 \gg 1/k$.
Note here that $\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}$ is the magnitude of the RR flux $F_3$ \eqref{eq:mixed_NS_NS_sol}.
We therefore conclude that for near-Hagedorn temperatures $R_0^2-R_H^2 \sim k^{-3/2}$ and large enough RR-flux $1-\lambda^2 \gg 1/k$ the leading behavior of the mass solely controls the profile of the string star. As we lower the RR flux the profile size is larger and the amplitude is smaller. Around $1-\lambda^2 \sim 1/k$ the solution size reaches the AdS scale, and the amplitude of $\zeta$ is of the same ($1/k$) order as $\chi$ and $\varphi$. We will discuss this case in section \ref{sec:small_RR} below.

For lower temperatures the solution size turn shorter. 
Below the near-Hagedorn regime, but for temperatures in which the EFT is still valid $k^{-3/2} \ll R_0^2 - R_H^2 \ll k^{-1}$ one might expect reliable solutions that are arbitrarily short ($k^{-1/2}\ll L$). This is not the case and for a good reason. If solutions with $L \ll 1$ would exist, they would approximately solve the flat space equations for $d=2$, and it is known that no such solutions exist \cite{Horowitz:1997jc,Chen:2021dsw}. Instead, whenever the solution is reliable ($|\chi|,|\varphi|\ll 1$) its size remains comparable to $L \sim k^{-1/4}$.
In other words, this section describes the behavior of \ads{3} string stars whenever they exist for finite RR flux $1-\lambda^2 \gg 1/k$.

\subsection{The D4 Witten model} \label{sec:d4_back}
Consider $4+1$ dimensional maximally symmetric $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory (with coupling $g_5$) compactified on a circle of radius $R$ with anti-periodic boundary condition for the fermions. We denote the $4+1$ ’t~Hooft coupling by $\lambda_5 = g_5^2 N$.
It is holographically dual to the near horizon limit of $N$ D4 branes \cite{Witten:1998zw}, with the $9+1$ (type IIA) metric
\begin{equation}\label{eq:witten_d4}
\begin{split}
	ds^2 & = \left(\frac{u}{R_{D4}}\right)^{3/2} \left[ -(dx^0)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^3 (dx^i)^2 +f(u) (dx^4)^2 \right] + \left(\frac{R_{D4}}{u}\right)^{3/2} \left[\frac{du^2}{f(u)} + u^2 d\Omega_4^2 \right]\\
	F_{(4)} &= \frac{2\pi N}{V_4} \epsilon_4, \quad e^\phi = g_s \left(\frac{u}{R_{D4}}\right)^{3/4}, \quad 
	R_{D4}^3 \equiv \pi g_s N l_s^3, \quad 
	f(u) \equiv 1-\left(\frac{u_\Lambda}{u}\right)^3,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The string coupling $g_s$ is related to the $4+1$ Yang-Mills coupling by $4\pi^2 g_s l_s = g_5^2$. Here $x_4 \sim x_4 + 2\pi R$ with $R = \frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{R_{D4}^3}{u_\Lambda}\right)^{1/2}$ (by demanding smooth solution where the $x_4$ circle shrinks at $u=u_\Lambda$).

The thermodynamics of this system was studied in \cite{Aharony:2006da}.
The thermal solution is produced by analytically continuing the time direction to a circle of size $\beta$, $x_0 = i \beta t$. On the gravity side, the analytically continued solution is the dominating solution for low temperatures. For high temperatures, one can take the same solutions, only with the $R$ and $\beta$ circles switched, so that now the temporal circle shrinks in the bulk. This last solution is a Euclidean black brane solution. The phase transition between the two happens at $\beta=2\pi R$ \cite{Aharony:2006da}.

Here we are interested in winding condensate solutions around the (analytically continued) thermal saddle \eqref{eq:witten_d4}. The solutions extend homogeneously on the $x^i$ directions but localize around $u=u_\Lambda$.
Defining $r^2 = \frac{4}{3} \left(\frac{R_{D4}^3}{u_\Lambda}\right)^{1/2} (u-u_\Lambda)$, $x_0 = i \beta t$ and $\phi = \frac{x_4}{R}$ we have to leading order in $r^2$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	ds^2 & = \left(\frac{u_\Lambda}{R_{D4}}\right)^{3/2} \left[ \beta^2 dt^2 + \sum_{i=1}^3 (dx^i)^2\right] + r^2 d\phi^2 + dr^2 + \left(\frac{R_{D4}^3}{u_\Lambda}\right)^{1/2} d\Omega_4^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
And at the next order in $r^2$
\begin{equation}
	G_{tt} = \beta^2\left(\frac{u_\Lambda}{R_{D4}}\right)^{3/2}\left(1+\frac{3}{2} \frac{u-u_\Lambda}{u_\Lambda}\right) = \beta^2\left(\frac{u_\Lambda}{R_{D4}}\right)^{3/2}\left(1+\frac{27 R}{16 R_{D4}^3} r^2\right).
\end{equation}
Comparing with \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz} we find the curvature scale $l^2 = \frac{16}{27} \frac{R_{D4}^3}{R}$.
In this model, the (confining) string tension is given by $T_{st} = \frac{1}{2\pi \alpha'} \left(\frac{u_\Lambda}{R_{D4}}\right)^{3/2} = \frac{4}{27 \pi \alpha'} (R_{D4}/R)^3$ and the mass gap (called the glueball mass) is of order $M_{gb} = 1/R$. Plugging inside \eqref{eq:conf_hag} with $d=2$ gives the leading correction to the holographic Hagedorn temperature
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\beta_c  = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{T_{st}}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{M_{gb}}{T_{st}}+ O(M_{gb}^2 T_{st}^{-3/2}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
or in terms of the dimensionless ratio $\lambda_5/R$:
\begin{equation}
	\beta_c / R = \sqrt{108 \pi^3}\cdot \left(\lambda_5/R\right)^{-1/2}
            - \frac{27 \pi^2}{\sqrt{2} \left(\lambda_5/R\right)^{-1}}
            +O((\lambda_5/R)^{-3/2}).
\end{equation}

We found that this model admits a `winding-string gas' saddle for near-Hagedorn temperatures: a normalizable condensate of winding strings around Euclidean time $t$ that extends homogeneously on the $R^3$ directions (and $x^4$). The condensate is localized in the bulk around $u=u_\Lambda$ with a size of $L \sim \sqrt{l_s l} \sim l_s \cdot (T_{st} / M_{gb}^2)^{1/4}$.

The winding-string gas saddle is highly metastable, as it has free energy higher than both the thermal solution, and (because we are above the phase transition) the black brane solution.
Note that the phase diagram is very similar to that of the \ads{3}, due to $2\pi R \iff \beta$ symmetry. Just like for the BTZ solution, the black brane solution has a tachyonic instability below the temperature
\begin{equation}
	\beta'_c = \frac{4\pi}{3} R_{D4} \left(\frac{R^2}{\alpha'}\right)^{1/3} = 2^{4/3} \pi \left(T_{st} M_{gb}^{-5}\right)^{1/3}.
\end{equation}
For temperatures slightly above it, there exists a condensate of winding $x^4$ strings homogeneous on $R^3\times S^1_\beta$, obtaining by interchanging the asymptotic circles for the winding-string gas saddle. It is possible to speculate a new kind of correspondence principle, or a black brane/string transition. The black brane with $x^4$ winding condensate and the thermal solution with $t$-winding condensate are connected via a line of metastable saddles.

To understand the relation to pure Yang-Mills, it is useful to write the critical temperatures in terms of $R$ and the $4+1$ Yang-Mills coupling $\lambda_5$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:temps}
	\beta_c/R = \sqrt{108 \pi^3\frac{R}{\lambda_5}}, \quad \beta_{HP}/R = 2\pi, \quad \beta_c'/R = \frac{2}{3} \left(\pi^2 \frac{\lambda_5}{R}\right)^{1/3}.
\end{equation}
The semiclassical approximation is valid when $l \gg l_s \gg l_{pl}$ or $1 \ll \lambda_5 / R \ll N$. In this regime $\beta_c / R \ll 1 \ll \beta_c' / R$. In the opposite limit, $\lambda_5/R \ll 1$ the holographic theory at energies below $\sim 1/R$ is that of pure $3+1$ Yang-Mills. 
In \cite{Aharony:2006da} the phase diagram of the system was suggested for any $\lambda_5,R$. At $\lambda_5/R \ll 1$ and for low temperatures $\beta \gg R$ the theory is described by $3+1$ SYM. This theory has a first-order confinement/deconfinement close to its Hagedorn temperature $\beta_c \gg R$. As a result, we also expect a phase transition at high temperatures $\beta_c' \ll R$. The simplest scenario suggested in \cite{Aharony:2006da} was a single new dominating phase for temperatures $\beta_c' < \beta <\beta_c$. This phase should have the unique property that it maps to itself when interchanging $\beta,R$.

Going back to the gravity limit $1 \ll \lambda_5/R \ll N$. If indeed the winding-string gas saddle is the one that connects the two saddles between $\beta_c$ and $\beta_c'$, the simplest option would be that its continuation to the $\lambda_5/R \ll 1$ is the dominant phase for temperatures $\beta_c' < \beta <\beta_c$, see figure \ref{fig:witten_model}. Notice that because the winding-string gas phase breaks the winding of both circles, it is indeed invariant to switching $\beta,R$.
This picture is also supported by the analysis of \cite{Aharony:2005ew} which studied $2d$ SYM on a torus. In the weakly coupled regime, the authors found a dominating phase with non-zero holonomies on both circles.

\subsection{The D3 Witten model} \label{sec:d3_back}
It is possible to repeat the previous construction also for D3s compactified on a circle \cite{Witten:1998qj,Aharony:1999ti,Csaki:1998qr}. The holographic theory is now $3+1$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills on $R^3 \times S^1$ with anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermions. The gravity dual is the near-Horizon limit of $N$ D3 branes on $S^1$. After analytically continuing $x^0 = i \beta t$ we find the thermal solution
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	ds^2 / l_{ads}^2 &= f(u) d\tau^2 + f^{-1}(u)du^2 + u^2 \left[ \beta^2 dt^2 + \sum_{i=1}^2 (dx^i)^2\right] + d\Omega^2_5,\\
	f(u) &= u^2 - \frac{u_0^4}{u^2}, \quad F_5 = 16 \pi  N \alpha'^2 \omega_5,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $l_{ads}^2 = \sqrt{4\pi g_s N} \alpha'$, $\tau \sim \tau + \pi/u_0$ (the $\tau$-circle closes at $u=u_0$) and the length of the asymptotic circle is $R=1/(2 u_0)$. There is a non-zero RR flux through the $S^5$, $\int_{S^5} \omega_5 = \pi^3$.
Close to $u=u_0$ the radial coordinate is $r = R ((u-u_0)/u_0)^{1/2}$ and 
\begin{equation}
	G_{tt} = R^2 \beta^2 u_0^2 \left(1 + 2 \frac{r^2}{l_{ads}^2}+...\right).
\end{equation}
Comparing with \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz} we find the curvature scale $l^2 = l_{ads}^2/2$ with $d=2$ (shrinking $S^1$). Following \eqref{eq:conf_hag} the leading correction to the holographic Hagedorn temperature is
\begin{equation}
	\beta_c = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{T_{st}}} \left(1 - (4\pi g_s N)^{-1/4} + O\left((4\pi g_s N)^{-1/2}\right)\right),
\end{equation}
with $T_{st} = R^2 u_0^2/(2\pi \alpha')$. The phase diagram of this model (when the gravity approximation is valid) is similar to the D4 case. A black brane solution exists by replacing the two Euclidean circles and dominates the canonical ensemble for high temperatures $\beta > 2\pi R$. The black brane is tachyonic for temperatures below (at leading $g_s N$ order)
\begin{equation}
	\beta_c' = \frac{\pi}{2^{3/2}} \frac{R}{l_s u_0} = \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{4\pi g_s N}{T_{st}}}.
\end{equation}
The same line of argument used for the D4 suggests a similar black brane/string transition. The black brane and the thermal saddle are connected between $\beta_c \le \beta \le \beta_c'$, with perturbative winding condensates being the near-critical description at each side.

\subsection{The Maldacena-Nu\~{n}ez background} \label{sec:mn_back}
In \cite{Maldacena:2000yy} Maldacena and Nu\~{n}ez (interpreting the solutions of \cite{Chamseddine:1997nm}) considered $N$ D5 branes on $R^4 \times S^2$, with a twisted normal bundle on $S^3$.
The holographic effective description is $5+1$ maximally supersymmetric YM on $R^4\times S^2$ with twisting of the $S^2$ using a gauge background for a $U(1)_R \subset SU(2)_R \subset SO(4)$ global symmetry. In terms of $R^4$ the twist preserves $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We denote the $5+1$ ’t~Hooft coupling $\lambda_6$ and the radius of the $S^2$ by $R$. 
The near horizon 10d metric and RR flux of the D5 system is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	ds^2_{str} / \alpha' &= e^{\phi_D} \left( -(dx^0)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^3 (dx^i)^2 + N \left[ d\rho^2 + e^{2g(\rho)} d\Omega_2^2 + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a=1}^3 (w_a - A_a)^2\right]\right)\\
	F_3 &= N \left[-\frac{1}{4} (w^1-A^1)\wedge(w^2-A^2)\wedge (w^3-A^3)+\frac{1}{4}\sum_{a=1}{3}F^a \wedge(w^a-A^a)\right],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		e^{2\phi_{D}} &= g_s^2 \frac{\sinh 2\rho}{2 e^{g}}=g_s^2\left(1+\frac{8}{9} \rho^2+O(\rho^4)\right),\\
		e^{2g} &= \rho \coth(2\rho) - \frac{\rho^2}{\sinh^2(2\rho)} - \frac{1}{4}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
here $w_a$ label 1-forms on $S^3$, and $A_a$ is a smooth solution that asymptotes at large $\rho$ to the prescribed $S^2$ twist, and $F=dA$. In this geometry the asymptotic $S^2$ shrinks at $\rho=0$.
This solution is weakly coupled and curved for $1 \ll g_s N \ll N$, or $1 \ll \lambda_6 /R^2 \ll N$. For $\lambda_6/R^2 \ll 1$ (in which gravity is highly curved) on the other hand the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory decouples at energies below $1/R$ \cite{Maldacena:2000yy}.


The thermal ensemble produced by analytically continuing $x_0 = i \beta / l_s \cdot t$ ($t \sim t+1$).
Close to $\rho=0$ the radial coordinate is $r = (\alpha' g_s N)^{1/2} \rho$, and the temporal (string) metric component is
\begin{equation}
	G_{tt} = \beta^2 e^{\phi_{D}} = \beta^2 g_s \left(1+ \frac{4}{9} \frac{r^2}{\alpha' g_s N} + O\left(\frac{r^4}{(\alpha'g_s N)^2}\right)\right).
\end{equation}
At $r=0$ the $S^3$ has no twist ($A_i$ is flat), and as long as the solution's size is smaller than $L \ll (\alpha'g_s N)^{1/2}$ we can approximate the geometry by $S_1 \times R^3 \times R^{3} \times S^3$ ($r$ being the radial direction in $R^3$).
Comparing with \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz}, we find `winding-string gas' saddles $\chi(r),\varphi(r)$ homogeneous on $R^3 \times S^3$ for near-Hagedorn temperatures.
In terms of section \ref{sec:gen_disc} $l = \frac{3}{2} (\alpha ' g_s N)^{1/2}$ and $d=3$ (as we have a shrinking $S^2$), and the first correction to the Hagedorn temperature is \eqref{eq:conf_hag}
\begin{equation}
	\beta_c = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{T_{st}}} \left(1-(2 g_s N)^{-1/2} + O(N^{-1}) \right).
\end{equation}
with $T_{st} = \frac{1}{2\pi \alpha'} g_s$.\footnote{The high energy description of this model is in terms of little string theory, which has its own, different, Hagedorn temperature \cite{Kutasov:2000jp}. The latter appear at much higher temperatures $\beta_{H,LST} = 2\pi (\alpha' N)^{1/2} \ll \beta_c$ (in the case we are considering $g_s N \ll 1$). \label{fn:LST}}


Close to the Hagedorn temperature $\beta-\beta_c \ll \beta_c$ there exists a reliable winding-string gas saddle homogeneous on the $R^3$ (and the rest of the compact directions) and localize at the IR $\rho=0$ region with size $L \sim l_s (g_s N)^{1/4}$. The black brane-like solution, in which the thermal circle closes, and its thermodynamics were studied in \cite{Buchel:2001qi,Gubser:2001eg,Buchel:2001dg}.\footnote{For the thermodynamics of other supergravity duals of 4d confining gauge theories see \cite{Freedman:2000xb,Buchel:2003ah,Buchel:2007vy}
}
A black brane/string transition for this model suggests the black brane (with a small horizon radius) is connected to the winding-string gas saddle via a line of worldsheet CFTs.
% MAYBE ADD THIS
% \todo{In the strong coupling limit of the D5 system $1 \ll N\ll g_s N$ ($\lambda_6 R^2 \gg N$) the S-dual picture is weakly coupled and weakly curved. This geometry is described by the following $10$d string metric and NS-NS 3-form
% \begin{equation}

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
% 	e^{2\phi} &= g_s^{-2} \frac{2 e^{g}}{\sinh 2\rho}.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% Unlike the D5 case, here the confining string dual is the D-string. It is therefore unclear what is the holographic meaning of a winding F-strings condensate (and a calculation of the D-string condensate is uncontrollable).
% Moreover, as the string metric is flat in $4d$, the winding mass is a constant. Therefore we expect the size of the solution to be $L \sim (\alpha' N)^{1/2}$, and we can't use the above $1/r$ expansion. Perhaps more importantly, the LST Hagedorn behavior appears at much lower temperatures compared to the NS5 F-string Hagedorn $\beta_c\sim l_s \ll \beta_{LST}$.}

\subsection{The Klebanov-Strassler conifold background} \label{sec:ks_back}
The Klebanov-Strassler geometry is given by \cite{Klebanov:2000hb}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:KS}
	ds^2 = h^{-1/2} \left(-(dx^0)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^3 (dx^i)^2\right) 
	+ h^{1/2}\left(
	\frac{\varepsilon^{4/3} K(\tau)}{6 K^3(\tau)} d\tau^2 + (...)
	\right)
\end{equation}
In $(...)$ we omitted the remaining 5 dimensions of the conifold geometry. For small $\tau$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	K(\tau) &= (2/3)^{1/3} - \tau^2/(5 \cdot 2^{2/3}\cdot 3^{1/3}) + O(\tau^4)\\
	h(\tau) &= (g_s M \alpha')^2 2^{2/3} \varepsilon^{-8/3}(a_0 - 2^{-1/3} 3^{-4/3} \tau^2 + O(\tau^4)),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and $a_0 \approx 0.71805$ \cite{PandoZayas:2003yb}. Here $M$ is the number of fractional $D3$ branes and $\varepsilon$ is the deformation parameter.
The background also includes RR and NS-NS fluxes, which are immaterial in the discussion of winding condensate.

The thermodynamics of Klebanov-Strassler was studied in \cite{Gubser:2001ri,Buchel:2001gw,Aharony:2007vg,Buchel:2018bzp}. Here we are interested only in the thermal solution, given by analytically continuing \eqref{eq:KS} by $x^0 = i \beta l_s t$ ($t\sim t+1$). At $\tau=0$ an $S^2$ of the conifold geometry closes, and the geometry is approximately $R^4 \times R^3 \times S^3$.
Defining the radial coordinate $r=G_{\tau\tau}^{1/2} \tau$ we find \footnote{here the $x_i$ have units of length squared. When we write $G_{tt}$ we already multiplying by $\alpha'$ to make contact with \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz}.}
\begin{equation}
	G_{tt} = \frac{\varepsilon^{4/3}}{2^{1/3} a_0^{1/2} \ g_s M } \left(1 + \frac{1}{3 a_0^{3/2}} \frac{r^2}{g_s M \alpha'}\right).
\end{equation}
In terms of \eqref{eq:conf_ansatz} $d=3$ and a curvature scale $l^2 = 3 a_0^{3/2} g_s M \alpha'$. As a result, the leading correction to the Hagedorn temperature in this background is
\begin{equation}
	\beta_c = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{T_{st}}} \left(1 - \frac{3^{1/2}}{2^{3/2} a_0^{3/4}} \left(g_s M\right)^{-1/2} + O\left((g_s M)^{-1}\right) \right),
\end{equation}they
with the confining string tension $T_{st} = \frac{\varepsilon^{4/3}}{2^{4/3} a_0^{1/2} \pi} (\alpha' g_s M)^{-1}$.

\section{AdS-sized solutions for \titlemath{\ads{3}} with small RR flux} \label{sec:small_RR}
\subsection{Analytical results} \label{sec:small_RR_anal}
In section \ref{sec:finite_RR} we concluded that the analysis for sub-AdS solutions is invalid for small RR fluxes $1-\lambda^2 \sim 1/k$, where the solution's size reaches the AdS scale.
In this section, we turn to study the behavior of \ads{3} string stars for small RR fluxes, as well as the pure NS-NS case. To that end we define 
\begin{equation}
	1-\lambda^2 \equiv \frac{\alpha}{k},
\end{equation}
and assume $0 \le \alpha \ll k$.\footnote{Notice that the quantization of the RR charge requires $k\cdot \sqrt{1-\lambda^2}=\sqrt{k\cdot \alpha}$ to be integers. In the large $k$ limit it gives no restriction on the range of $\alpha$.} Section \ref{sec:finite_RR} considered only near-Hagedorn temperatures $R_0^2-R_H^2 \sim k^{-3/2}$. 
For small RR flux, the important regime is the tighter $R_0^2-R_H^2 \sim k^{-2}$ (which we can call the very-near-Hagedorn regime).
We therefore define
\begin{equation}
	R_0^2 = R_H^2 + \frac{\hat m^2}{k^2}.
\end{equation}
Solutions are expected to be valid as long as $R_0^2-R_H^2 \ll R_H^2$, or $\hat m^2 \ll k$, which we will therefore assume.

Finally, it is useful to redefine the fields by $\chi = \frac{1}{k} \hat \chi$, $\phi = \frac{1}{k} \hat \phi$ and $\zeta = \frac{1}{k} \hat \zeta$. At large $k \gg 1$, the on-shell action from \eqref{eq:Delta_I} is given by
\begin{align}
	I_\text{String star} -I_{\text{TAdS}_3} &= \frac{\beta}{16\pi G_N} \frac{1}{k^2} \cdot F,\label{eq:Delta_I_alpha}\\
	F & =\int \frac{\sinh(2\rho)}{2} \ d\rho \Bigg\{ 
	(\hat \varphi')^2-\frac{((\sinh^2(\rho) \hat \zeta(\rho))')^2}{2\sinh^2(\rho)\cosh^2(\rho)}+|\hat \chi'|^2
	\nonumber\\
	&\qquad\qquad+
	\left(\hat m^2 + 2 \alpha \sinh^2(\rho) + 4 \left(\cosh^2(\rho) \hat\varphi -\sinh^2(\rho) \hat\zeta \right) \right) |\hat\chi|^2 \Bigg\},
	\label{eq:F_def}
\end{align}
with $F$ being the normalized free energy (compared to that of thermal \ads{3}). The equations of motion are (from \eqref{eq:mixed_full_eom})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:large_k_eqs_alpha}
\begin{split}
	\hat\chi ''+ v(\rho) \, \hat\chi ' - \left(\hat m^2 +2\alpha \sinh^2(\rho)+ 4\left(\cosh^2(\rho) \hat\varphi -\sinh^2(\rho) \hat\zeta \right) \right) \hat\chi & = 0, \\
	\hat\varphi ''+ v(\rho) \, \hat\varphi ' - 2 \cosh^2(\rho) |\hat\chi|^2 & = 0,
	\\
	\hat\zeta'' + u(\rho) \hat\zeta'
	 - 4 \cosh^2(\rho) \ |\hat\chi|^2 &= 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Observe that $\alpha$ adds a potential to the linear equation for $\chi$ and therefore for $\alpha > 0$ we expect a normalizable solution with size $L \sim 1$. Assuming an $O(1)$ result (for $\hat m^2 \sim O(1)$) gives $|\chi|,|\varphi|,|\zeta| \sim 1/k \ll 1$ which is self-consistent with our assumptions. The reader may worry that as the effective mass is now $m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) \sim k^0$, higher curvature corrections are now leading. In section \ref{sec:higher_curv} below we argue that the resulting mass shift is proportional to $\Delta m^2 \propto (1-\lambda^2)$ (times a $k^0$ factor). For finite $\alpha$ this is a $k^{-1}$ correction to the mass and therefore subleading.

At the extreme case $\alpha=0$ ($\lambda=1$) we have the pure NS-NS background. In this case for any temperature the $\rho$ dependence in $m^2_\text{eff}$ is canceled between the metric and the NS-NS flux, which results in a constant 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eff_m2_type_ii}
	m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) = \hat m^2 = k^2(R^2_0-R_H^2),
\end{equation}
equal to the flat space result \eqref{eq:m2_def}.
This property means that very close to the Hagedorn temperature strings winding around the thermal circle are light arbitrarily close to the boundary $\rho \gg 1$, although the proper length of the thermal circle diverges exponentially. Physically, this is due to the cancellation between the gravitational attraction (of AdS space) and the electric repulsion (or the non-zero $H$). This is related to the well-studied long strings in the pure NS-NS \ads{3} \cite{Maldacena:1998uz,Seiberg:1999xz}. These strings wind around the angular circle of Lorentzian \ads{3} with finite energy. Because asymptotically there is no difference between the two circles, the cancellation of the energy divergence at large $\rho$ is of the same origin.
As a result, for $\alpha = 0$ the potential in \eqref{eq:large_k_eqs_alpha} is quadratic and not exponential. Nevertheless, we expect a normalizable solution for $\chi,\varphi,\zeta$ also in this case for high enough $\hat m^2$, with a generic $L \sim 1$. We present numerical solutions to this equation in section \ref{sec:small_RR_num} below.

To find the leading correction to the \ads{3} Hagedorn temperature, we should look for the maximal value of $\hat m^2$ (as a function of $\alpha \ge 0$) for which there's a solution to the linearized \eqref{eq:large_k_eqs_alpha} equation for $\hat\chi$. We denote this critical value by $\hat m^2_c$.
For $\alpha=0$ the (smooth) linear solution can be found analytically to be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pure_linear_mode}
	\chi_\text{lin}(\rho) = P_{\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+\hat m^2}}{2}}(\cosh(2\rho)),
\end{equation}
with $P_n(x)$ being the Legendre function \cite{Berkooz:2007fe}. For $\rho \gg 1$ and $\hat m^2 > -1$ we have $\chi_\text{lin} \sim \exp(-\Delta_\chi \rho)$ with $\Delta_\chi = \Re(1-\sqrt{1+\hat m^2})$, and as $\chi_\text{lin} \sim \rho \exp(-\rho)$ for $\hat m^2=-1$. The solution is thus non-normalizable for any $\hat m^2$, but it turns delta-function normalizable at $\hat m^2 = -1$ (at the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound). Therefore for $\alpha=0$ the critical value is $\hat m^2_c = -1$, and the first correction to the pure NS-NS \ads{3} Hagedorn temperature is
\begin{equation}
	R_c^2(\lambda=1) = \frac{2}{k} - \frac{1}{k^{2}} + O(k^{-3}).
\end{equation}
Interestingly, for the type II pure NS-NS this is also the exact result $R_c^2 = 2/k - 1/k^2$ \cite{Berkooz:2007fe,Mertens:2014nca}.\footnote{I thank David Kutasov for pointing out that the first correction here is $O(k^{-2})$, and not $O(k^{-3/2})$ as found above \eqref{eq:finite_RR_R_c} and in \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}. It is his comment that led me to study the \ads{3} case.}
The fact that the zero-mode \eqref{eq:pure_linear_mode} is only delta-function normalizable is similar to flat space \cite{Atick:1988si}, and probably corresponds to the fact the Lorentzian spectrum in this case is continuous.

For $\alpha>0$ the linear equation has a potential and so we expect only discrete values of $\hat m^2$ for which exist normalizable solutions. We are interested in the `ground state' solution, with the largest $\hat m^2$. 
We weren't able to find an analytical solution in this case, but it is possible to find it numerically. In figure \ref{fig:m2s_alpha} we plotted $\hat m_c^2$ as a function of $\alpha$. It can be seen from the figure that $\hat m^2$ decreases as $\alpha$ grows. This is to be expected, as when $\alpha \gg 1$ we expect from section \ref{sec:finite_RR} to find $\hat m^2_c = - 2^{3/2} \alpha^{1/2}$ (by translating \eqref{eq:finite_RR_R_c} in terms of $\hat m^2$). This behavior is shown in the figure by a black dashed line.

\subsection{An argument against higher curvature corrections}\label{sec:higher_curv}
Higher curvature corrections always appear with non-negative powers of the string scale and therefore are naively subleading. For $d=2$, two operators still contribute at zeroth order in the string scale: $\mathcal{R}_{2} |\chi|^2$ and $g^{tt} F_{ij} F^{ij} |\chi|^2$. For the mixed background \eqref{eq:mixed_NS_NS_sol} their value is exactly a constant
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{R}_{2} = -2,\quad g^{tt} F_{ij} F^{ij} = -4\lambda^2.
\end{equation}
We can write these terms in the Lagrangian as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_\text{hige-curv} = g_1 \cdot \mathcal{R}_{2} |\chi|^2 + g_2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}g^{tt} F^{ij} |\chi|^2 = -2(g_1 + g_2 \lambda^2) |\chi|^2,
\end{equation}
for some unknown couplings $g_1,g_2 \sim O(1)$. 
Therefore the overall effect of these two terms is to shift the effective mass of $\chi$ by a constant $\Delta m^2 = -2(g_1 + g_2 \lambda^2)$.\footnote{Of course, both terms also induce a correction to the coupling of $\varphi$, $\zeta$ to $|\chi|^2$. Whenever the constant shift is subleading, so is the coupling.} As a result, the effective mass for the pure NS-NS case is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Delta_m}
	m^2_\text{eff}(\rho) = k^2(R_0^2-R_H^2) + \Delta m^2 + O(1/k).
\end{equation}
% From the solution of \eqref{eq:pure_linear_mode} we know that the pure NS-NS Hagedorn temperature should be at $m^2=-1$, or $R_c^2 = R_H^2$
We now turn specifically to the pure NS-NS theory $\lambda=1$, in which the worldsheet theory on thermal AdS is known \cite{Berkooz:2007fe,Rangamani:2007fz,Mertens:2014nca}.
The mass of the particle dictates the asymptotic behavior of its mode close to the boundary.
As such, it should match the \ads{3} $SL(2,R)$ Casimir of the corresponding worldsheet vertex operator. To find the exact worldsheet mass, we follow the discussion of \cite{Mertens:2014nca}, which uses the description of thermal \ads{3} as a specific coset of $SL(2,C)$ \cite{Hemming:2002kd}.
For a given $\beta$, a bosonic $SL(2,C)$ WZW primary with winding $\pm 1$ and $SL(2,C)$ Casimir $J^2 = s^2 + \frac{1}{4}$ (and $h_{int} =0$) has dimension
\begin{equation}
	h=\bar h = \frac{s^2 + \frac{1}{4}}{k-2} + \frac{k \beta^2}{16 \pi^2}
\end{equation}
We change variables to $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{2\pi}$, $-4m^2 = s^2 + \frac{1}{4}$ to get
\begin{equation}
	h=\bar h = -\frac{1}{4}\frac{m^2}{k-2} + \frac{k R_0^2}{4}.
\end{equation}
To write the type II expression we shift $k\mapsto k+2$ (only for the first term, as we keep the temperature in string units $k R_0^2$ constant) and find
\begin{equation}
	h=\bar h = -\frac{1}{4}\frac{m^2}{k} + \frac{k R_0^2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
As a result, the mass of the winding vertex operator as a function of $R_0$ is
\begin{equation}
	m^2 = k^2 \left(R_0^2 - \frac{2}{k}\right).
\end{equation}
Comparing with \eqref{eq:Delta_m} we find that the higher curvature correction to the mass vanishes $\Delta m^2=0$, for $\lambda=1$. In other words $g_1=-g_2$, and (for any $\lambda$)
\begin{equation}
	\Delta m^2 = -2g_1(1- \lambda^2).
\end{equation}
Because in this section we consider only $1-\lambda^2 \sim 1/k$, this is a subleading effect.

To further study the profile of the AdS-sized string star solution we used numerical analysis to find the non-linear solutions for \eqref{eq:large_k_eqs_alpha} of $\hat \chi, \hat \varphi$ and $\hat \zeta$ as a function of $\alpha$ and $\hat m^2$. The boundary conditions for a smooth and normalizable solution are\footnote{The smooth boundary condition for the Kalb-Ramond field is $(\rho^2 A_\phi)'(0)=0$. From \eqref{eq:a_def}, \eqref{eq:zeta_def} also follows $\zeta'(0)=0$.}
\begin{equation}
	\hat \chi'(0) = \hat \varphi'(0) = \hat\zeta'(0) = 0, \quad 
	\hat \chi(\infty) = \hat \varphi(\infty) = \hat\zeta(\infty) = 0.
\end{equation}
In practice, we chose $x_\text{min}=0.00001$ and $2<x_\text{max}<6$ (depending on $\alpha$), and tried to satisfy
\begin{equation}
	\hat \chi'(x_\text{min}) = \hat \varphi'(x_\text{min}) = \hat\zeta'(x_\text{min}) = 0, \quad 
	\hat \chi(x_\text{max}) = \hat \varphi(x_\text{max}) = \hat\zeta(x_\text{max}) = 0,
\end{equation}
using the shooting method. That is, we optimized the initial values at $x_\text{min}$ to satisfy the boundary condition at $x_\text{max}$. Notice that the variable $x$ is already the dimensionless length in which the characteristic size of the solution should be $O(1)$.
Figure \ref{fig:example} shows the profile of the solution at $\hat m^2=0$ for the pure NS-NS system $\alpha=0$ and for $\alpha=0.5$.
We found that the near-Hagedorn solutions require higher and higher accuracy for smaller values of $\alpha$. The reason is that $\alpha$ controls the size of the potential for $\hat\chi$. At the extreme case of $\alpha=0$, the linear equation for $\hat\chi$ has a continuous normalizable spectrum above the Hagedorn temperature. As a result, below we treat $\alpha$ as a regulator for the simulation and plot $\alpha=0.01$ instead of $\alpha=0$.


As the solutions are monotonically decreasing functions of $x$, the initial value at $x=0$ sets the amplitude of the solution. Figure \ref{fig:chi0} shows the initial values $\hat\chi(0)$ (black), $\hat\varphi(0)$ (red) and $\hat\zeta(0)$ (blue) as a function of the temperature $\hat m^2$. 
For large $\hat m^2 \gg 1$ (lower temperatures) the solution amplitude seems to grow linearly with $\hat m^2$, or 
$|\chi| \sim \hat m^2/k \sim (R_0^2-R_H^2)/R_H^2$. This is the same scaling found for (higher dimensional) flat space solutions \cite{Chen:2021dsw}. As in flat space, the solution is no longer reliable at $|\chi| \sim (R_0^2-R_H^2)/R_H^2 \sim 1$ or for $\hat m^2 \sim k$. This is self-consistent, as we assumed $\hat m^2 \ll k$ to derive \eqref{eq:large_k_eqs_alpha}. Notice that the temperature regime considered for finite RR flux $\hat m^2 \sim \sqrt{k}$ is inside the regime of validity.

As expected, the solution merges with the trivial solution $\hat \chi = \hat \varphi = \hat \zeta = 0$ at the Hagedorn temperature $\hat m^2_c$ (drawn in green dashed line). Close to $\hat m^2_c$ the winding mode gets similar to the linear mode $\chi_\text{lin}$ found numerically above, while $|\hat\varphi|,|\hat\chi|\ll |\hat\chi|$ are much smaller. This behavior is similar to the one found for higher dimensional AdS string stars \cite{Urbach:2022xzw} as well as for finite RR flux above (which is the large $\alpha \sim k \gg 1$ limit of the simulation).

Figure \ref{fig:lengthscale} shows the size $L$ of the winding mode profile (in AdS units) as a function of the temperature. $L$ is defined as the value of $\rho$ at which the amplitude of $\chi$ reaches $e^{-1} \chi(0)$. The length grows with the temperature, as was found for finite $RR$ flux (including higher dimensions \cite{Urbach:2022xzw}). For finite $\hat m^2$ the size is at the AdS scale and bounded from above by the size of the linear solution at the Hagedorn temperature $\hat m^2=\hat m^2_c$. At lower temperatures, $\hat m^2 \gg 1$ the solution size reaches the string scale and the solutions are unreliable.

The normalized \ads{3} string star free energy $F$ \eqref{eq:F_def} is presented in figure \ref{fig:free_energy} as a function of the temperature. The free energy turns out to always be positive, which is not immediately clear from its form \eqref{eq:F_def}. The \ads{3} string star is therefore thermodynamically disfavored compared to the thermal \ads{3} solution. As we explain above, the solution is also non-perturbatively metastable due to the dominant BTZ solution. The free energy decreases with the temperature and goes to zero at the Hagedorn temperature when the solution becomes trivial.
General EFT arguments predict that close enough to the critical value $|\hat\chi| \sim (\hat m^2-\hat m^2_c)^{1/2}$ (and $|\hat\varphi|,|\hat\chi| \sim (\hat m^2-\hat m^2_c)^1$). As a result, we expect the euclidean action to scale as
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{String star} -I_{\text{TAdS}_3} \sim \frac{1}{G_N} k^{-7/2} (\hat m^2 - \hat m^2_c)^2 \sim \frac{l_{ads}^{-2}l_s^3}{G_N} \left(\frac{R_0-R_c}{R_c}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where in the last line we moved back to general units for brevity.

abstract = {In this note, we prove the equivalence, under appropriate conditions, between several dynamical formalisms: projected dynamical systems, two types of differential inclusions, and a class of complementarity dynamical systems. Each of these dynamical systems can also be considered as a hybrid dynamical system. This work both generalizes previous results and sheds some new light on the relationship between known formalisms; besides, it exclusively uses tools from convex analysis.}

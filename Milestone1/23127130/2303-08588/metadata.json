    "abstract": "Since the invention of dynamic diode, its physical properties and potential applications have attracted wide attentions. A lot of attempts have been made to harvest the rebounding current and voltage of dynamic diode. However, the underlying physical mechanism of its carrier transport characteristic was rarely explored carefully. Here, the electrical transport properties of the dynamic diode are systematically investigated with a mechanical motion tuned method, where the dynamic current-voltage curve shows a gentler growth trend compared to the static curve. The rebounding current increases with motion velocity and contact force, resulting in a reduced current with the same bias voltage and an oscillation current with a changing velocity and force. Besides, we propose a circuit model with an accurate mathematical formula expression to describe the oscillation current, where an imaginary parameter n0 is creatively added to the exponential growth term. This work shows a physical picture of adjust microscopic carrier motion with macroscopic mechanical motion, which provides strong theoretical support for designing dynamic diode devices with better performance in the future.",

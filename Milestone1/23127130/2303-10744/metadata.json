    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove that the multiplicative group of a unital non-commutative Leavitt path algebra $L_K(E)$ and Cohn path algebra $C_K(E)$ contain a non-cyclic free subgroup, provided $K$ is a non-absolute field. We also provide a description of the generators of free subgroups in term of the graph $E$. Finally, we determine multiplicative groups of Leavitt path algebras of some special types.",

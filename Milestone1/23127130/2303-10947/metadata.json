    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of flow fluctuations, incorporated in non boost-invariant blast-wave model, on kinetic freeze-out parameters of identified hadrons in low energy relativistic heavy-ion collisions. For the purpose of this study, we use the transverse momentum spectra of the identified hadrons produced in central Pb--Pb collisions, at SPS energies ranging from $\\rm E_{Lab}=20A-158A $ GeV, and analyze them within a modified non boost-invariant blast wave model. We perform simultaneous fits of the transverse momentum spectra for light hadrons ($π^{-}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $p$) and heavy strange hadrons ($Λ$, $\\barΛ$, $φ$, $Ξ^{\\pm}$, $Ω^{\\pm}$) seperately. We also fit the transverse momentum spectra of charmonia ($J/Ψ$, $Ψ'$) at $\\rm E_{Lab}=158A $ GeV. Our findings suggest that the inclusion of flow fluctuations enhances kinetic freeze-out temperature in case of light and heavy strange hadrons and reduces the corresponding transverse flow velocities. Moreover, we find that the kinetic freeze-out parameters of the charmonia at $\\rm E_{Lab}=158A $ GeV are least affected by inclusion of flow fluctuations. Based on this, we make predictions which can provide further insights on the role of flow fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",

    "abstract": "In decentralized optimization, several nodes connected by a network collaboratively minimize some objective function. For minimization of Lipschitz functions lower bounds are known along with optimal algorithms. We study a specific class of problems: linear models with nonsmooth loss functions. Our algorithm combines regularization and dual reformulation to get an effective optimization method with complexity better than the lower bounds.",

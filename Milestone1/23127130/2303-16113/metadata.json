    "abstract": "Due to mutual interference between users, power allocation problems in wireless networks are often non-convex and computationally challenging. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach to tackling these problems and an approach that exploits the underlying topology of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel graph representation method for wireless networks that include full-duplex (FD) nodes. We then design a corresponding FD Graph Neural Network (F-GNN) with the aim of allocating transmit powers to maximise the network throughput. Our results show that our F-GNN achieves state-of-art performance with significantly less computation time. Besides, F-GNN offers an excellent trade-off between performance and complexity compared to classical approaches. We further refine this trade-off by introducing a distance-based threshold for inclusion or exclusion of edges in the network. We show that an appropriately chosen threshold reduces required training time by roughly 20% with a relatively minor loss in performance.",

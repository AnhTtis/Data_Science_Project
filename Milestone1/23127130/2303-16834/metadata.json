    "abstract": "We prove that amongst the class of free-by-cyclic groups, Gromov hyperbolicity is an invariant of the profinite completion. We show that whenever $G$ is a free-by-cyclic group with first Betti number equal to one, and $H$ is a free-by-cyclic group which is profinitely isomorphic to $G$, the ranks of the fibres and the characteristic polynomials associated to the monodromies of $G$ and $H$ are equal. We further show that for hyperbolic free-by-cyclic groups with first Betti number equal to one, the stretch factors of the associated monodromy and its inverse is an invariant of the profinite completion. We deduce that irreducible free-by-cyclic groups with first Betti number equal to one are almost profinitely rigid amongst irreducible free-by-cyclic groups. We use this to prove that generic free-by-cyclic groups are almost profinitely rigid amongst free-by-cyclic groups. We also show a similar results for {universal Coxeter}-by-cyclic groups.",

This broken symmetry state is degenerate in the spin orientation and we show that, associated with this degeneracy, the system has topological solitons. The solitons appear at the interface between degenerate ground states. These solitons are the relevant charge excitations in the system. When charge is added to the nanoribbon, the system energetically prefers to create magnetic domains and accommodate the extra electrons in the interface solitons rather than setting them in the conduction band.}

abstract = {Graphene, or single-layered graphite, with its high crystallinity and interesting semimetal electronic properties, has emerged as an exciting two-dimensional material showing great promise for the fabrication of nanoscale devices. Thin, elongated strips of graphene that possess straight edges, termed graphene ribbons, gradually transform from semiconductors to semimetals as their width increases, and represent a particularly versatile variety of graphene. Several lithographic, chemical and synthetic procedures are known to produce microscopic samples of graphene nanoribbons, and one chemical vapour deposition process has successfully produced macroscopic quantities of nanoribbons at 950°C. Here we describe a simple solution-based oxidative process for producing a nearly 100% yield of nanoribbon structures by lengthwise cutting and unravelling of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) side walls. Although oxidative shortening of MWCNTs has previously been achieved, lengthwise cutting is hitherto unreported. Ribbon structures with high water solubility are obtained. Subsequent chemical reduction of the nanoribbons from MWCNTs results in restoration of electrical conductivity. These early results affording nanoribbons could eventually lead to applications in fields of electronics and composite materials where bulk quantities of nanoribbons are required. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The possibility that non-magnetic materials such as carbon could exhibit a novel type of s-p electron magnetism has attracted much attention over the years, not least because such magnetic order is predicted to be stable at high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that atomic-scale structural defects of graphene can host unpaired spins, but it remains unclear under what conditions long-range magnetic order can emerge from such defect-bound magnetic moments. Here we propose that, in contrast to random defect distributions, atomic-scale engineering of graphene edges with specific crystallographic orientation - comprising edge atoms from only one sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene lattice - can give rise to a robust magnetic order. We use a nanofabrication technique based on scanning tunnelling microscopy to define graphene nanoribbons with nanometre precision and well-defined crystallographic edge orientations. Although so-called "armchair" ribbons display quantum confinement gaps, ribbons with the "zigzag" edge structure that are narrower than 7 nanometres exhibit an electronic bandgap of about 0.2-0.3 electronvolts, which can be identified as a signature of interaction-induced spin ordering along their edges. Moreover, upon increasing the ribbon width, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is revealed, indicating the switching of the magnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic configuration. We found that the magnetic order on graphene edges of controlled zigzag orientation can be stable even at room temperature, raising hopes of graphene-based spintronic devices operating under ambient conditions.},

In spite of the exceptional electronic properties of carbon nanotubes, only basic demonstration devices have been realized that require time-consuming processes. This is mainly due to a lack of selective growth and reliable assembly processes for nanotubes. However, graphene offers an attractive alternative. Here we report the patterning of graphene nanoribbons and bent junctions with nanometre-precision, well-defined widths and predetermined crystallographic orientations, allowing us to fully engineer their electronic structure using scanning tunnelling microscope lithography. The atomic structure and electronic properties of the ribbons have been investigated by scanning tunnelling microscopy and tunnelling spectroscopy measurements. Opening of confinement gaps up to 0.5 eV, enabling room-temperature operation of graphene nanoribbon-based devices, is reported. This method avoids the difficulties of assembling nanoscale components and may prove useful in the realization of complete integrated circuits, operating as room-temperature ballistic electronic devices. {\textcopyright} 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The all-semiconducting nature of sub-10-nm GNRs could bypass the problem of the extreme chirality dependence of the metal or semiconductor nature of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in future electronics. Currently, making GNRs using lithographic, chemical or sonochemical methods is challenging. It is difficult to obtain GNRs with smooth edges and controllable widths at high yields. Here we show an approach to making GNRs by unzipping multiwalled carbon nanotubes by plasma etching of nanotubes partly embedded in a polymer film. The GNRs have smooth edges and a narrow width distribution (10-20 nm). Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements reveal the high quality of the GNRs. Unzipping CNTs with well-defined structures in an array will allow the production of GNRs with controlled widths, edge structures, placement and alignment in a scalable fashion for device integration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, producing nanoribbons of very high quality, or in high volumes, remains a challenge. Here, we show that pristine few-layer nanoribbons can be produced by unzipping mildly gas-phase oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes using mechanical sonication in an organic solvent. The nanoribbons are of very high quality, with smooth edges (as seen by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy), low ratios of disorder to graphitic Raman bands, and the highest electrical conductance and mobility reported so far (up to 5e2 /h and 1,500cm-2 V-1 s-1 for ribbons 10-20nm in width). Furthermore, at low temperatures, the nanoribbons show phase-coherent transport and Fabry-Perot interference, suggesting minimal defects and edge roughness. The yield of nanoribbons is ∼2% of the starting raw nanotube soot material, significantly higher than previous methods capable of producing high-quality narrow nanoribbons.

Molecular dynamics simulations showed that PER was uniaxially aligned along the nanochannels of the MOF through host-guest interactions, which allowed for regulated growth of the nanoribbons.

abstract = {Topological insulators are an emerging class of materials that host highly robust in-gap surface or interface states while maintaining an insulating bulk1,2. Most advances in this field have focused on topological insulators and related topological crystalline insulators3 in two dimensions4–6 and three dimensions7–10, but more recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)11. The topological phase of these laterally confined, semiconducting strips of graphene is determined by their width, edge shape and terminating crystallographic unit cell and is characterized by a Z2 invariant12 (that is, an index of either 0 or 1, indicating two topological classes—similar to quasi-one-dimensional solitonic systems13–16). Interfaces between topologically distinct GNRs characterized by different values of Z2 are predicted to support half-filled, in-gap localized electronic states that could, in principle, be used as a tool for material engineering11. Here we present the rational design and experimental realization of a topologically engineered GNR superlattice that hosts a one-dimensional array of such states, thus generating otherwise inaccessible electronic structures. This strategy also enables new end states to be engineered directly into the termini of the one-dimensional GNR superlattice. Atomically precise topological GNR superlattices were synthesized from molecular precursors on a gold surface, Au(111), under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and characterized by low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experimental results and first-principles calculations reveal that the frontier band structure (the bands bracketing filled and empty states) of these GNR superlattices is defined purely by the coupling between adjacent topological interface states. This manifestation of non-trivial one-dimensional topological phases presents a route to band engineering in one-dimensional materials based on precise control of their electronic topology, and is a promising platform for studies of one-dimensional quantum spin physics.},

The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* ≈ 106 m s -1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2.

abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction - a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Magnetic materials and nanostructures based on carbon offer unique opportunities for future technological applications such as spintronics. This paper reviews graphene-derived systems in which magnetic correlations emerge as a result of reduced dimensions, disorder and other possible scenarios. In particular, zero-dimensional graphene nanofragments, one-dimensional graphene nanoribbons and defect-induced magnetism in graphene and graphite are covered. Possible physical mechanisms of the emergence of magnetism in these systems are illustrated with the help of computational examples based on simple model Hamiltonians. In addition, this review covers spin-transport properties, proposed designs of graphene-based spintronic devices, magnetic ordering at finite temperatures as well as the most recent experimental achievements.}

abstract = {Although the unconventional $\pi$-magnetism at the zigzag edges of graphene holds promise for a wide array of applications, whether and to what degree it plays a role in their chemistry remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the addition of a hydrogen atom─the simplest yet the most experimentally relevant adsorbate─to zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). We show that the $\pi$-magnetism governs the chemistry of ZGNRs, giving rise to a site-dependent reactivity of the carbon atoms and driving the hydrogenation process to the nanoribbon edges. Conversely, the chemisorbed hydrogen atom governs the $\pi$-magnetism of ZGNRs, acting as a spin-1/2 paramagnetic center in the otherwise antiferromagnetic ground state and spin-polarizing the charge carriers at the band extrema. Our findings establish a comprehensive picture of the peculiar interplay between chemistry and magnetism that emerges at the zigzag edges of graphene.},

@article{cai2010,
abstract = {Graphene nanoribbons-narrow and straight-edged stripes of graphene, or single-layer graphite-are predicted to exhibit electronic properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of nanoscale electronic devices. In particular, although the two-dimensional parent material graphene exhibits semimetallic behaviour, quantum confinement and edge effects should render all graphene nanoribbons with widths smaller than 10-nm semiconducting. But exploring the potential of graphene nanoribbons is hampered by their limited availability: although they have been made using chemical, sonochemical and lithographic methods as well as through the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, the reliable production of graphene nanoribbons smaller than 10-nm with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple method for the production of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons of different topologies and widths, which uses surface-assisted coupling of molecular precursors into linear polyphenylenes and their subsequent cyclodehydrogenation. The topology, width and edge periphery of the graphene nanoribbon products are defined by the structure of the precursor monomers, which can be designed to give access to a wide range of different graphene nanoribbons. We expect that our bottom-up approach to the atomically precise fabrication of graphene nanoribbons will finally enable detailed experimental investigations of the properties of this exciting class of materials. It should even provide a route to graphene nanoribbon structures with engineered chemical and electronic properties, including the theoretically predicted intraribbon quantum dots, superlattice structures and magnetic devices based on specific graphene nanoribbon edge states. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To date, this state has been observed directly only in two-dimensional systems. Here, using low-temperature single-electron transport spectroscopy, we show that the hole gas in low-disorder semiconducting carbon nanotubes forms a one-dimensional Wigner crystal. In an axial magnetic field, we observe three distinct regimes of spin and isospin polarization as carrier density is varied. We explain these regimes in terms of a Wigner crystal picture based on a gapped Luttinger liquid model, with the carriers represented by spatially localized solitons. Our observations could enable greater control over the behaviour of the spatially separated system of carriers. Such control, combined with the inherently long coherence times of carriers in carbon nanotubes, could prove useful in the development of solid-state quantum computing. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

The electronic structure of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and quantum dots (GQDs) has been predicted to depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation of their edges; however, the influence of edge structure has not been verified experimentally. Here, we use tunnelling spectroscopy to show that the electronic structure of GNRs and GQDs with 2-20 nm lateral dimensions varies on the basis of the graphene edge lattice symmetry. Predominantly zigzag-edge GQDs with 7-8 nm average dimensions are metallic owing to the presence of zigzag edge states. GNRs with a higher fraction of zigzag edges exhibit a smaller energy gap than a predominantly armchair-edge ribbon of similar width, and the magnitudes of the measured GNR energy gaps agree with recent theoretical calculations.},

abstract = {A central question in the field of graphene-related research is how graphene behaves when it is patterned at the nanometre scale with different edge geometries. A fundamental shape relevant to this question is the graphene nanoribbon (GNR), a narrow strip of graphene that can have different chirality depending on the angle at which it is cut. Such GNRs have been predicted to exhibit a wide range of behaviour, including tunable energy gaps 1,2 and the presence of one-dimensional (1D) edge states 3-5 with unusual magnetic structure 6,7 . Most GNRs measured up to now have been characterized by means of their electrical conductivity, leaving the relationship between electronic structure and local atomic geometry unclear 8-10 . Here we present a sub-nanometre-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) study of GNRs that allows us to examine how GNR electronic structure depends on the chirality of atomically well-defined GNR edges. The GNRs used here were chemically synthesized using carbon nanotube (CNT) unzipping methods that allow flexible variation of GNR width, length, chirality, and substrate 11,12 . Our STS measurements reveal the presence of 1D GNR edge states, the behaviour of which matches theoretical expectations for GNRs of similar width and chirality, including width-dependent energy splitting of the GNR edge state. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Boundaries between distinct topological phases of matter support robust, yet exotic quantum states such as spin–momentum locked transport channels or Majorana fermions1–3. The idea of using such states in spintronic devices or as qubits in quantum information technology is a strong driver of current research in condensed matter physics4–6. The topological properties of quantum states have helped to explain the conductivity of doped trans-polyacetylene in terms of dispersionless soliton states7–9. In their seminal paper, Su, Schrieffer and Heeger (SSH) described these exotic quantum states using a one-dimensional tight-binding model10,11. Because the SSH model describes chiral topological insulators, charge fractionalization and spin–charge separation in one dimension, numerous efforts have been made to realize the SSH Hamiltonian in cold-atom, photonic and acoustic experimental configurations12–14. It is, however, desirable to rationally engineer topological electronic phases into stable and processable materials to exploit the corresponding quantum states. Here we present a flexible strategy based on atomically precise graphene nanoribbons to design robust nanomaterials exhibiting the valence electronic structures described by the SSH Hamiltonian15–17. We demonstrate the controlled periodic coupling of topological boundary states18 at junctions of graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges to create quasi-one-dimensional trivial and non-trivial electronic quantum phases. This strategy has the potential to tune the bandwidth of the topological electronic bands close to the energy scale of proximity-induced spin–orbit coupling19 or superconductivity20, and may allow the realization of Kitaev-like Hamiltonians3 and Majorana-type end states21.},

abstract = {Zigzag edges of graphene nanostructures host localized electronic states that are predicted to be spin-polarized. However, these edge states are highly susceptible to edge roughness and interaction with a supporting substrate, complicating the study of their intrinsic electronic and magnetic structure. Here, we focus on atomically precise graphene nanoribbons whose two short zigzag edges host exactly one localized electron each. Using the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope, the graphene nanoribbons are transferred from the metallic growth substrate onto insulating islands of NaCl in order to decouple their electronic structure from the metal. The absence of charge transfer and hybridization with the substrate is confirmed by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, which reveals a pair of occupied/unoccupied edge states. Their large energy splitting of 1.9 eV is in accordance with ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations and reflects the dominant role of electron–electron interactions in these localized states.},

@article{cui2016,
abstract = {Precise spatial control of the spin propagation channels is of fundamental and practical importance in future graphene-based spintronic devices. Here we use first-principles calculations to show that when narrow zigzag graphene nanoribbons are connected to form junctions or superlattices, properly placed square-shaped carbon tetragons not only serve as effective bundles of the two incoming spin edge channels, but also act as definitive topological spin switches for the two outgoing channels. The nanoribbon segments are largely drawn from different acene molecules. We further show that such spin switches can lift the degeneracy between the two spin propagation channels, which enables tunability of different magnetic states upon charge doping. Preliminary experimental supports for the realization of such tetragons connecting nanoribbon segments are also presented.},

@article{blackwell2021,
abstract = {Spin-ordered electronic states in hydrogen-terminated zigzag nanographene give rise to magnetic quantum phenomena1,2 that have sparked renewed interest in carbon-based spintronics3,4. Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs)—quasi one-dimensional semiconducting strips of graphene bounded by parallel zigzag edges—host intrinsic electronic edge states that are ferromagnetically ordered along the edges of the ribbon and antiferromagnetically coupled across its width1,2,5. Despite recent advances in the bottom-up synthesis of GNRs featuring symmetry protected topological phases6–8 and even metallic zero mode bands9, the unique magnetic edge structure of ZGNRs has long been obscured from direct observation by a strong hybridization of the zigzag edge states with the surface states of the underlying support10–15. Here, we present a general technique to thermodynamically stabilize and electronically decouple the highly reactive spin-polarized edge states by introducing a superlattice of substitutional N-atom dopants along the edges of a ZGNR. First-principles GW calculations and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal a giant spin splitting of low-lying nitrogen lone-pair flat bands by an exchange field ($\sim$850 tesla) induced by the ferromagnetically ordered edge states of ZGNRs. Our findings directly corroborate the nature of the predicted emergent magnetic order in ZGNRs and provide a robust platform for their exploration and functional integration into nanoscale sensing and logic devices15–21.},

@article{dutta2012,
abstract = {Graphene and its quasi-one-dimensional counterpart, graphene nanoribbons, present an ideal platform for tweaking their unique electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties by various means for potential next-generation device applications. However, such tweaking requires knowledge of the electron-electron interactions that play a crucial role in these confined geometries. Here, we have investigated the magnetic and conducting properties of zigzag edge graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using the many-body configuration interaction (CI) method on the basis of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. For the half-filled case, the many-body ground state shows a ferromagnetic spin-spin correlation along the zigzag edge, which supports the picture obtained from one-electron theory. However, hole doping reduces the spin and charge excitation gap, making the ground state conducting and magnetic. We also provide a two-state model that explains the low-lying charge and spin excitation spectrum of ZGNRs. An experimental setup to confirm the hole-mediated conducting and magnetic states is discussed.},

@article{pizzochero2021,
abstract = {We unveil the nature of the structural disorder in bottom-up zigzag graphene nanoribbons along with its effect on the magnetism and electronic transport on the basis of scanning probe microscopies and first-principles calculations. We find that edge-missing m-xylene units emerging during the cyclodehydrogenation step of the on-surface synthesis are the most common point defects. These "bite"defects act as spin-1 paramagnetic centers, severely disrupt the conductance spectrum around the band extrema, and give rise to spin-polarized charge transport. We further show that the electronic conductance across graphene nanoribbons is more sensitive to "bite"defects forming at the zigzag edges than at the armchair ones. Our work establishes a comprehensive understanding of the low-energy electronic properties of disordered bottom-up graphene nanoribbons.},

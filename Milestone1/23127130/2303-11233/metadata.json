    "abstract": "This paper considers the sparse recovery with shuffled labels, i.e., $\\by = \\bPitrue \\bX \\bbetatrue + \\bw$, where $\\by \\in \\RR^n$, $\\bPi\\in \\RR^{n\\times n}$, $\\bX\\in \\RR^{n\\times p}$, $\\bbetatrue\\in \\RR^p$, $\\bw \\in \\RR^n$ denote the sensing result, the unknown permutation matrix, the design matrix, the sparse signal, and the additive noise, respectively. Our goal is to reconstruct both the permutation matrix $\\bPitrue$ and the sparse signal $\\bbetatrue$. We investigate this problem from both the statistical and computational aspects. From the statistical aspect, we first establish the minimax lower bounds on the sample number $n$ and the \\emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\\snr$) for the correct recovery of permutation matrix $\\bPitrue$ and the support set $\\supp(\\bbetatrue)$, to be more specific, $n \\gtrsim k\\log p$ and $\\log\\snr \\gtrsim \\log n + \\frac{k\\log p}{n}$. Then, we confirm the tightness of these minimax lower bounds by presenting an exhaustive-search based estimator whose performance matches the lower bounds thereof up to some multiplicative constants. From the computational aspect, we impose a parsimonious assumption on the number of permuted rows and propose a computationally-efficient estimator accordingly. Moreover, we show that our proposed estimator can obtain the ground-truth $(\\bPitrue, \\supp(\\bbetatrue))$ under mild conditions. Furthermore, we provide numerical experiments to corroborate our claims.",

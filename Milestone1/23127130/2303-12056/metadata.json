    "abstract": "This proceeding discusses the impact of XUV/X-ray irradiation on materials, and how their response is affected by temperature, size, and structure. When materials are exposed to intense XUV/X-ray irradiation, they undergo a series of processes ultimately leading to observable structure modification and damage. These effects were studied with a hybrid simulation tool XTANT-3. The code combines several methods in one interconnected model: the photon absorption and electron cascades are simulated with transport Monte Carlo; nonequilibrium kinetics of slow electrons (in the valence and the bottom of the conduction band) is traced with the Boltzmann equation; modeling evolution of the electronic structure and interatomic potential is done with the transferable tight binding method; and the response of the atomic system is simulated with the molecular dynamics. Combining these methods enabled the tracing of the essential effects of irradiation. This brief review summarizes the recent results obtained with this simulation tool.",

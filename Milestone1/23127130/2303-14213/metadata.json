    "abstract": "This research examines the propagation of rumors on social networks during public health emergencies and explores strategies to effectively manage false information in cyberspace. Using a simulation model, the study analyzes the impact of factors such as communication channel control, government intervention, and individual personalities on the spread of rumors. The results suggest that enhancing netizens' knowledge and capacity to recognize and resist rumors, developing rumor-debunking platforms, and promoting a \"clear\" ecology of network information content are effective strategies for controlling false information in cyberspace. However, the complexity and scale of actual networks present challenges to the development of a comprehensive cyberspace governance system. The findings offer practical guidelines for improving the effectiveness of governance in managing the spread of rumors on social networks.",

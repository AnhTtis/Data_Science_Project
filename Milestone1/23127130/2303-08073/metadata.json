    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct the Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra in the framework of the $\\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-deformed quantum algebras. Moreover, the $\\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-Heisenberg-Witt $n$-algebras is also investigated. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of the elliptic hermitian matrix models. We use the constraints to evaluate the $\\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-differential operators of the Virasoro algebra and generalize it to higher order differential operators. Particular cases corresponding to quantum algebras existing in literature are deduced.",

    "abstract": "Let $Φ'$ denote the strong dual of a nuclear space $Φ$. In this paper we introduce sufficient conditions for the convergence uniform on compacts in probability for a sequence of $Φ'$-valued processes with continuous or cádlàg paths. We use these results to introduce a topology on the space of $Φ'$-valued semimartingales which are good integrators. This is done under the assumption that $Φ$ is either a Fréchet nuclear space or the strict inductive limit of Fréchet nuclear spaces. In particular, we show that this topology is complete and that the stochastic integral mapping is continuous on the integrators.",

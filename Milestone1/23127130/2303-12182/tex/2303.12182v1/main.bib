	abstract = {The present work focuses on Kinematics, Localization and closed loop motion control of a differential drive mobile robot which is capable of navigating to a desired goal location in an obstacle free static indoor environment. Two trajectory planning approaches are made (i) the robot is rotated to eliminate orientation error and then translate to overcome distance error (ii) Both rotational and translational motion is given to the robot to overcome orientation and distance error simultaneously. Localization is estimated by integrating the robot movement in a fixed sampling frequency. The control law is based on kinematics model which provides updated reference speed to the high frequency PID control of DC motor. Stability of proposed control law is validated by Lyapunov Criterion. Both experimental and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the achieved control algorithms and their efficient implementation on a two wheeled differential drive mobile robot using an 8-bit microcontroller.},

	abstract = {Several authors have proposed some methoh for applying path following in specijic cases to mobile robots ([3J [9], [ I l l , etc.). When we hy to extend the path following approach to the general problem several dsy7culties arise. In this paper we present a generalized technique to apply path following to a mobile robot with nonholonomic constraints.As an application example, we expose the case of mobile robots with a higher degree of maneuverability than the typical car-like robots. In particular we consider a robot that can turn around itself making a zero-radius turn; a case still not resolved asfar as we know. Finally we propose a suitable control law for this example that ensures asymptotical convergence.},

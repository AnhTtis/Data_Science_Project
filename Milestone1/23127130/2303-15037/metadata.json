    "abstract": "The general relativistic Poynting-Robertson (PR) effect is a very important dissipative phenomenon occurring in high-energy astrophysics. Recently, it has been proposed a new model, which upgrades the two-dimensional (2D) description in the three-dimensional (3D) case in Kerr spacetime. The radiation field is considered as constituted by photons emitted from a rigidly rotating spherical source around the compact object. Such dynamical system admits the existence of a critical hypersurface, region where the gravitational and radiation forces balance and the matter reaches it at the end of its motion. Selected test particle orbits are displayed. We show how to prove the stability of these critical hypersurfaces within the Lyapunov theory. Then, we present how to study such effect under the Lagrangian formalism, explaining how to analytically derive the Rayleigh potential for the radiation force. In conclusion, further developments and future projects are discussed.",

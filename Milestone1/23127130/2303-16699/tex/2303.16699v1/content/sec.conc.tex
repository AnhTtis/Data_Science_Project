In this work, we have settled the complexity of the satisfiability problems for \hyltl and \hyctlstar. In both cases, we significantly increased the lower bounds, i.e.\ from $\Sigma_1^0$ and $\Sigma_1^1$ to  $\Sigma_1^1$ and $\Sigma_1^2$, respectively, and presented the first upper bounds, which are tight in both cases.
Along the way, we also determined the complexity of restricted variants, e.g.\ \hyltl satisfiability restricted to ultimately periodic traces (or, equivalently, to finite traces) is still $\Sigma_1^1$-complete while \hyctlstar satisfiability restricted to finite transition systems is $\Sigma_1^0$-complete.
Furthermore, we proved that both countable and the finitely-branching satisfiability for \hyctlstar are as hard as truth in second-order arithmetic.
As a key step in our proofs, we showed a tight bound of $\contcard$ on the size of minimal models for satisfiable \hyctlstar sentences.
Finally, we also showed that deciding membership in any level of the \hyltl quantifier alternation hierarchy is $\Pi_1^1$-complete. 

Thus our results show that satisfiability is highly undecidable, both for \hyltl and even more so for \hyctlstar. 
Note that both logics are synchronous, i.e.\ time passes at the same rate on all traces/paths under consideration.
Recently, several asynchronous logics for the specification of hyperproperties have been presented~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/BartocciFHNC22,DBLP:conf/cav/BaumeisterCBFS21,DBLP:conf/lics/BozzelliPS21,DBLP:journals/pacmpl/GutsfeldMO21,GutsfeldMO20}. 
Similarly, logics for probabilistic hyperproperties have been introduced~\cite{DBLP:conf/qest/AbrahamB18,DBLP:conf/nfm/DobeWABB22,DBLP:conf/atva/AbrahamBBD20,DimitrovaFT20}.
For both classes, the exact complexity of the satisfiability problems has, to the best of our knowledge, not been studied in detail.

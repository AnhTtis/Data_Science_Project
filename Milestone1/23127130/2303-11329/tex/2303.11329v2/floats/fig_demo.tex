{\bf Real video.} We play music using a speaker and record a video using iPhone with a binaural microphone~(different from training examples). We show the predicted camera rotation and sound direction over time.
They change smoothly and match our camera motion. Please see our \href{https://ificl.github.io/SLfM}{project webpage} for video results.

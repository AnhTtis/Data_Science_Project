    \caption{{\bf Qualitative results on HM3D-SS.} Given two images and their corresponding audio at the source viewpoints, our approach can individually predict the relative camera pose and localize sound locations  accurately. We visualize our camera rotation prediction with \textcolor{blue}{blue} bar and our sound angle prediction with \textcolor{orange}{orange} bar. To highlight the subtle differences in the waveforms, we color code the amplitude. Please see the \href{https://ificl.github.io/SLfM}{project webpage} for more video results.}

{\bf Estimating camera pose from audio prompting.} We estimate camera rotation by providing our cross-view binauralization model with synthetically generated audio prompts. Given the sound that it predicts, we infer the camera angle. We do this by finding the nearest neighbor (using IID cues) to a database of synthetic sounds, each paired with their corresponding angle.

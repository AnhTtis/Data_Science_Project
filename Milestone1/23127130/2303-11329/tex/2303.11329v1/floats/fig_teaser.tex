{\bf Images and sounds change in geometrically consistent ways.} 
For example, when we rotate to the right, a sound source that is initially in front of us becomes louder in our left ear. We use these cues to jointly train models for two tasks: localizing sounds from binaural audio and estimating camera rotation from images. The two models are trained entirely through self-supervision, by learning to produce outputs that agree with one other.

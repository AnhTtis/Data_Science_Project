              the retinal image is transformed considerably by commonly
              occurring changes in the environment. A local learning rule
              is proposed, which allows a network to learn to generalize
              across such transformations. During the learning phase, the
              network is exposed to temporal sequences of patterns
              undergoing the transformation. An application of the
              algorithm is presented in which the network learns
              invariance to shift in retinal position. Such a principle
              may be involved in the development of the characteristic
              shift invariance property of complex cells in the primary
              visual cortex, and also in the development of more
              complicated invariance properties of neurons in higher

  abstract = {Learning by temporal association rules such as Foldiak’s
              trace rule [1] is an attractive hypothesis that explains
              the development of invariance in visual recognition.
              Consistent with these rules, several recent experiments
              have shown that invariance can be broken by appropriately
              altering the visual environment but found puzzling
              diﬀerences in the effects at the psychophysical [2, 3]
              versus single cell [4, 5] level. We show a) that
              associative learning provides appropriate invariance in
              models of object recognition inspired by Hubel and Wiesel
              [6], b) that we can replicate the ”invariance
              disruption” experiments using these models with a
              temporal association learning rule to develop and maintain
              invariance, and c) that we can thereby explain the apparent
              discrepancies between psychophysics and singe cells
              eﬀects. We argue that these models account for the
              stability of perceptual invariance despite the underlying
              plasticity of the system, the variability of the visual
              world and expected noise in the biological mechanisms.},

  abstract   = {Concepts of objects as enduring and complete across space
                and time have been documented in infants within several
                months after birth, but little is known about how such
                concepts arise during development. Current theories that
                stress innate knowledge may neglect the potential
                contributions of experience to guide acquisition of object
                concepts. To examine whether learning plays an important
                role in early development of object representations, we
                used an eye-tracking paradigm with 4- and 6-month-old
                infants who were provided with an initial period of
                experience viewing an unoccluded trajectory, or no
                experience with this particular stimulus. After exposure to
                the unoccluded trajectory for only 2 min, there was a
                reliable increase in 4-month-old infants' anticipatory eye
                movement when the infants subsequently viewed
                occluded-trajectory displays, relative to 4-month-old
                infants who did not receive this experience. This effect of
                training in 4-month-old infants was found to generalize to
                another category of trajectory orientation. Older infants
                received no additional benefit from training, most likely
                because they enter the task capable of forming robust
                object representations under these conditions. This finding
                provides compelling evidence that very brief training
                facilitated formation of object representations, and
                suggests more generally that infants learn such
                representations from real-world experience viewing objects
                undergoing occlusion and disocclusion.},

  abstract = {Object recognition is challenging because each object
              produces myriad retinal images. Responses of neurons from
              the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to
              different objects, yet tolerant ("invariant") to changes in
              object position, scale, and pose. How does the brain
              construct this neuronal tolerance? We report a form of
              neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution.
              Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of
              visual experience caused specific changes in IT position
              tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning
              (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was
              significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour.
              Together with previous theoretical work and human object
              perception experiments, we speculate that UTL may reflect
              the mechanism by which the visual stream builds and
              maintains tolerant object representations.},

              ventral visual stream (inferior temporal cortex, IT), we
              here test if this is a general tolerance learning
              mechanism. First, we found that the same type of
              unsupervised experience that reshaped IT position tolerance
              also predictably reshaped IT size tolerance, and the
              magnitude of reshaping was quantitatively similar. Second,
              this tolerance reshaping can be induced under naturally
              occurring dynamic visual experience, even without eye
              movements. Third, unsupervised temporal contiguous
              experience can build new neuronal tolerance. These results
              suggest that the ventral visual stream uses a general
              unsupervised tolerance learning (UTL) algorithm to build
              its invariant object representation.},

  abstract = {Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning
              rule that modifies synaptic strength as a function of the
              relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. When a
              neuron is repeatedly presented with similar inputs, STDP is
              known to have the effect of concentrating high synaptic
              weights on afferents that systematically fire early, while
              postsynaptic spike latencies decrease. Here we use this
              learning rule in an asynchronous feedforward spiking neural
              network that mimics the ventral visual pathway and shows
              that when the network is presented with natural images,
              selectivity to intermediate-complexity visual features
              emerges. Those features, which correspond to prototypical
              patterns that are both salient and consistently present in
              the images, are highly informative and enable robust object
              recognition, as demonstrated on various classification
              tasks. Taken together, these results show that temporal
              codes may be a key to understanding the phenomenal
              processing speed achieved by the visual system and that
              STDP can lead to fast and selective responses.},

  abstract = {Identifying the same physical point in more than one
              image, the correspondence problem, is vital in motion
              analysis. Most research for establishing correspondence
              uses only two frames of a sequence to solve this problem.
              By using a sequence of frames, it is possible to exploit
              the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot
              change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion, it
              is possible to solve the correspondence problem for
              arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene. We
              formulate the correspondence problem as an optimization
              problem and propose an iterative algorithm to find
              trajectories of points in a monocular image sequence. A
              modified form of this algorithm is useful in case of
              occlusion also. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
              approach considering synthetic, laboratory, and real
              scenes.},

  abstract = {The cerebral cortex utilizes spatiotemporal continuity in
              the world to help build invariant representations. In
              vision, these might be representations of objects. The
              temporal continuity typical of objects has been used in an
              associative learning rule with a short-term memory trace to
              help build invariant object representations. In this paper,
              we show that spatial continuity can also provide a basis
              for helping a system to self-organize invariant
              representations. We introduce a new learning paradigm
              “continuous transformation learning” which operates by
              mapping spatially similar input patterns to the same
              postsynaptic neurons in a competitive learning system. As
              the inputs move through the space of possible continuous
              transforms (e.g. translation, rotation, etc.), the active
              synapses are modified onto the set of postsynaptic neurons.
              Because other transforms of the same stimulus overlap with
              previously learned exemplars, a common set of postsynaptic
              neurons is activated by the new transforms, and learning of
              the new active inputs onto the same postsynaptic neurons is
              facilitated. We demonstrate that a hierarchical model of
              cortical processing in the ventral visual system can be
              trained with continuous transform learning, and highlight
              differences in the learning of invariant representations to
              those achieved by trace learning.},

  abstract = {As the orientation or illumination of an object changes so
              does its appearance. This paper considers how observers are
              nonetheless able to recognize objects that have undergone
              such changes. In particular the paper tests the hypothesis
              that observers rely on temporal correlations between
              different object views to decide whether they are views of
              the same object or not. In a series of experiments subjects
              were shown a sequence of views representing a slowly
              transforming object. Testing revealed that subjects had
              formed object representations which were directly
              influenced by the temporal characteristics of the training
              views. In particular, introducing spurious correlations
              between views of different people's heads caused subjects
              to regard those views as being of a single person. This
              rapid and robust overriding of basic generalization
              processes supports the view that our recognition system
              tracks the correlated appearance of views of objects across
              time. Such view associations appear to allow the visual
              system to solve the view invariance problem without
              recourse to complex illumination models for extracting 3D
              form, or the use of the image plane transformations
              required to make appearance-based comparisons. (PsycINFO

              recordings of single cells in the inferotemporal cortex of
              the macaque monkey (Miyashita 1988 Nature 335 817-20). He
              described the responses of neurons to a sequence of random
              fractal pattern images, and how many of the neurons tested
              were seen to respond strongly to a subset of the images on
              the basis of sequence presentation order, i.e. appearance
              in time, rather than their spatial similarity. In this
              work, I describe a local, Hebb-like learning rule which in
              conjunction with a simple feedforward neural architecture
              is capable of replicating the type of temporal-order
              association apparent in the cells from which he made
              recordings. The paper also advances reasons for requiring
              such learning by describing its possible role in
              establishing transformation invariant representations of

                 model of motion perception whereby measurements from
                 different image regions are combined according to a
                 Bayesian estimator --- the estimated motion maximizes the
                 posterior probability assuming a prior favoring slow and
                 smooth velocities. In reviewing a large number of
                 previously published phenomena we find that the Bayesian
                 estimator predicts a wide range of psychophysical results.
                 This suggests that the seemingly complex set of illusions
                 arise from a single computational strategy that is optimal

  abstract   = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are
                useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature
                analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or
                slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It
                is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and
                application of principal component analysis to this
                expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed
                to find the optimal solution within a family of functions
                directly and can learn to extract a large number of
                decorrelated features, which are ordered by their degree of
                invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process
                high-dimensional input signals and extract complex
                features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning
                properties based on simple cell output, including disparity
                and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions
                are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a
                hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a
                simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured
                network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast,
                or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for
                one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training
                stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice
                to achieve good generalization to new objects. The
                generated representation is suitable for object
                recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained
                to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

              Yet relatively little is known about the environmental
              factors that cause invariant object recognition to emerge
              in the newborn brain. Is this ability a hardwired property
              of vision? Or does the development of invariant object
              recognition require experience with a particular kind of
              visual environment? Here, we used a high-throughput
              controlled-rearing method to examine whether newborn chicks
              (Gallus gallus) require visual experience with slowly
              changing objects to develop invariant object recognition
              abilities. When newborn chicks were raised with a slowly
              rotating virtual object, the chicks built invariant object
              representations that generalized across novel viewpoints
              and rotation speeds. In contrast, when newborn chicks were
              raised with a virtual object that rotated more quickly, the
              chicks built viewpoint-specific object representations that
              failed to generalize to novel viewpoints and rotation
              speeds. Moreover, there was a direct relationship between
              the speed of the object and the amount of invariance in the
              chick's object representation. Thus, visual experience with
              slowly changing objects plays a critical role in the
              development of invariant object recognition. These results
              indicate that invariant object recognition is not a
              hardwired property of vision, but is learned rapidly when
              newborns encounter a slowly changing visual world.},

              environmental factors that cause object recognition to

              a high-throughput controlled-rearing experiment that
              examined whether the development of object recognition
              requires experience with temporally smooth visual objects.
              When newborn chicks (Gallus gallus) were raised with
              virtual objects that moved smoothly over time, the chicks
              developed accurate color recognition, shape recognition,

              non-smoothly over time, the chicks' object recognition
              abilities were severely impaired. These results provide
              evidence for a "smoothness constraint" on newborn object

               absence of ground truth is a very challenging and important
               problem. In the context of online appearance modeling,
               there is an additional ambiguity involving the correctness
               of the appearance model. In this paper, we propose a novel
               performance evaluation strategy for tracking systems based
               on particle filter using a time reversed Markov chain.
               Starting from the latest observation, the time reversed
               chain is propagated back till the starting time t = 0 of
               the tracking algorithm. The posterior density of the time
               reversed chain is also computed. The distance between the
               posterior density of the time reversed chain (at t = 0) and
               the prior density used to initialize the tracking algorithm
               forms the decision statistic for evaluation. It is
               postulated that when the data is generated true to the
               underlying models, the decision statistic takes a low
               value. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the
               algorithm against various common failure modes in the
               generic visual tracking problem. Finally, we derive a small
               frame approximation that allows for very efficient
               computation of the decision statistic.},

              Indeed, under a variety of conditions, functions attributed
              to specialized areas can be supported by other regions.
              However, a host of studies have laid out an ever more
              detailed map of functional cortical areas. This leaves us
              with the puzzle of whether different cortical areas are
              intrinsically specialized, or whether they differ mostly by
              their position in the processing hierarchy and their inputs
              but apply the same computational principles. Here we show
              that the computational principle of optimal stability of
              sensory representations combined with local memory gives
              rise to a hierarchy of processing stages resembling the
              ventral visual pathway when it is exposed to continuous
              natural stimuli. Early processing stages show receptive
              fields similar to those observed in the primary visual
              cortex. Subsequent stages are selective for increasingly
              complex configurations of local features, as observed in
              higher visual areas. The last stage of the model displays
              place fields as observed in entorhinal cortex and
              hippocampus. The results suggest that functionally
              heterogeneous cortical areas can be generated by only a few
              computational principles and highlight the importance of
              the variability of the input signals in forming functional
              specialization.},

  abstract  = {Coherent visual experience requires that objects be
               represented as the same persisting individuals over time
               and motion. Cognitive science research has identified a
               powerful principle that guides such processing: Objects
               must trace continuous paths through space and time. Little
               is known, however, about how neural representations of
               objects, typically defined by visual features, are
               influenced by spatiotemporal continuity. Here, we report
               the consequences of spatiotemporally continuous vs.
               discontinuous motion on perceptual representations in human
               ventral visual cortex. In experiments using both dynamic
               occlusion and apparent motion, face-selective cortical
               regions exhibited significantly less activation when faces
               were repeated in continuous vs. discontinuous trajectories,
               suggesting that discontinuity caused featurally identical
               objects to be represented as different individuals. These
               results indicate that spatiotemporal continuity modulates
               neural representations of object identity, influencing
               judgments of object persistence even in the most staunchly
               âfeaturalâ areas of ventral visual cortex.},

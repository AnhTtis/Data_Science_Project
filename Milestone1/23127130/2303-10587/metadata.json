    "abstract": "We discuss an obstruction to a knot being smoothly slice that comes from minimum-genus bounds on smoothly embedded surfaces in definite 4-manifolds. As an example, we provide an alternate proof of the fact that the (2,1)-cable of the figure eight knot is not smoothly slice, as shown by Dai--Kang--Mallick--Park--Stoffregen in 2022. The main technical input of our argument consists of gauge-theoretic obstructions to smooth small-genus surfaces representing certain homology classes in $\\mathbb{CP}^2\\#\\mathbb{CP}^2$ proved by Bryan in the 1990s.",

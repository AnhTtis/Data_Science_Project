    "abstract": "We present an abstract, categorical formulation of dependent functions in a fundamental manner and independently from the Sigma-construction. For that, we define first the notion of a category with family-arrows, or a $\\f$-category. A $(\\f, Σ)$-category is a $\\f$-category with Sigma-objects, where a $(\\f, Σ)$-category with a terminal object is exactly a type-category of Pitts, or a category with attributes of Cartmell. We introduce categories with dependent arrows, or $\\di$-categories, and we show that every $(\\f, Σ)$-category is a $\\di$-category in a canonical way. The notion of a Sigma-object in a $\\di$-Category is affected by the existence of dependent arrows, and we show that every $(\\f, Σ)$-category is a $(\\di, Σ)$-category in a canonical way.",

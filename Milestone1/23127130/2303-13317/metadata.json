    "abstract": "The notion of an unexpected curve in the plane was introduced in 2018, and was quickly generalized in several directions in a flurry of mathematical activity by many authors. In this expository paper we first describe some of the main results on unexpected hypersurfaces. Then we summarize two offshoots of this theory. First we look at sets of points in $\\mathbb P^3$ whose general projection is a planar complete intersection (so-called {\\it geproci} sets). Although we now know a lot about these sets, much remains mysterious. Then we describe an interesting measure of unexpectedness called {\\it $AV$-sequences}, which have a surprising structure that is not yet fully understood.",

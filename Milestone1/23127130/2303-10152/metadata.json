    "abstract": "We study different aspects of the stabilizer entropies (SEs) and compare them against known nonstabilizerness monotones such as the min-relative entropy and the robustness of magic. First, by means of explicit examples, we show that, for Rényi index $0\\leq n<2$, the SEs are not monotones with respect to stabilizer protocols which include computational-basis measurements, not even when restricting to pure states (while the question remains open for $n\\geq 2$). Next, we show that, for any Rényi index, the SEs do not satisfy a strong monotonicity condition with respect to computational-basis measurements. We further study SEs in different classes of many-body states. We compare the SEs with other measures, either proving or providing numerical evidence for inequalities between them. Finally, we discuss exact or efficient tensor-network numerical methods to compute SEs of matrix-product states (MPSs) for large numbers of qubits. In addition to previously developed exact methods to compute the Rényi SEs, we also put forward a scheme based on perfect MPS sampling, allowing us to compute efficiently the von Neumann SE for large bond dimensions.",

%\subsection{PMG2000}
%We collect and annotate a benchmark dataset (denoted as PMG2000) for placental maturity grading (PMG) with four categories, which is the largest public dataset for this task to our best knowledge.
%This dataset has 2098 B-mode ultrasound images captured by the vendors, \ie, GE Voluson E8 Expert and Phillip EPIQ7, including 518 images with Grade 0, 501 images with Grade I, 548 images with Grade II, and 531 images with Grade III.

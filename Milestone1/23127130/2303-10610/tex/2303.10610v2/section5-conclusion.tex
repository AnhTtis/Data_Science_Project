\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

This work presents a dual-guidance diffusion network (DiffMIC) for boosting medical image classification. 
%
The main idea of our DiffMIC is to introduce dual-granularity conditional guidance over vanilla DDPM, and enforce condition-specific MMD regularization to improve classification performance. 
Experimental results on three medical image classification datasets with different image modalities show the superior performance of our network over state-of-the-art methods. As the first diffusion-based model for general medical image classification, our DiffMIC has the potential to serve as an essential baseline for future research in this area.

    "abstract": "Object detection and single image super-resolution are classic problems in computer vision (CV). The object detection task aims to recognize the objects in input images, while the image restoration task aims to reconstruct high quality images from given low quality images. In this paper, a two-stage framework for object detection and image restoration is proposed. The first stage uses YOLO series algorithms to complete the object detection and then performs image cropping. In the second stage, this work improves Swin Transformer and uses the new proposed algorithm to connect the Swin Transformer layer to design a new neural network architecture. We name the newly proposed network for image restoration SwinOIR. This work compares the model performance of different versions of YOLO detection algorithms on MS COCO dataset and Pascal VOC dataset, demonstrating the suitability of different YOLO network models for the first stage of the framework in different scenarios. For image super-resolution task, it compares the model performance of using different methods of connecting Swin Transformer layers and design different sizes of SwinOIR for use in different life scenarios. Our implementation code is released at https://github.com/Rubbbbbbbbby/SwinOIR.",

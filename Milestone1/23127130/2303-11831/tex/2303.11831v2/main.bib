    abstract = { PurposeTo validate a prospectively triggered spiral phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) sequence accelerated with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) in a population of children and adults with congenital heart disease.Materials and MethodsThe local research ethics committee approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all patients or guardians. Stroke volumes were quantified in 40 patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 21.4 years ± 13.8, age range: 3.0–61.3 years; 22 male patients aged 3.0–38.0 years [mean age, 17.2 years ± 10.5], 18 female patients aged 4.7–61.3 years [mean age, 26.6 years ± 15.9]) with congenital heart disease in the aorta (n = 40), main pulmonary artery (n = 38), right pulmonary artery (n = 22), and left pulmonary artery (n = 24). Stroke volumes were obtained with (a) breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR imaging with SENSE, (b) conventional breath-hold cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging, and (c) reference free-breathing phase-contrast MR imaging. Stroke volumes were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coefficients.ResultsImaging time with the breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR sequence was significantly lower than that with the conventional breath-hold phase-contrast MR sequence (~5 seconds vs ~16 seconds, respectively; P < .0001). There was excellent agreement in stroke volumes in all vessels between the reference free-breathing sequence (mean volume, 60.3 mL ± 27.3) and the two breath-hold sequences—spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.5 mL ± 27.1; P < .001) and conventional cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.8 mL ± 27.6; P = .268). The limits of agreement were smaller with the spiral breath-hold sequence than with the conventional breath-hold sequence (−4.4 mL, 2.9 mL vs −10.3 mL, 9.3 mL, respectively); correlation was similar (r = 0.998 vs r = 0.984, respectively).ConclusionFlow volumes can be accurately and reliably quantified by using a spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR sequence, with high spatiotemporal resolution obtained in a short breath hold.© RSNA, 2011Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101844/-/DC1 }

abstract = {Super resolution problems are widely discussed in medical imaging. Spatial resolution of medical images are not sufficient due to the constraints such as image acquisition time, low irradiation dose or hardware limits. To address these problems, different super resolution methods have been proposed, such as optimization or learning-based approaches. Recently, deep learning methods become a thriving technology and are developing at an exponential speed. We think it is necessary to write a review to present the current situation of deep learning in medical imaging super resolution. In this paper, we first briefly introduce deep learning methods, then present a number of important deep learning approaches to solve super resolution problems, different architectures as well as up-sampling operations will be introduced. Afterwards, we focus on the applications of deep learning methods in medical imaging super resolution problems, the challenges to overcome will be presented as well.}

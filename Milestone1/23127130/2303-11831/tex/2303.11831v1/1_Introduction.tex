\section{Introduction}
3D breath-hold imaging is a rapid method of assessing the abdominal anatomy, however anisotropic imaging with thick slices, is often required to enable the acquisition within a reasonable breath hold time. In this paper we have developed an unpaired approach to perform super-resolution of anisotropic MRI data to generate isotropic volumes. To achieve this we have implemented a novel adversarial loss, consisting of a cycle-consistent gradient mapping in order to enhance structural details and perceptual quality of abdominal MR images.

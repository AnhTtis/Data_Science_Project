\section{Conclusions}
Our initial results demonstrate that it is possible to perform ML super resolution without paired data. Our method relies on the idea that a patch in the high-resolution coronal plane has similar structures to a low-resolution sagittal patch, enabling the use of unpaired learning paradigm. The CycleGAN performs well on a relatively small training dataset with significant improvement in perceptual image quality and edge sharpness. However, there was a slight increase in artefacts, probably due to sharpening of ghosting and noise. Nevertheless, we believe this approach has potential in improving image quality for abdominal imaging.

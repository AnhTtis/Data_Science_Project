    "abstract": "This paper proposes a motion control scheme for robots operating in a dynamic environment with concave obstacles. A Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is constructed to drive the robot towards a goal position while ensuring collision avoidance without direct use of obstacle information in the optimization problem. This is achieved by guaranteeing tracking performance of an appropriately designed receding horizon path. The path is computed using a guiding vector field defined in a subspace of the free workspace where each point in the subspace satisfies a criteria for minimum distance to all obstacles. The effectiveness of the control scheme is illustrated by means of simulation.",

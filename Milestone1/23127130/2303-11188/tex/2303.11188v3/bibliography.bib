	abstract     = {Many autonomous agents, such as intelligent vehicles, are inherently required to interact with one another. Game theory provides a natural mathematical tool for robot motion planning in such interactive settings. However, tractable algorithms for such problems usually rely on a strong assumption, namely that the objectives of all players in the scene are known. To make such tools applicable for ego-centric planning with only local information, we propose an adaptive model-predictive game solver, which jointly infers other players' objectives online and computes a corresponding generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) strategy. The adaptivity of our approach is enabled by a differentiable trajectory game solver whose gradient signal is used for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of opponents' objectives. This differentiability of our pipeline facilitates direct integration with other differentiable elements, such as neural networks (NNs). Furthermore, in contrast to existing solvers for cost inference in games, our method handles not only partial state observations but also general inequality constraints. In two simulated traffic scenarios, we find superior performance of our approach over both existing game-theoretic methods and non-game-theoretic model-predictive control (MPC) approaches. We also demonstrate our approach's real-time planning capabilities and robustness in two hardware experiments.},

	abstract     = {We propose a learning-based methodology to reconstruct private information held by a population of interacting agents in order to predict an exact outcome of the underlying multi-agent interaction process, here identified as a stationary action profile. We envision a scenario where an external observer, endowed with a learning procedure, is allowed to make queries and observe the agents' reactions through private action-reaction mappings, whose collective fixed point corresponds to a stationary profile. By adopting a smart query process to iteratively collect sensible data and update parametric estimates, we establish sufficient conditions to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed learning-based methodology so that, if convergence happens, it can only be towards a stationary action profile. This fact yields two main consequences: i) learning locally-exact surrogates of the action-reaction mappings allows the external observer to succeed in its prediction task, and ii) working with assumptions so general that a stationary profile is not even guaranteed to exist, the established sufficient conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a desirable profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.},

 abstract = {We study general quadratic games with multidimensional actions, stochastic payoff interactions, and rich information structures. We first consider games with arbitrary finite information structures. In such games, we show that there generically exists a unique equilibrium. We then extend the result to games with infinite information structures, under an additional assumption of linearity of certain conditional expectations. In that case, there generically exists a unique linear equilibrium. In both cases, the equilibria can be explicitly characterized in compact closed form. We illustrate our results by studying information aggregation in large asymmetric Cournot markets and the effects of stochastic payoff interactions in beauty contests. Our results apply to general games with linear best responses, and also allow us to characterize the effects of small perturbations in arbitrary Bayesian games with finite information structures and smooth payoffs.},

@article{GROVER2022167,
	abstract = {We develop algorithms for inferring long-term intentions and parameters of local collision-avoidance behavior of agents in a multiagent system from their trajectories. This problem is challenging because an agent's observed trajectory only partially manifests its long-term task; it also contains adjustments made by the agent to ensure collision avoidance with other agents and obstacles in the environment. Since an observer would have no means to determine the magnitude of these adjustments, it is difficult to isolate the task-oriented component from the observed motion. To circumvent this problem, we model the agent's dynamics using a reactive optimization whose objective function captures the long-term task while its constraints capture collision-avoidance behavior. We develop two robust mixed-integer programming algorithms that infer the task and safety related parameters of this optimization problem from the positions and velocities of the agents. These algorithms are validated on synthetic datasets using parameter estimation errors, displacement errors and computation time as metrics. We further test these algorithms on a dataset of real human trajectories. We show that the learned parameters capture the true underlying pedestrian dynamics by rolling out the learned model and showing similarity between the ground truth trajectories and the reconstructed trajectories.},

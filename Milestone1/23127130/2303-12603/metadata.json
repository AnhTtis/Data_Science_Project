    "abstract": "This work investigates the effect of three different driveability constraints on the optimal energy management strategy for a p2 parallel hybrid. Two of these constraints are used to prevent frequent gear shifting and engine start/stops, while the third is used to increase the sportiness of the vehicle by maximizing the available torque reserve at all times. The constraints are imposed by reformulating them as penalty terms to be added to the base running cost of the control strategy, which is fuel consumption. Dynamic programming, a popular optimal control technique, is then used to design the energy management strategy that minimizes the total cost. A case study is developed for a p2 parallel hybrid and simulated on a combination of the Artemis driving cycles. The impact of each driveability constraint is analyzed with respect to a set of relevant features of the control strategy, such as the choice of engine operating points and the gear shift pattern. The resulting discussion provides some useful insight for the design of real-time, rule-based control strategies.",

  abstract = {Hybrid vehicle fuel economy performance is highly sensitive to the energy management strategy used to regulate power flow among the various energy sources and sinks. Optimal non-causal solutions are easy to determine if the drive cycle is known a priori. It is very challenging to design causal controllers that yield good fuel economy for a range of possible driver behavior. Additional challenges come in the form of constraints on powertrain activity, such as shifting and starting the engine, which are commonly called “drivability” metrics and can adversely affect fuel economy. In this paper, drivability restrictions are included in a shortest path stochastic dynamic programming (SP-SDP) formulation of the real-time energy management problem for a prototype vehicle, where the drive cycle is modeled as a stationary, finite-state Markov chain. When the SP-SDP controllers are evaluated with a high-fidelity vehicle simulator over standard government drive cycles, and compared to a baseline industrial controller, they are shown to improve fuel economy more than 11\% for equivalent levels of drivability. In addition, the explicit tradeoff between fuel economy and drivability is quantified for the SP-SDP controllers.},

  abstract = {Taking the complex but regular characteristics of bus routines into account, the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) might be a method with more potential to optimize the energy management of a plug-in hybrid electric bus (PHEB). However, the discrete transmission system and the continuous power system make it a complicated multidimensional optimal problem, particularly for PHEB with automated mechanical transmission (AMT), and the optimal decisions, which are obtained based on historical data, might not always well satisfy the driver's expectation to vehicle maneuverability under various driving conditions. To solve these problems, an adaptive approach based on the SDP is proposed in this paper. Exhaustively, the SDP is propelled into the input of the transmission to only optimize the torque split under the special gearshift logic, which reduces the dimensions of optimization and obtains more applicable optimal sequences. Then, an adaptive factor, which trades off the vehicle fuel economy and drivability in real time by dynamically adjusting the gearshift points and the torque split, is developed for the variation of the complicated bus driving cycles. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method could well respond to the variations of the driving conditions (e.g., road grade and vehicle load). Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is discussed in detail by comparisons with different control strategies. More importantly, the proposed approach has great potential to be applied in practice.},

  abstract = {The energy management strategy (EMS) of a hybrid electric vehicle is a supervisory control meant to steer power flows among the different energy sources of the powertrain. The EMS is designed for the purpose of reaching the maximum potential of a given powertrain architecture. Fuel consumption is not the only criterion to be considered for evaluating the global performance of an EMS, since the EMS also impacts other features such as drivability, through engine starts/stops and gear shifts. This paper proposes a general approach to include drivability constraints in the EMS of powertrains provided with discrete automated transmissions. As a first step, determinist dynamic programming is used to compute the optimal solution of the resulting optimization problem. This optimal solution is then used to assess the performance of the proposed online strategy, which is based on the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Finally, simulation results are completed by a discussion of experimental results, as the proposed online strategy has been implemented in a prototype vehicle designed at Renault and tested on a dynamometric bench.},

  abstract = {Efficiently solving the off-line control problem represents a crucial step to predict the fuel economy capability of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Optimal HEV control approaches implemented in literature usually prove to be either computationally inefficient or sub-optimal. Moreover, they often neglect drivability and comfort associated to the generated control actions over time. This paper therefore aims at introducing a rapid near-optimal approach to solve the off-line control problem for parallel and series-parallel HEV powertrains while accounting for drivability criteria such as the frequency of gear shifts and the number of activations of the thermal engine. The performance of the introduced slope-weighted energy-based rapid control analysis (SERCA) algorithm is compared with the global optimal benchmark provided by dynamic programming (DP) for both the parallel and the series-parallel HEV layouts over different driving missions. Results demonstrate how the SERCA algorithm can produce comparable control results with respect to DP by limiting the increase in the estimated fuel consumption within 2.2\%. The corresponding computational time can be simultaneously reduced by around 99.5\% while ensuring a limited number of gear shifts and engine activations over time. Engineers could therefore potentially implement the proposed SERCA algorithm in design and calibration procedures of parallel and series-parallel HEVs to accelerate the overall vehicle development process.},

  abstract = {Hybrid vehicle techniques have been widely studied recently because of their potential to significantly improve the fuel economy and drivability of future ground vehicles. Due to the dual-power-source nature of these vehicles, control strategies based on engineering intuition frequently fail to fully explore the potential of these advanced vehicles. In this paper, we present a procedure for the design of a near-optimal power management strategy. The design procedure starts by defining a cost function, such as minimizing a combination of fuel consumption and selected emission species over a driving cycle. Dynamic programming (DP) is then utilized to find the optimal control actions including the gear-shifting sequence and the power split between the engine and motor while subject to a battery SOC-sustaining constraint. Through analysis of the behavior of DP control actions, near-optimal rules are extracted, which, unlike DP control signals, are implementable. The performance of this power management control strategy is studied by using the hybrid vehicle model HE-VESIM developed at the Automotive Research Center of the University of Michigan. A tradeoff study between fuel economy and emissions was performed. It was found that significant emission reduction could be achieved at the expense of a small increase in fuel consumption.},

  abstract  = {This paper is concerned with the control of hybrid electric vehicles. In the vast literature on the subject, focus is put on the minimization of the fuel consumption. To do so, the deterministic optimal control theory is intensively used. The major concern regarding this approach is the need for driving conditions to be known in advance. In this paper, we suggest to consider the driving cycle as a stochastic process, and make use of the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) to design the power load sharing. We formulate a weighted criterion to minimize fuel consumption and allow for drivability conditions at the same time. The resulting control law may easily be implemented online as a static mapping function of the powertrain state. We provide simulation results based on a parallel HEV case study. We use statutory cycles to build a database of randomly generated cycles. This allows to assess the relevancy of this approach by comparing optimal fuel consumption (using deterministic programming), for each cycle, to the score obtained via the SDP framework. These preliminary results show that the SDP is a promising control tool to overcome the drawbacks inherent to the classical approaches.},

  abstract = {Advanced computer-aided engineering tools are urgently needed to foster the development of electrified road vehicles that would enable abating fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of the transport sector. Concerning plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), implementing an energy management strategy that can rapidly estimate near-optimal powertrain control trajectories while effectively dealing with broaded battery state-of-charge (SOC) window utilization and smooth HEV driving requirements still needs extensive development. To overcome the highlighted drawback, this paper introduces a formulation of the slope-weighted energy-based rapid control analysis (SERCA) algorithm which can rapidly identify near-optimal plug-in HEV control trajectories while complying with SOC boundaries and limiting the number of thermal engine activations and gear shifts. The HEV numerical model is introduced first, followed by formulating the optimal plug-in HEV control problem with smooth driving constraints and describing the dedicated SERCA based control approach. A performed case study demonstrates that SERCA can identify smooth driving constrained near-optimal HEV control trajectories for a 1.5 hours-long real-world driving mission within two minutes on a desktop computer, while a global optimal control approach such as dynamic programming (DP) is found to require more than 10 hours to perform the same task. On the other hand, compared with the global optimal reference provided by DP, the increase in estimated plug-in HEV operative cost in terms of fuel and electrical energy consumption associated to SERCA is always contained within few percentage points. The proposed methodology can accelerate HEV powertrain design and on-board supervisory controller development procedures.},

However, various defects in graphene produced during synthesis or fabrication hinder its performance for applications such as electronic devices, transparent electrodes, and spintronic devices. Due to its intrinsic bandgap and nonmagnetic nature, it cannot be used in nanoelectronics or spintronics. Intrinsic and extrinsic defects are ultimately introduced to tailor electronic and magnetic properties and take advantage of their hidden potential. This article emphasizes the current advancement of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in graphene for potential applications. We also discuss the limitations and outlook for such defects in graphene.},

            The diverse structural and electronic properties of the Si-adsorbed and -substituted monolayer graphene systems are studied by a complete theoretical framework under the first-principles calculations, including the adatom-diversified geometric structures, the Si- and C-dominated energy bands, the spatial charge densities, variations in the spatial charge densities and the atom- and orbital-projected density of states (DOSs). These critical physical quantities are unified together to display a distinct physical and chemical picture in the studying systems. Under the Si-adsorption and Si-substitution effects, the planar geometric structures are still remained mainly owing to the very strong C–C and Si–C bonds on the honeycomb lattices, respectively. The Si-adsorption cases can create free carriers, while the finite- or zero-gap semiconducting behaviors are revealed in various Si-substitution configurations. The developed theoretical framework can be fully generalized to other emergent layered materials. The Si-doped graphene systems might be a highly promising anode material in the lithium-ion battery owing to its rich potential properties.},

            Pristine graphene has been considered one of the most promising materials because of its excellent physical and chemical properties. However, various defects in graphene produced during synthesis or fabrication hinder its performance for applications such as electronic devices, transparent electrodes, and spintronic devices. Due to its intrinsic bandgap and nonmagnetic nature, it cannot be used in nanoelectronics or spintronics. Intrinsic and extrinsic defects are ultimately introduced to tailor electronic and magnetic properties and take advantage of their hidden potential. This article emphasizes the current advancement of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in graphene for potential applications. We also discuss the limitations and outlook for such defects in graphene.},

          , 
            
              Directly incorporating heteroatoms into the hexagonal lattice of graphene during growth has been widely used to tune its electrical properties with superior doping stability, uniformity, and scalability. However the introduction of scattering centers limits this technique because of reduced carrier mobilities and conductivities of the resulting material. Here, we demonstrate a rapid growth of graphitic nitrogen cluster–doped monolayer graphene single crystals on Cu foil with remarkable carrier mobility of 13,000 cm

              . The exceedingly large carrier mobility with high n-doping level was realized by (i) incorporation of nitrogen-terminated carbon clusters to suppress the carrier scattering and (ii) elimination of all defective pyridinic nitrogen centers by oxygen etching. Our study opens up an avenue for the growth of high-mobility/conductivity doped graphene with tunable work functions for scalable graphene-based electronic and device applications.},

              transitional metal atoms is predicted to exhibit many intriguing properties; for example iridium adatoms are proposed to induce a substantial topological gap in graphene. We extensively investigated the conductivity of single-layer graphene decorated with iridium deposited in ultra-high vacuum at low temperature (7 K) as a function of Ir concentration, carrier density, temperature and annealing conditions. Our results are consistent with the formation of Ir clusters of {\textasciitilde}100 atoms at low temperature, with each cluster donating a single electronic charge to graphene. Annealing graphene increases the cluster size, reducing the doping and increasing the mobility. We do not observe any sign of an energy gap induced by spin-orbit coupling, possibly due to the clustering of Ir.},

The charge density, electronic density of states (DOS), and transmission coefficient at different bias voltages are presented for comparison between pure and doped states.

The band structure of edge was engineered by differently selecting the doping positions of B, N, and B-N hexagonal rings and it was found that there are significant changes in the electronic properties of these systems due to doping.

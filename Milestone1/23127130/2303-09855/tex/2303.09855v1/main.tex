\begin{abstract}
%   A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an
%   article formatted for publication by ACM in a conference proceedings
%   or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
%   article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
%   as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
%   preparation of the documentation of their work.
Approximate K nearest neighbor (AKNN) search {\JIANYANGREVISION in the high-dimensional Euclidean vector space} is a fundamental and challenging problem. {\CHENGB We observe that} in high-dimensional space, the time consumption of {\CHENGB nearly all} AKNN algorithms is dominated by {\CHENGB that of} the distance comparison operations (DCOs). For each operation, it scans full dimensions of an object and thus, runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality.
To speed it up, we propose a randomized algorithm named \texttt{ADSampling} which runs in logarithmic time {\CHENGC wrt} the dimensionality {\CHENGB for the majority of DCOs} and succeeds with 
% theoretically guaranteed 
high probability. 
In addition, based on \texttt{ADSampling} we develop one {\chengf generic} and two algorithm-specific techniques as plugins to enhance existing AKNN algorithms.
Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that: (1) our techniques introduce nearly no accuracy loss and (2) they consistently improve the efficiency.

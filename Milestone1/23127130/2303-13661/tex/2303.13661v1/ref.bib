	abstract = {Silicon transistors in microelectronics are shrinking to close to the size at which quantum effects begin to have an impact on device performance. As silicon looks certain to remain the semiconductor material of choice for a while yet, such effects may be turned into an advantage by designing silicon devices that can process quantum information. One approach is to make use of electron spins generated by phosphorus dopant atoms buried in silicon, as they are known to represent well-isolated quantum bits (qubits) with long coherence times. It has not been possible to control single electrons in silicon with the precision for qubits, but now Andrea Morello and colleagues report single-shot, time-resolved readout of electron spins in silicon. This is achieved by placing the phosphorus donor atoms near a charge-sensing device called a single-electron transistor, which is fully compatible with current microelectronic technology. The demonstrated high-fidelity single-shot spin readout opens a path to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices in silicon.},

	abstract = {Although silicon is a promising material for quantum computation, the degeneracy of the conduction band minima (valleys) must be lifted with a splitting sufficient to ensure the formation of well-defined and long-lived spin qubits. Here we demonstrate that valley separation can be accurately tuned via electrostatic gate control in a metal--oxide--semiconductor quantum dot, providing splittings spanning 0.3--0.8 meV. The splitting varies linearly with applied electric field, with a ratio in agreement with atomistic tight-binding predictions. We demonstrate single-shot spin read-out and measure the spin relaxation for different valley configurations and dot occupancies, finding one-electron lifetimes exceeding 2 s. Spin relaxation occurs via phonon emission due to spin--orbit coupling between the valley states, a process not previously anticipated for silicon quantum dots. An analytical theory describes the magnetic field dependence of the relaxation rate, including the presence of a dramatic rate enhancement (or hot-spot) when Zeeman and valley splittings coincide.},

	abstract = {Silicon is one of the most promising semiconductor materials for spin-based information processing devices1,2. Its advanced fabrication technology facilitates the transition from individual devices to large-scale processors, and the availability of a 28Si form with no magnetic nuclei overcomes a primary source of spin decoherence in many other materials3,4. Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions5. Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in pure 28Si material (residual 29Si concentration <50 ppm) with donor densities of 1014--1015 cm−3. We elucidate three mechanisms for spin decoherence, active at different temperatures, and extract a coherence lifetime T2 up to 2 s. In this regime, we find the electron spin is sensitive to interactions with other donor electron spins separated by \~{}200 nm. A magnetic field gradient suppresses such interactions, producing an extrapolated electron spin T2 of 10 s at 1.8 K. These coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state and comparable to high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of donors in silicon ideal components of quantum computers2,6, or quantum memories for systems such as superconducting qubits7,8,9.},

abstract = {Practical applications in quantum communication and quantum computation require the building blocks—quantum bits and quantum memory—to be sufficiently robust and long-lived to allow for manipulation and storage (see the Perspective by Boehme and McCarney). Steger et al. (p. 1280) demonstrate that the nuclear spins of 31P impurities in an almost isotopically pure sample of 28Si can have a coherence time of as long as 192 seconds at a temperature of ∼1.7 K. In diamond at room temperature, Maurer et al. (p. 1283) show that a spin-based qubit system comprised of an isotopic impurity (13C) in the vicinity of a color defect (a nitrogen-vacancy center) could be manipulated to have a coherence time exceeding one second. Such lifetimes promise to make spin-based architectures feasible building blocks for quantum information science. An almost isotopically pure sample of 28Si provides a vacuumlike environment for 31P qubits. A quantum computer requires systems that are isolated from their environment, but can be integrated into devices, and whose states can be measured with high accuracy. Nuclear spins in solids promise long coherence lifetimes, but they are difficult to initialize into known states and to detect with high sensitivity. We show how the distinctive optical properties of enriched 28Si enable the use of hyperfine-resolved optical transitions, as previously applied to great effect for isolated atoms and ions in vacuum. Together with efficient Auger photoionization, these resolved hyperfine transitions permit rapid nuclear hyperpolarization and electrical spin-readout. We combine these techniques to detect nuclear magnetic resonance from dilute 31P in the purest available sample of 28Si, at concentrations inaccessible to conventional measurements, measuring a solid-state coherence time of over 180 seconds.}}

Still, a sizeable spin--electric coupling will be needed in realistic multiple-qubit systems to address single-spin and spin--spin manipulations8--10. Here, we realize a single-electron spin qubit with an isotopically enriched phase coherence time (20 μs)11,12and fast electrical control speed (up to 30 MHz) mediated by extrinsic spin--electric coupling. Using rapid spin rotations, we reveal that the free-evolution dephasing is caused by charge noise---rather than conventional magnetic noise---as highlighted by a 1/f spectrum extended over seven decades of frequency. The qubit exhibits superior performance with single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.9{\%} on average, offering a promising route to large-scale spin-qubit systems with fault-tolerant controllability.},

Zajac et al. built an efficient CNOT gate by using electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots, an implementation that is especially appealing because of its compatibility with existing semiconductor-based electronics (see the Perspective by Schreiber and Bluhm). To showcase the potential, the authors used the gate to create an entangled quantum state called the Bell state. Science, this issue p. 439; see also p. 393 A two-qubit gate essential for quantum computing is demonstrated in silicon quantum dots. Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99\%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in ~200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78\% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement).

	abstract = {Universal quantum computation will require qubit technology based on a scalable platform1, together with quantum error correction protocols that place strict limits on the maximum infidelities for one- and two-qubit gate operations2,3. Although various qubit systems have shown high fidelities at the one-qubit level4--10, the only solid-state qubits manufactured using standard lithographic techniques that have demonstrated two-qubit fidelities near the fault-tolerance threshold6 have been in superconductor systems. Silicon-based quantum dot qubits are also amenable to large-scale fabrication and can achieve high single-qubit gate fidelities (exceeding 99.9 per cent) using isotopically enriched silicon11,12. Two-qubit gates have now been demonstrated in a number of systems13--15, but as yet an accurate assessment of their fidelities using Clifford-based randomized benchmarking, which uses sequences of randomly chosen gates to measure the error, has not been achieved. Here, for qubits encoded on the electron spin states of gate-defined quantum dots, we demonstrate Bell state tomography with fidelities ranging from 80 to 89 per cent, and two-qubit randomized benchmarking with an average Clifford gate fidelity of 94.7 per cent and an average controlled-rotation fidelity of 98 per cent. These fidelities are found to be limited by the relatively long gate times used here compared with the decoherence times of the qubits. Silicon qubit designs employing fast gate operations with high Rabi frequencies16,17, together with advanced pulsing techniques18, should therefore enable much higher fidelities in the near future.},

Reaching two-qubit gate fidelities above 99{\%} has been a long-standing major goal for semiconductor spin qubits. These qubits are promising for scaling, as they can leverage advanced semiconductor technology4.

Although nearest-neighbour exchange coupling of two spins has been demonstrated, the interaction of spins via microwave-frequency photons could enable long-distance spin--spin coupling and connections between arbitrary pairs of qubits (`all-to-all'connectivity) in a spin-based quantum processor. Realizing coherent spin--photon coupling is challenging because of the small magnetic-dipole moment of a single spin, which limits magnetic-dipole coupling rates to less than 1 kilohertz. Here we demonstrate strong coupling between a single spin in silicon and a single microwave-frequency photon, with spin--photon coupling rates of more than 10 megahertz. The mechanism that enables the coherent spin--photon interactions is based on spin--charge hybridization in the presence of a magnetic-field gradient. In addition to spin--photon coupling, we demonstrate coherent control and dispersive readout of a single spin. These results open up a direct path to entangling single spins using microwave-frequency photons.},

abstract = {To help develop quantum circuits, much effort has been directed toward achieving the strong-coupling regime by using gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots. Potentially, the magnetic dipole, or spin, of a single electron for use as a qubit has advantages over charge-photon coupling owing to its longer lifetime. Samkharadze et al. hybridized the electron spin with the electron charge in a double silicon quantum dot. This approach yielded strong coupling between the single electron spin and a single microwave photon, providing a route to scalable quantum circuits with spin qubits. Science, this issue p. 1123 Strong coupling is induced between a single electron spin and a single photon. Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.}}

	abstract = {Electron spins in Si/SiGe quantum wells suffer from nearly degenerate conduction band valleys, which compete with the spin degree of freedom in the formation of qubits. Despite attempts to enhance the valley energy splitting deterministically, by engineering a sharp interface, valley splitting fluctuations remain a serious problem for qubit uniformity, needed to scale up to large quantum processors. Here, we elucidate and statistically predict the valley splitting by the holistic integration of 3D atomic-level properties, theory and transport. We find that the concentration fluctuations of Si and Ge atoms within the 3D landscape of Si/SiGe interfaces can explain the observed large spread of valley splitting from measurements on many quantum dot devices. Against the prevailing belief, we propose to boost these random alloy composition fluctuations by incorporating Ge atoms in the Si quantum well to statistically enhance valley splitting.},

	abstract = {Large-scale arrays of quantum-dot spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum wells require large or tunable energy splittings of the valley states associated with degenerate conduction band minima. Existing proposals to deterministically enhance the valley splitting rely on sharp interfaces or modifications in the quantum well barriers that can be difficult to grow. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new heterostructure, the ``Wiggle Well'', whose key feature is Ge concentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Experimentally, we show that placing Ge in the quantum well does not significantly impact our ability to form and manipulate single-electron quantum dots. We further observe large and widely tunable valley splittings, from 54 to 239 μeV. Tight-binding calculations, and the tunability of the valley splitting, indicate that these results can mainly be attributed to random concentration fluctuations that are amplified by the presence of Ge alloy in the heterostructure, as opposed to a deterministic enhancement due to the concentration oscillations. Quantitative predictions for several other heterostructures point to the Wiggle Well as a robust method for reliably enhancing the valley splitting in future qubit devices.},

  abstract={In part I, the development and deployment of a general nanoelectronic modeling tool (NEMO 3-D) has been discussed. Based on the atomistic valence-force field and the sp3d5s* nearest neighbor tight-binding models, NEMO 3-D enables the computation of strain and electronic structure in nanostructures consisting of more than 64 and 52 million atoms, corresponding to volumes of (110 nm)3 and (101 nm)3, respectively. In this part, successful applications of NEMO 3-D are demonstrated in the atomistic calculation of single-particle electronic states of the following realistically sized nanostructures: 1) self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) including long-range strain and piezoelectricity; 2) stacked quantum dot system as used in quantum cascade lasers; 3) SiGe quantum wells (QWs) for quantum computation; and 4) SiGe nanowires. These examples demonstrate the broad NEMO 3-D capabilities and indicate the necessity of multimillion atomistic electronic structure modeling.},

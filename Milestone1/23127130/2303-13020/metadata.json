    "abstract": "It is not possible to decompose generic thermal operations into combinations and concatenations of simpler thermal processes that only manipulate selected system energy levels. This creates a hindrance in providing realistically-implementable protocols to reach all thermodynamic state transitions. However, in this work we show that the recycling of thermal baths allows the decomposition of thermal operations into a series of elementary thermal operations, each involving only two system levels at a time. Such a scheme is equivalent to a catalytic version of elementary thermal operations, where the catalysts are prepared in Gibbs states and re-thermalized at a later time. Thus, the Gibbs state catalyst closes the gap between elementary thermal operations and thermal operations. Furthermore, when any catalyst can be employed, we prove that a hierarchy of different thermal processes converge to that of thermal operations.",

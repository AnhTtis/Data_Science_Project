    "abstract": "When considering a real log canonical threshold (RLCT) that gives a Bayesian generalization error, in general, papers replace a mean error function with a relatively simple polynomial whose RLCT corresponds to that of the mean error function, and obtain its RLCT by resolving its singularities through an algebraic operation called blow-up. Though it is known that the singularities of any polynomial can be resolved by a finite number of blow-up iterations, it is not clarified whether or not it is possible to resolve singularities of a specific polynomial by applying a specific blow-up algorithm. Therefore this paper considers the blow-up algorithm for the polynomials called sum-of-products (sop) polynomials and its RLCT.",

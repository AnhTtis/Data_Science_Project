    "abstract": "The mechanism of elementary particle mass generation is a fundamental issue of physics. While cardinal progress has recently been achieved in the case of leptons and current quarks through the Brout-Engler-Higgs mechanism, this issue is at the stage of searching for the constituent quarks forming the nucleon mass. A deep similarity is noted in the paper between the constituent quark states arising in central inelastic $NN$ collisions within a certain energy interval and the QCD matter states at the cosmological stage of nucleon mass generation. This gives rise to special attention to the investigation of both issues.",

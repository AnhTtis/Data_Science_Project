    "abstract": "Semi-supervised semantic segmentation learns a model for classifying pixels into specific classes using a few labeled samples and numerous unlabeled images. The recent leading approach is consistency regularization by selftraining with pseudo-labeling pixels having high confidences for unlabeled images. However, using only highconfidence pixels for self-training may result in losing much of the information in the unlabeled datasets due to poor confidence calibration of modern deep learning networks. In this paper, we propose a class-adaptive semisupervision framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (CAFS) to cope with the loss of most information that occurs in existing high-confidence-based pseudolabeling methods. Unlike existing semi-supervised semantic segmentation frameworks, CAFS constructs a validation set on a labeled dataset, to leverage the calibration performance for each class. On this basis, we propose a calibration aware class-wise adaptive thresholding and classwise adaptive oversampling using the analysis results from the validation set. Our proposed CAFS achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the full data partition of the base PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and on the 1/4 data partition of the Cityscapes dataset with significant margins of 83.0% and 80.4%, respectively.

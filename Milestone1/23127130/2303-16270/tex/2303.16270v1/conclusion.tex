\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper, we propose one-shot VFL that applies SSL to solve two critical problems of VFL: high communication cost and limited overlapping samples common in the real world. In one-shot VFL, the clients only conduct two times of uploading and one time of downloading and can achieve higher accuracy than the SOTA VFL approaches. We also propose few-shot VFL to improve the performance further by paying with one more round of communication. We evaluate our methods on imaging data and tabular data, and the results demonstrate that our methods can improve the model performance under the settings with limited overlapping samples and reduce the communication cost significantly.

In the future, we will evaluate our VFL methods in multi-modal settings combining different data types. In addition, we note that data privacy preservation is a significant concern of deploying FL in real life~\cite{sun2022label,wu2020privacy}. Our methods do not require the clients and the server to share additional information compared with existing VFL methods besides the number of classes, which is common knowledge for both the server and clients in most settings. 
%We are already exploring potential privacy leakage in VFL and feasible defense methods (e.g., differential privacy, encryption) in our approaches. 
Existing defense methods~\cite{liu2021defending,ghazi2021deep} can be directly incorporated into our approaches to improve privacy. In this paper, we follow most previous VFL literature~\cite{liu2019communication,liu2021fate} and evaluate on two-client scenarios. We will explore multi-party settings in future work.
Our code will be made publicly available.

ABSTRACT = {For the last 100 years, General Relativity (GR) has taken over the gravitational theory mantle held by Newtonian Gravity for the previous 200 years. This article reviews the status of GR in terms of its self-consistency, completeness, and the evidence provided by observations, which have allowed GR to remain the champion of gravitational theories against several other classes of competing theories. We pay particular attention to the role of GR and gravity in cosmology, one of the areas in which one gravity dominates and new phenomena and effects challenge the orthodoxy. We also review other areas where there are likely conflicts pointing to the need to replace or revise GR to represent correctly observations and consistent theoretical framework. Observations have long been key both to the theoretical liveliness and viability of GR. We conclude with a discussion of the likely developments over the next 100 years.},

abstract = {In this work, we review the main existing theories for the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor in dielectric media — a problem directly related to the century-long debate regarding the correct momentum of light in dielectric media, known as Abraham–Minkowski controversy. The theoretical validity of the main existing formulations is analyzed in terms of symmetry and invariance requirements for the tensors. We also present position- and time-dependent numerical simulations of the related electromagnetic forces for a lossless nondispersive medium, highlighting the different expected spatial force distributions. The force densities of different formulations drive forward different momentum and atomic number density distributions of the medium contributing to the total momentum and energy densities associated with the coupled field-medium state of light.}

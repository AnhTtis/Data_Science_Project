    "abstract": "We derive time and energy-optimal control policies for a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) to complete lane change maneuvers in mixed traffic. The interaction between CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) requires designing the best possible response of a CAV to actions by its neighboring HDVs. This interaction is formulated using a bilevel optimization setting with an appropriate behavioral model for an HDV's. Then, an iterated best response (IBR) method is used to determine a Nash equilibrium. However, we also show that when a common and simple-to-detect condition applies, the optimal lane-changing policy is in fact independent of HDV behavior with a CAV changing lanes by cooperating with another CAV in the target lane and always merging ahead of it. Thus, the dependence on the interaction between CAVs and HDVs may be eliminated in such cases. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of our controllers in terms of cost, safety guarantees, and disruption to the traffic flow when uncontrollable HDVs are present.",

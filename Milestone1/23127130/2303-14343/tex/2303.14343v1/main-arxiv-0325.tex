\begin{abstract}
Typically, ferroelectricity and metallicity cannot coexist due to the screening effect of conducting electrons, and a large number of stable monolayers with 1T/1T$^{\prime}$ phase lack spontaneous polarization due to inversion symmetry (IS). In this work, we have constructed the $\pi$-bilayer structures for $M$Te$_2$ ($M =$ Pt, Pd, and Ni) with van der Waals (vdW) stacking, where two monolayers are related by $C_{2z}$ rotation, and have demonstrated that these $\pi$-bilayers are typical ferroelectric metals (FEMs). The vertical polarization of PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer is 0.46 pC/m, comparable to that of FEM WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers. We show that the switching of polarization can be realized through interlayer sliding, which only requires crossing a very small energy barrier. The interlayer vdW charge transfer is the source of both vertical polarization and metallicity, and these properties are closely related to the spatially extended Te-$p_z$ orbital. Finally, we reveal that electron doping can significantly adjust the vertical polarization of these FEMs in both magnitude and direction. Our findings introduce a new class of FEMs, which have potential applicatioons in functional nanodevices such as ferroelectric tunneling junction and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.

\maketitle
\paragraph*{Introduction.}
Ferroelectric (FE) materials, where spontaneous polarization can be reversed or changed by an external electric field~\cite{PhysRev.17.475}, are gradually being developed as two-dimensional (2D) atom-thin layers in order to meet the needs of device miniaturization~\cite{ACSaelm.2019, d1T-MoTe2.NC, In2Se3.NC, SnSe.PRL, AdMa.2021, NbN.PRL}. 
However, many layered transition-metal dichalcogenides with 2H, 1T, and 1T$^{\prime}$ phases~\cite{TMD.NRM, TMD.CSR} and 2D hexagonal planar structures~\cite{graphene.Science, BN.AFM} have mirror/glide symmetry or IS, which precludes spontaneous vertical polarization.
Recently, the concept of sliding ferroelectricity has been proposed~\cite{Nano.2017}, which has successfully expanded the 2D FE family and has opened up a new research field known as slidetronics~\cite{MoA2N4.JMCA, npj.8.138, LaBr2.npj, FeCl2.npj, VS2.PRL, BN.Science1, BN.Science2, H-MX2.NatNan, MoS2.NC, MoS2.Nature2022, WTe2.Nature, WTe2.JPCL, WTe2.NP, ReS2.PRL}. 
This sliding ferroelectricity generates vertical polarization by vdW stacking, with switching coupled with interlayer sliding.
It has been studied theoretically and experimentally in many materials, such as h-BN bilayer~\cite{BN.Science1, BN.Science2}, 1H-MoS$_2$ multilayers~\cite{H-MX2.NatNan, MoS2.NC, MoS2.Nature2022}, and 1T$^{\prime}$-WTe$_2$ and ReS$_2$ multilayers~\cite{WTe2.Nature, WTe2.JPCL, WTe2.NP, ReS2.PRL}. The general theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity has recently been proposed, which not only includes sliding ferroelectricity but also provides new perspectives~\cite{Stacking.arXiv}.

The coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity is generally not possible because conducting electrons can effectively screen internal electric fields, preventing the material from exhibiting FE behavior. However, the concept of FEM has been proposed~\cite{Anderson1965}, and some materials have been proposed as FEM candidates, such as LiOsO$_3$~\cite{LiOsO.NM, LiOsO3.PhysRevB.90.094108}, SrTiO$_3$~\cite{SrTiO.supe.NP, SrTiO.supe.NC}, and Hg$_3$Te$_2X_2$ ($X$ = Cl, Br)~\cite{HgTeX.NC}, but lack direct evidence of polarization switching. 
Remarkably, It has been reported that the polar ($\gamma$; T$_d$-phase) and nonpolar structures ($\bar\gamma$; T$_0$-phase) of metallic MoTe$_2$ can be straightforwardly connected through interlayer shifts~\cite{MoTe2.wzj.PRL}, which are verified in experimentals~\cite{MoTe2-T0.NC}.
In 2D materials, an external electric field can penetrate the material and reverse vertical polarization due to electron confinement within the plane~\cite{CrN.PRB, LiOsO3film.PRL}. 
Despite theoretical predictions of FEM behavior in other 2D materials, such as buckled CrN~\cite{CrN.PRB}, LiOsO$_3$ films~\cite{LiOsO3film.PRL}, and bimetal phosphates M$_{\rm I}$M$_{\rm II}$P$_2$X$_6$ family~\cite{M1M1P2X6.SB}, only 1T$^{\prime}$-WTe$_2$ multilayers have been experimentally confirmed as FEMs~\cite{WTe2.Nature, WTe2.NP}, and the tunability of polarization by carriers doping in FEMs has been rarely studied yet due to the lack of FEM candidates~\cite{WTe2.doping.NC}.

In this work, we propose that the PtTe$_2$-family $\pi$-bilayers are typical 2D FEMs with spontaneous vertical polarization. Starting from centrosymmetric insulating 1T-monolayers, we obtain the metallic $\pi$-bilayer polar structures through vdW stacking. By allowing for interlayer sliding, two FE phases with opposite polarization can switch between each other with low energy cost. The polarization and metallicity of the bilayers can be attributed to charge density redistribution of the Te-$p_z$ orbital induced by interlayer vdW interactions. Finally, we show that the vertical polarization can be significantly adjusted in both magnitude and direction by doping the bilayers with I atoms as electron dopants.

\paragraph*{Methodology.}
We carried out the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) with projector augmented wave (PAW) method~\cite{paw1, paw2}, as implemented in the Vienna \emph{ab initio} simulation package (VASP)~\cite{KRESSE199615, vasp}. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Pardew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function~\cite{pbe} was employed for the exchange-correlation potential. The kinetic energy cutoff for plane wave expansion was set to 500 eV, and a 18$\times$18$\times$1 $\textbf{k}$-mesh was adopted for the Brillouin zone sampling in the self-consistent process. The thickness of the vacuum layer along $z$ axis was set to \textgreater ~20 \AA. Both lattice parameters and atomic positions were fully relaxed by minimizing the interionic forces below 10$^{-2}$ eV/\AA. The DFT-D3 method of Grimme with BJ damping was applied to consider vdW interaction~\cite{DFT-D3.JCP,DFT-D3.JCC}. The dipole correction was applied in all calculations~\cite{dipole}.  
The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional~\cite{HSE.JCP} was employed to check band structure.
Vertical polarization was calculated by the classical dipole method, details of which can be found in Section~\ref{SM1} of the Supplemental Material (SM).
FE switching pathway was obtained with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method~\cite{CINEB}. Phonon spectra were gained with the finite-difference method using a 3$\times$3$\times$1 supercell, as implemented in the Phonopy package~\cite{phonopy}.

\paragraph*{Crystal structure and vdW stacking.}
The 1T-$M$Te$_2$ monolayer possesses a hexagonal structure with space group $P\overline{3}m1$ (SG \#164), where each $M$ atom lies at the center of an octahedral cage formed by Te atoms. IS forbids spontaneous polarization. As reported in T$_d$-MoTe$_2$, the interlayer shifts of $C_{2z}$-related centrosymmetric 1T$^{\prime}$-monolayers actually break IS, yielding ferroelectricity in a semimetal~\cite{MoTe2.wzj.PRL}. Inspiredly, we construct a bilayer system, where the top and bottom 1T-monolayers ($xy$-plane) are related by $C_{2z}$ rotation. 
Hereafter, starting from the centrosymmetric monolayer without $C_{2z}$ symmetry, the $C_{2z}$-related bilayer system is called the $\pi$-bilayer, which breaks IS. 
The $\pi$-bilayer structure can be widely found in nature materials, such as 1T$^{\prime}$/T$_d$/T$_0$-TMD~\cite{MoTe2.wzj.PRL,workinprogress2}. Exfoliated from the T$_d$-MoTe$_2$ bulk, the FE polarization of the metallic MoTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer (with 1T$^{\prime}$-monolayer) is computed to be 0.25 pC/m. As the FE structure and nonpolar structure are confirmed in experiments, the observation of the FE flip under the electric field is expected~\cite{T1-MoTe2.Nature}.
The interlayer Te atoms distance $d_z$ of the $\pi$-bilayer is obtained by fully relaxation. Its stucture is parametrized by the $\textbf{v}_{||}\equiv M_{top}-M_{bottom}=(x_1,x_2)$ [with respect to the lattice constants; $\textbf{v}_{||}=x_1 \textbf{a} +x_2 \textbf{b}$].

In the series of $\pi$-bilayer structures, a glide symmetry ($g_z$: mirror symmetry $m_z$ with a fractional in-plane translattion) is preserved in the systems with $x_{1,2} = 0, 1/2$, while others with $x_{1,2}\neq 0 ~or~1/2$ do not have such a $g_z$ and have a polar axis along $z$ direction. 
The two FE phases with SG $P3m1$ (\#156) of PtTe$_2$ are obtained in our calculations [FE1: $\textbf{v}_{||}=(1/3,2/3)$; FE2: $\textbf{v}_{||}=(2/3,1/3)$], whose structures are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(b). 
Because the two FE structures are related by $m_z$ symmtery, they have the opposite vertical polarizations.
The vertical polarizations of $M$Te$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayers are presented in Table~\ref{table:1}.
For PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer, the vertical polarization is 0.46 pC/m, comparable to that of the previous FEM WTe$_2$ ($\sim$0.40 pC/m)~\cite{WTe2.Nature, WTe2.JPCL}.
Due to the existence of $C_{3z}$ symmetry, the net in-plane polarization is zero.
The existence of vertical polarization is also confirmed by the discontinuity of vacuum levels on the upper and lower sides of the slab, details of which are shown in Section~\ref{SM2} of the SM.






\paragraph*{Ferroelectric switching through interlayer sliding.}
From the total energy and vertical polarization as a function of the $\textbf{v}_{||}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(c) and Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(e), we obtained FE switching pathway realized by interlayer sliding as depicted by the dashed line. The energy barrier and polarization transition on the pathway are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(d) and Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(f), respectively. As global ground states, two FE phases are dynamically stable, which is confirmed by phonon spectra in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}(a) for PtTe$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayer.
The phonon spectra of PtTe$_2$ paraeletric (PE) $\pi$-bilayer is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}(b), with the vibration pattern of B1 optical soft mode at $\Gamma$ point depicted in inset.
The PE phase with $\textbf{v}_{||}=(1/2,1/2)$ at the saddle point of energy surface is unstable and will spontaneously transition to two FE phases, which indicates that the PE phase is the transition state of the FE switching pathway.

In addition, the typical energy double well structure is clearly visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(d), with a very low energy barrier of 56 meV per unit cell for PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer, which is listed in Table~\ref{table:1}. Such a low energy barrier is attributed to the fact that the interlayer sliding to achieve FE switching only needs to overcome weak interlayer vdW interactions, which does not involve the deformations of tightly bonded atoms as in displacive ferroelectrics~\cite{In2Se3.NC, BaTiO.Nature}. Sliding driven the oscillation of interlayer potential can generate alternating current, which provides a platform for the development of nanogenerator~\cite{Nano.2017, WTe2.JPCL}.
For PdTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers, contour plots of total energy and vertical polarization versus the $\textbf{v}_{||}$ and phonon spectra can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:S2} and Fig.~\ref{fig:S3}, which are similar to those of PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer.

\end{figure*}



\paragraph*{Origin of vertical polarization.}
Interlayer sliding can be equivalent to rigid ion translation without vertical displacement, so vertical polarization is purely electronic in origin. We attribute the origin of polarization to the asymmetric charge density redistribution induced by interlayer vdW interactions, instead of the subtle ion displacement along polarization direction from the inversion center as in displacive ferroelectrics represented by perovskite oxides~\cite{BaTiO.Nature}. In FE1 phase (see Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(a)), Te atom (Te$_{dn}$) at interface in the lower layer is directly below Pt atom (Pt$_{up}$) in the upper layer, while Te atom (Te$_{up}$) at interface in the upper layer sits above the center of triangle spanned by Pt atom (Pt$_{dn}$) in the lower layer. This asymmetric vdW stacking causes strong distortion of spatially extended Te$_{dn}$-$p_z$ orbital, making the interlayer vdW charge transfer near Te$_{dn}$ atom significantly deviates from the symmetric distribution of PE phase, as shown by plane-averaged charge density difference along $z$ direction in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(a) for PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer. The same situation can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:S4} for PdTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers. 
These results are consistent with the general theory for bilayer stacking ferroelectricity~\cite{Stacking.arXiv}.
When the top layer slides along the switching pathway, the interlayer vdW charge transfer gradually reverses, resulting in the reversal of vertical polarization. Additionally, FE materials usually have piezoelectric effect. By compressing $d_z$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(b), vertical polarization can be further enhanced due to more intense vdW charge transfer.




\paragraph*{Metallicity.}
 It is worth mentioning that the vdW charge transfer also introduces additional metallicity into our FE $\pi$-bilayers. Although the monolayer is insulating, the bilayer becomes metallic, which is checked by the HSE06 functional (Section~\ref{SM3} of the SM). After the stacking, Te$_{up}$ and Te$_{dn}$ atoms loses electrons seriously due to the space expansion of $p_z$ orbital, forming a large charge depletion zone like $p_z$ orbital, as shown by charge density difference in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(a) for PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer. When the two monolayers are far apart in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(c), band structure can be regarded as a direct doubling of the band of monolayer in Fig.~\ref{fig:S6}(a). With the increase of the interlayer vdW charge transfer due to the reduced $d_z$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(d-f), the valence band dominated by Te$_{up}$-$p_z$ and Te$_{dn}$-$p_z$ orbitals gradually rise above $E_F$ near $\Gamma$ point, moving PtTe$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayer from an insulating phase to a metallic phase (see more in Section~\ref{SM4} of the SM).

In particular, the origin of metallicity of $M$Te$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers is different from that of the previous FEM WTe$_2$ multilayers, where the centrosymmetric monolayer is already metallic~\cite{WTe2.Nature, WTe2.JPCL}. In addition, by stacking 2D FE semiconductor to manipulate depolarization field, it is possible to drive the inversion of the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum, which is successful in introducing metallicity into In$_2X_3$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) FE system~\cite{In2Se3.MH}. Electron doping is also an effective strategy. Very recently, by applying external gate bias to introduce free carriers, the coexistence of vertical polarization and in-plane conductance is realized in MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ insulated FE bilayers~\cite{MoS2.Nature2022}.

\end{figure}



\paragraph*{Polarization versus doping.}
Then we will discuss the tunability of polarization in PtTe$_2$-family $\pi$-bilayers through electron doping. Due to the metallic nature of FEMs, their carrier densities can be easily modified, and this can be simulated by replacing Te atoms with I atoms as electron doping. In Fig.~\ref{fig:4}, we simulate carrier densities regulation of polarization. The vertical polarization of the PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer is shown to decrease to zero and then increase in the opposite direction with the increase of additional electrons. The magnitude of polarization reaches a maximum of 0.59 pC/m when doping 0.67 $e$ per unit cell, which is slightly larger than the original polarization of PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer. The introduction of effective electron doping in $M$Te$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers causes the negative charge centers to move upward relative to their positive charge centers. 
Recently, the full tunability of polarization by changing carrier densities in FEM WTe$_2$ bilayer is proved by experiments~\cite{WTe2.doping.NC}.
Our results suggest that this ability to significantly adjust vertical polarization through charge carrier doping is a great advantage of $M$Te$_2$ FEMs and will be of great experimental interest.



\paragraph*{Discussion.}
FEMs (or FE-like metals) are rare in nature but have demonstrated various fascinating properties, such as unconventional superconductivity~\cite{SrTiO.supe.NP, SC.Nature2004}, unique optical responses~\cite{OP.PRB2010, OP.PRB2011}, and novel magnetoelectric effects~\cite{ME.PRL1995, ME.PRB2018}. The vdW layered materials provide an ideal platform for the study of sliding and metallic ferroelectricity due to their unique interlayer interactions. In our work, we demonstrate that the series of PtTe$_2$-family $\pi$-bilayers are typical FEMs with significant adjustment of vertical polarization by changing carrier densities. First, we design the metallic $\pi$-bilayer structure with vertical polarization by starting from centrosymmetric insulating 1T-monolayers. Second, we show that the switching of vertical polarization is coupled with interlayer sliding, where a low energy barrier ensures high speed and energy-saving data storage and processing. Third, we explain that the polarization and metallicity are caused by charge density redistribution of the Te-$p_z$ orbital, induced by interlayer vdW interactions. Finally, we find that vertical polarization can be significantly adjusted in both magnitude and direction by doping I atoms, which is a great advantage of $M$Te$_2$ FEMs. Electron doping causes the negative charge center to move upward relative to the positive charge center. These results predict a new class of typical 2D FEMs, which have potential applicatioons in functional nanodevices such as ferroelectric tunneling junction and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.
In addition, the $\pi$-bilayer of MoTe$_2$ simultaneously exhibits ferroelectricity and superconductivity, whose superconducting state can be controlled independently by doping and polarization. If the monolayer is a 2D quantum spin hall insulator, the $\pi$-bilayer would show both ferroelectricity and topology. In conclusion, the $\pi$-bilayer structure can be obtained in nature or in laboratory, which enables us to manipulate the interplay between the ferroelectricity and other novel properties, such as superconductivity and topology.

\subsection{Calculation method of vertical polarization}
\label{SM1}
Due to the disappearance of polarization uncertainty caused by the absence of periodicity in the out-of-plane direction, the vertical polarization of 2D systems is well defined by the classical dipole method~\cite{In2Se3.NC, WTe2.JPCL, M1M1P2X6.SB, In2Se3.MH}. The ion vertical polarization can be calculated by the point charge model, as shown in the following formula:
\begin{equation}
  P_{ion}=\frac{e}{S}\sum_{i}z_iQ_i=\frac{e}{S}\overline{z}_{ion}n
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the in-plane area of unit cell, $e$ is the elementary charge, $z_i$ is the spatial position of $i^{th}$ ion along $z$ direction, $Q_i$ is the ionic charge of $i^{th}$ ion, $n$ is the total number of electrons, and $\overline{z}_{ion}$ represents the ion center (positive charge center) of system in $z$ direction. The sum is over all ions in unit cell.  

Because of the continuous distribution of electron cloud, the electron vertical polarization can be calculated using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  P_e=-\frac{e}{S}\iiint z\rho(\textbf{r})d\textbf{r}=-\frac{e}{S}\overline{z}_{e}n \label{Pe}
\end{equation}
where $\rho(\textbf{r})$ represents the electronic charge density, $\overline{z}_{e}$ represents the electron center (negative charge center) of system in $z$ direction, and the integral is over the whole unit cell.

The total vertical polarization is the sum of the ion polarization and the electron polarization,
\begin{equation}
  P=P_{ion}+P_e=\frac{e}{S}\sum_{i}z_iQ_i-\frac{e}{S}\iiint z\rho(\textbf{r})d\textbf{r} \label{Ptotal}
\end{equation}
where the direction is from the negative charge center to the positive charge center.

\subsection{Discontinuity of vacuum levels}
\label{SM2}
Due to the presence of spontaneous vertical polarization, there is a built-in electric field, resulting in different vacuum levels on the upper and lower sides of FE slab. As shown by plane-averaged electrostatic potential along $z$ direction in Fig.~\ref{fig:S1}, the discontinuity of vacuum levels $(\Delta\varphi=\varphi_1 - \varphi_2)$ is obvious, where $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ represent the vacuum levels of the top and bottom sides, respectively. For PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers in Fig.~\ref{fig:S1}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig:S1}(b), the negative $\Delta\varphi$ (-0.051 eV) of FE1 phase indicates an upward vertical polarization, while a vertical polarization of FE2 phase with the equal magnitude and the opposite direction is demonstrated by the positive $\Delta\varphi$ (0.051 eV) with the equal magnitude. The same is true for PdTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S1}(c-f). The larger $\Delta\varphi$, the greater spontaneous polarization, which is also reflected in $M$Te$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayers.

\subsection{Band structure with the HSE06 functional}
\label{SM3}
In order to check the metallicity of $M$Te$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayers, we employ the HSE06 functional to obtain more accurate band structures. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S5}, the bilayers are metallic, which is consistent with the results of the PBE functional (see Fig.~\ref{fig:3}(f), Fig.~\ref{fig:S7}(d), and Fig.~\ref{fig:S7}(h)). The difference in band structure obtained by the HSE06 function and the PBE function is negligible.


\subsection{Origin of metallicity for PdTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers}
\label{SM4}
As with PtTe$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayer described in main text, interlayer vdW charge transfer also causes the valence band rise to introduce metallicity into PdTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayers. With the increase of the interlayer vdW charge transfer due to the reduced $d_z$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:S7}(a-d), the valence band dominated by the Te$_{up}$-$p_z$ and Te$_{dn}$-$p_z$ orbitals gradually rise above $E_F$ near $\Gamma$ point, which transforms PdTe$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayer from an insulator to a metal. For NiTe$_2$ 1T-monolayer in Fig.~\ref{fig:S6}(c), although there is a non-zero density of states near $E_F$, only two isolated valence bands dominated by the Te-$p_x$ and Te-$p_y$ orbitals pass through $E_F$, limiting conductivity. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S7}(e-h), the same valence band rise gives NiTe$_2$ FE $\pi$-bilayer more conductive electron states.

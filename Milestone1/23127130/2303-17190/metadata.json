    "abstract": "We classify the self-dual (or holomorphic) vertex operator superalgebras of central charge 24, or in physics parlance the two-dimensional (possibly fermionic) conformal field theories with just one primary field.\n  There are exactly 969 such vertex operator superalgebras under suitable regularity assumptions (essentially strong rationality) and the assumption that the shorter moonshine module $V\\!B^\\natural$ is the unique self-dual vertex operator superalgebra of central charge 23.5 whose weight-1/2 and weight-1 spaces vanish. Additionally, there might be self-dual vertex operator superalgebras arising as fake copies of $V\\!B^\\natural$ tensored with a free fermion $F$.\n  We construct and classify the self-dual vertex operator superalgebras by determining the 2-neighbourhood graph of the self-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 and also by realising them as simple-current extensions of a dual pair containing a certain maximal lattice vertex operator algebra. We show that all vertex operator superalgebras besides $V\\!B^\\natural\\otimes F$ and potential fake copies thereof stem from elements of the Conway group $\\mathrm{Co}_0$, the automorphism group of the Leech lattice $Λ$.\n  By splitting off free fermions if possible we obtain the classification for all central charges less than or equal to 24.",

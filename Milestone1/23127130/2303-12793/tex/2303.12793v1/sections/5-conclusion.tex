\section{Conclusion \label{Sec:Conclusion}}
In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \textbf{C}ross-l\textbf{i}ngual \textbf{Co}ntrastive learning (CiCo) for recently introduced sign language retrieval task. We formulate sign language retrieval as a cross-lingual retrieval task as well as a video-text retrieval problem. CiCo models the fine-grained cross-lingual mappings between sign videos and texts via the proposed cross-lingual contrastive learning. We also introduce a sign encoder, which is composed of a domain-agnostic encoder and a domain-aware one, to extract discriminative and domain-aligned features. Our Cico outperforms the pioneer SPOT-ALIGN by large margins on How2Sign and PHOENIX-2014T benchmarks. We also provide a baseline on CSL-Daily. We hope our approach could serve as a solid baseline for future research.

    "abstract": "The four-wave mixing process is a fundamental nonlinear interaction in Kerr media that can be described by a closed trajectory in the associated phase plane. We show here that it is possible to manipulate these trajectories and to connect two points that are not part of the same orbit. Our approach is based on a localized abrupt modification of the average power of the system. This mechanism is confirmed using different experimental realizations where iterative propagation in a short fiber segments mimics propagation in an idealized optical fiber.",

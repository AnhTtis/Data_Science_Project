    "abstract": "Trans-Neptunian objects smaller than a few kilometers are difficult to observe directly. They can be detected when they randomly occult a background star. Close to the ecliptic plane, each star is occulted once every tens of thousands of hours, and occultations typically last for less than a second. We present an algorithm, and companion pipeline, for detection of diffractive occultation events. Our approach includes: cleaning the data; an efficient and optimal matched filtering of the light-curves with a template bank of diffractive occultations; treating the red-noise in the light-curves; injection of simulated events for efficiency estimation; and applying data quality cuts. We discuss human vetting of the candidate events in a blinded way to reduce bias caused by the human-in-the-loop. We present Markov Chain Monte Carlo tools to estimate the parameters of candidate occultations, and test them on simulated events. This pipeline is used by the Weizmann Fast Astronomical Survey Telescope (W-FAST).",

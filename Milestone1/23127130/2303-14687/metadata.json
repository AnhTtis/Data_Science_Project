    "abstract": "Given a tensor functor between tensor categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$, we give criteria that, under certain assumptions, the Frobeniusness of $\\mathcal{C}$ or $\\mathcal{D}$ implies the Frobeniusness of the other one. We also give an affirmative answer to Natale's question asking if the class of Frobenius tensor categories is closed under exact sequences.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing question of the mutual relation between the stack and queue numbers of a graph, explicitly emphasized by Dujmović and Wood in 2005, was \"half-answered\" by Dujmović, Eppstein, Hickingbotham, Morin and Wood in 2022; they proved the existence of a graph family with the queue number at most 4 but unbounded stack number. We give an alternative very short, and still elementary, proof of the same fact.",

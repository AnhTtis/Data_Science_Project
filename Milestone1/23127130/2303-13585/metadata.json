    "abstract": "We provide further motivation for the string lamppost principle in 9d supergravities. Using a blend of ideas which includes Swampland conjectures, finiteness of black hole entropy, and classification of SCFTs, we show that infinite distance limits that keep BPS states heavy must decompactify to type IIA supergravity on an interval. Without relying on string theory, we provide bottom-up explanations for various UV features of the theory, such as the physics near the orientifold branes and the worldvolume theories of different stacks of non-perturbative 8-branes. We also provide a Swampland argument for the countability of the number of inequivalent string limits up to dualities which is a strong result with applications beyond this work.",

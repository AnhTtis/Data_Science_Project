\begin{abstract}

The resolution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is tricky, and it is well known that one of the major issue is to approach the space: $$ \bH^1(\Omega) \cap \bH(\dive0;\Omega):=\left\{\vvec\in \bH^1(\Omega)\, :\, \dive\vvec = 0 \right\}. $$ 
The non-conforming Crouzeix-Raviart finite element are convenient since they induce local mass conservation. Moreover they are such that the stability constant of the Fortin operator is equal to $1$. This implies that they can easily handle anisotropic mesh \cite{Apel01,Apel01Bis}. However spurious velocities may appear and damage the approximation.

 We propose a scheme here that allows to reduce the spurious velocities. It is based on a new discretisation for the gradient of pressure based on the symmetric MPFA scheme (finite volume MultiPoint Flux Approximation)  \cite{agelasMasson08,LEPOTIER05bis,lepotierhdr}.

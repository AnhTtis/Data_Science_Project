    "abstract": "We propose a categorification of the Dowker duality theorem for relations. Dowker's theorem states that the Dowker complex of a relation $R \\subseteq X \\times Y$ of sets $X$ and $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to the Dowker complex of the transpose relation $R^T \\subseteq Y \\times X$. Given a relation $R$ of small categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$, that is, a functor of the form $R \\colon \\mathcal{R} \\to \\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{D}$, we define the bisimplicial rectangle nerve $ER$ and the Dowker nerve $DR$. The diagonal $d(ER)$ of the bisimplicial set $ER$ maps to the simplicial set $DR$ by a natural projection $d(π_R) \\colon d(ER) \\to DR$.\n  We introduce a criterion on relations of categories ensuring that the projection from the diagonal of the bisimplicial rectangle nerve to the Dowker nerve is a weak equivalence. Relations satisfying this criterion are called Dowker relations. If both the relation $R$ of categories and its transpose relation $R^T$ are Dowker relations, then the Dowker nerves $DR$ and $DR^T$ are weakly equivalent simplicial sets.\n  In order to justify the abstraction introduced by our categorification we give two applications. The first application is to show that Quillen's Theorem A can be considered as an instance of Dowker duality. In the second application we consider a simplicial complex $K$ with vertex set $V$ and show that the geometric realization of $K$ is naturally homotopy equivalent to the geometric realization of the simplicial set with the set of $n$-simplices given by functions $\\{0,1,\\dots,n\\}\\to V$ whose image is a simplex of $K$.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the shadow of an exact black hole solution of Einstein's equations recently proposed by Cardoso et al., to describe a supermassive black hole immersed in a dark matter halo. We analyze and discuss the light rings and the gravitational lensing of this spacetime comparing them with an isolated Schwarzschild black hole. Using backward ray-tracing techniques, we study the shadows cast by such black hole when illuminated by a celestial sphere that emits radiation isotropically. We find that when the dark matter distribution concentrates near the event horizon of the black hole, multiple light rings emerge. In this high compactness regime, the shadows and gravitational lensing are significantly different from the Schwarzschild one. We also use the M87* and SgrA* shadow data, obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, to constrain the parameters of the dark matter halo.",

    "abstract": "This paper is the fourth in a series of four papers aiming to describe the (almost integral) Chow ring of $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_3$, the moduli stack of stable curves of genus $3$. In this paper, we finally compute the Chow ring of $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_3$ with $\\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$-coefficients.",

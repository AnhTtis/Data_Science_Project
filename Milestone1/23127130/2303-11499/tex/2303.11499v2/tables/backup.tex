  %\TK{@Raveesh - by x do you mean you can do either s or t for that dimension? So does that mean each row is actually multiple datapoints? Thats confusing.}\Rav{It means that the datapoint that we choose for evaluation of that dataflow can have varaible tile sizes for dimension marked by X. S and T on the other hand mean that its NECESSARILY spatial or temporal}}

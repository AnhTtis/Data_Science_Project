      Cache   & Implicit & \cellcolor{red!16}Line-level & \cellcolor{red!16}Fully Agnostic & \greencheck &  \cellcolor{red!16}Highest &   Lowest & Cache policy decisions are workload agnostic, with myopic line-level replacement and high fine-grained tag overheads. \\\hline

       FibreCache~\cite{gamma}  & Hybrid & Fiber-level & \cellcolor{orange!20}Partially Controlled & \greencheck & \cellcolor{red!20}High & \cellcolor{orange!20}Moderate & GAMMA is organized as cache to help with irregular accesses, but fibres are explicitly prefetched. This places nominal burden on programmer while also incurring a high area overhead of cache.  \\\hline

Only information needed from workload (explicit) is the start and end addresses of tensors in global address map and the local address maps along with DAG information.  \\\hline

    "abstract": "HPC applications are critical in various scientific domains ranging from molecular dynamics to chemistry to fluid dynamics. Conjugate Gradient (CG) is a popular application kernel used in iterative linear HPC solvers and has applications in numerous scientific domains. However, the HPCG benchmark shows that the peformance achieved by Top500 HPC systems on CG is a small fraction of the performance achieved on Linpack. While CG applications have significant portions of computations that are dense and sparse matrix multiplications, skewed SpMMs/GEMMs in the HPC solvers have poor arithmetic intensities which makes their execution highly memory bound unlike GEMMs in DNNs which have high arithmetic intensity. The problem of low intensity individual skewed GEMMs also exists in various emerging workloads from other domains like Graph Neural Networks, Transformers etc. In this work we identify various reuse opportunities between the tensors in these solver applications to extract reuse in the entire Directed Acyclic Graph of the tensor operations rather than individual tensor operations. These opportunities essentially depend on the dimensions of the tensors and the structure of the tensor dependency graph. We propose a systematic methodology to determine various kinds of reuse opportunities in the graph of operations and determine the loop order and tiling in the interdependent operations. As a result, we propose a novel mapping strategy GOGETA that improves reuse of HPC applications on spatial accelerators. We also propose a data organization strategy in the buffer. Our mapping achieves geomean 6.7x reduction in memory accesses.",

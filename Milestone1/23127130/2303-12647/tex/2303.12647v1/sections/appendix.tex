\label{app:task-descroption}



\subsubsection{Design prompt for the ``Moon Landing Party'' task}\hfill{}

\textbf{Assignment} You have been hired to design a poster inviting people to a fun party celebrating the 55th anniversary of the first Moon Landing. You may create multiple versions, and then choose a final design to be sent to invitees.

\textbf{About the Moon Landing} Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969. At the event, we will have Moon themed decorations, light refreshments, and very cool Moon-themed things. 


\subsubsection{Design Prompt for the ``Alice's Birthday'' task}\hfill{}

\textbf{Assignment} You have been hired to design a party invitation to Alice Liddell’s birthday party.  You may create multiple versions, and then choose a final design to be sent to all of Alice’s friends.
\textbf{Who is Alice Liddell}: Alice is a fictional character and the main protagonist of Lewis Carroll's children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass (1871). A child in the mid-Victorian era, Alice unintentionally goes on an underground adventure after accidentally falling down a rabbit hole into Wonderland; in the sequel, she steps through a mirror into an alternative world.

\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in Machine-Learning have led to the development of models that generate images based on a text description. Such large prompt-based text to image models (TTIs), trained on a considerable amount of data, allow the creation of high-quality images by users with no graphics or design training. This paper examines the role such TTI models can play in collaborative, goal-oriented design. Through a within-subjects study with 14 non-professional designers, we find that such models can help participants explore a design space rapidly and allow for fluid collaboration. We also find that text inputs to such models (“prompts”) act as reflective design material, facilitating exploration, iteration, and reflection in pair design. This work contributes to the future of collaborative design supported by generative AI by providing an account of how \LPIMs{} influence the design process and the social dynamics around design and suggesting implications for tool design.
%\todo{Abstract}%Recent advances in deep generative neural networks have made it possible for artificial intelligence to actively collaborate with human beings in co-creating novel content (e.g. music, art). While substantial research focuses on (individual) human-AI collaborations, comparatively less research examines how AI can play a role in human-human collaborations during co-creation. In a qualitative lab study, we observed 30 participants (15 pairs) compose a musical phrase in pairs, both with and without AI. Our findings reveal that AI may play important roles in influencing human social dynamics during creativity, including: 1) implicitly seeding a common ground at the start of collaboration, 2) acting as a psychological safety net in creative risk-taking, 3) providing a force for group progress, 4) mitigating interpersonal stalling and friction, and 5) altering users’ collaborative and creative roles. This work contributes to the future of generative AI in social creativity by providing implications for how AI could enrich, impede, or alter creative social dynamics in the years to come.

\caption{Large prompt-based text-to-image models enable rapid exploration of a design space, and fluid collaboration. By allowing users to declaratively and quickly create images through text descriptions, these text prompts act as a \textit{reflective design material} aiding exploration and collaboration. We observe that designers create prompts based on their tacit understanding of the model, and model outputs in turn both spark new ideas and allow rapid refinement of prompts.}

In the middle, prompt-base image generation models generate images from these prompts (on the right). Based on the generated images, designers may iterate by refining their idea  or refining the current prompt.

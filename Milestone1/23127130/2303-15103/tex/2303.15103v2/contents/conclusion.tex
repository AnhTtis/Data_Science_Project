\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we take the probabilistic perspective of contrastive learning, and prove that it is essentially running spectral clustering on the predefined similarity graph. Extending this result to multi-modal learning, we show that CLIP is also doing the generalized spectral clustering on the pair graph. Based on the maximum entropy principle and other useful properties, we propose to use the mixtures of exponential kernels (Kernel-InfoNCE loss) to replace the Gaussian kernel, which has achieved better performance empirically.

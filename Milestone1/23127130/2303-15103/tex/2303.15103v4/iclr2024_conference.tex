% Authors must not appear in the submitted version. They should be hidden
% as long as the \iclrfinalcopy macro remains commented out below.
% Non-anonymous submissions will be rejected without review.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section*{Author Contributions}
Yifan Zhang suggests the relationship between MRF and contrastive learning. Zhiquan Tan discovered the MRF framework for dimension reduction~\citep{van2022probabilistic}, and applied this framework to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. He also introduced the viewpoint of the maximum entropy principle for contrastive learning. Yifan and Zhiquan proposed Kernel-InfoNCE loss and refined the paper. Jingqin Yang did comprehensive experiments on Kernel-InfoNCE loss. Yang Yuan extended Theorem~\ref{thm:main} to CLIP, and wrote most of the paper.

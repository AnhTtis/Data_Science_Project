% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\subsubsection*{Author Contributions}
Yifan Zhang proposed the RKHS view of Self-supervised Learning, equivalence between InfoNCE and Markov Random Field. Zhiquan Tan discovered the MRF framework for dimension reduction~\citep{van2022probabilistic}, and applied this framework to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. He also introduced the viewpoint of the maximum entropy principle for contrastive learning. Yifan Zhang discovered the work LaCLIP. Yifan and Zhiquan proposed Kernel-InfoNCE loss and refined the paper. Jingqin Yang did comprehensive experiments on Kernel-InfoNCE loss. Yang Yuan extended Theorem~\ref{thm:main} to CLIP, and wrote most part of the paper.

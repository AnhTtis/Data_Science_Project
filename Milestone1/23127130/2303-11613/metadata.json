    "abstract": "We construct a class of chiral fermionic CFTs from classical codes over finite fields whose order is a prime number. We exploit the relationship between classical codes and Euclidean lattices to provide the Neveu-Schwarz sector of fermionic CFTs. On the other hand, we construct the Ramond sector using the shadow theory of classical codes and Euclidean lattices. We give various examples of chiral fermionic CFTs through our construction. We also explore supersymmetric CFTs in terms of classical codes by requiring the resulting fermionic CFTs to satisfy some necessary conditions for supersymmetry.",

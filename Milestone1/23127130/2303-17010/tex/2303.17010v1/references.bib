                   Fletcher, Luke and Rosman, Guy",
  abstract      = "Predicting the motion of a driver's vehicle is crucial for
                   advanced driving systems, enabling detection of potential
                   risks towards shared control between the driver and
                   automation systems. In this paper, we propose a variational
                   neural network approach that predicts future driver
                   trajectory distributions for the vehicle based on multiple
                   sensors. Our predictor generates both a conditional
                   variational distribution of future trajectories, as well as
                   a confidence estimate for different time horizons. Our
                   approach allows us to handle inherently uncertain
                   situations, and reason about information gain from each
                   input, as well as combine our model with additional
                   predictors, creating a mixture of experts. We show how to
                   augment the variational predictor with a physics-based
                   predictor, and based on their confidence estimations,
                   improve overall system performance. The resulting combined
                   model is aware of the uncertainty associated with its
                   predictions, which can help the vehicle autonomy to make
                   decisions with more confidence. The model is validated on
                   real-world urban driving data collected in multiple
                   locations. This validation demonstrates that our approach
                   improves the prediction error of a physics-based model by
                   25\% while successfully identifying the uncertain cases with
                   82\% accuracy.",

  author   = "Ladosz, Pawel and Weng, Lilian and Kim, Minwoo and Oh, Hyondong",
  abstract = "This paper reviews exploration techniques in deep reinforcement
              learning. Exploration techniques are of primary importance when
              solving sparse reward problems. In sparse reward problems, the
              reward is rare, which means that the agent will not find the
              reward often by acting randomly. In such a scenario, it is
              challenging for reinforcement learning to learn rewards and
              actions association. Thus more sophisticated exploration methods
              need to be devised. This review provides a comprehensive overview
              of existing exploration approaches, which are categorised based
              on the key contributions as: reward novel states, reward diverse
              behaviours, goal-based methods, probabilistic methods,
              imitation-based methods, safe exploration and random-based
              methods. Then, unsolved challenges are discussed to provide
              valuable future research directions. Finally, the approaches of

  abstract  = "Deep Imitation Learning requires a large number of expert
               demonstrations, which are not always easy to obtain, especially
               for complex tasks. A way to overcome this shortage of labels is
               through data augmentation. However, this cannot be easily
               applied to control tasks due to the sequential nature of the
               problem. In this work, we introduce a novel augmentation method
               which preserves the success of the augmented trajectories. To
               achieve this, we introduce a semi-supervised correction network
               that aims to correct distorted expert actions. To adequately
               test the abilities of the correction network, we develop an
               adversarial data augmented imitation architecture to train an
               imitation agent using synthetic experts. Additionally, we
               introduce a metric to measure diversity in trajectory datasets.
               Experiments show that our data augmentation strategy can improve
               accuracy and convergence time of adversarial imitation while
               preserving the diversity between the generated and real
               trajectories.",

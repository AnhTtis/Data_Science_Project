    "abstract": "The toroidal dipole excitation is an important field for metamaterial research because of their low-loss attribute. In this study, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally, a unique polarization independent terahertz metamaterial that modulates a broad resonance into a sharp mode by coupling the inherent toroidal dipole excitation to the lattice mode of the metasurface. The advantage of polarization independence in the metasurface enables the excitation of lattice-coupled toroidal mode for both the transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes of the incident terahertz radiation. The interaction of the two dark low-loss modes results in the significant enhancement of the quality factor of the metasurface at the point of resonance matching. Such a polarization independent lattice-matched toroidal excitation-based device has the potential to impact the development of low loss terahertz component for ultrasensitive sensors, low loss equipment, and slow light devices for enhanced light matter interaction.",

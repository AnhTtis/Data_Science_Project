    "abstract": "We obtain charged spherically symmetric black holes in the two-component scalar Einstein-Maxwell-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model with a symmetry breaking potential. These asymptotically flat black holes carry resonant scalar Q-hair. As expected, these hairy black holes give rise to non-uniqueness. When comparing these solutions with the corresponding charged boson stars and Reissner-Nordström black holes, we find a different pattern in the case of a massive real scalar component and a massless one. We demonstrate that, as the real component becomes massless, the resonant hairy black holes bifurcate from Reissner-Nordström black holes for sufficiently small gravitational coupling.",

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of RDF datasets has resulted in studies focusing on optimizing SPARQL query processing. Most existing work focuses on basic graph patterns (BGPs) and ignores other vital operators in SPARQL, such as \texttt{UNION} and \texttt{OPTIONAL}. SPARQL queries with these operators, which we abbreviate as SPARQL-UO, pose serious query plan generation challenges. In this paper, we propose techniques for executing SPARQL-UO queries using BGP execution as a building block, based on a novel \underline{B}GP-based \underline{E}valuation (BE)-Tree representation of query plans. On top of this, we propose a series of \emph{cost-driven BE-tree transformations} to generate more efficient plans by reducing the search space and intermediate result sizes, and a \emph{candidate pruning} technique that further enhances efficiency at query time. Experiments confirm that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by orders of magnitude.

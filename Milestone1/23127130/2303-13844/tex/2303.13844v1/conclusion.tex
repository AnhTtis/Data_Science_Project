\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The proliferation of knowledge graph applications has generated increasing RDF data management problems. In this paper, we focus on how to optimize SPARQL queries with \texttt{UNION} and \texttt{OPTIONAL} clauses (SPARQL-UO for short). Making use of existing BGP query evaluation modules in SPARQL engines, we propose a series of cost-driven transformations on the BGP-based evaluation tree (BE-tree). These optimizations can significantly reduce the search space and intermediate result sizes, and thus improve both the time and space efficiency of SPARQL-UO query evaluation. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our optimizations, and compare the performance of the optimized method with the state-of-the-art on large-scale synthetic and real RDF datasets containing millions of triples. These experiments confirm that our SPARQL-UO query evaluation method is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing work.

%In our future work, we will consider incorporating other types of SPARQL expressions (such as \texttt{FILTER}) into our optimization framework, so as to design a comprehensive cost-based SPARQL optimizer that can be applied to any RDF database system.

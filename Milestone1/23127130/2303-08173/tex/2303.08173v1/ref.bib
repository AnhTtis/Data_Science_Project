We generalize an earlier concept of “induced events” for this framework to include system features such as delays in control signals or modeling multiple user classes sharing a resource. We apply this generalized IPA to two SHS with diﬀerent characteristics. First, we develop a gradient estimator for the performance of a linear switched system with control signal delays and a safety constraint and show that it is independent of the random delay distributional characteristics. Second, we derive closedform unbiased IPA estimators for a Stochastic Flow Model (SFM) of systems executing tasks subject to either hard or soft real-time constraints. These estimators are incorporated in a gradient-based algorithm to optimize performance by controlling a task admission threshold parameter. Simulation results are included to illustrate this optimization approach.},

It consists of surface-way networks, freeway networks, and ramps with a mixed trafﬁc ﬂow of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Trafﬁc congestions occur frequently, which affect daily life and pose all kinds of problems and challenges. Alleviation of trafﬁc congestions not only improves travel safety and efﬁciencies but also reduces environmental pollution. Among all the solutions, trafﬁc signal control (TSC) is commonly thought as the most important and effective method. TSC algorithms have evolved quickly, especially over the past several decades. As a result, several TSC systems have been widely implemented in the world, making TSC a major component of intelligent transportation system (ITS). In TSC and ITS, many new technologies can be adopted. Computational intelligence (CI), which mainly includes artiﬁcial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary computation algorithms, brings ﬂexibility, autonomy, and robustness to overcome nonlinearity and randomness of trafﬁc systems. This paper surveys some commonly used CI paradigms, analyzes their applications in TSC systems for urban surface-way and freeway networks, and introduces current and potential issues of control and management of recurrent and nonrecurrent congestions in trafﬁc networks, in order to provide valuable references for further research and development.},

The traditional queue spillover phenomenon in the trafﬁc models can be prevented here. Second, aiming at the coordination and dynamic uncertainty problem in arterial trafﬁc, a coordinated arterial trafﬁc type-2 fuzzy coordination control method is put forward. It consists of two-layer type-2 fuzzy controller, the basic control layer and the coordination layer. The former allocates green time according to the trafﬁc situation of each intersection, while the latter adjusts each intersection’s green time on basis of the vehicles between the intersection and the downstream intersections for the purpose of enlarging green wave band. Finally, in order to conﬁgure the high-dimensional complex parameters of the coordinated two-layer type-2 FLC effectively, the parameters of membership function and the rules of the two controllers are optimized alternately by gravitational search algorithm. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method from several aspects.},

This controller uses neural network (NN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to adapt the traffic signal timings according to the congestion. NN takes signal timings as input and gives the queue length as output. GA is further applied to get the optimized green signal timing at its output, which is capable of reducing the queue length and overall delay.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising datadriven approach for adaptive trafﬁc signal control (ATSC) in complex urban trafﬁc networks, and deep neural networks further enhance its learning power. However, the centralized RL is infeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the joint action space. The multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by distributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new challenges: now, the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint of each local agent due to limited communication among agents. Most existing studies in MARL focus on designing efﬁcient communication and coordination among traditional Q-learning agents. This paper presents, for the ﬁrst time, a fully scalable and decentralized MARL algorithm for the state-of-the-art deep RL agent, advantage actor critic (A2C), within the context of ATSC. In particular, two methods are proposed to stabilize the learning procedure, by improving the observability and reducing the learning difﬁculty of each local agent. The proposed multi-agent A2C is compared against independent A2C and independent Q-learning algorithms, in both a large synthetic trafﬁc grid and a large real-world trafﬁc network of Monaco city, under simulated peak-hour trafﬁc dynamics. The results demonstrate its optimality, robustness, and sample efﬁciency over the other state-of-the-art decentralized MARL algorithms.},

	abstract = {Conﬂicts between pedestrians and vehicles are one of the common safety issues at signalized intersections. Pedestrian Flashing GREEN (FG), a time interval for pedestrians on crosswalks to safely ﬁnish crossing before the next phase occurs, may fail to clear the crosswalk in the allotted time, due to signiﬁcant pedestrian non-compliant behavior. In this manner, probability of pedestrian-vehicle exposures increases when non-compatible vehicle ﬂows are released at the next immediate phase. This paper seeks to address this issue by presenting a trafﬁc signal control strategy for urban trafﬁc networks that aims to minimize vehicle traveling delay (increase efﬁciency) as well as pedestrian crossing risk (increase safety). First, a macroscopic model for pedestrian-vehicle mixed-ﬂow networks is proposed. Considering the high-incidence rate of pedestrian violations during FG, an additional Dynamic All RED (DAR) phase is introduced at the end of each FG period, whose duration is adaptively adjusted according to the number of non-compliant pedestrians. With computational complexity being a concern for our model, an evolutionary algorithm with repairing mechanism (EARM), is proposed to solve our problem. Case studies are provided to illustrate the potential impact of the pedestrian movement to the vehicle trafﬁc networks when pedestrian safety is considered in the system, as well as the efﬁcacy of our trafﬁc light control strategy for pedestrians and vehicles on risk reduction.},

	abstract = {The optimization of urban trafﬁc lights is a relevant problem. With the increasing occupation of urban pathways comes mobility deterioration: increasing delays, trafﬁc jams and other consequential losses. Its relevance led to several proposals on trafﬁc light optimization; the majority of them only consider vehicular trafﬁc, to the detriment of pedestrians. Nonetheless, the longer pedestrians wait to cross, the riskier their behavior becomes, since they become more impatient. We tackle this problem through the optimization of trafﬁc lights considering the average delays of both pedestrians and vehicles, by using microscopic trafﬁc simulations. The problem is modeled on the basis of reference works of the area, and solved by an Evolution Strategy (ES). Several constraint handling methods are compared, including one proposed in this work, Two-Level Ranking (TLR), that aims to quickly ﬁnd feasible solutions, which is important for real-time execution. The ES was able to ﬁnd solutions that keep the pedestrian delays within the limits given by related work. Furthermore, in the evaluated scenario, a solution that satisﬁes the constraints is found, in average, at approximately 18.6 seconds with TLR, which is shorter than what other methods yield, allowing real-time operation.},

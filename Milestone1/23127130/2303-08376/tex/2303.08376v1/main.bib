    abstract = { It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined. }

Although it appears simple, solving the HM when the interactions are repulsive, the particles are fermions, and the temperature is low{\textemdash}all of which applies in the case of correlated electron systems{\textemdash}is computationally challenging. Two groups have tackled this important problem. Huang et al. studied a three-band version of the HM at finite temperature, whereas Zheng et al. used five complementary numerical methods that kept each other in check to discern the ground state of the HM. Both groups found evidence for stripes, or one-dimensional charge and/or spin density modulations.Science, this issue p. 1161, p. 1155Competing inhomogeneous orders are a central feature of correlated electron materials, including the high-temperature superconductors. The two-dimensional Hubbard model serves as the canonical microscopic physical model for such systems. Multiple orders have been proposed in the underdoped part of the phase diagram, which corresponds to a regime of maximum numerical difficulty. By combining the latest numerical methods in exhaustive simulations, we uncover the ordering in the underdoped ground state. We find a stripe order that has a highly compressible wavelength on an energy scale of a few kelvin, with wavelength fluctuations coupled to pairing order. The favored filled stripe order is different from that seen in real materials. Our results demonstrate the power of modern numerical methods to solve microscopic models, even in challenging settings.},

Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.",

    abstract = { The Hubbard model is the simplest model of interacting fermions on a lattice and is of similar importance to correlated electron physics as the Ising model is to statistical mechanics or the fruit fly to biomedical science. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits an incredible wealth of phases, phase transitions, and exotic correlation phenomena. Although analytical methods have provided a qualitative description of the model in certain limits, numerical tools have shown impressive progress in achieving quantitative accurate results over the past several years. This article gives an introduction to the model, motivates common questions, and illustrates the progress that has been achieved over recent years in revealing various aspects of the correlation physics of the model. }

    abstract = { The repulsive Hubbard model has been immensely useful in understanding strongly correlated electron systems and serves as the paradigmatic model of the field. Despite its simplicity, it exhibits a strikingly rich phenomenology reminiscent of that observed in quantum materials. Nevertheless, much of its phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we review a subset of what is known about the Hubbard model based on exact results or controlled approximate solutions in various limits, for which there is a suitable small parameter. Our primary focus is on the ground state properties of the system on various lattices in two spatial dimensions, although both lower and higher dimensions are discussed as well. Finally, we highlight some of the important outstanding open questions. }

abstract = "We describe the LDA band structre of YBa2Cu3O7 in the ϵF ± 2 eV range using orbital projections and compare with YBa2Cu4O8. Then, the high-energy and chain-related degrees of freedom are integrated out and we arrive at two, nearest-neighbor, orthogonal, two-center, 8-band Hamiltonians, H8+ and H8−, for respectively the even and odd bands of the bi-layer. Of the 8 orbitals, Cux2 −y2, O2x, O3y, and Cus have σ character and Cuxz, Cuyz, O2z, and O3z have π character. The roles of the Cus orbital, which has some Cu3z2 − 1 character, and the four π orbitals are as follows: Cus provides 2nd- and 3rd-nearest-neighbor (t′ and t″) intra-plane hopping, as well as hopping between planes (t⊥). The π-orbitals are responsible for bifurcation of the saddle-points for dimpled planes. The 4-σ-band Hamiltonian is generic for flat CuO2 planes and we use it for analytical studies. The k∥-dependence is expressed as one on u ≡ (cos bky + cos akx)2 and one on v ≡ (cos bky − cos akx)2. The latter arises solely through the influence of Cus. The reduction of the σ-Hamiltonian to 3- and 1-band Hamiltonians is explicitly discussed and we point out that, in addition to the hoppings commonly included in many-body calculations, the 3-band Hamiltonian should include hopping between all 2nd-nearest-neighbor oxygens and that the 1-band Hamiltonian should include 3rd-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We calculate the single-particle hopping between the planes of a bi-layer and show that it is generically: t⊥ (k∥) ≈ 0.25 eV · v2 (1 − 2ut′t)−2. The hopping through insulating spacers such as (BaO)Hg(BaO) is an order of magnitude smaller, but seems to have the same k∥-dependence. We show that the inclusion of t′ is crucial for understanding ARPES for the anti-ferromagnetic insulator Sr2CuO2Cl2. Finally, we estimate the value of the inter-plane exchange constant J⊥ for an un-doped bi-layer in meanfield theory using different single-particle Hamiltonians, the LDA for YBa2Cu3O6, the eight- and four-band Hamiltonians, as well as an analytical calculation for the latter. We conclude that J⊥ ~ − 20 meV."

abstract = {We report results of large-scale ground-state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on t-t′-J cylinders with circumferences 6 and 8. We determine a rough phase diagram that appears to approximate the two-dimensional (2D) system. While for many properties, positive and negative t′ values (t′/t=±0.2) appear to correspond to electron- and hole-doped cuprate systems, respectively, the behavior of superconductivity itself shows an inconsistency between the model and the materials. The t′\&lt;0 (hole-doped) region shows antiferromagnetism limited to very low doping, stripes more generally, and the familiar Fermi surface of the hole-doped cuprates. However, we find t′\&lt;0 strongly suppresses superconductivity. The t′\&gt;0 (electron-doped) region shows the expected circular Fermi pocket of holes around the (π,π) point and a broad low-doped region of coexisting antiferromagnetism and d-wave pairing with a triplet p component at wavevector (π,π) induced by the antiferromagnetism and d-wave pairing. The pairing for the electron low-doped system with t′\&gt;0 is strong and unambiguous in the DMRG simulations. At larger doping another broad region with stripes in addition to weaker d-wave pairing and striped p-wave pairing appears. In a small doping region near x=0.08 for t′∼−0.2, we find an unconventional type of stripe involving unpaired holes located predominantly on chains spaced three lattice spacings apart. The undoped two-leg ladder regions in between mimic the short-ranged spin correlations seen in two-leg Heisenberg ladders.}}

abstract = {Unidirectional (“stripe”) charge density wave order has now been established as a ubiquitous feature in the phase diagram of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, where it generally competes with superconductivity. Nonetheless, on theoretical grounds it has been conjectured that stripe order (or other forms of “optimal” inhomogeneity) may play an essential positive role in the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report density matrix renormalization group studies of the Hubbard model on long four- and six-leg cylinders, where the hopping matrix elements transverse to the long direction are periodically modulated—mimicking the effect of putative period 2 stripe order. We find that even modest amplitude modulations can enhance the long-distance superconducting correlations by many orders of magnitude and drive the system into a phase with a substantial spin gap and superconducting quasi–long-range order with a Luttinger exponent, Ksc∼1.}}

abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.}}

abstract = {Superconductivity in cuprates takes place in their two-dimensional (2D) layers but solving even the simplest model of interacting fermions in 2D is a challenge. The theory problem simplifies in 1D, with experiment becoming the tricky part. Chen et al. synthesized a cuprate that consists of parallel chains and behaves like a 1D system. Crucially, the material could be doped over a wide range of hole concentrations. The researchers showed that including a near-neighbor attractive interaction in a 1D model of interacting fermions was necessary to explain their photoemission measurements. —JS Photoemission measurements of a one-dimensional cuprate over a wide hole-doping range constrain the parameters of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. In the cuprates, one-dimensional (1D) chain compounds provide a distinctive opportunity to understand the microscopic physics, owing to the availability of reliable theories. However, progress has been limited by the challenge of controllably doping these materials. We report the synthesis and spectroscopic analysis of the 1D cuprate Ba2-xSrxCuO3+δ over a wide range of hole doping. Our angle-resolved photoemission experiments reveal the doping evolution of the holon and spinon branches. We identify a prominent folding branch whose intensity fails to match predictions of the simple Hubbard model. An additional strong near-neighbor attraction, which may arise from coupling to phonons, quantitatively explains experiments for all accessible doping levels. Considering structural and quantum chemistry similarities among cuprates, this attraction may play a similarly important role in high-temperature cuprate superconductors.}}

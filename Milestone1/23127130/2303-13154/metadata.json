    "abstract": "To every Hopf heap or quantum cotorsor of Grunspan a Hopf algebra of translations is associated. This translation Hopf algebra acts on the Hopf heap making it a Hopf-Galois co-object. Conversely, any Hopf-Galois co-object has the natural structure of a Hopf heap with the translation Hopf algebra isomorphic to the acting Hopf algebra. It is then shown that this assignment establishes an equivalence between categories of Hopf heaps and Hopf-Galois co-objects.",

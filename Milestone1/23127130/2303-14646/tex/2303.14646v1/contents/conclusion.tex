\revise{We propose a %novel
taxonomy based on which we divide the current strategies into different categories according to the types of the planning tasks and the nature of the methods.}
Based on the proposed taxonomy, we compare and summarize the most essential literature relevant to the topic.
Resources of data sets and simulators are reviewed and compared, which should be most useful for researchers conducting empirical studies.
At last, we discuss several future directions and their challenges.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{bioPhoto/ivan.png}}]{Yupeng Li} (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from The University of Hong Kong. He was with the University of Toronto and is currently with Hong Kong Baptist University. His research interests are in general areas of network science and, in particular, algorithmic decision making and machine learning problems, which arise in networked systems. %, such as information networks and ride-sharing platforms. 
He is also excited about interdisciplinary research that applies algorithmic techniques to edging problems. Recently, he has worked on robust online machine learning for the application of data classification, and he has extended these techniques to modern areas in networking and social media. Dr. Li has been awarded the Rising Star in Social Computing Award by CAAI and the distinction of Distinguished Member of the IEEE INFOCOM Technical Program Committee in 2022. He serves on the technical committees of some top conferences in computer science. His works have been published in prestigious venues, such as \textsc{IEEE INFOCOM}, \textsc{ACM MobiHoc}, \textsc{IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications}, and \textsc{IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking}. He is a member of ACM and IEEE.

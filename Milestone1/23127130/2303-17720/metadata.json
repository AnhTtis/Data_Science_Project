    "abstract": "Neural networks have been proven to be both highly effective within computer vision, and highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequently, as the use of neural networks increases due to their unrivaled performance, so too does the threat posed by adversarial attacks. In this work, we build towards addressing the challenge of adversarial robustness by exploring the relationship between the mini-batch size used during adversarial sample generation and the strength of the adversarial samples produced. We demonstrate that an increase in mini-batch size results in a decrease in the efficacy of the samples produced, and we draw connections between these observations and the phenomenon of vanishing gradients. Next, we formulate loss functions such that adversarial sample strength is not degraded by mini-batch size. Our findings highlight a potential risk for underestimating the true (practical) strength of adversarial attacks, and a risk of overestimating a model's robustness. We share our codes to let others replicate our experiments and to facilitate further exploration of the connections between batch size and adversarial sample strength.",

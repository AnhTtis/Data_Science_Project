    "abstract": "Within quantum thermodynamics, many tasks are modelled by processes that require work sources represented by out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, often dubbed quantum batteries, in which work can be deposited or from which work can be extracted. Here we consider quantum batteries modelled as finite-dimensional quantum systems initially in thermal equilibrium that are charged via cyclic Hamiltonian processes. We present optimal or near-optimal protocols for $N$ identical two-level systems and individual $d$-level systems with equally spaced energy gaps in terms of the charging precision and work fluctuations during the charging process. We analyze the trade-off between these figures of merit as well as the performance of local and global operations.",

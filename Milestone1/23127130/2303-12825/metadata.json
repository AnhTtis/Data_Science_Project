    "abstract": "Bilayer quantum Hall states have been shown to be described by a BCS-paired state of composite fermions. However, finding a qualitatively accurate model state valid across all values of the bilayer separation is challenging. Here, we introduce two variational wavefunctions, each with a single variational parameter, which can be thought of as a proxy for the BCS order parameter. Studying systems of up to 9+9 electrons in a spherical geometry using Monte Carlo methods, we show that the ground state can be accurately described by these single-parameter variational states. In addition, for the first time we provide a numerically exact wavefunction for the Halperin-111 state in terms of composite fermions.",

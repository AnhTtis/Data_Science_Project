    "abstract": "Non Efimovian $N$-body resonances are investigated in the regime of a large two-body s wave scattering length. In view of a universal description of low-energy bound and quasi-bound states, a contact model is introduced. The modeling requires two parameters in addition to the scattering length. Using a modified scalar product, the contact model provides a normalization of bound states, possibly not square-integrable, that coincides with that of the corresponding finite range model.",

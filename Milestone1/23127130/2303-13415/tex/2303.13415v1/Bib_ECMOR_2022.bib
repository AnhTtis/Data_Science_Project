abstract = {We present a new fully-implicit, mixed-hybrid, finite-element (MHFE) discretization scheme for general-purpose compositional reservoir simulation. The locally conservative scheme solves the coupled momentum and mass balance equations simultaneously, and the fluid system is modeled using a cubic equation-of-state. We introduce a new conservative flux approach for the mass balance equations for this fully-implicit approach. We discuss the nonlinear solution procedure for the proposed approach, and we present extensive numerical tests to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the MHFE method using tetrahedral elements. We also compare the method to other advanced discretization schemes for unstructured meshes and tensor permeability. Finally, we illustrate the applicability and robustness of the method for highly heterogeneous reservoirs with unstructured grids.},

@article{Nardean2022,
abstract = {Linear solvers for reservoir simulation applications are the objective of this review. Specifically, we focus on techniques for Fully Implicit (FI) solution methods, in which the set of governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is properly discretized in time (usually by the Backward Euler scheme), and space, and tackled by assembling and linearizing a single system of equations to solve all the model unknowns simultaneously. Due to the usually large size of these systems arising from real-world models, iterative methods, specifically Krylov subspace solvers, have become conventional choices; nonetheless, their success largely revolves around the quality of the preconditioner that is supplied to accelerate their convergence. These two intertwined elements, i.e., the solver and the preconditioner, are the focus of our analysis, especially the latter, which is still the subject of extensive research. The progressive increase in reservoir model size and complexity, along with the introduction of additional physics to the classical flow problem, display the limits of existing solvers. Intensive usage of computational and memory resources are frequent drawbacks in practice, resulting in unpleasantly slow convergence rates. Developing efficient, robust, and scalable preconditioners, often relying on physics-based assumptions, is the way to avoid potential bottlenecks in the solving phase. In this work, we proceed in reviewing principles and state-of-the-art of such linear solution tools to summarize and discuss the main advances and research directions for reservoir simulation problems. We compare the available preconditioning options, showing the connections existing among the different approaches, and try to develop a general algebraic framework.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a novel block preconditioner, labelled Explicit Decoupling Factor Approximation (EDFA), to accelerate the convergence of Krylov subspace solvers used to address the sequence of non-symmetric systems of linear equations originating from flow simulations in porous media. The flow model is discretized blending the Mixed Hybrid Finite Element (MHFE) method for Darcy's equation with the Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the mass conservation. The EDFA preconditioner is characterized by two features: the exploitation of the system matrix decoupling factors to recast the Schur complement and their inexact fully-parallel computation by means of restriction operators. We introduce two adaptive techniques aimed at building the restriction operators according to the properties of the system at hand. The proposed block preconditioner has been tested through an extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-case applications, pointing out its robustness and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Recently, graphics processing units (GPUs) have been demonstrated to provide a significant performance benefit for black-oil reservoir simulation, as well as flash calculations that serve an important role in compositional simulation. A comprehensive approach to compositional simulation based on GPUs has yet to emerge, and the question remains as to whether the benefits observed in black-oil simulation persist with a more complex fluid description. We present a positive answer to this question through the extension of a commercial GPU-basedblack-oil simulator to include a compositional description based on standard cubic equations of state (EOSs). We describe the motivations for the selected nonlinear formulation, including the choice of primary variables and iteration scheme, and support for both fully implicit methods (FIMs) and adaptive implicit methods (AIMs). We then present performance results on an example sector model and simplified synthetic case designed to allow a detailed examination of runtime and memory scaling with respect to the number of hydrocarbon components and model size, as well as the number of processors. We finally show results from two complex asset models (synthetic and real) and examine performance scaling with respect to GPU generation, demonstrating that performance correlates strongly with GPU memory bandwidth.},

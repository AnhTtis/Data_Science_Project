    "abstract": "The phenomenon of quantum tunneling remains a fascinating and enigmatic one, defying classical notions of particle behavior. This paper presents a novel theoretical investigation of the tunneling phenomenon, from the viewpoint of Hartman effect, showing that the classical concept of spatiality is transcended during tunneling, since one cannot describe the process as a crossing of the potential barrier. This means that quantum tunneling strongly indicates that quantum non-locality should be understood as an aspect of quantum non-spatiality. It is also emphasized that according to the Conceptuality Interpretation of quantum mechanics, a non-spatial state should be understood as a `state of abstractness' of a conceptual-like entity, which only when it reaches its maximum degree of concreteness, during the wave-function collapse, can enter the spatiotemporal layer of our physical reality.",

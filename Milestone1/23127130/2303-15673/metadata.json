    "abstract": "The HPCA-2023 paper \"Are Randomized Caches Truly Random?\" makes the claim that \"MIRAGE is broken\" while relying on two faulty assumptions: (1) starting from a severely compromised initial state where some sets are already full, and (2) a buggy cipher that does not provide uniformity of randomizing addresses over the cache sets. When we fixed these two shortcomings (starting with valid state and using AES/PRINCE cipher) we do not observe any conflict misses, emphasizing that Mirage remains unbroken. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the faulty assumptions of the HPCA'23 paper and share the code of our analysis along with the paper.",

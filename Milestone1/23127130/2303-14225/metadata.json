    "abstract": "By now two possible physical mechanisms of superconductivity suppression at superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) interfaces, which work even for interfaces with compensated antiferromagnets, were reported. One of them suggests that the Neel order of the AF induces rapidly oscillating spin-triplet correlations in the S layer. They are called Neel triplets and they suppress singlet superconductivity. Nonmagnetic disorder destroys this type of triplet correlations. As a result, the critical temperature of the S/AF bilayer grows with impurity strength. The second mechanism, on the contrary, suggests that nonmagnetic impurity scattering suppresses superconductivity in S/AF hybrids. The predictions were made in the framework of two different quasiclassical approaches [G. A. Bobkov et al. Phys. Rev. B 106, 144512 (2022) and E. H. Fyhn et al. arXiv:2210.09325]. Here we suggest the unified theory of the proximity effect in thin-film S/AF structures, which incorporates the both pictures as limiting cases and study the proximity effect at S/AF interfaces for arbitrary impurity strength, chemical potential and the value of the Neel exchange field.",

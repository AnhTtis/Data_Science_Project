    "abstract": "Laser sails propelled by gigawatt-scale ground-based laser arrays have the potential to reach relativistic speeds, traversing the solar system in hours and reaching nearby stars in years. Here, we describe the danger interplanetary dust poses to the survival of a laser sail during its acceleration phase. We show through multi-physics simulations how localized heating from a single optically absorbing dust particle on the sail can initiate a thermal-runaway process that rapidly spreads and destroys the entire sail. We explore potential mitigation strategies, including increasing the in-plane thermal conductivity of the sail to reduce the peak temperature at hotspots and isolating the absorptive regions of the sail which can burn away individually.",

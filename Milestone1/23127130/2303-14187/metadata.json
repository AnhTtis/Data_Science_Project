    "abstract": "We improved a previously proposed method of using closed-orbit modulation for linear optics correction. Instead of fitting individual closed orbits, the improved method decomposes the orbit oscillation data into two orthogonal modes and fits the amplitudes of the modes at all BPMs. While the original method is limited to process around tens to a hundred orbits, the improved method can process thousands of orbits, which are easily available when alternating-current (AC) waveforms are applied to the two modulating correctors. The method has been experimentally demonstrated on the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)-II storage ring.",

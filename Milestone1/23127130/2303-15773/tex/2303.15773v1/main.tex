\abstract{In the quest for high-performance quantum thermal machines, looking for an optimal thermodynamic efficiency is only part of the issue. Indeed, at the level of quantum devices, fluctuations become extremely relevant and need to be taken into account. In this paper we study the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for a quantum thermal machine with a quantum harmonic oscillator as a working medium, connected to two thermal baths, one of which is dynamically coupled. We show that parameters can be found such that the machine operates both as a quantum engine or refrigerator, with both sizeable efficiency and small fluctuations.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The rapid development of quantum technologies calls for a deeper understanding of thermodynamics and energetics at a microscopic level, where unavoidable quantum effects have to be taken into account. The extension of classical concepts of thermodynamics to the quantum realm is not only at the forefront of fundamental theoretical research~\cite{campisi11,kosloff12, niedenzu, anders, talkner20, benenti17}, but also relevant for new nanodevice applications~\cite{bjorn, giazotto,martinez, pekola, arrachea}. Mastering the thermodynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium, from energy storage to energy transfer and transduction and heat--to--work conversion, is of great importance for emerging technologies with applications in quantum computing~\cite{arrachea,krantz19, calzona}, quantum communication~\cite{aufeve, qcbook}, and quantum sensing~\cite{golokolenov}.

Spurred by the rapid emergence of new quantum technology platforms, in the last few years the first prototype realizations of quantum thermal machines~\cite{pekola, spin, cangemireview, sheng,vischi}  and quantum batteries~\cite{quach, maillette} have been reported, calling for new theoretical and experimental investigations. For instance, a great interest revolves around heat nano-engines and refrigerators where the working medium (WM) is a quantum system coupled to several thermal reservoirs. Indeed, it has been shown that a multi-terminal configuration can improve both the output power and the efficiency at maximum power~\cite{levy12, huber19, imry12, mazza04,mazza15,erdman17,sanchez2,cavaliere_iscience,lopez23,lu23}. Also, the impact of quantum coherence on the performance of thermal machines has been inspected~\cite{karimi16,pekola19,brandner17,kosloff02,rezek06,fried17,korze16,hammam22}.

Quantum devices are highly sensitive to fluctuations that may limit device performances~\cite{anders, cangemireview, paternostro, gomez0, gomez}, in contrast to macroscopic devices, where usually fluctuations can be safely neglected. To assess fluctuations, the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs)
have been recently introduced~\cite{barato, shiraishi16, timpanaro,
guarnieri, asegava, pal, shiraishi18, cangemi,menczel, koyuk, potanina}. These TURs combine steady-state currents $J$, their fluctuations $D_{J}$ and dissipation (measured by the entropy production rate $\dot{S}$), 
giving limits on the precision of currents for 
a given dissipation. 
Indeed, in Ref.~\cite{barato} it was reported that for certain classical
Markovian systems, the signal-to-noise ratio satisfies a TUR bound, showing that relative current fluctuations are 
lower bounded in terms of the inverse entropy
production rate. By introducing a dimensionless trade-off parameter $Q_J$, 
TURs can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
Q_J\equiv \dot{S}\frac{D_{J}}{J^2}\ge 2 k_B,
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant (from now on we will set $k_B=1$).
After that, several bounds for TURs~\cite{horowitz17, pietzonka18,
koyuk18, brandner18, coherence18,cangemi20,jiao20,singh}, and their possible violations, have
been put forward under different assumptions, starting from classical
Markovian dynamics to quantum systems, including time-dependent forces
and the role of time-reversal symmetry.
For instance, when the model preserves time--reversal--symmetry it
has been shown that, at least in the linear regime~\cite{cangemi,
brandner18}, the trade-off parameter $Q$ 
never achieves values lower than 2. Recently, experimental results on TURs have appeared~\cite{pal}. They thus
represent new tools to inspect the performances of so-far unexplored
resources based on non-thermal states, correlations and quantum
coherences in non-equilibrium quantum systems~\cite{paternostro}.\\

In this work, we consider a single quantum harmonic oscillator, a building block of many quantum technologies~\cite{krantz19, arrachea}, as the WM coupled to two thermal reservoirs. One of them is statically linked, while the other one is modulated at a frequency $\Omega$. Driven system-bath couplings offer enhanced design flexibility, such as the possibility to switch between regimes of quantum heat engine or refrigerator~\cite{cavaliere_prr,cavaliere_iscience}. Here we are interested in assessing the precision of the currents in such regimes, by studying the TURs related to the heat current and the 
work current (i.e., the total exchanged power). Via a systematic perturbative approach, we obtain expressions for the thermodynamic quantities and the TURs, that can be numerically integrated with standard techniques. Even though we report no violation of TURs, i.e. we do not observe values of $Q < 2$, we show that $Q$ can attain minimal values (close to 2) both in the engine and refrigerator regimes, accompanied by sizeable efficiency. In the limit of very small damping, simple analytical expressions for the TURs are obtained, which support our findings.\\

In Sec.~\ref{sec:modther} the model is illustrated, along with the definition of all thermodynamical quantities and corresponding correlators describing their fluctuations. We then proceed to Sec.~\ref{sec:sec3} evaluating their quantum and time averaged values in the dynamical steady state, to lowest order in the strength of the dynamical coupling. Results are reported and discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:sec4}, and conclusions are drawn in Sec.~\ref{sec:conc}.
\section{Model and general setting}\label{sec:modther}
\subsection{Model}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=7.5cm,keepaspectratio]{Setup.pdf}
    \caption{{\bf Setup}. Schematic depiction of the setup under investigation. The WM -- a quantum harmonic oscillator with characteristic frequency $\omega_0$ -- is in contact with two thermal reservoirs at temperatures $T_\nu$, with $\nu =1,2$. The WM can exchange heat currents $J_\nu$ with the reservoirs and total power $P$ with an external source. The purple dashed lines represent the coupling between the WM and the thermal reservoirs. The coupling to the $\nu = 1$ reservoir is modulated in time with frequency $\Omega$, while that to the $\nu = 2$ reservoir is static.}
    \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}
We consider a minimal model for an operating heat engine in the quantum regime. A single quantum harmonic oscillator acts as the WM and is coupled to two thermal reservoirs, respectively kept at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ --see Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}. The total Hamiltonian is ($\hbar = k_B = 1$)
\begin{equation}
H^{(t)} =  H_{{\rm WM}} + \sum_{\nu=1}^{2} \left[H_\nu + H_{{\rm int}, \nu}^{(t)}\right]\,,
\label{eq:totH}
\end{equation}
where the Hamiltonian of the WM is
\begin{equation}
H_{{\rm WM}}= \frac{p^2}{2 m} + \frac{1}{2}m \omega_0^2 x^2\,,
\label{eq:Ham_qho}
\end{equation}
with $m$ and $\omega_0$ the mass and the characteristic frequency. The Hamiltonian of the $\nu=1,2$ reservoir is described in the usual Caldeira-Legget framework~\cite{weiss, CL83} in terms of an infinite set of independent harmonic oscillators as
\begin{equation}
H_{{\nu}}=  \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left[\frac{P^2_{k,\nu}}{2 m_{k,\nu}} + \frac{1}{2}m_{k,\nu} \omega^2_{k,\nu }X^2_{k,\nu}\right]\,,
\label{eq:Ham_res}
\end{equation}
and the interaction between the WM and the $\nu$--th reservoir is
\begin{equation}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!H_{{\rm int},\nu}^{(t)}\!\!=\!\!\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left[
- g_\nu(t) c_{k,\nu} x X_{k,\nu}
+\frac{g^2_\nu(t) c^2_{k,\nu}}{2 m_{k,\nu}\omega_{k,\nu}^2} x^2\right]\!, 
\label{eq:H_int_nu}
\end{equation}
where $c_{k,\nu}$ describes the interaction strength and the counter--term $\propto x^2$ prevents the renormalization of the WM potential. Following Refs.~\cite{carrega_prxquantum, cavaliere_prr, cavaliere_iscience}, we focus on a dynamical coupling situation to establish a working thermal machine in a periodic steady state regime. In particular, we assume here that the dimensionless coupling with the $\nu=1$ reservoir is modulated in time as $g_1(t)=\cos(\Omega t)$, with $\Omega$ the driving frequency, while the $\nu=2$ coupling is kept constant $g_2(t)=1$ -- see the sketch in Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}. At the initial time $t_0{\to -\infty}$, the reservoirs are assumed in their thermal equilibrium at temperatures $T_\nu$, with the total density matrix written in a factorized form as 
\begin{equation}
\rho(t_0) = \rho_{{\rm WM}}(t_0)\otimes \rho_{1}(t_0)\otimes \rho_{2}(t_0)\,,
\label{eq:initial_rho}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \rho_\nu (t_0) = \frac{e^{-H_\nu /T_\nu}}{{\rm Tr} \left\{e^{-H_\nu/T_\nu}\right\}}
\end{equation}
and with $\rho_{{\rm WM}}(t_0)$ the initial density matrix of the WM.\\

In the Heisenberg picture the equations of motion for the WM and reservoir degrees of freedom~\cite{carrega_prxquantum} are, respectively,
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x}(t)&=&\dfrac{p(t)}{m},\nonumber\\
\dot{p}(t)&=&- m \omega_0^2 x(t) +{\displaystyle \sum_{\nu=1}^{2}} {\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}} \bigg[
 g_\nu(t) c_{k,\nu} X_{k,\nu}(t)\nonumber\\
&-&\dfrac{g^2_\nu(t) c^2_{k,\nu}}{m_{k,\nu}\omega_{k,\nu}^2}x(t) \bigg],
\label{eq:EoM_DoF_sys}
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\dot{X}_{k,\nu}(t) &=&\frac{P_{k,\nu}(t)}{m_{k,\nu}},\nonumber\\
\!\!\!\!\dot{P}_{k,\nu}(t) &=&\!\!- m_{k,\nu} \omega_{k,\nu}^2 X_{k,\nu}(t) +  
g_\nu(t) c_{k,\nu} x(t),
\label{eq:EoM_DoF_res}
\end{eqnarray}\\
where overdots denote time derivatives.\\

The solution for the position operator of the $k$--th oscillator of the $\nu$--th reservoir are
\begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\!\!X_{k,\nu}(t)&=&\xi_{k,\nu}(t) +\frac{c_{k,\nu}}{m_{k,\nu}\omega_{k,\nu}}\cdot\nonumber\\
&\cdot&\int_{t_0}^t \mathrm{d}s\ g_\nu(s) x(s) \sin[\omega_{k,\nu}(t-s)]\, ,
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\xi_{k,\nu}(t)&=&X_{k,\nu} (t_0) \cos [\omega_{k,\nu}(t-t_0)]\nonumber\\
&+&\frac{P_{k,\nu}(t_0)}{m_{k,\nu} \omega_{k,\nu}}\sin[\omega_{k,\nu}(t-t_0)]\,.
\label{eq:xi_knu_def}
\end{eqnarray}
The usual fluctuating force operator is defined as
\begin{equation}
\xi_\nu(t) \equiv \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} c_{k,\nu}\xi_{k,\nu}(t),
\label{eq:xi_nu_def}
\end{equation}
with zero quantum average $\langle\xi_\nu(t)\rangle ={\rm Tr}\{\xi_\nu(t)\rho(t_0)\}=0$ and correlation function $\langle\xi_\nu(t)\xi_{\nu'}(t')\rangle \equiv {\cal L}_\nu(t-t')\delta_{\nu,\nu'}$, with
\begin{equation}
\label{corr}
{\cal L}_\nu(t-t')={\cal L}_{\nu,{\rm s}} (t-t') + {\cal L}_{\nu,{\rm a}}(t-t')\,.
\end{equation}
Here, the symmetric (s) and anti-symmetric (a) contributions with respect to the time argument are
\begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\!\!{\cal L}_{\nu,{\rm s}}(t)&\!\!=&\!\!\!\!\int_0^{+\infty}\!\!\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\pi} 
{\cal J}_\nu(\omega)\coth\left(\frac{\omega}{2T_\nu}\right)\cos(\omega t),\label{eq:ls}\\
\!\!\!\!\!\!{\cal L}_{\nu,{\rm a}}(t)&\!\!=&\!\!-i\int_0^{+\infty}\!\!\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\pi} 
{\cal J}_\nu(\omega)\sin(\omega t).\label{eq:la}
\end{eqnarray}
In the above expressions, the so-called spectral density~\cite{weiss}
\begin{equation}
\label{spectral}
{\cal J}_\nu(\omega)= \frac{\pi}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \frac{c^2_{k,\nu}}{m_{k,\nu}\omega_{k,\nu}}\delta(\omega - \omega_{k,\nu})
\end{equation}
has been introduced. It governs the properties of the $\nu$--th reservoir, e.g. its possible non--Markovian behaviour~\cite{nm1, nm2, nm3, nm4, nm5}. The precise shape of ${\cal J}_{\nu}(\omega)$ will be specified later.
\subsection{Thermodynamic quantities}\label{sec:sec22}
In this work we focus on thermodynamic quantities in the long time limit, when a periodic steady state has been reached. Therefore, all quantities of interest can be averaged over one period of the drive ${\cal T}=2\pi/\Omega$, and are therefore well-defined both for weak and strong coupling~\cite{jurgen,esposito19,liu22, brandner166}. The average heat current $J_{\nu}$ of the $\nu$--th reservoir and the total power $P$ can be written as~\cite{cavaliere_prr}
\begin{eqnarray}
P&=&\frac{1}{\cal T}\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\!\!\!\!\mathrm{d}t'\!\!\sum_{\nu=1}^{2}{\rm Tr}
\left[\frac{\partial H_{{\rm int},\nu}^{(t')}}{\partial t'}\rho(t')\right]\,,\label{eq:P}\\
J_\nu&=&-\frac{1}{\cal T}\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\!\!\!\!\mathrm{d}t'{\rm Tr}
\left[H_{\nu}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t'}\rho(t')\right]\,,\label{eq:J}
\end{eqnarray}
where here and in all the following $\bar{t}$ denotes a large positive time. It is worth noting that a positive sign in the above quantities indicates an energy flow towards the WM. Since the power contribution is associated to the temporal variation of the interaction term, it is only due to the dynamical coupling of the WM to the $\nu=1$ bath. An energy balance relation holds true,
\begin{equation}
P +J_1 +J_2 =0,
\label{balance}
\end{equation}
reflecting the first law of thermodynamics~\cite{cavaliere_prr, benenti17, paternostro}. An important quantity to assess thermodynamic performances is the time--averaged entropy production rate, related to the currents by~\cite{benenti17, paternostro, esposito19})
\begin{equation}
 \label{entropy}
\dot S=-\sum_{\nu=1}^{2}\frac{J_\nu}{T_\nu}\,,
\end{equation}
with $\dot{S}\geq 0$ in accordance to the second law of thermodynamics~\cite{paternostro}.\\

Due to dissipation, all quantities undergo fluctuations that affect the device performances.
During the whole time interval $t-t_0$, fluctuations can be characterized by auto--correlation functions~\cite{weiss, cangemi}: given an observable $O(t)$ we define 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:meanfluct}
D_{O} (t)=\frac{1}{t-t_0}\int_{t_0}^{t}\mathrm{d}s \int_{t_0}^{t}\mathrm{d}s' \langle{O (s) O (s')}\rangle,
\end{equation}
 where $t-t_0$ is a large time interval, $t-t_0\to+\infty$ and where $\langle A(t)\rangle\equiv\mathrm{Tr}\{A(t)\rho(t_0)\}$ denotes the quantum average. In this limit, the above auto--correlation function reduces to a single integral, that can be written as~\cite{cangemi}
\begin{equation}
\label{doot}
D_{O}(t)=\int_{0}^{+\infty}\mathrm{d}\tau \langle\{O (t), O (t-\tau)\}\rangle\,,
\end{equation}
with $\{A,B\}=AB+BA$ the anti--commutator, leading to the period--averaged fluctuation
\begin{equation}
D_{O}=\frac{1}{{\cal T}}\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\ \mathrm{d}s\ D_{O}(s).\label{corrav}
\end{equation}

\section{Perturbative approach}\label{sec:sec3}
\label{perturbative}
The dynamics of the driven dissipative quantum system can be solved by resorting to non-equilibrium Green function formalism~\cite{paz1, paz2, arrachea12}, as described in Ref.~\cite{carrega_prxquantum}. In this work, however, we will only focus on the case in which the modulated coupling ($\nu=1$) is much weaker than the static one ($\nu=2$). Under these circumstances, a perturbative expansion can be used to evaluate all the quantities introduced above.
To do so, it is convenient to rewrite the total Hamiltonian in Eq.~(\ref{eq:totH}) as 
\begin{equation}
H^{(t)} = H^{(0)} + \Delta H^{(t)}\,,\label{eq:totH_pert}
\end{equation}
as the sum of an unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H^{(0)}$, and $\Delta H^{(t)}$, the time--dependent interaction with the reservoir $\nu = 1$:  
\begin{equation}
H^{(0)} =  H_{{\rm WM}}  + \sum_{\nu =1}^{2} H_\nu  + H_{{\rm int},2}\,;\,\Delta H^{(t)} = H_{{\rm int}, 1}^{(t)}.\nonumber
\end{equation}
In the Heisenberg picture, the position operator of the WM can be written as
\begin{equation}
x(t)= x^{(0)}(t) + \Delta x(t),
\label{eq:x_qho_pert} 
\end{equation}
where $x^{(0)}(t) = e^{i H^{(0)}(t-t_0)} x_{\mathrm{S}} e^{-i H^{(0)}(t-t_0)}$, with the label S denoting the Schr\"{o}dinger picture, and where the perturbative correction is
\begin{equation}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\Delta x(t) = -i \int_{t_0}^{t} {\rm d}s\!\left[ g_1(s) x^{(0)}(s)  \xi_1(s), x^{(0)}(t)\right],\label{eq:delta_xl_qho}
\end{equation}
neglecting terms $O \left({\Delta H^{(t)}}^2\right)$. 
\subsection{Heat current and total power}
We start considering the average heat current $J_1$. From Eq.~(\ref{eq:J}) we have the general result~\cite{carrega_prxquantum}
\begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!J_1&=&-\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{{\cal T}}g_{1}(s)\left\langle x(s) \left[ \dot{\xi}_1(s)+\right.\right.\nonumber\\ 
&+&\left.\left.\int_{t_0}^{s} {\rm d}s'\, g_{1}(s')x(s')F_1(s-s')\right]\right\rangle\,,
\label{jj1}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have introduced
 \begin{equation}
 F_1(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\frac{c_{k,1}^2}{m_{k,1}}\cos(\omega_{k,1} t)
 \end{equation}
 with Fourier transform $F_1(\omega) = 2 \omega {\cal J}_1(\omega)$. Expanding $x(t)$ as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:x_qho_pert}) we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
J_1\!\!&=&\!\!\!-\!\!\!\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\!\!\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{{\cal T}} g_{1}(s) \bigg\{ \langle x^{(0)}(s) \dot{\xi}_1(s)\rangle + \langle\Delta x(s) \dot{\xi}_1(s)\rangle
\!\!+\nonumber\\
&+&\int_{t_0}^{s} {\rm d}s'\, g_{1}(s')\langle x^{(0)}(s) x^{(0)}(s')\rangle  F_1(s-s')\bigg\}.
\end{eqnarray}
We now perform the quantum average on the initial state of Eq.~(\ref{eq:initial_rho}), exploiting the fact that $\langle x^{(0)}(t) \dot{\xi}_1(t) \rangle = 0$ and that
\begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\langle \Delta x(t) \dot{\xi}_1(t)\rangle &=& -i  \int_{t_0}^{t} {\rm d}s \,g_1(s)\cdot\nonumber\\ 
\!\!\!\!&\cdot&\langle [x^{(0)}(s),x^{(0)}(t)]\rangle Z_1(s-t), 
\label{eq:q_avg_Delta_xl_xi}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
Z_1(t-t')\equiv\langle\xi_1(t)\dot{\xi}_1(t')\rangle=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t'}\mathcal{L}(t-t')\,,
\end{equation}
where the decomposition in symmetric and antisymmetric contributions
\begin{equation}
Z_1(t-t')=Z_{1,\mathrm{s}}(t-t')+Z_{1,\mathrm{a}}(t-t')\,,
\end{equation}
has been introduced, see Eq.~(\ref{corr}). Finally, we arrive at the expression for the heat current
\begin{eqnarray}
J_1&=& -\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{{\cal T}}\bigg\{ \int_{t_0}^{s} {\rm d}s'g_{1}(s)g_{1}(s')F_{1}(s-s')\cdot\nonumber\\
&\cdot&\langle x^{(0)}(s) x^{(0)}(s')\rangle-i\int_{t_0}^{s} {\rm d}s'\, g_{1}(s') g_{1}(s)\cdot\nonumber\\
&\cdot&Z_1(s'-s)\langle [ x^{(0)}(s') , x^{(0)}(s) ] \rangle\bigg\}.
\end{eqnarray}

To perform the average over ${\cal T}$ we observe that the correlation function 
\begin{equation}
C(t,t')=\langle x^{(0)}(t)x^{(0)}(t')\rangle\label{ctt}
\end{equation}
only depends, in the long time limit $t\gg t_0$, on the time difference $t-t'$, i.e. in the long time limit $C(t,t')=C(t-t')$.
This allows to change variable $\tau=s-s'$, to perform the limit $t_0\to -\infty$, and thus to obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
J_1&=&-\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}\!\!\!{\rm d}\tau\left\{{F_{1}(\tau)}
 \cos(\Omega \tau)C(\tau)\right.\nonumber\\ 
 \!\!\!\!&\!\!\!\!-&\!\!\!\!\left.i Z_1(-\tau)\cos(\Omega \tau)\left[C(-\tau) - C(\tau)\right]\right\}\,.~\label{eq:J1integ}
\end{eqnarray}
By direct inspection one finds that ${F_1(t)=-2i Z_{1,{\rm s}}(t)}$ and introducing the response function $\chi_0(t)\equiv i m \theta(t) \langle [ x^{(0)}(t), x^{(0)}(0)]\rangle$ (see~\cite{vignale}) with $\theta(t)$ the Heaviside step function, whose Fourier transform is
\begin{equation}
\chi_0(\omega)=-\frac{1}{\omega^2-\omega_0^2+i\omega\gamma_2(\omega)}\,,\label{eq:chi0}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_2(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\mathrm{d}t e^{i\omega t}\gamma_2(t)$ is the damping kernel of the $\nu=2$ bath in Fourier space with
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{\nu}(t) \equiv \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \frac{c_{k,{\nu}}^2}{m_{k,{\nu}}\omega_{k,{\nu}}^2}\cos(\omega_{k,{\nu}}t)\,,
\label{eq:Gamma}
\end{equation}
it is then possible to rewrite the average heat current as 
\begin{equation}
\!\!\!\!\!\!J_1 = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{4\pi m} (\omega + \Omega){\cal J}_1(\omega + \Omega) N(\omega)\chi''_{0}(\omega)\,,\label{eq:j1int}
\end{equation}
where here and in the following, the double prime denotes the imaginary part, and
\begin{equation}
N(\omega) = \coth\left(\frac{\omega + \Omega}{2T_1}\right)-\coth\left(\frac{\omega}{2T_2}\right)\,.\label{eq:ENNE}
\end{equation}

Turning to the average total power of Eq.~(\ref{eq:P}) we have the general expression~\cite{carrega_prxquantum}
\begin{eqnarray}
P&=&\int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\mathrm{d}s\bigg\{ - \dot{g}_1(s) \langle x(s) \xi_{1}(s)
\rangle+\nonumber\\
\!\!\!\!&\!\!\!\!+&\!\!\!\!\dot{g}_1(s)\left\langle x(s)\int_{t_0}^{s} {\rm d}s'\, \gamma_1(s-s') \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}s'} [ g_1(s') x(s') ]\right\rangle\bigg\}\,.
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Following the same steps of the perturbative expansion detailed above, after the quantum average we get
\begin{eqnarray}
P&=& \int_{\bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+{\cal T}}\frac{ds}{{\cal T}}\Big\{2 \int_{t_0}^{s} {\rm d}s'\,\Big[ \mathcal{L}_1(s'-s)
\dot{g}_1(s) g_1(s')\cdot\nonumber\\
&\cdot&C''(s-s')\Big]-\int_{t_0}^{s}{\rm d}s'\,\Big[  \dot{g}_1(s) g_1(s')C(s-s')\cdot\nonumber\\
&\cdot&\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}s'} \gamma_1(s-s')\Big] +\gamma_1(0)\dot{g}_1(s) g_1(s) C(0)\Big\}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Taking the average over the period of the drive, recalling Eqs.~(\ref{corr}),~(\ref{eq:ls}),~(\ref{eq:la}) and exploiting the identity $\dot{\gamma}_1(t)=-2i {\cal L}_{1,{\rm a}}(t)$ one obtains
\begin{equation}
P=-\Omega\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{4\pi m} {\cal J}_1(\omega+\Omega)N(\omega)\chi''_0(\omega).\label{eq:pint}
\end{equation}
Notice that the above results are fully consistent with those obtained using a fully non-equilibrium Green function formalism in the perturbative regime (see Appendix E of Ref.~\cite{cavaliere_prr}).
In the following we will focus only on $J_1$ and $P$, but $J_2$ can be easily obtained from the energy balance expressed by Eq.~(\ref{balance}).\\
\subsection{Correlation functions}
The auto--correlation function given in Sec.~\ref{sec:sec22} can be evaluated in the perturbative regime following steps similar to those described above. Here we briefly outline the procedure to obtain $D_{J_1}$: starting from the definition of Eq.~(\ref{doot}), to lowest order it is sufficient to consider only the zero-th order term $x^{(0)}(t)$ of the position operator $x(t)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:x_qho_pert}). Then, the fluctuations of $J_1$ can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
D_{J_1}(t)&=&\!\!\int_0^{+\infty}{\mathrm d}\tau g_{1}(t)g_1(t-\tau)\cdot\nonumber\\
\!\!&\!\!\cdot&\!\!\left\langle \{x^{(0)}(t)  \dot{\xi}_1(t),x^{(0)}(t-\tau)\dot{\xi}_1(t-\tau)\} \right\rangle\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The quantum averages in the above expression decouple in terms of the form $\langle x^{(0)}(t)x^{(0)}(t')\rangle\equiv C(t,t')$ -- see Eq.~(\ref{ctt}) -- and in terms of the form
\begin{equation}
\langle \dot{\xi}_1(t)\dot{\xi}_1(t')\rangle=\frac{{\mathrm d}}{{\mathrm d}t}\frac{{\mathrm d}}{{\mathrm d}t'}{\cal L}_1(t-t')\,.
\end{equation}
Exploiting again the time translational invariance $C(t,t')=C(t-t')$ and following steps analogous to those discussed above, the fluctuation of $J_1$ averaged over ${\cal T}$ -- see Eq.~(\ref{corrav}) -- turn out to be
\begin{equation}
\!\!\!\!\!D_{J_1}\!\!=\!\!\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!\!\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{4\pi m}\!(\omega +\Omega)^2 {\cal J}_1(\omega+\Omega) R(\omega)\chi''_{{0}}(\omega),\label{eq:d11int}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\!\!R(\omega)=\coth\left(\frac{\omega+\Omega}{2T_1}\right)\coth\left(\frac{\omega}{2T_2}\right) -1\,.\label{eq:ERRE}
\end{equation}
In complete analogy, we derive the period--averaged fluctuations of the power $P$ that read
\begin{equation}
D_{P}=\Omega^2\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{4\pi m}~ {\cal J}_1(\omega+\Omega) R(\omega) \chi''_{{0}}(\omega)\,.\label{eq:dppint}
\end{equation}
\section{Results}\label{sec:sec4}
Hereafter, we focus on the specific case of a system with a structured, Lorentzian spectral density for the dynamically coupled bath
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal J}_1(\omega)=\frac{d_1 m\gamma_1\omega}{(\omega^2-\omega_1^2)^2+\gamma_1^2\omega^2}\,,\label{eq:spden1}
\end{equation}
peaked at $\omega\approx\omega_1$, with typical broadening $\gamma_1$ and coupling strength parameterized by $d_1$. Such a spectral density, which is known to induce non--Markovian effects~\cite{cavaliere_prr,nm1,nm2,nm3,nm4,nm5}, can be either obtained in cavity--optomechanical systems~\cite{cavop1,cavop2} or in circuit-QED setups~\cite{cqed1,cqed2}, with the latter representing a particularly convenient solid--state platform which allows to tune dynamical couplings up to a high degree of precision~\cite{cqed3}. For the statically coupled contact we choose a Ohmic spectral density ${\mathcal J}_2(\omega)=m\gamma_2\omega$, which implies $\gamma_2(\omega)\equiv\gamma_2$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:chi0}).

\subsection{Average thermodynamic quantities}
The quantum-thermodynamical properties of this setup have been investigated recently~\cite{cavaliere_prr}. It has been shown that it can either operate as a quantum engine or a quantum refrigerator depending on the parameters. Here we focus on the case $\gamma_{1,2}\ll\omega_0$, favourable to obtain better performances and smaller fluctuations, and on temperatures in the quantum regime $T_{\nu}<\omega_0$. In particular, we show here the case $T_2=2 T_1$, with $T_1=0.4\omega_0$.\footnote{To be consistent with the perturbative approach, $d_1$ has been chosen small enough so that the peak value of $\mathcal{J}_1(\omega)$ satisfies $\mathcal{J}_1(\omega_1)\ll m\omega_0^2$.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=7.5cm,keepaspectratio]{Energy.pdf}
    \caption{{\bf Energy currents and operating modes}. Panels (a) and (b) show, as a density plot, the average power $P$ and heat current $J_1$ as a function of the driving frequency $\Omega$ and the resonance frequency $\omega_1$. Both quantities are here normalized to $\gamma_2^2$. The dashed line marks the resonance condition $\omega_1=\omega_0-\Omega$. In all panels $T_1=0.4\omega_0$, $T_2=0.8\omega_0$, $\gamma_1=0.05\omega_0$, $\gamma_2=0.01\omega_0$ and $d_1=10^{-3}\omega_0^4$.}
    \label{fig:enemodes}
\end{figure}
Results for the total power $P$ and for the heat current $J_1$, obtained integrating numerically Eqs.~(\ref{eq:pint}),(\ref{eq:j1int}) are shown as density plots in Figs.~\ref{fig:enemodes}(a,b) as a function of the driving frequency $\Omega$ and $\omega_1$. Depending on the sign of $J_{\nu}$ and $P$ different operating modes are identified~\cite{cavaliere_iscience}. Here we focus on the most relevant ones: heat engine with $P<0$ and $J_1<0$ and refrigerator with $P>0$ and $J_1>0$. The best performance for these operating modes occurs, for $T_1<T_2$, when $\omega_1=\omega_0-\Omega$ is satisfied~\cite{cavaliere_prr}, see the dashed line.\footnote{The situation for $T_1>T_2$ is essentially mirrored along the axis $\omega_1=\omega_0$. In this case the best engine and refrigerator operating regimes occur along the resonance condition $\omega_1=\omega_0+\Omega$~\cite{cavaliere_prr}.}\\
\subsection{Thermodynamic uncertainty relations}
It is now interesting to assess the impact of fluctuations on the performance of this setup. To this end, we use TURs~\cite{barato,cangemi, horowitz17, brandner18, agarwalla}. We are particularly interested in the engine and refrigerator regimes and thus in the TURs for $P$ and $J_1$, expressed in terms of the 
trade-off parameter $Q_P$ and $Q_{J_1}$ as~\cite{cangemi, brandner18, agarwalla}
\begin{equation}
Q_P=\dot{S}\frac{D_{P}}{P^2}\ge 2\ ;\ Q_{J_1}=\dot{S}\frac{D_{J_1}}{J_1^2}\ge 2\,.
\end{equation}
These TURs combine energy flows, their fluctuations, and the entropy production rate in a dimensionless quantity expressing the trade-off between how the system fluctuates with respect to the quality (in terms of magnitude and degree of dissipation) of the energy flow. The lower $Q_{\mu}$ (with $\mu\in\{J_1,P\}$), the better the operation of the thermal machine~\cite{pietzonka18}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=7.5cm,keepaspectratio]{TURs.pdf}
    \caption{{\bf Quantifying fluctuations via TURs}. Density plot of $Q_P$ (panel a) and $Q_1$ (panel b) as a function of $\Omega$ and $\omega_1$. Parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:enemodes}.}
    \label{fig:denstur}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:denstur} shows density plots of the numerically evaluated $Q_P$ (a) and $Q_{J_1}$ (b) as a function of $\Omega$ and $\omega_1$ and it is clear that $Q_{\mu}>2$ everywhere. Via extensive numerical investigations we can report that regardless of all parameter configurations, $Q_{\mu}<2$ is never found in this model, and thus no violation of TUR bounds~\cite{barato,cangemi,brandner18} occurs. The trade-off parameters can attain very large values, see the white regions in the plots, and even diverge -- e.g. at the crossover between the engine and the refrigerator regimes along $\omega_1=\omega_0-\Omega$ (due to $J_1$, $P$ crossing zero). Interestingly, however, they are instead particularly low (even approaching $Q_{\mu}\approx 2$) around the latter resonance line, where the best performances occur. Let us then relate $Q_{\mu}$ to the efficiency $\eta=-P/J_2$ (engine mode) or to the coefficient of performance $\mathrm{COP}=J_1/P$ (refrigerator mode), normalized to the respective Carnot limits $\eta_C=1-\frac{T_1}{T_2}$ and $\mathrm{COP}_C=\frac{T_1}{T_2-T_1}$. \footnote{For the parameters chosen here, $\eta_C=0.5$ and COP$_C$=1.}
 \begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=7.5cm,keepaspectratio]{Figura_Eta_Q_2.pdf}
    \caption{{\bf Efficiency vs. fluctuations}. Panel (a) shows as a red curve the efficiency, normalized to the Carnot limit, of the thermal machine operating as an engine, and $Q_P$ as a green line, as a function of $\Omega$ along the resonance line $\omega_1=\omega_0-\Omega$ -- see Fig.~\ref{fig:enemodes}. Panel (b) shows the same quantities along the same resonance, but in the regime where the machine operates as a refrigerator. Parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:enemodes}.}
    \label{fig:tagli}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:tagli}(a) shows $\eta/\eta_C$ (red line) and $Q_P$ (green line) as a function of $\Omega$ within the engine region along the dashed line of Fig.~\ref{fig:enemodes}. As is clear, there is a large range of driving frequencies where $Q_P$ is very close to 2. Furthermore, when it attains its minimum value, for $\Omega\approx0.35\omega_0$, the efficiency of the engine is $\approx0.7\eta_C$. On the other hand, when the engine operates at its maximum efficiency of $\eta\approx0.95\eta_C$, $Q_P$ almost doubles. Notice also that $Q_P$ diverges at the boundaries of the engine regime and that the maximum of $\eta$ is located in close proximity of one of these edges. The situation in the refrigerator regime is qualitatively similar, and is reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:tagli}(b).\\

To gain further insight, we can exploit the fact that in the limit $\gamma_2\to 0$ one can approximate~\cite{cavaliere_prr} $\chi''_0(\omega)\approx\frac{\pi}{2\omega_0}\sum_{p=\pm 1}p\delta(\omega-p\omega_0)$, with $\delta(\omega)$ the Dirac delta. The integrals in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:j1int}),(\ref{eq:pint}),(\ref{eq:d11int}),(\ref{eq:dppint}) are then easily solved, leading to
\begin{eqnarray}
J_1&=&\frac{1}{8m\omega_0}\sum_{p=\pm 1}(\omega_0+p\Omega)\mathcal{J}_1(\omega_0+p\Omega)N_p,\nonumber\\
P&=&-\frac{\Omega}{8m\omega_0}\sum_{p=\pm 1}p\mathcal{J}_1(\omega_0+p\Omega)N_p,\nonumber\\
D_{J_1}&=&\frac{1}{8m\omega_0}\sum_{p=\pm 1}(\omega_0+p\Omega)^2\mathcal{J}_1(\omega_0+p\Omega)R_p,\nonumber\\
D_{P}&=&\frac{\Omega^2}{8m\omega_0}\sum_{p=\pm 1}\mathcal{J}_1(\omega_0+p\Omega)R_p\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $N_p=N(p\omega_0)$ and $R_p=R(p\omega_0)$ -- see Eqs.~(\ref{eq:ENNE}),(\ref{eq:ERRE}). In the regime $\gamma_1\ll\omega_0$ considered in this paper, restricting along the resonance line $\omega_1=\omega_0-\Omega$ one can safely drop all terms with $p=+1$ in the above expressions~\cite{cavaliere_prr}. Then, after simple rearrangements one can see that in this limit $Q_P\equiv Q_{J_{1}}$, with
\begin{equation}
Q_{\mu}\!=\!2\left(\frac{\omega_0}{2T_2}-\frac{\omega_0-\Omega}{2T_1}\right)\coth\left(\frac{\omega_0}{2T_2}-\frac{\omega_0-\Omega}{2T_1}\right).\nonumber
\end{equation}
This proves that, at least in the above limits, the TURs are never violated and $Q_{\mu}\geq 2$ in agreement with our numerical findings. Indeed, in this limit $Q_{\mu}=2$ precisely when $\Omega=\Omega^{*}=\omega_0\eta_C$, which is the ``turning point'' between the operation as an engine and that as a refrigerator along the resonance~\cite{cavaliere_prr}. There, at $\Omega = \Omega^{*}$, we have  $\eta\to\eta_C$ (with $P\to0$) and COP$\to$COP$_C$ (with $J_1\to0$). The net coalescence of engine and refrigerator modes is lifted at finite values of $\gamma_{\nu}$, which results in $\eta<\eta_C$ (COP$<$COP$_C$), with the maximum for $\eta$ (COP) occurring at $\Omega\lesssim\Omega^{*}$ ($\Omega\gtrsim\Omega^{*}$). Also, when $\gamma_{\nu}$ is small but non zero the trade-off parameters are no longer identical, and develop the divergence near $\Omega^{*}$ seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:tagli}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
In this paper we have analyzed the fluctuations of the heat current and power exchanged between a quantum thermal machine with a single quantum harmonic oscillator as the WM and two thermal baths at uneven temperature, in the presence of a dynamical coupling between the WM and one of the baths. Such a machine can operate either as a quantum heat engine or as refrigerator depending on the frequency of the drive and the other parameters. To understand the impact of fluctuations on such operating modes we have developed expressions for the fluctuations to leading order in the amplitude of the dynamical coupling. Such expressions allow us to numerically evaluate the trade-off parameters $Q_P$ and $Q_{J_1}$ associated to total power (in the engine case) or heat current from the cold bath (in the refrigerator case), whose magnitude is associated to the strength and impact of fluctuations. We report no violation of the lower bound proposed for these quantities in the literature. However, we have found that in typical operating regimes the trade-off parameters can reach values very close to the lower bound, with an efficiency of about 70\% of the Carnot limit in the case of a quantum engine. In the limit of weak damping, appropriate for the regime of parameters considered in this paper, we have also developed an analytical approximation for the trade-off parameters, which supports our findings and shows that TUR bounds cannot be violated in our model, at least for weak damping.\\

Despite no violation of TURs has been found, showing that the trade-off parameters can attain small values in sensible operating regimes is a first step towards the development of optimal protocols for the operation of quantum thermodynamic machines. Future developments of this work may lead to consider more complex driving protocols for the thermal machine, which could help to even increase the efficiency at the lowest values of the trade-off parameters. Also, it will be interesting to look for more complex quantum thermal machines, either in multi--terminal or multi--WM configurations. Due to their ability to perform multiple thermodynamical tasks at once~\cite{cavaliere_iscience}, assessing the impact of fluctuations can be a key issue towards their optimization.

First and foremost I thank my supervisor Kai Cieliebak for his guidance, helpful feedback, and insightful discussions. Moreover, I thank Lei Zhao who convinced me to write this paper and the remaining members of the symplectic group in Augsburg, in particular Urs Frauenfelder, for their input and company. Lastly, I thank my family and friends who supported me throughout my academic career, in particular Christian P.M. Schneider, Alexander Segner, and Florian Stuhlmann.

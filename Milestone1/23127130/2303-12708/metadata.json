    "abstract": "The dust ball collapse is studied in the context of the \"rainbow metric\" approach (where the matter content is supplemented with a scalar field perturbation) to the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario within the framework of loop quantum cosmology. The global spacetime structure is determined for this scenario and subsequently used to evaluate the entanglement entropy via a slight adaptation of existing formulas. The resulting model is shown to qualitatively resemble the Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime, in particular, it still contains singularities, which allows us to define the entropy only for portions of the null infinity. The consequence of these results for the black hole information loss paradox is discussed. Furthermore, the results in presence of the scalar field are used in discussion regarding the viability of the selected scenario, in particular, the assumption of stationarity used to determine the exterior metric.",

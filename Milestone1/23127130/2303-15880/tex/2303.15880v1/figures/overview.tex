    \caption{From an input image $I_{1}^{*}$, we infer the 3D joint locations $P_{1}$ and estimate appearance vectors $a_{1}$ for each limb (here, represented using an RGB palette). We transfer the pose from the input view to the novel view and render the primitives along with their appearances onto the high-dimensional latent image $J_{2}$. From the latent image, we synthesize the output image $I_{2}$, which should match the target image $I_{2}^{*}$.}

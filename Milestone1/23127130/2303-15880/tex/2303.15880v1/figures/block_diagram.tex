    \caption{Architecture of the model. Pose is first localized in the 2D space, then regressed in 3D. Simultaneously appearance vectors are inferred from the input image. Primitives, naturally deducted from the pose, are rendered in the novel viewpoint using the camera intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients. We synthesize the output image using a high-dimensional feature image alongside with the appearance vectors.}

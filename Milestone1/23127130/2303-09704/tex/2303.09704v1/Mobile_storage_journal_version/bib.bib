Recently, "geographical load balancing" has been suggested to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions. However, this reduction of cost can paradoxically increase total energy use.This paper explores whether the geographical diversity of Internet-scale systems can additionally be used to provide environmental gains. Specifically, we explore whether geographical load balancing can encourage use of "green" renewable energy and reduce use of "brown" fossil fuel energy. We make two contributions. First, we derive two distributed algorithms for achieving optimal geographical load balancing. Second, we show that if electricity is dynamically priced in proportion to the instantaneous fraction of the total energy that is brown, then geographical load balancing provides significant reductions in brown energy use. However, the benefits depend strongly on the degree to which systems accept dynamic energy pricing and the form of pricing used.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the ACM SIGMETRICS Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems}, pages = {233–244}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {load balancing, energy consumption, demand response, data centers}, location = {San Jose, California, USA}, series = {SIGMETRICS '11} }

 abstract = {We examine the performance attributes of a merchant transmission investment framework that relies on 'market driven' investment to increase transmission network capacity needed to support competitive wholesale markets for electricity. Under a stringent set of assumptions, the merchant investment model has a remarkable set of attributes that appears to solve the natural monopoly problem and the associated need for regulating electric transmission companies. We expand the merchant model to incorporate several attributes of wholesale power markets and transmission networks that the merchant model ignores. These include market power in wholesale electricity markets, lumpiness in transmission investment opportunities, stochastic attributes of transmission networks and associated property rights definition issues, strategic behavior by potential merchant transmission investors and issues related to the coordination of transmission system operators and merchant transmission owners. Incorporating these more realistic attributes of transmission networks and the behavior of transmission owners and system operators leads to the conclusion that several potentially significant inefficiencies may result from reliance on the merchant transmission investment framework. Accordingly, it is inappropriate for policymakers to assume that they can avoid dealing with the many challenges associated with stimulating efficient levels of investment in electric transmission networks by adopting the merchant model.},

	Abstract = {The high variability of renewable energy is a major obstacle toward its increased penetration. Energy storage can help reduce the power imbalance due to the mismatch between the available renewable power and the load. How much can storage reduce this power imbalance? How much storage is needed to achieve this reduction? This paper presents a simple analytic model that leads to some answers to these questions. Considering the multitimescale grid operation, we formulate the power imbalance problem for each timescale as an infinite horizon stochastic control problem and show that a greedy policy minimizes the average magnitude of the residual power imbalance. Observing from the wind power data that in shorter timescales the power imbalance can be modeled as an iid zero-mean Laplace distributed process, we obtain closed form expressions for the minimum cost and the stationary distribution of the stored power. We show that most of the reduction in the power imbalance can be achieved with relatively small storage capacity. In longer timescales, the correlation in the power imbalance cannot be ignored. As such, we relax the iid assumption to a weakly dependent stationary process and quantify the limit on the minimum cost for arbitrarily large storage capacity.},

	Abstract = {Integrating energy storage into the grid in scenarios with high penetration of renewable resources remains a significant challenge. Recently, Risk Limiting Dispatch (RLD) was proposed as a mechanism that utilizes information and market recourse to reduce reserve capacity requirements, emissions and other system operator objectives. Among other benefits, it included a set of simplified rules that can be readily utilized in existing system operator dispatch systems to provide reliable and computationally efficient decisions. RLD implements stochastic loss of load control to absorb the increased uncertainty in the grid. Storage is emerging as an alternative to mitigate the uncertainty in the grid. This paper extends the RLD framework to incorporate intrahour storage. It develops a closed form scheduling rule for optimal stochastic dispatch that incorporates a sequence of markets and real-time information. Simple approximations to the optimal rule that can be easily implemented in existing dispatch systems are proposed and evaluated. The approximation relies on continuous-time approximations of solutions for a discrete time optimal control problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed procedures.},

	Abstract = {Energy storage can alleviate the problems that the uncertainty and variability associated with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar create in power systems. Besides applications such as frequency control, temporal arbitrage or the provision of reserve, where the location of storage is not particularly relevant, distributed storage could also be used to alleviate congestion in the transmission network. In such cases, the siting and sizing of this distributed storage is of crucial importance to its cost-effectiveness. This paper describes a three-stage planning procedure to identify the optimal locations and parameters of distributed storage units. In the first stage, the optimal storage locations and parameters are determined for each day of the year individually. In the second stage, a number of storage units is available at the locations that were identified as being optimal in the first stage, and their optimal energy and power ratings are determined. Finally, in the third stage, with both the locations and ratings fixed, the optimal operation of the storage units is simulated to quantify the benefits that they would provide by reducing congestion. The quality of the final solution is assessed by comparing it with the solution obtained at the first stage without constraints on storage sites or size. The approach is numerically tested on the IEEE RTS 96.},

	Abstract = {Increased penetration of renewable energy sources poses new challenges to the power grid. Grid integrated energy storage combined with fast-ramping conventional generation can help to address challenges associated with power output variability. This paper proposes a risk mitigating optimal power flow (OPF) framework to study the dispatch and placement of energy storage units in a power system with wind generators that are supplemented by fast-ramping conventional back-up generators. This OPF with storage charge/discharge dynamics is solved as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. Chance constraints are used to implement the risk mitigation strategy. The model is applied to case studies based on the IEEE 14 bus benchmark system. First, we study the scheduling of spinning reserves and storage when generation and loads are subject to uncertainties. The framework is then extended to investigate the optimal placement of storage across different network topologies. The results of the case studies quantify the need for storage and reserves as well as suggest a strategy for their scheduling and placement.},

	Abstract = {As the penetration level of transmission-scale time-intermittent renewable generation resources increases, control of flexible resources will become important to mitigating the fluctuations due to these new renewable resources. Flexible resources may include new or existing synchronous generators as well as new energy storage devices. Optimal placement and sizing of energy storage to minimize costs of integrating renewable resources is a difficult optimization problem. Further,optimal planning procedures typically do not consider the effect of the time dependence of operations and may lead to unsatisfactory results. Here, we use an optimal energy storage control algorithm to develop a heuristic procedure for energy storage placement and sizing. We perform operational simulation under various time profiles of intermittent generation, loads and interchanges (artificially generated or from historical data) and accumulate statistics of the usage of storage at each node under the optimal dispatch. We develop a greedy heuristic based on the accumulated statistics to obtain a minimal set of nodes for storage placement. The quality of the heuristic is explored by comparing our results to the obvious heuristic of placing storage at the renewables for IEEE benchmarks and real-world network topologies.},

Our main result proves that when the generation costs are convex and nondecreasing, there always exists an optimal storage capacity allocation that places zero storage at generation-only buses that connect to the rest of the network via single links. This holds regardless of the demand profiles, generation capacities, line-flow limits and characteristics of the storage technologies. Through a counterexample, we illustrate that this result is not generally true for generation buses with multiple connections.

	Abstract = {The problem of short-term forecast of real-time locational marginal price (LMP) and network congestion is considered from a system operator perspective. A new probabilistic forecast technique is proposed based on a multiparametric programming formulation that partitions the uncertainty parameter space into critical regions from which the conditional probability distribution of the real-time LMP/congestion is obtained. The proposed method incorporates load/generation forecast, time varying operation constraints, and probabilistic contingency models. By shifting the computation cost associated with multiparametric program offline, the online computation cost is significantly reduced.},

	Abstract = {For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

	Abstract = {Given a stochastic net demand process evolving over a transmission-constrained power network, we consider the system operator's problem of minimizing the expected cost of generator dispatch, when it has access to spatially distributed energy storage resources. We show that the expected benefit of storage derived under the optimal dispatch policy is concave and non-decreasing in the vector of energy storage capacities. Thus, the greatest marginal value of storage is derived at small installed capacities. For such capacities, we provide an upper bound on the locational (nodal) marginal value of storage in terms of the variation of the shadow prices of electricity at each node. In addition, we prove that this upper bound is tight, when the cost of generation is spatially uniform and the network topology is acyclic. These formulae not only shed light on the correct measure of statistical variation in quantifying the value of storage, but also provide computationally tractable tools to empirically calculate the locational marginal value of storage from net demand time series data.},

@article{Taylor2015,
	Abstract = {Should energy storage buy and sell power at wholesale prices like utilities and generators, or should its physical and financial operation be asynchronyous as with transmission lines? In the first case, storage straightforwardly profits through intertemporal arbitrage, also known as load shifting and peak shaving. In this paper, the latter case, referred to as passive storage, is examined. Because passive storage does not make nodal price transactions, new mechanisms are necessary for its integration into electricity markets. This issue is addressed by further developing the analogy between energy storage and transmission. Specifically, financial rights are defined for storage, and tracing is extended to multiperiod power flows linked by storage. Like flowgate transmission rights, the new financial storage rights redistribute the system operator's merchandising surplus and enable risk-averse market participants to hedge against nodal price volatility resulting from storage congestion. Simple examples are given demonstrating the implementation of the new mechanisms. Game-theoretic analysis suggests that financial storage rights mitigate gaming when both the generator and load bid strategically.},

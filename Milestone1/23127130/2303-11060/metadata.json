    "abstract": "We study news neural networks to approximate function of distributions in a probability space. Two classes of neural networks based on quantile and moment approximation are proposed to learn these functions and are theoretically supported by universal approximation theorems. By mixing the quantile and moment features in other new networks, we develop schemes that outperform existing networks on numerical test cases involving univariate distributions. For bivariate distributions, the moment neural network outperforms all other networks.",

This paper presents an overview of the integration of deep machine learning (DL) in FPGA CAD design flow, focusing on high-level and logic synthesis, placement, and routing. Our analysis identifies key research areas that require more attention in FPGA CAD design, including the development of open-source benchmarks optimized for end-to-end machine learning experiences and the potential of knowledge-sharing among researchers and industry practitioners to incorporate more intelligence in FPGA CAD decision-making steps. By providing insights into the integration of deep machine learning in FPGA CAD flow, this paper aims to inform future research directions in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

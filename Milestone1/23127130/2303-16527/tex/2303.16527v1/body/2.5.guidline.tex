\paragraph{Paper Organization}
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In \cref{sec:background}, we first introduce the deep functional map pipeline and our key definitions. We then state a theorem that shows that features learned in the deep functional map pipeline have a geometric interpretation under certain conditions. In light of this discovery, we introduce in \cref{sec:method} two modifications to the functional map pipeline, by promoting structural properties suggested by our analysis. Finally, in \cref{sec:application}, we will show how these modifications improve overall performance in different shape matching scenarios.

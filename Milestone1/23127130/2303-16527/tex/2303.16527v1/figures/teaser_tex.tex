    \caption{\textit{Left:} Features learned in existing deep functional map pipelines are used in a purely \textit{algebraic manner} as constraints for a linear system, thus lacking interpretability and clear geometric content. \textit{Right:} We propose a theoretically-justified modification to this pipeline, which leads to learning \textit{robust} and \textit{repeatable} features that enable matching via nearest neighbor search.}

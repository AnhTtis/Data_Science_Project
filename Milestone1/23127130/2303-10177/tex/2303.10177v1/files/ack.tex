\begin{center}
I owe a debt to my parents, Lucia and Bob. \\
I should like to thank my bruvver, Giulio, for his \textgreek{φιλάδελφος} impetus of generosity. \\
I am grateful also to my sis: Chiara had a hand in it, too. \\ 
There are, then, my consobrinus, Gabri, \& my senior confidantes, Filly, Laura, and Miranda, \\ 
who have shown themselves in full empathy with my woes. \\
The thoughtfulness of \ZhTraditional{埃琳娜} was revealed to be a sanative balsam. \\
All of them have sought to lend me their tootsies to carry on, \\ 
being my feet unusable. \\

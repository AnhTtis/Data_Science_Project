    "abstract": "A Dirac metal is a doped (gated) Dirac material with the Fermi energy ($E_\\text{F}$) lying either in the conduction or valence bands. In the non-interacting picture, optical absorption in gapless Dirac metals occurs only if the frequency of incident photons ($Ω$) exceeds the direct (Pauli) frequency threshold, equal to $2E_\\text{F}$. In this work, we study, both analytically and numerically, the role of electron-electron ($ee$) and electron-hole ($eh$) interactions in optical absorption of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Dirac metals in the entire interval of frequencies below $2E_\\text{F}$. We show that, for $Ω\\ll E_\\text{F}$, the optical conductivity, $\\Reσ(Ω)$, arising from the combination of $ee$ and certain $eh$ scattering processes, scales as $Ω^2\\lnΩ$ in 2D and as $Ω^2$ in 3D, respectively, both for short-range (Hubbard) and long-range (screened Coulomb) interactions. Another type of $eh$ processes, similar to Auger-Meitner (AM) processes in atomic physics, starts to contribute for $Ω$ above the direct threshold, equal to $E_\\text{F}$. Similar to the case of doped semiconductors with parabolic bands studied in prior literature, the AM contribution to $\\Reσ(Ω)$ in Dirac metals is manifested by a threshold singularity, $\\Reσ(Ω)\\propto (Ω-E_\\text{F})^{d+2}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality and $0<Ω-E_\\text{F}\\ll E_\\text{F}$. In contrast to doped semiconductors, however, the AM contribution in Dirac metals is completely overshadowed by the $ee$ and other $eh$ contributions. Numerically, $\\Reσ(Ω)$ happens to be small in almost the entire range of $Ω<2E_\\text{F}$. This finding may have important consequences for collective modes in Dirac metals lying below $2E_\\text{F}$.",

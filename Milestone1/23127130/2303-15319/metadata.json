    "abstract": "More than a thousand 8\" silicon sensors will be visually inspected to look for anomalies on their surface during the quality control preceding assembly into the High-Granularity Calorimeter for the CMS experiment at CERN. A deep learning-based algorithm that pre-selects potentially anomalous images of the sensor surface in real time has been developed to automate the visual inspection. The anomaly detection is done by an ensemble of independent deep convolutional neural networks: an autoencoder and a classifier. The performance is evaluated on images acquired in production. The pre-selection reduces the number of images requiring human inspection by 85%, with recall of 97%. Data gathered in production can be used for continuous learning to improve the accuracy incrementally.",

MMMF can be formulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) and learned using standard SDP solvers. However, current SDP solvers can only handle MMMF problems on matrices of dimensionality up to a few hundred. Here, we investigate a direct gradient-based optimization method for MMMF and demonstrate it on large collaborative prediction problems. We compare against results obtained by Marlin (2004) and find that MMMF substantially outperforms all nine methods he tested.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Machine Learning}, pages = {713–719}, numpages = {7}, location = {Bonn, Germany}, series = {ICML '05} }

We use SDP duality and interior-point algorithm theories to prove that the SDP localizes any network or graph that has unique sensor positions to fit given distance measures. Therefore, we show, for the first time, that these networks can be localized in polynomial time. We also give a simple and efficient criterion for checking whether a given instance of the localization problem has a unique realization in R2 using graph rigidity theory. Finally, we introduce a notion called strong localizability and show that the SDP model will identify all strongly localizable subnetworks in the input network.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms}, pages = {405–414}, numpages = {10}, location = {Vancouver, British Columbia}, series = {SODA '05} }

 abstract = {The paper deals with the estimation of a high dimensional covariance with a conditional sparsity structure and fast diverging eigenvalues. By assuming a sparse error covariance matrix in an approximate factor model, we allow for the presence of some cross-sectional correlation even after taking out common but unobservable factors. We introduce the principal orthogonal complement thresholding method 'POET' to explore such an approximate factor structure with sparsity. The POET-estimator includes the sample covariance matrix, the factor-based covariance matrix, the thresholding estimator and the adaptive thresholding estimator as specific examples. We provide mathematical insights when the factor analysis is approximately the same as the principal component analysis for high dimensional data. The rates of convergence of the sparse residual covariance matrix and the conditional sparse covariance matrix are studied under various norms. It is shown that the effect of estimating the unknown factors vanishes as the dimensionality increases. The uniform rates of convergence for the unobserved factors and their factor loadings are derived. The asymptotic results are also verified by extensive simulation studies. Finally, a real data application on portfolio allocation is presented.},

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of computation time for trajectory generation in quadrotors. Most trajectory generation methods for waypoint navigation of quadrotors, for example minimum snap/jerk and minimum-time, are structured as bi-level optimizations. The first level involves allocating time across all input waypoints and the second step is to minimize the snap/jerk of the trajectory under that time allocation. Such an optimization can be computationally expensive to solve. In our approach we treat trajectory generation as a supervised learning problem between a sequential set of inputs and outputs. We adapt a transformer model to learn the optimal time allocations for a given set of input waypoints, thus making it into a single step optimization. We demonstrate the performance of the transformer model by training it to predict the time allocations for a minimum snap trajectory generator. The trained transformer model is able to predict accurate time allocations with fewer data samples and smaller model size, compared to a feedforward network (FFN), demonstrating that it is able to model the sequential nature of the waypoint navigation problem.",

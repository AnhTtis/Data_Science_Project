    "abstract": "The phenomenon of the almost linear growth of the square root of spatial string tension $\\sqrt{σ_s(T)}= c_σ g^2 T$ was found both in lattice and in theory, based on the Field Correlator Method (FCM). In the latter the string tension (both spatial and colorelectric) is expressed as an integral of the two gluon Green's function calculated with the same string tension: $σ= \\int G^{(2g)}_σ$. This relation allows to check the selfconsistency of the theory. However at nonzero temperature $T$ in the two-gluon Green's function in the space-like region appear terms which create in $σ_s$ quadratic in T behavior. We calculate below in the paper the $σ_s$ numerically in the whole temperature region $T_c< T < 5 T_c$ using the FCM method and compare the results with lattice data finding a good agreement. This justifies the use of the FCM in the space-like region and in high T thermodynamics without extra parameters.",

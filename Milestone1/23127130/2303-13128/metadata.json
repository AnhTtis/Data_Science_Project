    "abstract": "We investigate production of $J/ψ$ mesons in hadron-hadron collisions, defined as low invariant mass $c\\bar{c}$ singlets produced in a mixture of perturbative and nonperturbative mechanisms provided by the PYTHIA Monte Carlo. We find that in this model the color reconnection mechanism, which breaks the factorization, is essential to reasonably describe the experimental data.",

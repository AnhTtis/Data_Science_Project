  abstract  = "In an open, constantly changing and collaborative environment
               like the forthcoming Semantic Web, it is reasonable to expect
               that knowledge sources will contain noise and inaccuracies.
               Practical reasoning techniques for ontologies therefore will
               have to be tolerant to this kind of data, including the ability
               to handle inconsistencies in a meaningful way. For this purpose,
               we employ paraconsistent reasoning based on four-valued logic,
               which is a classical method for dealing with inconsistencies in
               knowledge bases. Its transfer to OWL DL, however, necessitates
               the making of fundamental design choices in dealing with class
               inclusion, which has resulted in differing proposals for
               paraconsistent description logics in the literature. In this
               paper, we build on one of the more general approaches which due
               to its flexibility appears to be most promising for further
               investigations. We present two algorithms suitable for
               implementation, one based on a preprocessing before invoking a
               classical OWL reasoner, the other based on a modification of the
               KAON2 transformation algorithms. We also report on our
               implementation, called ParOWL.",

First-order FDE is also briefly revisited, and we conclude by listing some open problems for future research.},

We propose a finer analysis of how belief can be based on information, where the confirmation comes from multiple possibly conflicting sources and is of a probabilistic nature. We use Belnap-Dunn logic and its probabilistic extensions to account for potentially contradictory information on which belief is grounded. We combine it with an extension of {\L}ukasiewicz logic, or a bilattice logic, within a two-layer modal logical framework to account for belief.},

Perhaps “complementary” would be an altogether more fitting qualification for the present text. It is not required to have read “Basic Many-Valued Logic” in order to use my chapter. It is (I hope) not more difficult to read, either. On the other hand, you will find few overlaps and for sure some quite different points of view. Urquhart's chapter, for example, covers functional completeness, model theory, or theory of consequence relations very well, and I do not repeat this material.},

Thus far, a similar characterization has not been found for RLs on the set of intervals of [0,1], or more generally, of a bounded lattice L. In this paper, we show that the open problem can be solved if it is restricted, making only a few simple and intuitive assumptions, to the class of interval-valued residuated lattices (IVRLs). More specifically, we derive a full characterization of product and implication in IVRLs in terms of their counterparts on the base RL. To this aim, we use triangle algebras, a recently introduced variety of RLs that serves as an equational representation of IVRLs.},

We show that these algebras serve as an equational representation of interval-valued residuated lattices (IVRLs). Furthermore, we present triangle logic (TL), a system of many-valued logic capturing the tautologies of IVRLs. Triangle algebras are used to cast the essence of using closed intervals of L as truth values into a set of appropriate logical axioms. Our results constitute a crucial first step towards solving an important research challenge: the axiomatic formalization of residuated t-norm based logics on LI, the lattice of closed intervals of [0,1], in a similar way as was done for formal fuzzy logics on the unit interval.},

  abstract = {The context for this paper is a class of distributive lattice expansions, called double quasioperator algebras (DQAs). The distinctive feature of these algebras is that their operations preserve or reverse both join and meet in each coordinate. Algebras of this type provide algebraic semantics for certain non-classical propositional logics. In particular, MV-algebras, which model the Łukasiewicz infinite-valued logic, are DQAs. Varieties of DQAs are here studied through their canonical extensions. A variety of this type having additional operations of arity at least 2 may fail to be canonical; it is already known, for example, that the variety of MV-algebras is not. Non-canonicity occurs when basic operations have two distinct canonical extensions and both are necessary to capture the structure of the original algebra. This obstruction to canonicity is different in nature from that customarily found in other settings. A generalized notion of canonicity is introduced which is shown to circumvent the problem. In addition, generalized canonicity allows one to capture on the canonical extensions of DQAs the algebraic operations in such a way that the laws that these obey may be translated into first-order conditions on suitable frames. This correspondence may be seen as the algebraic component of duality, in a way which is made precise. In many cases of interest, binary residuated operations are present. An operation h which, coordinatewise, preserves ∨ and 0 lifts to an operation which is residuated, even when h is not. If h also preserves binary meet then the upper adjoints behave in a functional way on the frames.},

	Abstract = {In the present article, we introduce a multi-type display calculus for dynamic epistemic logic, which we refer to as Dynamic Calculus. The display approach is suitable to modularly chart the space of dynamic epistemic logics on weaker-than-classical propositional base. The presence of types endows the language of the Dynamic Calculus with additional expressivity, allows for a smooth proof-theoretic treatment, and paves the way towards a general methodology for the design of proof systems for the generality of dynamic logics, and certainly beyond dynamic epistemic logic. We prove that the Dynamic Calculus adequately captures Baltag--Moss--Solecki's dynamic epistemic logic, and enjoys Belnap-style cut elimination.},

  abstract  = "Ontologies have succeeded as a knowledge representation
               formalism in many domains of application. Nevertheless, they are
               not suitable to represent vague or imprecise information. To
               overcome this limitation, several extensions to classical
               ontologies based on fuzzy logic have been proposed. Even though
               different fuzzy logics lead to fuzzy ontologies with very
               different logical properties, the combined use of different
               fuzzy logics has received little attention to date. This paper
               proposes a fuzzy extension of the Description Logic [Formula:
               see text] --- the logic behind the ontology language OWL 2 ---
               that joins G{\"o}del and Zadeh fuzzy logics. We analyze the
               properties of the new fuzzy Description Logic in order to
               provide guidelines to ontology developers to exploit the best
               features of each fuzzy logic. The proposal also considers
               degrees of truth belonging to a finite set of linguistic terms
               rather than numerical values, thus being closer to real experts'
               reasonings. We prove the decidability of the combined logic by
               presenting a reasoning preserving procedure to obtain a crisp
               representation for it. This result is generalized to offer a
               similar reduction that can be applied when any other finite t
               -norms, t -conorms, negations or implications are considered in
               the logic.",

Each hybrid inductive formula is shown to have an effectively calculable first-order local frame correspondent. We define two subclasses, called the nominally skeletal and skeletal hybrid inductive formulas. We show that members of these subclasses are, respectively, preserved under canonical extensions and Dedekind--MacNeille completions of certain hybrid algebras, which is enough to ensure that these formulas axiomatize relationally complete logics. The key methodological tool in proving these results is a hybrid version of the ALBA algorithm, which we formulate and call hybrid-ALBA.},

	Abstract = {We extend unified correspondence theory to Kripke frames with impossible worlds and their associated regular modal logics. These are logics the modal connectives of which are not required to be normal: only the weaker properties of additivity $\Diamond x\vee \Diamond y = \Diamond (x\vee y)$ and multiplicativity $\Box x\wedge \Box y = \Box (x\wedge y)$ are required. Conceptually, it has been argued that their lacking necessitation makes regular modal logics better suited than normal modal logics at the formalization of epistemic and deontic settings. From a technical viewpoint, regularity proves to be very natural and adequate for the treatment of algebraic canonicity J{\'o}nsson-style. Indeed, additivity and multiplicativity turn out to be key to extend J{\'o}nsson's original proof of canonicity to the full Sahlqvist class of certain regular distributive modal logics naturally generalizing distributive modal logic. Most interestingly, additivity and multiplicativity are key to J{\'o}nsson-style canonicity also in the original (i.e. normal DML. Our contributions include: the definition of Sahlqvist inequalities for regular modal logics on a distributive lattice propositional base; the proof of their canonicity following J{\'o}nsson's strategy; the adaptation of the algorithm ALBA to the setting of regular modal logics on two non-classical (distributive lattice and intuitionistic) bases; the proof that the adapted ALBA is guaranteed to succeed on a syntactically defined class which properly includes the Sahlqvist one; finally, the application of the previous results so as to obtain proofs, alternative to Kripke's, of the strong completeness of Lemmon's epistemic logics E2-E5 with respect to elementary classes of Kripke frames with impossible worlds.},

	Abstract = {The present article provides an analysis of the existing proof systems for dynamic epistemic logic from the viewpoint of proof-theoretic semantics. Dynamic epistemic logic is one of the best known members of a family of logical systems that have been successfully applied to diverse scientific disciplines, but the proof-theoretic treatment of which presents many difficulties. After an illustration of the proof-theoretic semantic principles most relevant to the treatment of logical connectives, we turn to illustrating the main features of display calculi, a proof-theoretic paradigm that has been successfully employed to give a proof-theoretic semantic account of modal and substructural logics. Then, we review some of the most significant proposals of proof systems for dynamic epistemic logics, and we critically reflect on them in the light of the previously introduced proof-theoretic semantic principles. The contributions of the present article include a generalization of Belnap's cut-elimination metatheorem for display calculi, and a revised version of the display-style calculus D.EAK [30]. We verify that the revised version satisfies the previously mentioned proof-theoretic semantic principles, and show that it enjoys cut-elimination as a consequence of the generalized metatheorem.},

@article{GMPTZ,
	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. The present article aims at establishing formal connections between correspondence phenomena, well known from the area of modal logic, and the theory of display calculi, originated by Belnap. These connections have been seminally observed and exploited by Marcus Kracht, in the context of his characterization of the modal axioms (which he calls primitive formulas) which can be effectively transformed into 'analytic'structural rules of display calculi. In this context, a rule is 'analytic'if adding it to a display calculus preserves Belnap's cut-elimination theorem. In recent years, the state-of-the-art in correspondence theory has been uniformly extended from classical modal logic to diverse families of non-classical logics, ranging from (bi-)intuitionistic (modal) logics, linear, relevant and other substructural logics, to hybrid logics and mu-calculi. This generalization has given rise to a theory called unified correspondence, the most important technical tools of which are the algorithm ALBA, and the syntactic characterization of Sahlqvist-type classes of formulas and inequalities which is uniform in the setting of normal DLE-logics (logics the algebraic semantics of which is based on bounded distributive lattices). We apply unified correspondence theory, with its tools and insights, to extend Kracht's results and prove his claims in the setting of DLE-logics. The results of the present article characterize the space of properly displayable DLE-logics.},

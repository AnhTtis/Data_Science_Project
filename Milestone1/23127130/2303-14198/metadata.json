    "abstract": "We introduce a paraconsistent expansion of the Gödel logic with a De Morgan negation $\\neg$ and modalities $\\blacksquare$ and $\\blacklozenge$. We equip it with Kripke semantics on frames with two (possibly fuzzy) relations: $R^+$ and $R^-$ (interpreted as the degree of trust in affirmations and denials by a given source) and valuations $v_1$ and $v_2$ (positive and negative support) ranging over $[0,1]$ and connected via $\\neg$. We motivate the semantics of $\\blacksquareφ$ (resp., $\\blacklozengeφ$) as infima (suprema) of both positive and negative supports of $φ$ in $R^+$- and $R^-$-accessible states, respectively. We then prove several instructive semantical properties of the logic. Finally, we devise a tableaux system for branching fragment and establish the complexity of satisfiability and validity.",

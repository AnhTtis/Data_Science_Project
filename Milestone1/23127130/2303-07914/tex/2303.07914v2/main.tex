\begin{abstract}
A popular approach to streaming speech translation is to employ a single offline model with a \textit{wait-$k$} policy to support different latency requirements, which is simpler than training multiple online models with different latency constraints. However, there is a mismatch problem in using a model trained with complete utterances for streaming inference with partial input. We demonstrate that speech representations extracted at the end of a streaming input are significantly different from those extracted from a complete utterance. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Future-Aware Streaming Translation (FAST) that adapts an offline ST model for streaming input. FAST includes a Future-Aware Inference (FAI) strategy that incorporates future context through a trainable masked embedding, and a Future-Aware Distillation (FAD) framework that transfers future context from an approximation of full speech to streaming input.
Our experiments on the MuST-C EnDe, EnEs, and EnFr benchmarks show that FAST achieves better trade-offs between translation quality and latency than strong baselines. Extensive analyses suggest that our methods effectively alleviate the aforementioned mismatch problem between offline training and online inference.\footnote{The code is available at \url{https://github.com/biaofuxmu/FAST}}

\section{Limitations}

Our proposed method is built upon the Wav2Vec2.0 base model, whose superior representation power has been shown to enhance the performance of offline ST models. 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that its parameters are considerably large, approximately 95M. 
This may lead to increased computational costs during training and inference. 
If we want to extend the model to the long context audio (similar to the document level machine translation \cite{zhang2020long}), we have to explore the future work in our conclusion.

The CIF module for detecting the acoustic boundary is optimized from the weakly supervised signal -- total length of text tokens. 
In streaming inference, the boundary detector is not guaranteed to predict accurate boundaries. 
In other words, it is not guaranteed to align each text token with detected boundaries during online inference. 
However, due to the good performance of overall translation quality, we hypothesize that these boundaries may represent some meaningful acoustic (or phrase-like) units. 
The underlying meaning should be another future work to explore.

    "abstract": "This paper reviews suggestions for changes to database technology coming from the work of many researchers, particularly those working with evolving big data. We discuss new approaches to remote data access and standards that better provide for durability and auditability in settings including business and scientific computing. We propose ways in which the language standards could evolve, with proof-of-concept implementations on Github.",

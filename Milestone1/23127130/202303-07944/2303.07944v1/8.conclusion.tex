\section{Conclusions}
We proposed a novel non-contrastive learning approach for end-to-end unsupervised signal regression, with specific experiments on blood volume pulse estimation from face videos.
This SiNC framework effectively learns powerful visual features with only loose frequency constraints.
We demonstrated this by training accurate rPPG models using non-rPPG data and our simple loss functions.
Given the subtlety of the rPPG signal, we believe our work can be extended to other signal regression tasks in the domain of remote vitals estimation.

    "abstract": "We extend our previous model, avalanche-burst invasion percolation (AIP)model by introducing long-range correlations between sites described by fractional Brownian statistics. In our previous models with independent, random site strengths, we reproduced a unique set of power-laws consistent with some of the b-values observed during induced seismicity. We expand upon these models to produce a family of critical exponents which would be characterized by the local long-range correlations inherent to host sediment. Further, in previous correlated invasion percolation studies, fractal behavior was found in only a subset of the range of Hurst exponent, $H$. We find fractal behavior persists for the entire range of Hurst exponent. Additionally, we show how multiple cluster scaling power laws results from changing the generalized Hurst parameter controlling long-range site correlations, and gives rise to a truly multifractal system. This emergent multifractal behavior plays a central role in allowing us to extend our model to better account for variations in the observed Gutenber-Richter b-values of induced seismicity.",

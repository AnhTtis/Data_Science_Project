abstract = {Resistance thermometry provides a time-tested method for taking temperature measurements. However, fundamental limits to resistance-based approaches has produced considerable interest in developing photonic temperature sensors to leverage advances in frequency metrology and to achieve greater mechanical and environmental stability. Here we show that silicon-based optical ring resonator devices can resolve temperature differences of 1 mK using the traditional wavelength scanning methodology. An even lower noise floor of 80 $\mu$K for measuring temperature difference is achieved in the side-of-fringe, constant power mode measurement.},

ABSTRACT = {High-temperature-resistant fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are the main competitors to thermocouples as sensors in applications for high temperature environments defined as being in the 600–1200 °C temperature range. Due to their small size, capacity to be multiplexed into high density distributed sensor arrays and survivability in extreme ambient temperatures, they could provide the essential sensing support that is needed in high temperature processes. While capable of providing reliable sensing information in the short term, their long-term functionality is affected by the drift of the characteristic Bragg wavelength or resonance that is used to derive the temperature. A number of physical processes have been proposed as the cause of the high temperature wavelength drift but there is yet no credible description of this process. In this paper we review the literature related to the long-term wavelength drift of FBGs at high temperature and provide our recent results of more than 4000 h of high temperature testing in the 900–1000 °C range. We identify the major components of the high temperature wavelength drift and we propose mechanisms that could be causing them.},

ABSTRACT = {Fiber Bragg gratings inscribed in single crystalline multimode sapphire fibers (S-FBG) are suitable for monitoring applications in harsh environments up to 1900 °C. Despite many approaches to optimize the S-FBG sensor, a metrological investigation of the achievable temperature uncertainties is still missing. In this paper, we developed a hybrid optical temperature sensor using S-FBG and thermal radiation signals. In addition, the sensor also includes a thermocouple for reference and process control during a field test. We analyzed the influence of the thermal gradient and hotspot position along the sensor for all three detection methods using an industrial draw tower and fixed point cells. Moreover, the signal processing of the reflected S-FBG spectrum was investigated and enhanced to determine the reachable measurement repeatability and uncertainty. For that purpose, we developed an analytical expression for the long-wavelength edge of the peak. Our findings show a higher stability against mechanical-caused mode variations for this method to measure the wavelength shift compared to established methods. Additionally, our approach offers a high robustness against aging effects caused by high-temperature processes (above 1700 °C) or harsh environments. Using temperature-fixed points, directly traceable to the International System of Units, we calibrated the S-FBG and thermocouple of the hybrid sensor, including the corresponding uncertainty budgets. Within the scope of an over 3-weeks-long field trial, 25 production cycles of an industrial silicon manufacturing process with temperatures up to 1600 °C were monitored with over 100,000 single measurements. The absolute calibrated thermocouple (Uk=2≈1K…4K) and S-FBG (Uk=2≈10K…14K) measurements agreed within their combined uncertainty. We also discuss possible strategies to significantly reduce the uncertainty of the S-FBG calibration. A follow-up measurement of the sensor after the long-term operation at high temperatures and the transport of the measuring system together with the sensor resulted in a change of less than 0.5 K. Thus, both the presented hybrid sensor and the measuring principle are very robust for applications in harsh environments.},

abstract = {Spectral pattern recognition is used to measure temperature and generate calibrated wavelength/frequency combs using a single silicon waveguide ring resonator. The ring generates two incommensurate interleaving TE and TM spectral combs that shift independently with temperature to create a spectral pattern that is unique at every temperature. Following an initial calibration, the ring temperature can be determined by recognizing the spectral resonance pattern, and as a consequence, the wavelength of every resonance is also known. Two methods of pattern-based temperature retrieval are presented. In the first method, the ring is locked to a previously determined temperature set-point defined by the coincidence of only two specific TE and TM cavity modes. Based on a prior calibration at the set-point, the ring temperature and hence all resonance wavelengths are then known and the resulting comb can be used as a wavelength calibration reference. In this configuration, all reference comb wavelengths have been reproduced within a 5 pm accuracy across an 80 nm range by using an on-chip micro-heater to tune the ring. For more general photonic thermometry, a spectral correlation algorithm is developed to recognize a resonance pattern across a 30 nm wide spectral window and thereby determine ring temperature continuously to 50 mK accuracy. The correlation method is extended to simultaneously determine temperature and to identify and correct for wavelength calibration errors in the interrogating light source. The temperature and comb wavelength accuracy is limited primarily by the linewidth of the ring resonances, with accuracy and resolution scaling with the ring quality factor.},

An air hole is introduced at the center of the coupling region of the waveguide of an all-pass microring resonator. The effective refractive index theory is used to design its equivalent phase shift and therefore the lineshape of the Fano resonance. Experimental results showed that the quality factor and the Fano parameter of the structure were invariant in a broad temperature range. The wavelength-temperature sensitivity was 75.3 pm/\&\#x2103;, the intensity-temperature sensitivity at the Fano asymmetric edge was 7.49\&\#x2005;dB/\&\#x2103;, and the temperature resolution was 0.25 mK within 10\&\#x2103; to 90\&\#x2103;.},

We propose a photonic sensor with less than milli-kelvin self-heating effect utilizing silicon nitride (Si3N4) microring resonator with a loaded quality factor of 4.75 × 105. By investigating thermal broadening transmission spectra under various probing powers, effective absorption coefficient and thermal relaxation constant of the device were obtained where thermo-refractive and Kerr effect were accounted. Self-heating temperature rise was predicted to be mitigated to 245 μK under a proposed measurement condition, and this ultra-low self-heating effect was experimentally proved. The proposed approach can be used to establish metrological standards for photonic thermometry and various sensing applications.}

In addition to the decay in reflectivity, which was observed, a shift in Bragg wavelength over the temperature range considered was seen. A mechanism for the decay in the reflectivity was developed and modeled according to a power law, and the results were compared with those from the aging curve approach. The wavelength shift was simulated by modification of the power law, which was also found to fit well to the experimental data. Temperature-induced reversible and irreversible changes in the grating characteristics were observed and considered to be a means to predict the working lifetime of the grating at comparatively low temperatures. Accelerated aging was also reviewed and compared in terms of reflectivity and Bragg wavelength shift. It was shown that the temperature-induced irreversible shift in the Bragg wavelengths could not be predicted by use of the isothermal decay of the refractive-index modulation. The results were discussed within the framework of the current theoretical approaches for predicting the stability of gratings of this type.},

    abstract = "{Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}",

    "abstract": "We consider spinorial fields in polar form to deduce their respective tensorial connection in various physical situations: we show that in some cases the tensorial connection is a useful tool, instead in other cases it arises as a necessary object. The comparative analysis of the different cases possessing a tensorial connection is done, investigating the analogies between space-time structures. Eventual comments on quantum field theory and specific spinors are given.",

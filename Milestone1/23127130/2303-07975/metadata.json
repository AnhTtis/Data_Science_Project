    "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand, data security has become increasingly important for ensuring privacy and safety, especially given the sensitive and, sometimes, critical nature of the data handled by IoT devices. There exist hardware-based trusted execution environments used to protect data, but they are not compatible with low-cost devices that lack hardware-assisted security features. The research in this paper presents software-based protection and encryption mechanisms explicitly designed for embedded devices. The proposed architecture is designed to work with low-cost, low-end devices without requiring the usual changes on the underlying hardware. It protects against hardware attacks and supports runtime updates, enabling devices to write data in protected memory. The proposed solution is an alternative data security approach for low-cost IoT devices without compromising performance or functionality. Our work underscores the importance of developing secure and cost-effective solutions for protecting data in the context of IoT.",

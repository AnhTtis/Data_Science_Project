    "abstract": "The Sinc approximation applied to double-exponentially decaying functions is referred to as the DE-Sinc approximation. Because of its high efficiency, this method has been used in various applications. In the Sinc approximation, its mesh size and truncation numbers should be optimally selected to achieve its best performance. However, the standard selection formula has only been ``near-optimally'' selected because the optimal formula of the mesh size cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions of truncation numbers. In this study, we propose two improved selection formulas. The first one is based on the concept by an earlier research that resulted in a better selection formula for the double-exponential formula. The formula performs slightly better than the standard one, but is still not optimal. As a second selection formula, we introduce a new parameter to propose truly optimal selection formula. We provide explicit error bounds for both selection formulas. Numerical comparisons show that the first formula gives a better error bound than the standard formula, and the second formula gives a much better error bound than the standard and first formulas.",

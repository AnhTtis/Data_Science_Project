    "abstract": "To increase the science rate for high data rates/volumes, Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) has partnered with Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) to define an edge to data center traffic shaping / steering transport capability featuring data event-aware network shaping and forwarding. The keystone of this ESnet JLab FPGA Accelerated Transport (EJFAT) is the joint development of a dynamic compute work Load Balancer (LB) of UDP streamed data. The LB is a suite consisting of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) executing the dynamically configurable, low fixed latency LB data plane featuring real-time packet redirection at high throughput, and a control plane running on the FPGA host computer that monitors network and compute farm telemetry in order to make dynamic decisions for destination compute host redirection / load balancing.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and mitigating optical loss is critical to the development of high-performance photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Especially in high refractive index contrast compound semiconductor (III-V) PICs, surface absorption and scattering can be a significant loss mechanism, and needs to be suppressed. Here, we quantify the optical propagation loss due to surface state absorption in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuits (PIC) platform, probe its origins using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and show that it can be mitigated by surface passivation using alumina ($Al_{2}O_{3}$). We also explore potential routes towards achieving passive device performance comparable to state-of-the-art silicon PICs",

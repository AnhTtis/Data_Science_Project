    \Description{A flowchart introducing the framework for modeling the trade-off between privacy preservation and activity recognition. The raw image set was captured at the same resolution $r\times r$. Through a user study, we obtained users' perceived importance of different privacy features. For privacy feature and activity recognition tasks, we evaluate both machines' and humans' performances. Based on these studies, we then calculate the modeling results of the trade-off between privacy preservation and activity recognition.}

abstract = {Super-resolution (SR) is a coveted image processing technique for mobile apps ranging from the basic camera apps to mobile health. Existing SR algorithms rely on deep learning models with significant memory requirements, so they have yet to be deployed on mobile devices and instead operate in the cloud to achieve feasible inference time. This shortcoming prevents existing SR methods from being used in applications that require near real-time latency. In this work, we demonstrate state-of-the-art latency and accuracy for on-device super-resolution using a novel hybrid architecture called SplitSR and a novel lightweight residual block called SplitSRBlock. The SplitSRBlock supports channel-splitting, allowing the residual blocks to retain spatial information while reducing the computation in the channel dimension. SplitSR has a hybrid design consisting of standard convolutional blocks and lightweight residual blocks, allowing people to tune SplitSR for their computational budget. We evaluate our system on a low-end ARM CPU, demonstrating both higher accuracy and up to 5\texttimes{} faster inference than previous approaches. We then deploy our model onto a smartphone in an app called ZoomSR to demonstrate the first-ever instance of on-device, deep learning-based SR. We conducted a user study with 15 participants to have them assess the perceived quality of images that were post-processed by SplitSR. Relative to bilinear interpolation --- the existing standard for on-device SR --- participants showed a statistically significant preference when looking at both images (Z=-9.270, p&lt;0.01) and text (Z=-6.486, p&lt;0.01).},

  abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision technologies have made possible the development of intelligent monitoring systems for video surveillance and ambient-assisted lixving. By using this technology, these systems are able to automatically interpret visual data from the environment and perform tasks that would have been unthinkable years ago. These achievements represent a radical improvement but they also suppose a new threat to individual’s privacy. The new capabilities of such systems give them the ability to collect and index a huge amount of private information about each individual. Next-generation systems have to solve this issue in order to obtain the users’ acceptance. Therefore, there is a need for mechanisms or tools to protect and preserve people’s privacy. This paper seeks to clarify how privacy can be protected in imagery data, so as a main contribution a comprehensive classification of the protection methods for visual privacy as well as an up-to-date review of them are provided. A survey of the existing privacy-aware intelligent monitoring systems and a valuable discussion of important aspects of visual privacy are also provided.}

@article{Saini2014,
  abstract = {Huge amounts of video are being recorded every day by surveillance systems. Since video is capable of recording and preserving an enormous amount of information which can be used in many applications, it is worth examining the degree of privacy loss that might occur due to public access to the recorded video. A fundamental requirement of privacy solutions is an understanding and analysis of the inference channels than can lead to a breach of privacy. Though inference channels and privacy risks are well studied in traditional data sharing applications (e.g., hospitals sharing patient records for data analysis), privacy assessments of video data have been limited to the direct identifiers such as people's faces in the video. Other important inference channels such as location (Where), time (When), and activities (What) are generally overlooked. In this paper we propose a privacy loss model that highlights and incorporates identity leakage through multiple inference channels that exist in a video due to what, when, and where information. We model the identity leakage and the sensitive information separately and combine them to calculate the privacy loss. The proposed identity leakage model is able to consolidate the identity leakage through multiple events and multiple cameras. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the proposed privacy analysis framework.},

@article{Daher2017,
  abstract        = {One of the main problems that are being addressed intensively in modern societies is the ageing of population. Today's challenge is to allow elderly people to remain autonomous at their home as much as possible. Currently, one of the active research fields is the development of an assistive living system (ALS) that aims to support people at home. This can help elderly people to stay at home as long as possible, which consequently satisfies elders and reduces the health care cost. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient way to track and recognize basic elderly activities using a single RGB-D camera. The main benefit of this method is the low cost and the effortless deployment and installation, as well as an overall recall of 97{\%}.},

  abstract  = {Ubiquitous surveillance cameras and personal devices have given rise to the vast generation of image data. While sharing the image data can benefit various applications, including intelligent transportation systems and social science research, those images may capture sensitive individual information, such as license plates, identities, etc. Existing image privacy preservation techniques adopt deterministic obfuscation, e.g., pixelization, which can lead to re-identification with well-trained neural networks. In this study, we propose sharing pixelized images with rigorous privacy guarantees. We extend the standard differential privacy notion to image data, which protects individuals, objects, or their features. Empirical evaluation with real-world datasets demonstrates the utility and efficiency of our method; despite its simplicity, our method is shown to effectively reduce the success rate of re-identification attacks.},

We studied how well the privacy attitudes of MTurk workers mirror the privacy attitudes of the larger user population. We report results from an MTurk survey of attitudes about managing one's personal information online and policy preferences about anonymity. We compare these attitudes with those of a representative U.S. adult sample drawn from a separate survey a few months earlier. MTurk respondents were younger and better educated, and more likely to use social media than the representative US adult sample. Although they reported a similar amount of personal information online, U.S. MTurk workers put a higher value on anonymity and hiding information, were more likely to do so, had more privacy concerns than the larger U.S. public. Indian MTurk workers were much less concerned than American workers about their privacy and more tolerant of government monitoring. Our analyses show that these findings hold even when controlling for age, education, gender, and social media use. Our findings suggest that privacy studies using MTurk need to account for differences between MTurk samples and the general population.},

This system is increasingly popular with researchers and developers. Here we extend previous studies of the demographics and usage behaviors of MTurk workers. We describe how the worker population has changed over time, shifting from a primarily moderate-income, U.S.-based workforce towards an increasingly international group with a significant population of young, well-educated Indian workers. This change in population points to how workers may treat Turking as a full-time job, which they rely on to make ends meet.},

However, the data privacy challenges and tensions that arise when people share devices have not been studied in depth. This paper presents a qualitative study with 72 participants that analyzes how families in Bangladesh currently share mobile phones, their usage patterns, and the tensions and challenges that arise as individuals seek to protect the privacy of their personal data. We show how people share devices out of economic need, but also because sharing is a social and cultural practice that is deeply embedded in Bangladeshi society. We also discuss how prevalent power relationships affect sharing practices and reveal gender dynamics that impact the privacy of women's data. Finally, we highlight strategies that participants adopted to protect their private data from the people with whom they share devices. Taken together, our findings have broad implications that advance the CSCW community's understanding of digital privacy outside the Western world.},

Consequently, governments have begun to undertake a variety of different surveillance programs, which in turn provoke questions regarding citizens' privacy rights. However, both the concepts of privacy and of citizens' corresponding political rights have not been well-developed in HCI for non-Western contexts. This paper presents findings from a three-month long ethnography and online survey (n=606) conducted in Bangladesh, where the government recently imposed mandatory biometric registration for every mobile phone user. Our analysis surfaces important privacy and safety concerns regarding identity, ownership, and trust, and reveals the cultural and political challenges of imposing biometric registration program in Bangladesh. We also discuss how alternative designs of infrastructure, technology, and policy may better meet stakeholders' competing needs in the Global South.},

  abstract   = {In this paper we examine the notion of privacy as promoted in the digital economy and how it has been taken up as a design challenge in the fields of CSCW, HCI and Ubiquitous Computing. Against these prevalent views we present an ethnomethodological study of digital privacy practices in 20 homes in the UK and France, concentrating in particular upon people's use of passwords, their management of digital content, and the controls they exercise over the extent to which the online world at large can penetrate their everyday lives. In explicating digital privacy practices in the home we find an abiding methodological concern amongst members to manage the potential `attack surface' of the digital on everyday life occasioned by interaction in and with the networked world. We also find, as a feature of this methodological preoccupation, that privacy dissolves into a heterogeneous array of relationship management practices. Accordingly we propose that `privacy' has little utility as a focus for design, and suggest instead that a more productive way forward would be to concentrate on supporting people's evident interest in managing their relationships in and with the networked world.},

A lack of conceptual interpretive frameworks makes it difficult to unpack interrelated privacy issues in settings where information technology is also present. Building on theory developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in socio-technical environments as a practical matter.},

  abstract  = {Women in South Asian own fewer personal devices like laptops and phones than women elsewhere in the world. Further, cultural expectations dictate that they should share mobile phones with family members and that their digital activities be open to scrutiny by family members. In this paper, we report on a qualitative study conducted in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh about how women perceive, manage, and control their personal privacy on shared phones. We describe a set of five performative practices our participants employed to maintain individuality and privacy, despite frequent borrowing and monitoring of their devices by family and social relations. These practices involved management of phone and app locks, content deletion, technology avoidance, and use of private modes. We present design opportunities for maintaining privacy on shared devices that are mindful of the social norms and values in the South Asian countries studied, including to improve discovery of privacy controls, offer content hiding, and provide algorithmic understanding of multiple-user use cases. Our suggestions have implications for enhancing the agency of user populations whose social norms shape their phone use.},

Prior research has focused on families and device owners in western contexts (Europe and North America), and has identified the importance of bystanders: individuals who are subjected to smart device use of others. Given the cultural and contextual aspects of accommodating bystanders, we identify a gap where bystanders in non-western societies have been insufficiently researched. To address this we conduct 20 interviews with domestic workers and household employers in Jordan, exploring privacy attitudes and practices. Our analysis uncovers a complex interplay between religious and social norms; legal and regulatory perspectives on privacy; and tensions between households and their domestic workers. We explore issues arising from smart homes coexisting as a residence and workplace, and highlight how workplace protections are ill-suited. We structure our findings to help inform public awareness, policy makers, manufacturers, and future research.},

We interviewed researchers, developers, industry leaders, policymakers, and designers involved in their deployment to explore motivations, expectations, perceived opportunities and barriers to adoption. This provided insight into several pertinent challenges facing the adoption of these technologies, including: how they might make a nebulous concept like privacy computationally tractable; how to make them more usable by developers; and how they could be explained and made accountable to stakeholders and wider society. We conclude with implications for the development, deployment, and responsible governance of these privacy-preserving computation techniques.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, articleno = {68}, numpages = {13}, keywords = {expert interview, policy, privacy-enhancing technologies, cryptography}, location = {Yokohama, Japan}, series = {CHI '21}}

The proposed framework explicitly learns a degradation transform for the original video inputs, in order to optimize the trade-off between target task performance and the associated privacy budgets on the degraded video. A notable challenge is that the privacy budget, often defined and measured in task-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model performance, because a strong protection of privacy has to sustain against any possible model that tries to hack privacy information. Such an uncommon situation has motivated us to propose two strategies, i.e., budget model restarting and ensemble, to enhance the generalization of the learned degradation on protecting privacy against unseen hacker models. Novel training strategies, evaluation protocols, and result visualization methods have been designed accordingly. Two experiments on privacy-preserving action recognition, with privacy budgets defined in various ways, manifest the compelling effectiveness of the proposed framework in simultaneously maintaining high target task (action recognition) performance while suppressing the privacy breach risk.

\begin{abstract}

A computer vision system using low-resolution image sensors can provide intelligent services (e.g., activity recognition) but preserve unnecessary visual privacy information from the hardware level. However, preserving visual privacy and enabling accurate machine recognition have adversarial needs on image resolution. Modeling the trade-off of privacy preservation and machine recognition performance can guide future privacy-preserving computer vision systems using low-resolution image sensors. In this paper, using the at-home activity of daily livings (ADLs) as the scenario, we first obtained the most important visual privacy features through a user survey. Then we quantified and analyzed the effects of image resolution on human and machine recognition performance in activity recognition and privacy awareness tasks. We also investigated how modern image super-resolution techniques influence these effects. Based on the results, we proposed a method for modeling the trade-off of privacy preservation and activity recognition on low-resolution images.

%It is unclear how to find the balanced image resolution that can optimize the two goals simultaneously.
%In this paper, using the at-home activity of daily livings (ADLs) as the scenario, we explored the effect of image resolution on privacy-preserving machine recognition. 
%We first obtained the most user-concerned visual privacy features through a user survey. Then we quantified how image resolution affects both the human's perception ability and the machine's recognition performance using cutting-edge machine learning methods in both activity recognition and privacy awareness tasks. 
%We also investigated how modern super-resolution techniques influence the results. 
%Based on the results, we proposed a method for modeling privacy-preserving machine recognition over image resolution. 
%We expect our work can inspire future privacy-preserving intelligent computer vision systems. 

%A low-resolution image sensor can achieve this purpose from the hardware level.

In this paper, we chose Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in a home environment as an example to explore an effective modeling method for visual privacy, preserving intelligent applications. Therefore, we firstly obtained the most user-concerned visual privacy features through a user study.

%A low-resolution image sensor makes it possible for visual-privacy-preserving machine recognition. However, current research is insufficient to determine an optimal image resolution, on which we can balance the machine recognition performance and the visual privacy preserving capability. In this paper, we chose recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs), which is important for health monitoring and assessment, to explore the image resolution model for visual privacy preserving intelligent applications. We first obtained the most user-concerned visual privacy features through a user survey. Then we modeled the effect of image resolution on ADLs recognition performance and visual privacy awareness from both the human and the machine with cutting-edge machine learning methods. %Also, we empirically modeled the impact of image resolution on cutting-edge machine learning approaches for ADLs recognition. 
%On this basis, we proposed the modeling method for calculating the optimal resolution range that can maximize the machine's ADLs recognition performance while preserving the visual privacy. We envision that our method can be easily applied or adapted to other vision-based smart applications that require to balance privacy awareness and machine recognition performance.

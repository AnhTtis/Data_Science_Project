    "abstract": "We present a computational approach to the classical Schottky problem based on Fay's trisecant identity for genus $g\\geq 4$. For a given Riemann matrix $\\mathbb{B}\\in\\mathbb{H}^{g}$, the Fay identity establishes linear dependence of secants in the Kummer variety if and only if the Riemann matrix corresponds to a Jacobian variety as shown by Krichever. The theta functions in terms of which these secants are expressed depend on the Abel maps of four arbitrary points on a Riemann surface. However, there is no concept of an Abel map for general $\\mathbb{B} \\in \\mathbb{H}^{g}$. To establish linear dependence of the secants, four components of the vectors entering the theta functions can be chosen freely. The remaining components are determined by a Newton iteration to minimize the residual of the Fay identity. Krichever's theorem assures that if this residual vanishes within the finite numerical precision for a generic choice of input data, then the Riemann matrix is with this numerical precision the period matrix of a Riemann surface. The algorithm is compared in genus 4 for some examples to the Schottky-Igusa modular form, known to give the Jacobi locus in this case. It is shown that the same residuals are achieved by the Schottky-Igusa form and the approach based on the Fay identity in this case. In genera 5, 6 and 7, we discuss known examples of Riemann matrices and perturbations thereof for which the Fay identity is not satisfied.",

    "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity is a complex and widely recognized trait that poses significant challenges in developing effective cancer therapies. Characterizing the heterogeneous subpopulation structure within a tumor will enable a more precise and successful treatment strategy for cancer therapy. A possible strategy to uncover the structure of subpopulations is to examine how they respond differently to different drugs. For instance, PhenoPop was proposed as a means to unravel the subpopulation structure within a tumor from high-throughput drug screening data. However, the deterministic nature of PhenoPop restricts the model fit and the information it can extract from the data. As an advancement, we proposed a stochastic model based on the linear birth-death process to address this limitation. Our model can formulate a dynamic variance along the horizon of the experiment so that the model uses more information from the data to provide a more robust estimation. In addition, the newly proposed model can be readily adapted to situations where the experimental data exhibits a positive time correlation. We concluded our study by testing our model on simulated data (In Silico) and experimental data (In Vitro), which supports our argument about its advantages.",

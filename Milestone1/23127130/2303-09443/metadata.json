    "abstract": "The $B^+ \\rightarrow J/ψη^{\\prime} K^+$ decay is observed for the first time using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13TeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$. The branching fraction of this decay is measured relative to the known branching fraction of the $B^+ \\rightarrow ψ(2S) K^+$ decays and found to be $$ \\frac{\\mathcal{B}( B^+ \\rightarrow J/ψη^{\\prime}K^+)}{\\mathcal{B}( B^+ \\rightarrow ψ(2S)K^+)} = \\left(4.91\\pm 0.47\\pm0.29\\pm0.07\\right)\\times10^{-2}, $$ where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic and the third is related to external branching fractions. A first look at the $J/ψη^{\\prime}$ mass distribution is performed and no signal of intermediate resonances is observed.",

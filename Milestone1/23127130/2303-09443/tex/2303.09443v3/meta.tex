 Observation 
 of the $B^+ \rightarrow J/\psi \eta^{\prime} K^+$ decay
 
 
  The $B^+ \rightarrow J/\psi \eta^{\prime} K^+$
  decay is observed for the first time 
  using proton-proton collision data
  collected by the LHCb experiment  
  at centre-of-mass energies of 
  7, 8, and 13TeV,
  corresponding 
  to a total integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$.
  
  The branching fraction of this decay is measured relative 
  to the known branching fraction
  of the $B^+ \rightarrow \psi(2S) K^+$ decays
  and found to be 
  $$
  \frac{\mathcal{B}( B^+ \rightarrow J/\psi \eta^{\prime}K^+)}
       {\mathcal{B}( B^+ \rightarrow \psi(2S)K^+) } = 
  \left(4.91\pm 0.47\pm0.29\pm0.07\right)\times10^{-2},
  $$
  where the first uncertainty is statistical, 
  the second is systematic and 
  the third is related to
  external branching fractions. 
  A first look at the $J/\psi\eta^{\prime}$ 
  mass distribution 
  is performed 
  and no signal of intermediate 
  resonances is observed.

    "abstract": "We show that weakly entangled states can improve communication over a qubit\nchannel using only separate, interference-free, measurements of individual\nphotons. We introduce a communication task corresponding to the cryptographic\nprimitive known as secret sharing and show that all steerable two-qubit\nisotropic states provide a quantum advantage in the success rate using only\nproduct measurements. Furthermore, we show that such measurements can even\nreveal communication advantages from noisy partially entangled states that\nadmit no quantum steering. We then go further and consider a stochastic variant\nof secret sharing based on more sophisticated, yet standard, partial Bell state\nanalysers, and show that this reveals advantages also for a range of\nunsteerable isotropic states. By preparing polarisation qubits in unsteerable\nstates, we experimentally demonstrate improved success rates of both secret\nsharing tasks beyond the best entanglement-unassisted qubit protocol. Our\nresults reveal the capability of simple and scalable measurements in\nentanglement-assisted quantum communication to overcome large amounts of noise.",

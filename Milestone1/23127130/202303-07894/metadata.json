    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate photothermal heating of ultra-flexible\nmetamaterials, which are obtained by randomly mixing TiN nanoparticles in\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Due to the plasmonic properties of TiN\nnanoparticles, incident light is perfectly absorbed in a broadband range\n(300-3000 nm) to generate heat within these metamaterials. Under irradiation of\nan 808 nm near-infrared laser with different intensities, our predicted\ntemperature rises as a function of time agree well with recent experimental\ndata. For a given laser intensity, the temperature rise varies\nnon-monotonically with concentration of TiN nanoparticles because the\nenhancement of thermal conductivity and absorbed energy as adding plasmonic\nnanostructures leads to opposite effects on the heating process. When the model\nis extended to solar heating, photothermal behaviors are qualitatively similar\nbut the temperature increase is less than 13 $K$. Our studies would provide\ngood guidance for future experimental studies on the photo-to-heat conversion\nof broadband perfect absorbers.",

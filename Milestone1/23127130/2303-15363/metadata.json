    "abstract": "We studied how the cryogenic sapphire resonator responds to fast variations of the dissipated microwave power. The experiments were carried out with sapphire resonators cooled to 6 K at frequencies around 11 GHz. We found that the power-to-frequency conversion of the resonator depends on Fourier frequency as the transfer function of the 1st-order low-pass filter with corner frequency close to the resonator loaded half-bandwidth. Having measured the power-to-frequency conversion of the cryogenic sapphire resonator, we predicted the phase noise of the microwave oscillator based on such resonator.",

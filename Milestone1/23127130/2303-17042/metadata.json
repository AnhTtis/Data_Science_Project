    "abstract": "An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is developed for nonsmooth biconvex optimization for inverse problems in imaging. In particular, the simultaneous estimation of activity and attenuation (SAA) problem in time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) has such a structure when maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed. The ADMM framework is applied to MLE for SAA in TOF-PET, resulting in the ADMM-SAA algorithm. This algorithm is extended by imposing total variation (TV) constraints on both the activity and attenuation map, resulting in the ADMM-TVSAA algorithm. The performance of these algorithms is illustrated using the standard maximum likelihood activity and attenuation estimation (MLAA) algorithm as a reference.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes a heterogeneous push-sum based subgradient algorithm for multi-agent distributed convex optimization in which each agent can arbitrarily switch between subgradient-push and push-subgradient at each time. It is shown that the heterogeneous algorithm converges to an optimal point at an optimal rate over time-varying directed graphs.",

    "abstract": "We consider a differential geometric setting on power sets and Borel algebras. Our chosen framework is based on diffeologies, and we make a link between the various diffeological structures that we propose, having in mind set-valued maps, relations, set-valued gradients, differentiable measures, and shape analysis. This work intends to establish rigorous properties on sample diffeologies that seem of interest to us.",

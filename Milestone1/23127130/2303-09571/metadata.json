    "abstract": "We study the growth of entanglement entropy in a doubly holographic model of gravity for a spherical AdS black hole. Compared to previous work, which was limited to the case of planar black holes, this introduces an extra scale to the problem. This allows us to analyze the interplay between the reorganization of entanglement entropy due to island formation and the onset of the Hawking-Page phase transition and to find the appearance of a new critical black hole radius unrelated to the thermodynamics. We also find that the geometry of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface capturing the physics of islands exhibits drastically different behavior than in the planar case.",

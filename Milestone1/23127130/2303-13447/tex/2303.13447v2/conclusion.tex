\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We contribute \system, a framework for composing 
interaction history-aware and customizable widgets 
to enable transparent, reusable, and expressive
data science workflows in computational notebooks. 
Case studies conducted in the industry
setting demonstrated how \system widgets
enabled efficient graph analysis workflows 
compared to participants' previous experience
by surfacing inconsistencies and data quality issues. 
The built-in interaction history enabled sharing of insights
and data among various steps within a project.
The shared action features empowered users
to customize the widget, thereby reducing dependency on developers.
However, similar to any new framework, \system
exhibited several limitations related to
incomplete documentation and gaps in widget feature design,
among others. These challenges encourage interesting
future research.
%We plan to open-source \system to speed up the progress
%of the widget-suite and component library development
%through community effort. 
% Finally, we plan to address 
% the fundamental research questions related to balancing human agency and automation with respect to recommendation and composability, 
% conduct larger-scale studies to get feedback, 
% and expand to other domains for generalizability.

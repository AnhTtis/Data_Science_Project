\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}
In this paper, we present DevelSet,
a CUDA and DNN accelerated end-to-end level set OPC framework that can perform instant mask optimization in around 1 second.
By introducing the curvature term into the level set algorithm, we extend the applicable scenarios of level set-based ILT methodology for mask manufacturability improvement.
Moreover, a novel multi-branch neural network with level set embeddings is proposed to boost the fast convergence of DevelSet.
We believe the improved level set algorithm with CUDA/DNN accelerated joint optimization paradigm
will have a real impact on the industrial mask optimization solutions.
%Future research includes the exploration on neural network extension and evaluation on more complicated designs.

  abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, refers to the public ledger used in a distributed network. Because blockchain does not rely on a central authority, peers have to agree on the state of the ledger among themselves, i.e., they have to reach a consensus on the state of the transactions. The way nodes reach that consensus has gained incredible attention in the literature. Bitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, as did Ethereum at first. The latter decided to move from PoW to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because of the high energy consumption required by PoW. To date, many other consensus protocols have been proposed to address the limitations of the seminal ones. In this paper, we inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of consensus protocols research. The aim is to provide an analysis of the research introducing new consensus protocols in order to enable a more unified treatment. To that end, we review 28 new consensus protocols and we propose a four-category classification framework: Origin, Design, Performance and Security. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by classifying the 28 protocols. Many surveys have already been proposed in the literature and some of them will be discussed later in the paper. Yet, we believe that this work is relevant and important for two reasons. Firstly, blockchain being a fast evolving topic, new consensus protocols emerge regularly and improvements are also put forward on a regular basis. Hence, this work aims at reflecting the latest state-of-the-art in terms of consensus protocols. Secondly, we aim to propose a comprehensive classification framework, integrating knowledge from multiple works in the literature, as well as introducing classification dimensions that have not been proposed before. This work demonstrates that multiple consensus have been proposed in a short period of time, and highlights the differences between these protocols. Furthermore, it is suggested that researchers and practitioners who aim to propose consensus protocols in the future should pay attention to all the dimensions presented in the classification framework.},

The translation of existing business rules on transactions to a smart contract is challenging and time consuming. These types of constraints are often re-used among different contracts in a given application area. Automatic generation of smart contracts can reduce the level of expertise required for, along with the time and cost incurred in, specifying them. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for auto-generating smart contracts by enabling seamless translation of constraints encoded in a knowledge representation to blockchain requirements. Our framework uses ontologies and semantic rules to encode domain-specific knowledge and then leverages the structure of abstract syntax trees to incorporate the required constraints. We successfully demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of our method in two different applications: translating eligibility criteria for clinical trials and car rentals.},

In this paper we review academic approaches from the discipline of model-driven engineering as well as industrial no-code and low-code development platforms for blockchains. We further present a case study for an integrated no-code blockchain environment for demonstrating the state-of-the-art in this area.

The requirements on these networks and their usage, however, can differ significantly from traditional communication networks, with implications on all layers of the protocol stack. This article is motivated by these differences and, in particular, by the observation that many fundamental design aspects of these networks are not well-understood today. To support the networking community to contribute to this emerging application domain, we present a structured overview of the field, from topology and neighbor discovery, over block and transaction propagation, to sharding and off-chain networks, also reviewing existing empirical results from different measurement studies. In particular, for each of these domains, we provide the context, highlighting differences and commonalities with traditional networks, review the state-of-the-art, and identify open research challenges. Our article can hence also be seen as a call-to-arms to improve the foundation on top of which blockchains are built.},

In the last several years, there has been a lot of work devoted to conceptual multidimensional modeling for data warehouses. This paper presents a survey of various proposed conceptual multidimensional models for core as well as advanced features supported. Hereafter, a comparison of the models is done based on the criteria broadly categorized as: general aspects, relationship aspects and implementation aspects, showing the evolution in this area. General aspects involve basic features of the multidimensional model. The relationships among various constructs used in the multidimensional model are referred under relationship criteria. The implementation criteria relate aspects such as mathematical formalism and guidelines to define complex multidimensional structures.},

In this paper we explore the attestation of models through globally unique identifiers as a first step towards decentralized applications based on models. As a proof-of-concept we describe a prototypical implementation of a software connector for the ADOxx metamodeling platform. The connector allows for (a.) the creation of claims bound to the identity of an Ethereum account and (b.) their verification on the blockchain by anyone at a later point in time. For evaluating the practical applicability, we demonstrate the application on the Ethereum network and measure and evaluate limiting factors related to transaction cost and confirmation times.},

At the application and business levels, long-established query languages such as SQL provide interoperability that can be complemented by blockchain-based data storage today, enabling permissionless and verifiable data storage along with decentralized execution across tens of thousands of nodes. However, when accessing one or more blockchains, interoperability is not provided today, posing challenges such as inhomogeneous data access in addition to different features and trade-offs, e.g. in data and distribution, scalability, and security. Towards interoperability in data access among the increasing number of blockchain platforms, this paper introduces a cross-chain query language for data access across blockchains. Similar to SQL, the language abstracts from implementation based on a data model compatible with the largest open and permission-less blockchains (OPB) today. The language, data model, and processing architecture are demonstrated and evaluated with an implemented prototype, aiming to contribute to the discussion on blockchain interoperability among OPB.},

Thus, it is essential to present research evidence that has been published in this area. In this systematic survey, 275 research papers that examined serverless computing from well-known literature databases were extensively reviewed to extract useful data. Then, the obtained data were analyzed to answer several research questions regarding state-of-the-art contributions of serverless computing, its concepts, its platforms, its usage, etc. We moreover discuss the challenges that serverless computing faces nowadays and how future research could enable its implementation and usage.},

To bridge the gap between choreography modeling and implementation, this paper critically analyzes the assumptions of choreography languages. We propose new language concepts specifically targeting blockchain capabilities, and we define their operational semantics.

Despite the momentum in the cloud-native community, the existing challenges and compromises still wait for more advanced research and solutions to further explore the potential of the serverless computing model. As a contribution to this knowledge, this article surveys and elaborates the research domains in the serverless context by decoupling the architecture into four stack layers: Virtualization, Encapsule, System Orchestration, and System Coordination.

Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and the Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designing contracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and functionality.},

  abstract = {With the recent maturity of Cloud computing technology and the flexibility of the Cloud services, the offering of Cloud services has spread exponentially. Different Cloud service providers offer their services highlighting different performance indicators. Because of the diversity of Cloud services and their highlighted performance indicators, the selection of the most suitable Cloud service is a complex problem for the Cloud users. Many Cloud users are unable to identify the Cloud services that best suit their needs and thus choose an unsuitable Cloud service, which results in financial loses as well as time delays. To this end, in this study, we propose an efficient three layered framework for evaluating and ranking IaaS, PaaS and SaaS Cloud services. We identified the functional and non-functional key performance indicators (KPIs) for Cloud services from 6 KPI classes. We classified these KPIs with respect to their types and criticality so that the Cloud user can easily choose according to his needs. The relative importance of the KPIs was determined using CRITIC method. We combined the KPIs values and their relative importance for an overall evaluation and ranking of the Cloud services using Vikor method. A case study is also presented for a step by step demonstration of the proposed method.},

However, to execute collaborative business processes, we need a mechanism for enabling entire workflows as a whole, where participants' private processes must agree on the shared inter-organizational processes realized by Blockchain. To address this, we introduce a set of techniques that take business process models as input and transforms them into statecharts for Blockchain and process participants. We also optimize the size of the statechart in order to reduce the number of communications between Blockchain and participants. The statecharts are then used as a basis for generating software artifacts: smart contracts running on Blockchain and Web applications for process participants. Through the evaluation of our solution, we confirmed that our algorithms produce software artifacts that collaboratively work together. By applying the statechart reduction algorithms, we could reduce the number of sending and receiving events by 74\% and 65\% in two case studies.},

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations' costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  abstract = {Limitations on high latency and low scalability of classical blockchain systems retard their adoptions and applications. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently rebuild upper layer components. The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises DAG techniques. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of ever-existing and ongoing DAG-based blockchain systems. We abstract a general model to capture the main features and identify six types of design patterns. Then, we evaluate these systems from the perspectives of structure, consensus, property, security, and performance. We further discuss the trade-off between different factors, open challenges, and the potentiality of DAG-based solutions, indicating their promising directions for future research.},

Despite of the importance of DApps, we still have quite little understanding of DApps along with its ecosystem. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of blockchain-based DApps to date, based on an extensive dataset of 995 Ethereum DApps and 29,846,075 transaction logs over them. We make a descriptive analysis of the popularity of DApps, summarize the patterns of how DApps use smart contracts to access the underlying blockchain, and explore the worth-addressing issues of deploying and operating DApps. Based on the findings, we propose some implications for DApp users to select proper DApps, for DApp developers to improve the efficiency of DApps, and for blockchain vendors to enhance the support of DApps.},

Compared with conventional service architectures, cloud computing introduces new security challenges in secure service management and control, privacy protection, data integrity protection in distributed databases, data backup, and synchronization. Blockchain can be leveraged to address these challenges, partly due to the underlying characteristics such as transparency, traceability, decentralization, security, immutability, and automation. We present a comprehensive survey of how blockchain is applied to provide security services in the cloud computing model and we analyze the research trends of blockchain-related techniques in current cloud computing models. During the reviewing, we also briefly investigate how cloud computing can affect blockchain, especially about the performance improvements that cloud computing can provide for the blockchain. Our contributions include the following: (i) summarizing the possible architectures and models of the integration of blockchain and cloud computing and the roles of cloud computing in blockchain; (ii) classifying and discussing recent, relevant works based on different blockchain-based security services in the cloud computing model; (iii) simply investigating what improvements cloud computing can provide for the blockchain; (iv) introducing the current development status of the industry/major cloud providers in the direction of combining cloud and blockchain; (v) analyzing the main barriers and challenges of integrated blockchain and cloud computing systems; and (vi) providing recommendations for future research and improvement on the integration of blockchain and cloud systems.},

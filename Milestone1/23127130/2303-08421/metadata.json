    "abstract": "We have carried absolute frequency measurements of the $(6s^{2})\\,^{1}S_{0}$ $-$ $(6s6p)\\,^{3}P_{1}$ transition in $^{171}$Yb (the intercombination line), where the spin-1/2 isotope yields two hyperfine lines. The measurements rely on sub-Doppler spectroscopy to yield a discriminator to which a 556 nm laser is locked. The frequency reference for the optical frequency measurements is a high-quality quartz oscillator steered to the GNSS timescale that is bridged with a frequency comb. The reference is validated to $\\sim3\\times10^{-12}$ by spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}-\\,^{3}P_{0}$ (clock) line in laser cooled and trapped $^{171}$Yb atoms. From the hyperfine separation between the $F=1/2$ and $F=3/2$ levels of $^{3}P_{1}$ we determine the hyperfine constant to be $A(^3P_1)= 3\\,957\\,833\\,(28)$ kHz.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The footprint of foundation models is rapidly expanding: this class of emerging technology is pervading society and is only in its infancy.
\EG aims to ensure that foundation models are transparent for a range of informational needs, thereby establishing the basic facts of how they come to impact society.
We look forward to seeing the community build upon and make use of \EG.
Concurrently, we encourage policy uptake to standardize reporting on all assets in \EG as the basis for driving change in the foundation model ecosystem.

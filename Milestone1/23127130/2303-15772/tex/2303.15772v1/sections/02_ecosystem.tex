Technology development situates in a broader social context: technology is the byproduct of organization-internal processes and the artifact of broader social forces \citep{martin2020extending, gebru2018datasheets, mitchell2018modelcards, amironesei2021notes, paullada2021data, birhane2022values}.
\citet[][\S1.2]{bommasani2021opportunities} introduce this perspective for foundation models: \reffig{ecosystem-diagram} demonstrates the canonical pipeline where datasets, models, and applications mediate the relationship between the people on either side.

Concretely, consider \assetURL{Stable Diffusion} \citep{rombach2021highresolution}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item People create content (\eg take photos) that they (or others) upload to the web.
\item LAION curates the LAION-5B dataset \citep{schuhmann2022laion} from the CommonCrawl web scrape, filtered for problematic content. 
\item LMU Munich, IWR Heidelberg University, and RunwayML train Stable Diffusion on a filtered version of LAION-5B using 256 A100 GPUs.
\item Stability AI builds Stable Diffusion Reimagine by replacing the Stable Diffusion text encoder with an image encoder.\footnote{\url{https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-reimagine}}
\item Stability AI deploys Stable Diffusion Reimagine as an image editing tool to end users on Clipdrop, allowing users to generate multiple variations of a single image (\eg imagine a room with different furniture layouts). 
The application includes a filter to block inappropriate requests and solicits user feedback to improve the system as well as mitigate bias.
\end{enumerate}
This process delineates social roles and, thereby, \textit{stakeholders}: data creators, data curators, compute providers, hardware providers, foundation model developers, downstream application developers, and end users. 
While framed technically (\eg curation, training, adaptaiton), the process bears broader societal ramifications:  for example, ongoing litigation contends the use of LAION and the subsequent image generation from Stable Diffusion is unlawful, infringing on the rights and the styles of data creators.\footnote{See \url{https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/is-ai-art-stealing-from-artists}.}
As the foundation model ecosystem matures, amounting to greater commercial viability, foundation model development will become even more intricate, implicating even more social roles.\footnote{See \url{https://www.madrona.com/foundation-models/}.}

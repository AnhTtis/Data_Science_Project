\section{Introduction}


\tldr{Foundation models exist in an ecosystem}
While attention centers on the foundation model,
the technical construction and the social consequences
of a foundation model depends on the context.
\emph{Models} are trained from \emph{datasets} and models are adapted into
\emph{applications}.
Furthermore, datasets can be derived from other datasets,
and models can be further fine-tuned.
[talk about social impact - privacy harms, adaptation determines risk; model
that isn't deployed or not used to generate has significantly less harms - compare GPT-3 and Gopher]

\tldr{We introduce ecosystem graphs}
In this paper, we present a framework, ecosystem graphs, to capture the ecosystem around
foundation models.
In particular, we represent each \emph{asset} (dataset, model, application)
as a node, and any dependencies are represented as directed edges.

\tldr{Significance: documentation}
Documentation is important for transparency.
Having the graph allows us to answer questions, etc.
[important: give a few good examples]
We can think of model cards and datasheets as documentation on the nodes
of the graph, whereas the ecosystem graph is about the edges.

\tldr{Concrete assets}
We created an ecosystem with N datasets, N models, and N applications from DATE
to DATE.
[include some examples]

Implementation: GitHub repository where anyone can contribute

\tldr{Questions}
Using this, we can do the following:

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been shown to be flexible and effective function estimators for identification of nonlinear state-space models. However, if the resulting models are used directly for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), the resulting nonlinear optimization problem is often overly complex due the size of the network, requires the use of high-order observers to track the states of the ANN model, and the overall control scheme exploits little of the structural properties or available autograd tools for these models. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to auto-convert ANN state-space models to linear parameter-varying (LPV) form and solve predictive control problems by successive solutions of linear model predictive problems, corresponding to quadratic programs (QPs). Furthermore, we show how existing ANN identification methods, such as the SUBNET method that uses a state encoder, can provide efficient implementation of MPCs. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via a simulation study on an unbalanced disc system.",

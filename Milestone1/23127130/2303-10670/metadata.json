    "abstract": "Distributed quantum computation has gained extensive attention since small-qubit quantum computers seem to be built more practically in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this paper, we give a distributed Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm (DBVA) with $t$ computing nodes, and a distributed exact Grover's algorithm (DEGA) that solve the search problem with only one target item in the unordered databases. Though the designing techniques are simple in the light of BV algorithm, Grover's algorithm, the improved Grover's algorithm by Long, and the distributed Grover's algorithm by Qiu et al, in comparison to BV algorithm, the circuit depth of DBVA is not greater than $2^{\\text{max}(n_0, n_1, \\cdots, n_{t-1})}+3$ instead of $2^{n}+3$, and the circuit depth of DEGA is $8(n~\\text{mod}~2)+9$, which is less than the circuit depth of Grover's algorithm, $1 + 8\\left\\lfloor \\fracπ{4}\\sqrt{2^n} \\right\\rfloor$. In particular, we provide situations of our DBVA and DEGA on MindQuantum (a quantum software) to validate the correctness and practicability of our methods. By simulating the algorithms running in the depolarized channel, it further illustrates that distributed quantum algorithm has superiority of resisting noise.",

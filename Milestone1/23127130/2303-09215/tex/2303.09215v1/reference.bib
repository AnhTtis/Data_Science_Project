journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the effects of a dark matter (DM) spike on the neighborhood of Sgr A*, the black hole (BH) in the center of the Milky Way. Our main goal is to investigate whether current and future astronomical observations of Sgr A* could detect the presence of such a DM spike. At first, we construct the spacetime metric around a static and spherically symmetric BH with a DM spike, and later, this solution is generalized for a rotating BH using the Newman–Janis–Azreg-Aïnou algorithm. For the static BH metric, we use the data of the S2 star orbiting Sgr A* to determine and analyze the constraints on the two free parameters characterizing the density and innermost boundary of the DM halo surrounding the BH. Furthermore, by making use of the available observational data for the DM spike density ρ sp and the DM spike radius R sp in the Milky Way, we consider a geometrically thick accretion disk model around the Sgr A* BH and demonstrate that the effect of DM distribution on the shadow radius and the image of the BH is considerably weak for realistic DM densities, becoming significant only when the DM density is of the order ρ sp ∼ (10−19–10−20) g cm−3 near the BH. We further analyze the possibility of observing this effect with radio interferometry, simulating observations with an EHT-like array, and find that it is unlikely to be detectable in the near future.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {If a lot of dark matter particles accumulate near the black hole, then the chances of detecting dark matter signals near a black hole are greatly increased. These effects may be observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), Tianqin project, Taiji project, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). In this work, we explore the effects of dark matter spikes on black hole space-time. For the Schwarzschild-like black hole case, we consider Newton's approximation and perturbation approximation. This makes it possible to use Xu's method to solve the Einstein field equation, and extend Schwarzschild-like black hole to Kerr-like black hole (BH) via Newman-Janis (NJ) algorithm. By analyzing the dark matter spike on the black hole event horizon (EH), stationary limit surfaces (SLS), ergosphere and energy-momentum tensors (EMT), we found that compared with the dark matter halo, the dark matter spike would have a higher effect on the black hole by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, if there is a dark matter spike near the black hole, it is very possible to test the dark matter model through gravitational wave (GW) observation and EHT observation.}

title = {Black holes, gravitational waves and fundamental physics: a roadmap},
journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {The grand challenges of contemporary fundamental physics—dark matter, dark energy, vacuum energy, inflation and early universe cosmology, singularities and the hierarchy problem—all involve gravity as a key component. And of all gravitational phenomena, black holes stand out in their elegant simplicity, while harbouring some of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity: event horizons, singularities and ergoregions.

The hitherto invisible landscape of the gravitational Universe is being unveiled before our eyes: the historical direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marks the dawn of a new era of scientific exploration. Gravitational-wave astronomy will allow us to test models of black hole formation, growth and evolution, as well as models of gravitational-wave generation and propagation. It will provide evidence for event horizons and ergoregions, test the theory of General Relativity itself, and may reveal the existence of new fundamental fields. The synthesis of these results has the potential to radically reshape our understanding of the cosmos and of the laws of Nature.

The purpose of this work is to present a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the relevant fields of research, summarize important open problems, and lay out a roadmap for future progress. This write-up is an initiative taken within the framework of the European Action on ‘Black holes, Gravitational waves and Fundamental Physics’.}

abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.}

These quasinormal modes have been studied for a long time, often with the intent of describing the time evolution of a perturbation in terms of these modes in a way very similar to a normal-mode analysis. In this review, we summarize how quasinormal modes are defined and computed. We will see why they have been regarded as closely analogous to normal modes, and discover why they are actually quite different. We also discuss how quasinormal modes can be used in the analysis of a gravitational wave signal, such as will hopefully be detected in the near future.}

title = {Spacetime Metrics and Ringdown Waveforms for Galactic Black Holes Surrounded by a Dark Matter Spike},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Theoretical models suggest the existence of a dark matter spike surrounding the supermassive black holes at the core of galaxies. The spike density is thought to obey a power law that starts at a few times the black hole horizon radius and extends to a distance, R sp, of the order of a kiloparsec. We use the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations to construct the spacetime metric representing a black hole surrounded by such a dark matter spike. We consider the dark matter to be a perfect fluid, but make no other assumption about its nature. The assumed power-law density provides in principle three parameters with which to work: the power-law exponent γ sp, the external radius R sp, and the spike density  at R sp. These in turn determine the total mass of the spike. We focus on Sagittarius A* and M87 for which some theoretical and observational bounds exist on the spike parameters. Using these bounds in conjunction with the metric obtained from the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations, we investigate the possibility of detecting the dark matter spikes surrounding these black holes via the gravitational waves emitted at the ringdown phase of black hole perturbations. Our results suggest that if the spike to black hole mass ratio is roughly constant, greater mass black holes require relatively smaller spike densities to yield potentially observable signals. We find that is unlikely for the spike in M87 to be detected via the ringdown waveform with currently available techniques unless its mass is roughly an order of magnitude larger than existing observational estimates. However, given that the signal increases with black hole mass, dark matter spikes might be observable for more massive galactic black holes in the not too distant future.}

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Beginning with the pioneering work of Regge and Wheeler (1957 Phys. Rev. 108 1063), there have been many studies of perturbations away from the Schwarzschild spacetime background. In particular several authors Moncrief (1974 Ann. Phys. 88 323), Sachs (1964 Relativity, Groups and Topology (New York: Gordon and Breach)) and Brizuela et al (2007 Phys. Rev. D 76 024004) have investigated gauge invariant quantities of the Regge–Wheeler (RW) formalism. Steven Detweiler also investigated perturbations of Schwarzschild in his own formalism, introducing his own gauge choice which he denoted the ‘easy (EZ) gauge’, and which he was in the process of adapting for use in the second-order self-force problem. We present here a compilation of some of his working results, arising from notes for which there seems to have been no manuscript in preparation. In particular, we outline Detweiler’s formalism, list the gauge invariant quantities he used, and explain the process by which he found them.}

abstract = {The theory of gauge-invariant non-spherical metric perturbations of Schwarzschild black-hole spacetimes is now well established. Yet, as different notations and conventions have been used throughout the years, the literature on the subject is often confusing and sometimes confused. The purpose of this review is to review and collect the relevant expressions related to the Regge–Wheeler and Zerilli equations for the odd and even-parity perturbations of a Schwarzschild spacetime. Special attention is paid to the form they assume in the presence of matter-sources and, for the two most popular conventions in the literature, to the asymptotic expressions and gravitational-wave amplitudes. Besides pointing out some inconsistencies in the literature, the expressions collected here could serve as a quick reference for the calculation of the perturbations of a Schwarzschild black-hole spacetime driven by generic sources and for those approaches in which gravitational waves are extracted from numerically generated spacetimes.}

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Quasinormal modes are eigenmodes of dissipative systems. Perturbations of classical gravitational backgrounds involving black holes or branes naturally lead to quasinormal modes. The analysis and classification of the quasinormal spectra require solving non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems for the associated linear differential equations. Within the recently developed gauge-gravity duality, these modes serve as an important tool for determining the near-equilibrium properties of strongly coupled quantum field theories, in particular their transport coefficients, such as viscosity, conductivity and diffusion constants. In astrophysics, the detection of quasinormal modes in gravitational wave experiments would allow precise measurements of the mass and spin of black holes as well as new tests of general relativity. This review is meant as an introduction to the subject, with a focus on the recent developments in the field.}

The main components of the ringing waveform are black hole quasi-normal modes. In this paper, we study the effects of the dark matter halos with three different density profiles on the gravitational polar (even-parity) perturbations of a supermassive black hole. For this purpose, we first consider modified Schwarzschild spacetime with three different dark matter profiles and derive the equation of motion of the polar perturbations of the supermassive black hole. It is shown that by ignoring the dark matter perturbations, a Zerilli-like master equation with a modified potential for the polar perturbation can be obtained explicitly. Then we calculate the complex frequencies of the quasi-normal modes of the supermassive black hole in the dark matter halos. The corresponding gravitational wave spectra with the effects of the dark matter halos and their detectability have also been discussed.}

The proposed method involves discretizing the master field equation and expressing it in the form of a homogeneous system of linear algebraic equations. The resulting homogeneous matrix equation furnishes a non-standard eigenvalue problem, which can then be solved numerically to obtain the quasinormal frequencies. A key feature of the present approach is that the discretization of the wave function and its derivatives is made to be independent of any specific metric through coordinate transformation. In many cases, it can be carried out beforehand, which in turn improves the efficiency and facilitates the numerical implementation. We also analyze the precision and efficiency of the present method as well as compare the results to those obtained by different approaches.}

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Recent studies based on the notion of black hole pseudospectrum indicated substantial instability of the fundamental and high-overtone quasinormal modes (QNMs). Besides its theoretical novelty, the details about the migration of the QNM spectrum due to specific perturbations may furnish valuable information on the properties of associated gravitational waves in a more realistic context. This work generalizes the matrix method for black hole QNMs to cope with a specific class of perturbations to the metric featured by discontinuity, which is known to be intimately connected with the QNM structural instability. In practice, the presence of discontinuity poses a difficulty so that many well-known approaches for QNMs cannot be straightforwardly applied. By comparing with other methods, we show that the modified matrix method is efficient, which can be used to solve for the low-lying modes with reasonable precision. Therefore, it might serve as an alternative gadget for relevant studies.}

    "abstract": "Supermassive black holes at the center of each galaxy may be surrounded by dark matter. Such dark matter admits a spike structure and vanishes at a certain distance from the black hole. This dark matter will impact the spacetime near the black hole and the related ringing gravitational waves can show distinguished features to the black hole without dark matter. In the present work, we calculate the quasi-normal modes who dominate the ringdown process of the perturbed black holes surrounded by dark matter spike. We find that the isospectrality for black holes with dark matter spike will break down. And more the relative ringing frequency difference between the black holes with and without dark matter can be as large as $10^{-2}$. These features can be used in future gravitational wave detection about extremal mass ratio inspiral systems to probe the existence of dark matter around supermassive black holes.",

    "abstract": "Conductivity reconstruction in an inverse eddy current problem is considered in the present paper. With the electric field measurement on part of domain boundary, we formulate the reconstruction problem to a constrained optimization problem with total variation regularization. Existence and stability are proved for the solution to the optimization problem. The finite element method is employed to discretize the optimization problem. The gradient Lipschitz properties of the objective functional are established for the the discrete optimization problems. We propose the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the discrete problem. Based on the the gradient Lipschitz property, we prove the convergence by extending the admissible set to the whole finite element space. Finally, we show some numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.",

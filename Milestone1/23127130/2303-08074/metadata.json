    "abstract": "We study the local properties of positive solutions of the equation $-Δu=u^p-m|\\nabla u|^q$ in a punctured domain $Ω\\setminus\\{0\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^N$ or in a exterior domain $\\mathbb{R}^N\\setminus B_{r_0}$ in the range $\\min\\{p,q\\}>1$ and $m>0$. We prove a series of a priori estimates depending $p$ and $q$, and of the sign of $q-\\frac {2p}{p+1}$ and $q-p$. Using various techniques we obtain removability results for singular sets and we give a precise description of behaviour of solutions near an isolated singularity or at infinity in $\\mathbb{R}^N$.",

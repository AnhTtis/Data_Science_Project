    "abstract": "We give an explicit graph formula, in terms of decorated boundary strata classes, for the wall-crossing of universal Brill-Noether classes. More precisely, fix $n>0$ and $d<g$ , and two stability conditions $φ^-, φ^+$ for degree~$d$ compactified universal (over $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$) Jacobians that lie on opposite sides of a stability hyperplane. Our main result is a formula for the difference between the Brill-Noether classes, compared via the pullback along the (rational) identity map $\\mathsf{Id} \\colon \\overline{\\mathcal{J}}^d_{g,n} (φ^+) \\dashrightarrow \\overline{\\mathcal{J}}^d_{g,n} (φ^-)$. The calculation involves constructing a resolution of the identity map by means of subsequent blow-ups.",

We first describe an unsupervised approach, which takes an input sentence and predicts itself in a contrastive objective, with only standard dropout used as noise. This simple method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised counterparts. We find that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation and removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we propose a supervised approach, which incorporates annotated pairs from natural language inference datasets into our contrastive learning framework, by using {``}entailment{''} pairs as positives and {``}contradiction{''} pairs as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and supervised models using BERT base achieve an average of 76.3{\%} and 81.6{\%} Spearman{'}s correlation respectively, a 4.2{\%} and 2.2{\%} improvement compared to previous best results. We also show{---}both theoretically and empirically{---}that contrastive learning objective regularizes pre-trained embeddings{'} anisotropic space to be more uniform, and it better aligns positive pairs when supervised signals are available.",

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by Sim-CLR achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1% of the labels, we achieve 85.8% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100\texttimes{} fewer labels.},

abstract = {Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BIGBIRD, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BIGBIRD is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BIGBIRD drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.},

yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as
significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative

characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch
between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model
music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical

Instead, it presents a single idea about representation that allows advances made by several different groups to be combined into an imaginary system called GLOM.1 The advances include transformers, neural fields, contrastive representation learning, distillation, and capsules. GLOM answers the question: How can a neural network with a fixed architecture parse an image into a part-whole hierarchy that has a different structure for each image? The idea is simply to use islands of identical vectors to represent the nodes in the parse tree. If GLOM can be made to work, it should significantly improve the interpretability of the representations produced by transformer-like systems when applied to vision or language.}",

ABSTRACT = {Dropout is one of the most popular regularization methods in the scholarly domain for preventing a neural network model from overfitting in the training phase. Developing an effective dropout regularization technique that complies with the model architecture is crucial in deep learning-related tasks because various neural network architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and they have exhibited reasonable performance in their specialized areas. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and novel review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in dropout regularization. We explain various dropout methods, from standard random dropout to AutoDrop dropout (from the original to the advanced), and also discuss their performance and experimental capabilities. This paper provides a summary of the latest research on various dropout regularization techniques for achieving improved performance through &ldquo;Internal Structure Changes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Data Augmentation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Input Information&rdquo;. We can see that proper regularization with respect to structural constraints of network architecture is a critical factor to facilitate overfitting avoidance. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the methods presented in this work, which can serve as valuable references for future research and the development of new approaches. We also pay attention to the scholarly domain in the discussion in order to meet the overwhelming increase of scientific research outcomes by providing an analysis of several important academic scholarly issues of neural networks.},

We present a new approach that combines sequential, structural and chemical information into one graph model of proteins. We predict functional class membership of enzymes and non-enzymes using graph kernels and support vector machine classification on these protein graphs.Results: Our graph model, derivable from protein sequence and structure only, is competitive with vector models that require additional protein information, such as the size of surface pockets. If we include this extra information into our graph model, our classifier yields significantly higher accuracy levels than the vector models. Hyperkernels allow us to select and to optimally combine the most relevant node attributes in our protein graphs. We have laid the foundation for a protein function prediction system that integrates protein information from various sources efficiently and effectively.Availability: More information available via www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Mitarbeiter/borgwardt.html.Contact:  borgwardt@dbs.ifi.lmu.de}",

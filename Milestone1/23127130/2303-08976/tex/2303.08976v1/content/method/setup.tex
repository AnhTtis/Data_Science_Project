\subsection{Benchmarks, Hardware and Runtime Environment}
We ran our benchmarks on four different systems with four different Nvidia GPUs.
These GPUs include the RTX 2080Ti, RTX 3060, RTX 3090 and RTX Titan. For the Pnpoly, Nbody, GEMM and Convolution benchmarks we performed an exhaustive search of the entire search space. For the Hotspot, Dedisp and Expdist benchmarks our results are based on 10 000 random configurations from the search space for each architecture. 
%Our RTX 2080Ti system RTX 3060, RTX 3090 and RTX Titan.

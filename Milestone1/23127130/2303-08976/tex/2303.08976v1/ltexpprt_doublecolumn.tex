%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING STYLE RESTRICTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  1. There are no new tags.  Existing LaTeX tags have been formatted to match

%%
%%  2. Do not change the margins or page size!  Do not change from the default
%%     text font!
%%
%%  3. You must use \cite in the text to mark your reference citations and
%%     \bibitem in the listing of references at the end of your chapter. See
%%     the examples in the following file. If you are using BibTeX, please
%%     supply the bst file with the manuscript file.
%%
%%  4. This macro is set up for two levels of headings (\section and

%%
%%  5. No running heads are to be used for this volume.
%%
%%  6. Theorems, Lemmas, Definitions, Equations, etc. are to be double numbered,
%%     indicating the section and the occurrence of that element
%%     within that section. (For example, the first theorem in the second
%%     section would be numbered 2.1. The macro will
%%     automatically do the numbering for you.
%%
%%  7. Figures and Tables must be single-numbered.
%%     Use existing LaTeX tags for these elements.
%%     Numbering will be done automatically.

\begin{abstract}

Peak performance metrics published by vendors often do not  correspond to what can be achieved in practice. It is therefore of great interest to do extensive benchmarking on core applications and library routines. Since DGEMM is one of the most used in compute-intensive numerical codes, it is typically highly vendor optimized and of great interest for empirical benchmarks.

In this paper we show how to build a novel tool that autotunes the benchmarking process for the Roofline model. Our novel approach can efficiently and reliably find optimal configurations for any target hardware. Results of our tool on a range of hardware architectures and comparisons to theoretical peak performance are included.

Our tool autotunes the benchmarks for the target architecture by deciding the optimal parameters through state space reductions and exhaustive search. Our core idea includes calculating the confidence interval using the variance and mean and comparing it against the current optimum solution. We can then terminate the evaluation process early if the confidence interval’s  maximum  is  lower  than  the  current  optimum solution. This dynamic approach yields a search time improvement of up to 116.33x for the DGEMM benchmarking process compared to a traditional fixed sample-size methodology. Our tool produces the same benchmarking result with an error of less than 2\% for each of the optimization techniques we apply, while providing a great reduction in search time. We compare these results against hand-tuned benchmarking parameters. Results from the memory-intensive TRIAD benchmark, and some ideas for future directions are also included.

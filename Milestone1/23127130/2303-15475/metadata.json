    "abstract": "The multimode Brownian oscillator model is employed to simulate the emission spectra of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. Good agreement is obtained between measured and simulated photoluminescence spectra of WSe2, WS2, MoSe2 and MoS2 at various temperatures. The Huang-Rhys factor extracted from the model can be associated with that from the modified semi-empirical Varshni equation at high temperatures. Individual mechanisms leading to the unique temperature-dependent emission spectra of those TMDs are validated by the MBO fitting, while it is in turn confirmed that the MBO analysis is an effective method for studying the optical properties of TMD monolayers. Parameters extractd from the MBO fitting can be used to explore exciton-photon-phonon dynamics of TMDs in a more comprehensive model.",

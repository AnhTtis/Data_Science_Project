    "abstract": "We extend the single-fluid solvability conditions to include plasma systems at arbitrary $β$ with arbitrary flows and external forcing terms. This treatment includes both the isotropic and the anisotropic cases. The generalized conditions that result can be used to generate certain classes of single-fluid equilibria.",

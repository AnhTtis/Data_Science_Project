    "abstract": "We derive sufficient conditions for theories consisting of multiple vector fields, which could also couple to external fields, to be multi-field generalised Proca theories. We derive the conditions by demanding that the theories have the required structure of constraints, giving the correct number of degrees of freedom. The Faddeev-Jackiw constraint analysis is used and is cross-checked by Lagrangian constraint analysis. To ensure the theory is constraint, we impose a special case of Hessian condition where time-time and time-space components of the Hessian matrix vanishes. The derivation is benefitted from the realisation that the theories are diffeomorphism invariance (or, in the case of flat spacetime, invariant under Lorentz isometry). The sufficient conditions obtained include a refinement of secondary-constraint enforcing relations derived previously in literature, as well as a condition which ensures that the iteration process of constraint analysis terminates. Some examples of theories satisfying, or not satisfying, the sufficient conditions are provided. Most notably, due to the obtained refinement on some of the conditions, some theories which are previously interpreted as being undesirable are in fact legitimate, and vice versa.",

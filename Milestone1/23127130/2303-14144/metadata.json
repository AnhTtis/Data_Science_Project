    "abstract": "We study $6$-transposition groups, i.e. groups generated by a normal set of involutions $D$, such that the order of the product of any two elements from $D$ does not exceed $6$. We classify most of the groups generated by $3$ elements from $D$, two of which commute, and prove they are finite.",

    "abstract": "High-repetition-rate plasma-induced shockwaves in liquid have been observed using ultrafast X-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI) for the first time. Using a laser-triggered nanosecond-pulsed plasma device in heptane at ambient conditions, it is demonstrated that these well-timed weak shocks can be generated at an unprecedented repetition rate (>3 per minute), significantly faster than that of more commonly-used dynamic targets (exploding wire, gas gun). This simple portable target can easily be adapted to study discharges in different media (water, oils, solids) at comparably high repetition rates and over a wide range of possible input energies. Compared to previously PCI-imaged shocks, these shocks are relatively weak (1 < Mach number < 1.4), which advances the resolution and sensitivity limits of this high-speed imaging diagnostic. Numeric solutions of a Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction model are used to estimate post-shock thermodynamic conditions, the results of which show good agreement with expectations based on Rankine-Hugoniot normal shock thermodynamic relations.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the time-dependent ghost Gutzwiller approximation (td-gGA), a non-equilibrium extension of the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (gGA), a powerful variational approach which systematically improves on the standard Gutzwiller method by including auxiliary degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the effectiveness of td-gGA by studying the quench dynamics of the single-band Hubbard model as a function of the number of auxiliary parameters. Our results show that td-gGA captures the relaxation of local observables, in contrast with the time-dependent Gutzwiller method. This systematic and qualitative improvement leads to an accuracy comparable with time-dependent Dynamical Mean-Field Theory which comes at a much lower computational cost. These findings suggest that td-gGA has the potential to enable extensive and accurate theoretical investigations of multi-orbital correlated electron systems in nonequilibrium situations, with potential applications in the field of quantum control, Mott solar cells, and other areas where an accurate account of the non-equilibrium properties of strongly interacting quantum systems is required.",

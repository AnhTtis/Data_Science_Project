    "abstract": "Enhanced tensor field theories (eTFT) have dominant graphs that do not correspond to melonic diagrams of ordinary tensor field theories. They therefore describe pertinent candidates to escape the so-called branched polymer phase, the universal geometry found for tensor models. For generic rank $d$ of the tensor field, we compute the perturbative $β$-functions at one-loop of two just-renormalizable quartic eTFT coined by $+$ or $\\times$, depending on their vertex weights. The models $+$ has two quartic coupling constants $(λ, λ_{+})$, and two 2-point couplings (mass, $Z_a$). Meanwhile, the model $\\times$ has two quartic coupling constants $(λ, λ_{\\times})$ and three 2-point couplings (mass, $Z_a$, $Z_{2a}$). At all orders, both models have a constant wave function renormalization: $Z=1$ and therefore no anomalous dimension. Despite such peculiar behavior, both models acquire nontrivial radiative corrections for the coupling constants. The RG flow of the model $+$ exhibits neither asymptotic freedom nor the ordinary Landau ghost of $φ^4_4$ model: $λ_{+}$ is a fixed point and $λ$ has linear behavior in time scale $t = \\log(k/k_0)$. In the UV, the mass behaves likewise namely is linear in $t$, whereas $Z_a$ decreases exponentially towards a constant value. For the model $\\times$, both $λ$ and $λ_{\\times}$ do not flow, all remaining 2-point coupling constants are linear functions of the time scale in the UV.",

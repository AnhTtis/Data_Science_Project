    "abstract": "The first multiband photometric solutions of the short-period V Gru eclipsing binary from the southern hemisphere is presented in this study. Light curves of the system were observed through BVI filters at the Congarinni Observatory in Australia for 15 nights. In addition to the new ground-based data, we also used the TESS observations in two sectors. We analyzed the light curves of the system using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) 2.4.7 version code to achieve the best accordance with the photometric observations. The solutions suggest that V Gru is a near-contact binary system with q=1.302(81) mass ratio, f1=0.010(23), f2=-0.0.009(21), and i=73.45(38). We considered the two hot spots on the hotter and cooler components for the light curve analysis. We extracted the minima times from the light curves based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. Using our new light curves, TESS, and additional literature minima, we computed the ephemeris of V Gru. The system's eclipse timing variation trend was determined using the MCMC method. This system is a good and challenging case for future studies.",

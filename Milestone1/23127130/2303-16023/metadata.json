    "abstract": "We use Jiang--Pareschi's cohomological rank functions and techniques developed by Caucci and Ito to study syzygies of projective bundles on abelian varieties. Consequently, we generalize and refine Chiantipalli's results regarding property $N_p$ of projective bundles over abelian varieties.",

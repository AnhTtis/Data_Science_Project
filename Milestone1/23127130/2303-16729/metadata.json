    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we characterize the existence of binary self-orthogonal codes meeting the Griesmer bound by employing Solomon-Stiffler codes and some related residual codes. Second, using such a characterization, we determine the exact value of $d_{so}(n,7)$ except for five special cases and the exact value of $d_{so}(n,8)$ except for 41 special cases, where $d_{so}(n,k)$ denotes the largest minimum distance among all binary self-orthogonal $[n, k]$ codes. Currently, the exact value of $d_{so}(n,k)$ $(k \\le 6)$ was determined by Shi et al. (2022). In addition, we develop a general method to prove the nonexistence of some binary self-orthogonal codes by considering the residual code of a binary self-orthogonal code.",

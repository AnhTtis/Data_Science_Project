    "abstract": "The paper introduces an interactive machine learning mechanism to process the measurements of an uncertain, nonlinear dynamic process and hence advise an actuation strategy in real-time. For concept demonstration, a trajectory-following optimization problem of a Kinova robotic arm is solved using an integral reinforcement learning approach with guaranteed stability for slowly varying dynamics. The solution is implemented using a model-free value iteration process to solve the integral temporal difference equations of the problem. The performance of the proposed technique is benchmarked against that of another model-free high-order approach and is validated for dynamic payload and disturbances. Unlike its benchmark, the proposed adaptive strategy is capable of handling extreme process variations. This is experimentally demonstrated by introducing static and time-varying payloads close to the rated maximum payload capacity of the manipulator arm. The comparison algorithm exhibited up to a seven-fold percent overshoot compared to the proposed integral reinforcement learning solution. The robustness of the algorithm is further validated by disturbing the real-time adapted strategy gains with a white noise of a standard deviation as high as 5%.",

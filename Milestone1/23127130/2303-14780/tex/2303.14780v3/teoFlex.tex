\section{Proof of theorem \ref{teoFlex}}\label{secTeoFlex}

In this section, we shall prove theorem \ref{teoFlex}. For $o=[n]$, the result holds because for any translation in the plane, the compactification  $f$  verifies $o(f)=[n]$. For this type of maps, all the mutually singular sets consist of a single set and by theorem \ref{TeoCod}, we conclude the existence of a map such that $o(f)=[n]$. 

Now, we are only interested in the case $[n^2]\leq o \leq \sup(\Pol)$. First, we are going to prove the result for the particular case $o\in \L$, and then, adapt to obtain the general result ($o\in\CL$).


\subsection{Construction of the map}

We are going to recall the construction done in \cite{HaRo19} that will provide us a homeomorphism $f:S^2\to S^2$. Let us fix $[a(n)]\in \L$ such that $[n^2]< [a(n)]< \sup(\Pol)$. For said  $[a(n)]$, there must exist $L\geq 3$ such that $[a(n)]\leq [n^L]$. From now on, $L$ is going to be fixed. 

Let us consider $P_1,\cdots, P_{L+2}$ copies of the plane $\R^2$. For each $P_i$ we denote $O_i=\{(x,y)\in P_i: y>0\}$ the upper half plane. For each $i=1,\cdots, L+1$ we are going to select maps $\varphi_i:(0,\infty)\to \R$ and with them, define $\Phi_i:O_i\to O_{i+1}$ by
$\Phi_i(x,y)=(x+\varphi_i(y),y)$.

The first property we want for $\varphi_i$ is the limit in $0$ be $-\infty$. Now, we define $\sim$ the equivalence relation in $\cup P_i$ generated by $(x,y)\sim \Phi_i(x,y)$ if $(x,y)\in O_i$. The quotient space $P=\cup P_i/\sim$  is a Hausdorff simply connected non-compact surface, and thus is homeomorphic to the plane. Figure \ref{imgPlaneP} represents the quotient space $P$.  


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\input{figPlaneP}
\caption{Gluing of the plane $P$ for $L=3$.} \label{imgPlaneP}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}


Let $T:\cup P_i\to \cup P_i$ be defined as the translation $T(x,y)=(x+1,y)$ on each $P_i$.  The map $T$ commutes with each $\Phi_i$ and therefore it defines $F:P\to P$ as an orientation preserving homeomorphism on the plane without fixed points. The map $F$ induces a homeomorphism $f$ in the compactification of the plane $\R^2\cup \{\infty\}= S^2$, which verifies $\Omega(f)=\{\infty\}$. In particular, we can apply theorem  \ref{TeoCod} to compute its generalized entropy. Figure \ref{imgMapf} represents the dynamics of $f$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\input{figMapf}
\caption{ Dynamics of $f$ for $L=3$.} \label{imgMapf}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

To compute $o(f)$, we need first to understand the location of the mutually singular sets. Let us call $\pi:\cup P_i\to P$ the projection and for each $i$, define $Y_i=\pi([-1/3,1/3]\times [0,1])$ with $[-1/3,1/3]\times [0,1]\subset P_i$. For the map constructed $f$, the family of sets $\{Y_1,\cdots, Y_{L+2}\}$ is mutually singular. Moreover, any other family of mutually singular sets, up to iteration of its elements with a diameter small enough, is equivalent to this one.  Figure \ref{imgMutSingLoc} represents the location of the sets $Y_i$.


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\input{figMutSingLoc}
\caption{ Locations of sets $Y_i$ for $L=3$.} \label{imgMutSingLoc}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}



 The key observation to be made is that for a point $(x,y)\in P_i$ such that its projection $\pi(x,y)\in Y_i$ needs for $-\varphi_i(y)>0$ iterates to reach $Y_{i+1}$. This means, that with the height $y$, we can control the amount of time the point $\pi(x,y)\in Y_1$ is going to need to reach each one of the sets $Y_i$.   


\subsection{Proof of the theorem for the particular case} \label{secPartCase}

Up to this point, we have followed the construction done \cite{HaRo19}. Our next step will be to modify the choice of the maps $\f_i$  done in \cite{HaRo19} such that $[c_{f,\F}(n)]=[a(n)]$.

Let us construct $\varphi_i$ by steps. We shall chose $\f_1$ such that it is negative, increasing, and, for each positive integer $k_1$, assumes the value $-k_1$ on a non trivial interval $I_{k_1}$. This collection of intervals tends to $0$ when $k_1$ tends to $+\infty$. For convenience, we assume that all these intervals are included in the interval $\left. (0, 1 \right]$. The number $k_1$ is going to be our main variable, and we would like to stress that any point of the form $\pi(x,y)\in Y_1$ with $y\in I_{k_1}$ is going to need $k_1$ iterates of $f$ to reach $Y_2$.

Now we look at $k_1$ iterations of the points in the previous step that are in $Y_2$. These points do have the same height $y$ when looked in $P_2$.  The restriction of $\f_2$ to $I_{k_1}$ tell us how many iterates are needed for these points in $Y_2$ to reach $Y_3$. We are going to ask that $\f_2$ restricted to $I_{k_1}$ is continuous, increasing and varies from $-(k_1+a_2(k_1))$ to $-k_1$ (we postpone for later the choice of the integer $0< a_2(k_1)\leq k_1$). Moreover, we need that for each integer $-k_2$ in the interval  $[-(k_1+ a_2(k_1)),-k_1]$, $\f_2$ assumes the value $-k_2$ on a non trivial sub-interval $I_{k_1,k_2}\subset I_{k_1}$.  Now, any point with height in  $I_{k_1,k_2}$ is going to need $k_1$ iterations to go from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$ and $k_2$ iterations to go from $Y_2$ to $Y_3$. We would like to observe that for fixed $k_1$, there are $a_2(k_1)$ possible iterations needed to reach from $Y_2$ to $Y_3$. Finally, we would like remark that we chose the interval $[-(k_1+ a_2(k_1)),-k_1]$ instead of $[-a_2(k_1),0]$ because we also need that the limit of $\f_2$ in $0$ be $-\infty$.  

Likewise, we define $\f_3$ to be increasing on each interval $I_{k_1,k_2}$ and assume each integer $-k_3$ between $-(3k_1-k_2+a_3(k_1))$ and $-(3k_1-k_2)$ on a non trivial sub-interval $I_{k_1,k_2,k_3}$ of $I_{k_1,k_2}$. To explain why we choose the interval like this, first observe that $2k_1 \leq k_1+ k_2 \leq 3k_1$. By the choice of the interval, if $0< a_3(k_1)\leq k_1$, then,
\[4k_1 \leq k_1+k_2+k_3 \leq 5k_1.\]
This gives us the following control: A point in $Y_1$ with height in $I_{k_1}$ is going to reach $Y_2$ in $k_1$ iterates, reach $Y_3$ in between $2k_1$ to $3k_1$ iterates and $Y_4$ in between $4k_1$ to $5k_1$ iterates. Similar to the previous step, for $k_1$ fixed, there are $a_3(k_1)$ possible iterations needed to reach from $Y_3$ to $Y_4$. 
	
We define $\f_i$ inductively until $\f_{L+1}$. The map $\f_{i+1}$ is chosen such that for $k_1, \cdots, k_i$ fixed, it assumes each integer value $-k_{i+1}$ in a sub-interval $I_{k_1,\cdots,k_{i+1}}$ of $I_{k_1,\cdots,k_{i}}$. The value of $-k_{i+1}$ ranges in an interval of length $a_{i+1}(k_1)\leq k_1$ and such that 
\[2ik_1\leq k_1+\cdots + k_{i+1}\leq (2i+1)k_1.\]
For $i+1=L+1$, we see
\[2Lk_1 \leq  k_1+\cdots + k_{L+1} \leq (2L+1)k_1.\]


Let us finally address the choice of $a_i(n)$. We choose them such that
\[\left[n \sum_{k_1=1}^{n} a_2(k_1)\cdots a_{L+1}(k_1) \right]  =[a(n)].\]

\begin{lemma}
Given $[a(n)]\in \B$ such that $[n^2]< [a(n)] \leq [n^L]$ there exist sequences $a_2(n),$ $\cdots,$ $a_{L+1}(n)$ such that 
\[\left[n \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_2(k)\cdots a_{L+1}(k) \right]  =[a(n)],\]
and $a_i(n)\leq n$ for all $i=2,\cdots, L+1$ and all $n\geq 1$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us call $d(n)=  n \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_2(k)\cdots a_{L+1}(k)$ and $e(n)=a_2(n)\cdots a_{L+1}(n)$. Consider two constants $c_1\geq 2$ and $c_2>0$ such that $\frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)}\leq c_1$ and $a(n)\leq c_2 n^L$, for all $n\geq 0$. 

We suppose that we have picked our sequences up to $n$ verifying  $b_1 a(n)\leq d(n) \leq b_2 a(n)$, for some $b_1<b_2$.  
For the next step, we choose $e(n+1)$ such that $b_1 a(n+1)\leq d(n+1) \leq b_2 a(n+1)$. 

If $d(n+1)$ verifies $\frac{d(n+1)}{d(n)}= \frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)}$, then 
\[b_1 a(n+1) = b_1a(n) \frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)}\leq  d(n) \frac{d(n+1)}{d(n)} \leq  b_2a(n) \frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)}  = b_2 a(n+1).\]
This implies the desired property for $d(n+1)$. We need to see that this pick is compatible with our restriction $a_i(n)\leq n$ for all $i$ and all $n$. Once we observe that
\[\frac{d(n+1)}{d(n)} = \frac{n+1}{n} + e(n+1) \frac{n+1}{d(n)},\]
we infer that we need to define $e(n+1)$ by
\[e(n+1)= \left( \frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)} - \frac{n+1}{n}\right) \frac{d(n)}{n+1}.\]
Yet, 
\[ \left( \frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)} - \frac{n+1}{n}\right) \frac{d(n)}{n+1}\leq (C-2)b_2 c_2 \frac{n^L}{n+1}\leq (n+1)^{L},\]
for $n$ large enough. Since we have $L$ sequences $a_i$, we can pick $e(n+1)$ satisfying all the above.  

\end{proof}


Our task now is to compute $[c_{f,\F}(n)]$. 

Consider a word $w \in \A_{n}(f,\F)$ and $x\in S^2$ a point such that $w$ is the coding of the itinerary of $x$. We call the displacement of $w$, $k$ units to the right, to the word of length $n$ that codes the itinerary of $f^{-k}(x)$. The displacement of $w$, $k$ units to the left, is the word of length $n$ that codes the itinerary of $f^{k}(x)$.

Consider the syndetic set $\S=(2L+2)\N$. In light of lemma \ref{LemSyn}, if we prove that  $d_1 a(n) \leq c_{f,\F}(n) \leq d_2 a(n)$ for $n\in S$, then $[c_{f,\F}(n)]=[a(n)]$.

Let us consider $ b_2>b_1 >0$ such that 
\[b_1 a(n) \leq n \sum_{k_1=1}^{n} a_2(k_1)\cdots a_{L-1}(k_1)  \leq b_2 a(n)\ \forall n\in \N.\]
By linear invariance of $[a(n)]$ there exists $c_2> c_1>0$ such that
\[ c_1 a(k(2L+2)) \leq a(k) \leq c_2 a(k(2L+2))\ \forall k\in \N.\]

We now fix some $n\in \S$ and define $k\in \N$ such that $n=k(2L+2)$. If a word in $\A_{n}(f,\F)$ begins with $Y_1$ and is associated to $k_1\leq k$, then all the symbols $Y_2,\cdots, Y_{L+2}$ appear in $w$. By our construction, there are  $a_2(k_1)\cdots a_{L+1}(k_1)$ of those. Each one of this words can be displaced at least $k$ to the right creating new unique words in $\A_{n}(f,\F)$. This is true because all symbols $Y_i$ appear before $(2L+1)k_1 \leq (2L+1)k$. From this, we infer that in $\A_n(f,\F)$ there are at least  $k \sum_{k_1=1}^k  a_2(k_1)\cdots a_{L+1}(k_1)$ distinct words. Then,
\[c_{f,\F}(n)\geq k \sum_{k_1=1}^k  a_2(k_1)\cdots a_{L+1}(k_1)\geq b_1 a(k)\geq b_1 c_1 a(n).\]

On the other hand, every word in $\A_n(f,\F)$ is obtained from displacing a word that starts with $Y_1$. We can displace up to $n$  spaces  to the right or $(2L+2)n$ to the left. We only need to count up to $k_1 =n$ and therefore,    
\[c_{f,\F}(n)\leq (2L+3)n \sum_{k_1=1}^n  a_2(k_1)\cdots a_{L+1}(k_1)\leq (2L+3) c_2 a(n).\]
In conclusion, if $d_1= b_1c_1$ and $d_2=(2L+3)c_2$, we have proved that
\[d_1 a(n) \leq c_{f,\F}(n) \leq d_2 a(n)\ \forall n\in \S.\]
Thus, 
\[ [c_{f,\F}(n)]=[a(n)]\]
and with this, we have finished the proof of theorem \ref{teoFlex} for the case $o=[a(n)]\in \L$.



\subsection{Lemmas of orders of growth}

To prove the general case of theorem \ref{teoFlex}, the following lemma will simplify our reasoning. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lemSupOrd}
	Let $\Gamma\subset \mathbb{O}$ a countable subset of orders of growth, then there exists a countable and ordered subset $\hat \Gamma\subset \mathbb{O}$ such that $\sup (A) = \sup (B)$. Moreover, if $\Gamma\subset \B$ or $\Gamma\subset \L$, then so does $\hat\Gamma$. 
\end{lemma}

In order to prove lemma \ref{lemSupOrd}, the following is necessary. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lemSup}
Suppose that  $[a(n)],[b(n)] \in \OG$. Then:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item $\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\}=[\max\{a(n),b(n)\}]$.
\item If  $[a(n)],[b(n)] \in \B$ or  $[a(n)],[b(n)] \in \L$, so does $\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	(1) We know that $[a(n)]\leq [\max\{a(n),b(n)\}] $ and $[b(n)]\leq [\max\{a(n),b(n)\}]$, then $\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\}\leq [\max\{a(n),b(n)\}]$. But, if we suppose $$\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\}< [\max\{a(n),b(n)\}],$$ then there exists $[c(n)]\in \OG$ such that $$\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\}<[c(n)]< [\max\{a(n),b(n)\}].$$ 
By definition, we know  $[a(n)]\leq\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\},$ and then $[a(n)]\leq [c(n)]$. Analogously, $[b(n)]\leq [c(n)]$. Thus, there must exist constants $d_1,d_2>0$ such that $a(n)\leq d_1 c(n)$ and $b(n)\leq d_2 c(n)$. Let $d=\max\{d_1,d_2\}$ and observe $\max\{a(n),b(n)\}\leq dc(n)$, which implies $[\max\{a(n),b(n)\}]\leq [c(n)]$, a contradiction. Therefore, $$\sup\{[a(n)],[b(n)]\}=[\max\{a(n),b(n)\}],$$ as we wanted.

$(2)$ For elements in $\B$ is an immediate conclusion from part (1) of this lemma. For elements in $\L$, it is necessary to use point $(2)$ of proposition \ref{propLIPProp}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of lemma \ref{lemSupOrd}]
	Let $\Gamma=\{[b_1(n)],[b_2(n)],\cdots,[b_k(n)],\cdots\}\subset \mathbb{O}$, we construct the subset $\hat \Gamma$ as follows: 
$$\begin{array}{ccl}
[a_1(n)]&=&[b_1(n)], \\ 

[a_2(n)]&=&\sup\{[b_1(n)],[b_2(n)]\}=[\max\{b_1(n),b_2(n)\}], \\ 

[a_3(n)]&=&\sup\{[a_1(n)],[b_3(n)]\}=\sup\{\sup\{[b_1(n)],[b_2(n)]\},[b_3(n)]\}\\ 

 &=&\sup\{[b_1(n)],[b_2(n)],[b_3(n)]\} =[\max\{b_1(n),b_2(n),b_3(n)\}], \\
 
\vdots & & \\

[a_k(n)]&=&\sup\{[a_{k-1}(n)],[b_{k}(n)]\}=\cdots = [\max\{b_1(n),b_2(n),\cdots, b_{k}(n)\}], \\

\vdots
\end{array}$$
The previous identities hold by lemma \ref{lemSup} and an inductive argument. $A$ is clearly a countable set, and it is easy to see that it is an ordered set, in fact
$$\begin{array}{rcl} [a_1(n)]&=&\sup\{[b_1(n)],[b_2(n)]\}\leq\sup\{[b_1(n)],[b_2(n)],[b_3(n)]\}\\
&=&[a_2(n)]\leq \cdots\leq  [a_k(n)] \leq [a_{k+1}(n)] \leq \cdots .
\end{array}$$
If $\Gamma\subset \B$ or $\Gamma\subset \L$, by the second item of $\ref{lemSup}$, so does $\hat \Gamma$. 	
	
We shall prove now that $\sup (\hat \Gamma)= \sup (\Gamma)$. Since $\sup (\hat \Gamma) \geq [a_k(n)]\geq [b_k(n)]$, we deduce $\sup (\hat \Gamma) \geq \sup (\hat \Gamma)$. On the other hand, $\sup (\Gamma) \geq [b_k(n)]$, for all $k\in \N$, and by definition of $[a_k(n)]$, we infer $\sup (\Gamma)\geq [a_k(n)]$ for all $k\in \N$. Therefore, $\sup (\Gamma)\leq \sup (\hat \Gamma)$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Proof of the general case}

Let us consider $\Gamma \subset \L$ countable such that $[n^2]\leq o=\sup(\Gamma)\leq \sup(\Pol)$. We want to construct $f$ such that $o(f)=o$. 

By lemma \ref{lemSupOrd}, we might suppose that $\Gamma$ is ordered. Moreover, if $\Gamma=\{[a_k(n)]:k\in \N\}$, we may also assume that $[a_1(n)]\geq [n^2]$.

We first construct $f_1\in \H$ such that $o(f_1)=[a_1(n)]$ using the technique of subsection \ref{secPartCase}. We shall call $\infty$ to the only fixed point of $f_1$ and $D_1$ as the disk associated to the lower semi-plane in $P_1$. We also call $S_1$ to the closure of its complement. The dynamics constructed in subsection \ref{secPartCase} lay entirely in the region $S_1$. Therefore, $o(f_{1|S_1})=[a_1(n)]$. 


\begin{figure}[!h]\label{disf2}
\begin{center}
\input{figf2.tex}
\caption{$f_2:S^2 \rightarrow S^2$.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


We now define $f_2\in \H$ such that $f_{2|S_1}=f_{1|S_1}$ and $f_{2|D_1}$ verifies $o( f_{2|D_1})=[a_2(n)]$. The construction is made in an analogous way by adding new planes $P^2_i$ and using the lower semi-plane of $P_1$. Figure \ref{disf2} represents the construction of $f_2$. 



We choose one of the new planes and call $D_2$ to the region associated to its lower half-plane. We call $S_2$ to the closure of the complement of $D_2$ and observe that dynamics created so far lay entirely in $S_2$. In particular, 
\[o(f_{2|S_2})=o(f_2)=\sup\{o(f_{2|S_1}), o(f_{2|D_1})\}=\sup \{[a_1(n)],[a_2(n)]\}= [a_2(n)].\]

Inductively, we define a family of regions  $D_k$ and $S_k=\overline{D_k^c}$ where $D_k$ is a disk, contains $\infty$ in its border, $D_{k+1}\subset D_k$, and we may also ask that $diam(D_k)\to 0$. By induction, we also have a family of maps $f_k\in \H$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $f_k(S_i)=S_i$ for all $i\leq k$. 
\item  $f_{k+1|S_k}= f_{k|S_k}$.
\item  $o(f_k)= o(f_{k|S_k})=[a_k(n)]$. 
\end{itemize}

This family of dynamical systems in $\H$ define a unique map $f\in \H$ with $f(x)=f_k(x)$ if $x\in S_k$.

Let us check if $o(f)=\sup(\Gamma)$. We first observe that
\[o(f)\geq o(f_{|S_k})= o(f_{k|S_k})=[a_k(n)], \]
thus, $o(f)\geq\sup (\Gamma)$. To see the other inequality, we chose $\e>0$ and $k$ such that $diam(D_k)\leq \e/2$. Since $f(D_k)= D_k$, for any $x_k\in D_k$, the dynamical ball $B(x_k,n,\e)$ contains $D_k$ for every $n$. If $G_n$ is an $(n,\e)$ generator set of $f_{|S_k}$ with 
$g_{f_{|S_k},\e}(n) =   \#G_n$, then $G_n\cup \{x_k\}$ is an $(n,\e)$-generator set of $f$. Therefore, 
$g_{f,\e}(n)\leq g_{f_{|S_k},\e}(n) +1 $ and then 
\[ [g_{f,\e}(n)]\leq [g_{f_{|S_k},\e}(n)]\leq o(f_{|S_k} ) = [a_k(n)]\leq \sup (\Gamma).\]
From this, we conclude  that $o(f)\leq \sup (\Gamma)$. This proves $o(f)=\sup (\Gamma)$ and finishes the proof of theorem \ref{teoFlex}.

    "abstract": "In a series of papers, published in Mathematische Annalen, Bianchi and Blumenthal introduced the notions of Bianchi orbifolds and Hilbert-Blumnethal surfaces as generalizations of modular curves associated to quadratic fields. In this paper, in the same spirit, and following a similar line of reasoning, we introduce the concept of Bianchi and Hilbert-Blumenthal quaternionic orbifolds as generalizations of the Lipschitz and Hurwitz quaternionic modular orbifolds defined recently by Díaz, Vlacci and the first author. In particular, we describe the cusp cross-sections of the Hilbert-Blumenthal quaternionic orbifolds in terms of fundamental units of real quadratic fields. These are 7-dimensional solvmanifolds which are virtual ${\\mathbb T}^6$ bundles over the circle with monodromy a linear Anosov diffeomorphism of the 6-torus.",

\Large \textbf{Appendix}
\end{center}
This appendix is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Appendix~\ref{Appendix_A} provides a detailed definition and assumptions concerning the Exponential family, which were omitted from the main text for clarity. It also introduces the notion of F-suitability of an estimator and includes an in-depth discussion and proof of Proposition~\ref{consistency_proposition}.
    \item Appendix~\ref{Appendix_simulations} presents additional experiments and elaborates on certain implementation details.
    \item Appendix~\ref{SectionProofs} contains all theoretical results along with their corresponding proofs.
\end{itemize}

    "abstract": "Nowadays, various memory-hungry applications like machine learning algorithms are knocking \"the memory wall\". Toward this, emerging memories featuring computational capacity are foreseen as a promising solution that performs data process inside the memory itself, so-called computation-in-memory, while eliminating the need for costly data movement. Recent research shows that utilizing the custom extension of RISC-V instruction set architecture to support computation-in-memory operations is effective. To evaluate the applicability of such methods further, this work enhances the standard GNU binary utilities to generate RISC-V executables with Logic-in-Memory (LiM) operations and develop a new gem5 simulation environment, which simulates the entire system (CPU, peripherals, etc.) in a cycle-accurate manner together with a user-defined LiM module integrated into the system. This work provides a modular testbed for the research community to evaluate potential LiM solutions and co-designs between hardware and software.",

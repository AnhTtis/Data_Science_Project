    "abstract": "In this survey article, a variety of systems modeling tumor growth are discussed. In accordance with the hallmarks of cancer, the described models incorporate the primary characteristics of cancer evolution. Specifically, we focus on diffusive interface models and follow the phase-field approach that describes the tumor as a collection of cells. Such systems are based on a multiphase approach that employs constitutive laws and balance laws for individual constituents. In mathematical oncology, numerous biological phenomena are involved, including temporal and spatial nonlocal effects, complex nonlinearities, stochasticity, and mixed-dimensional couplings. Using the models, for instance, we can express angiogenesis and cell-to-matrix adhesion effects. Finally, we offer some methods for numerically approximating the models and show simulations of the tumor's evolution in response to various biological effects.",

\caption{Comparison between different 3D-aware GANs on image generation quality and multiview 3D consistency. The image generation quality is evaluated via FID between generated and real images. The 3D consistency is measured by conducting 3D reconstruction~\cite{wang2021neus} on generated multiview images and calculating PSNR between them and the re-rendered reconstruction results. Our method inherits the high image quality of approaches leveraging 2D super-resolution meanwhile maintains strict 3D consistency taking the advantage of direct 3D rendering. 
% The shape of triangles and circles distinguish methods with or without the 2D super-resolution module.

\caption{Overview of our framework. 3D-to-2D imitation strategy is enforced to let the generator's 3D branch to mimic the results of its 2D branch, thus leading to image generation of high quality and strict 3D consistency. 3D-aware convolutions are also introduced to the tri-plane generator to enhance 3D representation learning, which further improves the image generation quality.}

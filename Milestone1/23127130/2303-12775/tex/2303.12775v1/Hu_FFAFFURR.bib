Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals $\sigma$'s and },

@article{Sakharov2005,
abstract = {Nearly half of all proteins contain metal ions, which perform a wide variety of specific functions associated with life processes. However, insights into the local/global, structural and dynamical fluctuations in metalloproteins from molecular dynamics simulations have been hampered by the "conventional" potential energy function (PEF) used in nonmetalloprotein simulations, which does not take into the nonnegligible charge transfer and polarization effects in many metal complexes. Here, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of Zn(2+) bound to Cys(-) and/or His(0) in proteins using both the conventional PEF and a novel PEF that accounts for the significant charge transfer and polarization effects in these Zn complexes. Simulations with the conventional PEF yield a nontetrahedral Cys(2)His(2) Zn-binding site and significantly overestimate the experimental Zn-S(Cys(-)) distance. In contrast, simulations with the new PEF accurately reproduce the experimentally observed tetrahedral structures of Cys(2)His(2) and Cys(4) Zn-binding sites in proteins, even when the simulation started from a nontetrahedral Zn(2+) configuration. This suggests that simulations with the new PEF could account for coordinational changes at Zn, which occurs during the folding/unfolding of Zn-finger proteins and certain enzymatic reactions The strategy introduced here can easily be applied to investigate Zn(2+) interacting with protein ligands other than Cys(-) and His(0). It can also be extended to study the interaction of other metals that have significant charge transfer and polarization effects.},

This compares to ∼40–50 meV for nondispersion corrected PBE0 and 40–100 meV for different empirical force fields (estimated for the alanine tetrapeptide). For longer peptide chains that form a secondary structure, CCSD(T) level benchmark data are currently unaffordable.

abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute “ab initio molecular simulations” (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree–Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

abstract = {Abstract Techniques from numerical analysis and crystallographic refinement have been combined to produce a variant of the Truncated Newton nonlinear optimization procedure. The new algorithm shows particular promise for potential energy minimization of large molecular systems. Usual implementations of Newton's method require storage space proportional to the number of atoms squared (i.e., O(N2)) and computer time of O(N3). Our suggested implementation of the Truncated Newton technique requires storage of less than O(N1.5) and CPU time of less than O(N2) for structures containing several hundred to a few thousand atoms. The algorithm exhibits quadratic convergence near the minimum and is also very tolerant of poor initial structures. A comparison with existing optimization procedures is detailed for cyclohexane, arachidonic acid, and the small protein crambin. In particular, a structure for crambin (662 atoms) has been refined to an RMS gradient of 3.6 × 10−6 kcal/mol/{\AA} per atom on the MM2 potential energy surface. Several suggestions are made which may lead to further improvement of the new method.},

Here we present a case study, based on a data set of conformers of amino acids and dipeptides, of how machine-learning techniques can help addressing these issues. We will exploit a recently developed strategy to define a metric between structures, and use it as the basis of both clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques showing how these can help reveal structure-property relations, identify outliers and inconsistent structures, and rationalise how perturbations (e.g. binding of ions to the molecule) affect the stability of different conformers.},

It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

abstract = {Modern molecular mechanics force fields are widely used for modeling the dynamics and interactions of small organic molecules using libraries of transferable force field parameters. However, for molecules outside the training set, the parameters are potentially inaccurate and it may be preferable to derive molecule-specific parameters. Here we present an intuitive parameter derivation toolkit, QUBEKit (QUantum mechanical BEspoke Kit), which enables the automated generation of system-specific small molecule force field parameters directly from quantum mechanics. QUBEKit is written in python and combines bond, angle, torsion, charge, and Lennard-Jones parameter derivation methodologies alongside a method for deriving the positions and charges of off-center virtual sites from the partitioned quantum mechanical electron density. As a proof of concept, we have rederived a complete set of parameters for 109 small organic molecules and assessed the accuracy by comparing computed liquid properties with experiments. QUBEKit gives competitive results when compared to standard transferable force fields, with mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol, and 1.17 kcal/mol for the liquid density, heat of vaporization, and free energy of hydration, respectively. This indicates that the derived parameters are suitable for molecular modeling applications, including computer-aided drug design.},

abstract = {Abstract Parmscan is an automatic engine for force-field parameterization. In this work, we applied both systematic search (SS) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the force-field parameters (bond length, bond angle, as well as torsional angle terms) to reproduce the relative energies of conformational pairs as well as other molecular properties such as vibrational frequencies. We present an example of how to apply Parmscan to reproduce the relative energies of 11 hydrocarbons by optimizing the torsional parameter of C–C–C–C using both systematic search and the genetic algorithm. Both of the two methods successfully found the lowest RMS error, which is 0.51 kcal/mol (the unsigned mean error is 0.37 kcal/mol). The Cornell et al. model (Parm94, ref. 21) achieves an RMS error of 0.78 kcal/mol. A second example is the application of the genetic algorithm to optimize the torsional parameter C–O–C–O and bond angle parameter O–C–O simultaneously for 11 dioxanes, to reproduce the experimental relative energies. After 300–400 iterations of GA optimizations, the RMS deviation is reduced to 0.56–0.57 kcal/mol, slightly better than that of Parm99 (ref. 22) and much better than that of the Cornell et al. model. In further applications, the bond length and bond angle parameters of hydrocarbons and benzene were optimized to reproduce the experimental vibrational frequencies. Encouraging results were obtained compared to the Cornell et al. force field: for the low vibrational frequencies of ethane, propane, and butane, the new model achieves an unsigned mean error of 19 cm−1, compared to 30 cm−1 of the Cornell et al. model; for 20 vibrational frequencies of benzene, the new model can also give much smaller unsigned mean error (29 vs. 53 cm−1). It seems that after appropriate parameterizations, a simple harmonic molecular model, such as employed in AMBER, can also reproduce lower vibrational frequencies of molecules quite well. {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

This approach does not account for polarization in larger molecules or proteins, and the parametrization process is labor-intensive. Using linear-scaling density functional theory and atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning, environment-specific charges and Lennard-Jones parameters are derived directly from quantum mechanical calculations for use in biomolecular modeling of organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed methods significantly reduce the number of empirical parameters needed to construct molecular mechanics force fields, naturally include polarization effects in charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and scale well to systems comprised of thousands of atoms, including proteins. The feasibility and benefits of this approach are demonstrated by computing free energies of hydration, properties of pure liquids, and the relative binding free energies of indole and benzofuran to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme.},

abstract = {Zinc plays important roles in structural stabilization of proteins, enzyme catalysis, and signal transduction. Many Zn binding sites are located at the interface between the protein and the cellular fluid. In aqueous solutions, Zn ions adopt an octahedral coordination, while in proteins zinc can have different coordinations, with a tetrahedral conformation found most frequently. The dynamics of Zn binding to proteins and the formation of complexes that involve Zn are dictated by interactions between Zn and its binding partners. We calculated the interaction energies between Zn and its ligands in complexes that mimic protein binding sites and in Zn complexes of water and one or two amino acid moieties, using quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular mechanics (MM). It was found that MM calculations that neglect or only approximate polarizability did not reproduce even the relative order of the QM interaction energies in these complexes. Interaction energies calculated with the CHARMM-Drude polarizable force field agreed better with the ab initio results, although the deviations between QM and MM were still rather large (40-96 kcal/mol). In order to gain further insight into Zn-ligand interactions, the free energies of interaction were estimated by QM calculations with continuum solvent representation, and we performed energy decomposition analysis calculations to examine the characteristics of the different complexes. The ligand-types were found to have high impact on the relative strength of polarization and electrostatic interactions. Interestingly, ligand-ligand interactions did not play a significant role in the binding of Zn. Finally, analysis of ligand exchange energies suggests that carboxylates could be exchanged with water molecules, which explains the flexibility in Zn binding dynamics. An exchange between carboxylate (Asp/Glu) and imidazole (His) is less likely.},

abstract = {Small metal ions play critical roles in numerous biological processes. Of particular interest is how metalloenzymes are allosterically regulated by the binding of specific ions. Understanding how ion binding affects these biological processes requires atomic models that accurately treat the microscopic interactions with the protein ligands. Theoretical approaches at different levels of sophistication can contribute to a deeper understanding of these systems, although computational models must strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency in order to enable long molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, we present a systematic effort to optimize the parameters of a polarizable force field based on classical Drude oscillators to accurately represent the interactions between ions (K{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Na{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and Cl{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and coordinating amino-acid residues for a set of 30 biologically important proteins. By combining ab initio calculations and experimental thermodynamic data, we derive a polarizable force field that is consistent with a wide range of properties, including the geometries and interaction energies of gas-phase ion/protein-like model compound clusters, and the experimental solvation free-energies of the cations in liquids. The resulting models display significant improvements relative to the fixed-atomic-charge additive CHARMM C36 force field, particularly in their ability to reproduce the many-body electrostatic nonadditivity effects estimated from ab initio calculations. The analysis clarifies the fundamental limitations of the pairwise additivity assumption inherent in classical fixed-charge force fields, and shows its dramatic failures in the case of Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} binding sites. These optimized polarizable models, amenable to computationally efficient large-scale MD simulations, set a firm foundation and offer a powerful avenue to study the roles of the ions in soluble and membrane transport proteins.

Integration of the atomic deformation densities — bonded minus free atoms — defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule.

The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system.},

It complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas.

abstract = {Mammalian metallothioneins (MTs) comprise a Zn3Cys9 cluster in the $\beta$ domain and a Zn4Cys11 cluster in the $\alpha$ domain. They play a crucial role in storing and donating Zn(2+) ions to target metalloproteins and have been implicated in several diseases, thus understanding how MTs release Zn(2+) is of widespread interest. In this work, we present a strategy to compute the free energy for releasing Zn(2+) from MTs using a combination of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) minimizations, and continuum dielectric calculations. The methodology is shown to reproduce the experimental observations that (1) the Zn-binding sites do not have equal Zn(2+) affinity and (2) the isolated $\beta$ domain is thermodynamically less stable and releases Zn(2+) faster with oxidizing agents than the isolated $\alpha$ domain. It was used to compute the free energies for Zn(2+) release from the metal cluster in the absence and presence of the protein matrix (protein architecture and coupled protein-water interactions) to yield the respective disulfide-bonded product. The results show the importance of the protein matrix as well as protein dynamics and coupled conformational changes in accounting for the differential Zn(2+)-releasing propensity of the two domains with oxidizing agents.},

abstract = {Metallothioneins (MTs) are a particular type of small metalloprotein that possess a significant amount of Cys residues, which confer upon them an extraordinary capacity for heavy metal binding. Now, more than 50 years after their discovery and after the publication of thousands of papers, it is generally agreed that they are involved in different biological functions depending on the organisms and/or isoforms considered.This review attempts to critically review the state-of-the-art of these unusual metal-binding proteins. Special attention is devoted to their chemical and structural characterization and reactivity, including a detailed overview of the most prominent techniques used for purification and quantification of MTs, as well as a section with a comparative description of all the three-dimensional structures so far known. Equally important are the biological aspects of MTs, which have also been extensively analyzed. Thus, their in vivo origin, localization and induction pathways, as well as their proposed biological significance is discussed. Finally, the most recent applications of MTs in the Biomedicine and Biotechnology fields and the future goals that, in our opinion, investigators should aim for in MT research are mentioned in the final sections. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The binding of seemingly redox inactive zinc ions allows MT to play a central role in oxidoreductive cellular metabolism, cellular zinc distribution and homeostasis. In this interpretive study, we discuss the interaction of MT with physiologically relevant molecules and its effect on zincthiolate bonds. These interactions are linked to recent progress in the functional role of MT in cellular zinc transport, energy production, and protection of the organism against oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Metallothioneins (MT) are small, metal-binding proteins with diverse functions related to metal ion homeostasis. This paper presents the full 384-388-atom structures of the two native Zn(II)- and the Cd(II)-containing domains of human MT2, optimized with density functional theory. The presented structures are accurate to {\~{}} 0.03 {\AA} for bond lengths and thus provide new physical insight into the detailed electronic structures of MTs, in particular with accurate accounts of bridging vs. terminal bonds not available from NMR or EXAFS. The MT protein enhances the asymmetry, as compared to the protein-free clusters, causing a hierarchy in binding that most likely allows MTs to transfer ions to multiple targets in vivo. The protein polarization is substantial and occurs primarily via the terminal sulfurs, a key mechanism in providing domain-specific electronic structures. The $\beta$-domain polarizes its smaller cluster less on average, due to its less polarizable, higher negative charge density, as reflected in longer MS bond lengths and smaller bond orders. This may explain why MT2$\beta$ is more reactive and dynamic and why MTs have evolved two different-size, asymmetric domains with different metal binding affinities fit for different molecular targets of metal ion transfer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Mobley2012,
abstract = {Computational techniques see widespread use in pharmaceutical drug discovery, but typically prove unreliable in predicting trends in protein-ligand binding. Alchemical free energy calculations seek to change that by providing rigorous binding free energies from molecular simulations. Given adequate sampling and an accurate enough force field, these techniques yield accurate free energy estimates. Recent innovations in alchemical techniques have sparked a resurgence of interest in these calculations. Still, many obstacles stand in the way of their routine application in a drug discovery context, including the one we focus on here, sampling. Sampling of binding modes poses a particular challenge as binding modes are often separated by large energy barriers, leading to slow transitions. Binding modes are difficult to predict, and in some cases multiple binding modes may contribute to binding. In view of these hurdles, we present a framework for dealing carefully with uncertainty in binding mode or conformation in the context of free energy calculations. With careful sampling, free energy techniques show considerable promise for aiding drug discovery.},

@article{Reif2013,
abstract = {The GROMOS 54A8 force field [Reif et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput.2012, 8, 3705-3723] is the first of its kind to contain nonbonded parameters for charged amino acid side chains that are derived in a rigorously thermodynamic fashion, namely a calibration against single-ion hydration free energies. Considering charged moieties in solution, the most decisive signature of the GROMOS 54A8 force field in comparison to its predecessor 54A7 can probably be found in the thermodynamic equilibrium between salt-bridged ion pair formation and hydration. Possible shifts in this equilibrium might crucially affect the properties of electrolyte solutions or/and the stability of (bio)molecules. It is therefore important to investigate the consequences of the altered description of charged oligoatomic species in the GROMOS 54A8 force field. The present study focuses on examining the ability of the GROMOS 54A8 force field to accurately model the structural properties of electrolyte solutions, lipid bilayers, and proteins. It is found that (i) aqueous electrolytes involving oligoatomic species (sodium acetate, methylammonium chloride, guanidinium chloride) reproduce experimental salt activity derivatives for concentrations up to 1.0 m (1.0-molal) very well, and good agreement between simulated and experimental data is also reached for sodium acetate and methylammonium chloride at 2.0 m concentration, while not even qualitative agreement is found for sodium chloride throughout the whole range of examined concentrations, indicating a failure of the GROMOS 54A7 and 54A8 force-field parameter sets to correctly account for the balance between ion-ion and ion-water binding propensities of sodium and chloride ions; (ii) the GROMOS 54A8 force field reproduces the liquid crystalline-like phase of a hydrated DPPC bilayer at a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 323 K, the area per lipid being in agreement with experimental data, whereas other structural properties (volume per lipid, bilayer thickness) appear underestimated; (iii) the secondary structure of a range of different proteins simulated with the GROMOS 54A8 force field at pH 7 is maintained and compatible with experimental NMR data, while, as also observed for the GROMOS 54A7 force field, $\alpha$-helices are slightly overstabilized with respect to 3(10)-helices; (iv) with the GROMOS 54A8 force field, the side chains of arginine, lysine, aspartate, and glutamate residues appear slightly more hydrated and present a slight excess of oppositely-charged solution components in their vicinity, whereas salt-bridge formation properties between charged residues at the protein surface, as assessed by probability distributions of interionic distances, are largely equivalent in the GROMOS 54A7 and 54A8 force-field parameter sets.},

abstract = {Abstract We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 {\AA}, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 {\AA}) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 {\AA}, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 {\AA} and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 {\AA} and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. ? 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Abstract The widely used CHARMM additive all-atom force field includes parameters for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In the present article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform ?all-CHARMM? simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Traditional approaches to specifying a molecular mechanics force field encode all the information needed to assign force field parameters to a given molecule into a discrete set of atom types. This is equivalent to a representation consisting of a molecular graph comprising a set of vertices, which represent atoms labeled by atom type, and unlabeled edges, which represent chemical bonds. Bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral parameters are then assigned by looking up bonded pairs, triplets, and quartets of atom types in parameter tables to assign valence terms and using the atom types themselves to assign nonbonded parameters. This approach, which we call indirect chemical perception because it operates on the intermediate graph of atom-typed nodes, creates a number of technical problems. For example, atom types must be sufficiently complex to encode all necessary information about the molecular environment, making it difficult to extend force fields encoded this way. Atom typing also results in a proliferation of redundant parameters applied to chemically equivalent classes of valence terms, needlessly increasing force field complexity. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning force field parameters via direct chemical perception. Rather than working through the intermediary of the atom-typed graph, direct chemical perception operates directly on the unmodified chemical graph of the molecule to assign parameters. In particular, parameters are assigned to each type of force field term (e.g., bond stretch, angle bend, torsion, and Lennard-Jones) based on standard chemical substructure queries implemented via the industry-standard SMARTS chemical perception language, using SMIRKS extensions that permit labeling of specific atoms within a chemical pattern. We use this to implement a new force field format, called the SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format. We demonstrate the power and generality of this approach using examples of specific molecules that pose problems for indirect chemical perception and construct and validate a minimalist yet very general force field, SMIRNOFF99Frosst. We find that a parameter definition file only ∼300 lines long provides coverage of all but {\textless}0.02{\%} of a 5 million molecule drug-like test set. Despite its simplicity, the accuracy of SMIRNOFF99Frosst for small molecule hydration free energies and selected properties of pure organic liquids is similar to that of the General Amber Force Field, whose specification requires thousands of parameters. This force field provides a starting point for further optimization and refitting work to follow.},

Here we utilize an efficient microscopic method to demonstrate that van der Waals interactions in nanomaterials act at distances greater than typically assumed, and can be characterized by different scaling laws depending on the dimensionality and size of the system. Specifically, we study the behaviour of van der Waals interactions in single-layer and multilayer graphene, fullerenes of varying size, single-wall carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. As a function of nanostructure size, the van der Waals coefficients follow unusual trends for all of the considered systems, and deviate significantly from the conventionally employed pairwise-additive picture. We propose that the peculiar van der Waals interactions in nanostructured materials could be exploited to control their self-assembly.},

We show that the effective atomic C6 coefficients depend strongly on the bonding environment of an atom in a molecule.

abstract = {The free energy governing K+ conduction through gramicidin A channels is characterized by using over 0.1 $\mu$s of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent and membrane. The results provide encouraging agreement with experiments and insights into the permeation mechanism. The free energy surface of K+, as a function of both axial and radial coordinates, is calculated. Correcting for simulation artifacts due to periodicity and the lack of hydrocarbon polarizability, the calculated single-channel conductance for K+ ions is 0.8 pS, closer to experiment than any previous calculation. In addition, the estimated single ion dissociation constants are within the range of experimental determinations. The relatively small free energy barrier to ion translocation arises from a balance of large opposing contributions from protein, single-file water, bulk electrolyte, and membrane. Mean force decomposition reveals a remarkable ability of the single-file water molecules to stabilize K+ by –40 kcal/mol, roughly half the bulk solvation free energy. The importance of the single-file water confirms the conjecture of Mackay et al. [Mackay, D. H. J., Berens, P. H., Wilson, K. R. {\&}amp; Hagler, A. T. (1984) Biophys. J. 46, 229–248]. Ion association with the channel involves gradual dehydration from approximately six to seven water molecules in the first shell, to just two inside the narrow pore. Ion permeation is influenced by the orientation of the single-file water column, which can present a barrier to conduction and give rise to long-range coupling of ions on either side of the pore. Small changes in the potential function, including contributions from electronic polarization, are likely to be sufficient to obtain quantitative agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {PDZ domains contain 80-100 amino acids and bind short C-terminal sequences of target proteins. Their specificity is essential for cellular signaling pathways. We studied the binding of the Tiam1 PDZ domain to peptides derived from the C-termini of its Syndecan-1 and Caspr4 targets. We used free energy perturbation (FEP) to characterize the binding energetics of one wild-type and 17 mutant complexes by simulating 21 alchemical transformations between pairs of complexes. Thirteen complexes had known experimental affinities. FEP is a powerful tool to understand protein/ligand binding. It depends, however, on the accuracy of molecular dynamics force fields and conformational sampling. Both aspects require continued testing, especially for ionic mutations. For six mutations that did not modify the net charge, we obtained excellent agreement with experiment using the additive, AMBER ff99SB force field, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.37 kcal/mol. For six ionic mutations that modified the net charge, agreement was also good, with one large error (3 kcal/mol) and an RMSD of 0.9 kcal/mol for the other five. The large error arose from the overstabilization of a protein/peptide salt bridge by the additive force field. Four of the ionic mutations were also simulated with the polarizable Drude force field, which represents the first test of this force field for protein/ligand binding free energy changes. The large error was eliminated and the RMS error for the four mutations was reduced from 1.8 to 1.2 kcal/mol. The overall accuracy of FEP indicates it can be used to understand PDZ/peptide binding. Importantly, our results show that for ionic mutations in buried regions, electronic polarization plays a significant role.},

In fluctuating charge models, polarizability is treated by allowing the partial charges to be variables, with values that are coupled to charges on the same molecule as well as those on other molecules. The charges can be efficiently propagated in a molecular dynamics simulation using extended Lagrangian dynamics. By making a coordinate change from the charge variables to a set of normal mode charge coordinates for each molecule, a new method is constructed in which the normal mode charge variables uncouple from those on the same molecule. The method is applied to the TIP4P-FQ model of water and compared to other methods for implementing the dynamics.

abstract = {Abstract A fluctuating charge (FQ) force field is applied to molecular dynamics simulations for six small proteins in explicit polarizable solvent represented by the TIP4P-FQ potential. The proteins include 1FSV, 1ENH, 1PGB, 1VII, 1H8K, and 1CRN, representing both helical and ?-sheet secondary structural elements. Constant pressure and temperature (NPT) molecular dynamics simulations are performed on time scales of several nanoseconds, the longest simulations yet reported using explicitly polarizable all-atom empirical potentials (for both solvent and protein) in the condensed phase. In terms of structure, the FQ force field allows deviations from native structure up to 2.5 {\AA} (with a range of 1.0 to 2.5 {\AA}). This is commensurate to the performance of the CHARMM22 nonpolarizable model and other currently existing polarizable models. Importantly, secondary structural elements maintain native structure in general to within 1 {\AA} (both helix and ?-strands), again in good agreement with the nonpolarizable case. In qualitative agreement with QM/MM ab initio dynamics on crambin (Liu et al. Proteins 2001, 44, 484), there is a sequence dependence of average condensed phase atomic charge for all proteins, a dependence one would anticipate considering the differing chemical environments around individual atoms; this is a subtle quantum mechanical feature captured in the FQ model but absent in current state-of-the-art nonpolarizable models. Furthermore, there is a mutual polarization of solvent and protein in the condensed phase. Solvent dipole moment distributions within the first and second solvation shells around the protein display a shift towards higher dipole moments (increases on the order of 0.2?0.3 Debye) relative to the bulk; protein polarization is manifested via the enhanced condensed phase charges of typical polar atoms such as backbone carbonyl oxygens, amide nitrogens, and amide hydrogens. Finally, to enlarge the sample set of proteins, gas-phase minimizations and 1 ps constant temperature simulations are performed on various-sized proteins to compare to earlier work by Kaminsky et al. (J Comp Chem 2002, 23, 1515). The present work establishes the feasibility of applying a fully polarizable force field for protein simulations and demonstrates the approach employed in extending the CHARMM force field to include these effects. ? 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {To promote accuracy of the atom-bond electronegativity equalization method (ABEEM$\sigma \pi$) fluctuating charge polarizable force fields, and extend it to include all transition metal atoms, a new parameter, the reference charge is set up in the expression of the total energy potential function. We select over 700 model molecules most of which model metalloprotein molecules that come from Protein Data Bank. We set reference charges for different apparent valence states of transition metals and calibrate the parameters of reference charges, valence state electronegativities, and valence state hardnesses for ABEEM$\sigma \pi$ through linear regression and least square method. These parameters can be used to calculate charge distributions of metalloproteins containing transition metal atoms (Sc-Zn, Y-Cd, and Lu-Hg). Compared the results of ABEEM$\sigma \pi$ charge distributions with those obtained by ab initio method, the quite good linear correlations of the two kinds of charge distributions are shown. The reason why the STO-3G basis set in Mulliken population analysis for the parameter calibration is specially explained in detail. Furthermore, ABEEM$\sigma \pi$ method can also quickly and quite accurately calculate dipole moments of molecules. Molecular dynamics optimizations of five metalloproteins as the examples show that their structures obtained by ABEEM$\sigma \pi$ fluctuating charge polarizable force field are very close to the structures optimized by the ab initio MP2/6?311G method. This means that the ABEEM$\sigma \pi$/MM can now be applied to molecular dynamics simulations of systems that contain metalloproteins with good accuracy. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Subgroup discovery is a local pattern discovery task, in which descriptions of subpopulations of a database are evaluated against some quality function. As standard quality functions are functions of the described subpopulation, we propose to search for equivalence classes of descriptions with respect to their extension in the database rather than individual descriptions. These equivalence classes have unique maximal representatives forming a closure system. We show that minimum cardinality representatives of each equivalence class can be found during the enumeration process of that closure system without additional cost, while finding a minimum representative of a single equivalence class is NP-hard. With several real-world datasets we demonstrate that search space and output are significantly reduced by considering equivalence classes instead of individual descriptions and that the minimum representatives constitute a family of subgroup descriptions that is of same or better expressive power than those generated by traditional methods.},

abstract = {Subgroup discovery is a key data mining method that aims at identifying descriptions of subsets of the data that show an interesting distribution with respect to a pre-defined target concept. For practical applications the integration of numerical data is crucial. Therefore, a wide variety of interestingness measures has been proposed in literature that use a numerical attribute as the target concept. However, efficient mining in this setting is still an open issue. In this paper, we present novel techniques for fast exhaustive subgroup discovery with a numerical target concept. We initially survey previously proposed measures in this setting. Then, we explore options for pruning the search space using optimistic estimate bounds. Specifically, we introduce novel bounds in closed form and ordering-based bounds as a new technique to derive estimates for several types of interestingness measures with no previously known bounds. In addition, we investigate efficient data structures, namely adapted FP-trees and bitset-based data representations, and discuss their interdependencies to interestingness measures and pruning schemes. The presented techniques are incorporated into two novel algorithms. Finally, the benefits of the proposed pruning bounds and algorithms are assessed and compared in an extensive experimental evaluation on 24 publicly available datasets. The novel algorithms reduce runtimes consistently by more than one order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Existing algorithms for subgroup discovery with numerical targets do not optimize the error or target variable dispersion of the groups they find. This often leads to unreliable or inconsistent statements about the data, rendering practical applications, especially in scientific domains, futile. Therefore, we here extend the optimistic estimator framework for optimal subgroup discovery to a new class of objective functions: we show how tight estimators can be computed efficiently for all functions that are determined by subgroup size (non-decreasing dependence), the subgroup median value, and a dispersion measure around the median (non-increasing dependence). In the important special case when dispersion is measured using the mean absolute deviation from the median, this novel approach yields a linear time algorithm. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows that, when used within branch-and-bound search, this approach is highly efficient and indeed discovers subgroups with much smaller errors.},

@article{Sutton2020,
abstract = {Although machine learning (ML) models promise to substantially accelerate the discovery of novel materials, their performance is often still insufficient to draw reliable conclusions. Improved ML models are therefore actively researched, but their design is currently guided mainly by monitoring the average model test error. This can render different models indistinguishable although their performance differs substantially across materials, or it can make a model appear generally insufficient while it actually works well in specific sub-domains. Here, we present a method, based on subgroup discovery, for detecting domains of applicability (DA) of models within a materials class. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing three state-of-the-art ML models for predicting the formation energy of transparent conducting oxides. We find that, despite having a mutually indistinguishable and unsatisfactory average error, the models have DAs with distinctive features and notably improved performance.},

abstract = {Subgroup discovery (SGD) is presented here as a data-mining approach to help find interpretable local patterns, correlations, and descriptors of a target property in materials-science data. Specifically, we will be concerned with data generated by density-functional theory calculations. At first, we demonstrate that SGD can identify physically meaningful models that classify the crystal structures of 82 octet binary (OB) semiconductors as either rocksalt or zincblende. SGD identifies an interpretable two-dimensional model derived from only the atomic radii of valence s and p orbitals that properly classifies the crystal structures for 79 of the 82 OB semiconductors. The SGD framework is subsequently applied to 24 400 configurations of neutral gas-phase gold clusters with 5-14 atoms to discern general patterns between geometrical and physicochemical properties. For example, SGD helps find that van der Waals interactions within gold clusters are linearly correlated with their radius of gyration and are weaker for planar clusters than for nonplanar clusters. Also, a descriptor that predicts a local linear correlation between the chemical hardness and the cluster isomer stability is found for the even-sized gold clusters.},

abstract = {The 7S particle of Xenopus laevis oocytes contains 5S RNA and a 40-K protein which is required for 5S RNA transcription in vitro. Proteolytic digestion of the protein in the particle yields periodic intermediates spaced at 3-K intervals and a limit digest containing 3-K fragments. The native particle is shown to contain 7-11 zinc atoms. These data suggest that the protein contains repetitive zinc-binding domains. Analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals nine tandem similar units, each consisting of approximately 30 residues and containing two invariant pairs of cysteines and histidines, the most common ligands for zinc. The linear arrangement of these repeated, independently folding domains, each centred on a zinc ion, comprises the major part of the protein. Such a structure explains how this small protein can bind to the long internal control region of the 5S RNA gene, and stay bound during the passage of an RNA polymerase molecule.},

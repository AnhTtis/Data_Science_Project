    "abstract": "The accuracy of classical force fields (FFs) has been shown to be limited for the simulation of cation-protein systems despite their importance in understanding the processes of life. Improvements can result from optimizing the parameters of classical FFs or by extending the FF formulation by terms describing charge transfer and polarization effects. In this work, we introduce our implementation of the CTPOL model in OpenMM, which extends the classical additive FF formula by adding charge transfer (CT) and polarization (POL). Furthermore, we present an open-source parameterization tool, called FFAFFURR that enables the (system specific) parameterization of OPLS-AA and CTPOL models. The performance of our workflow was evaluated by its ability to reproduce quantum chemistry energies and by molecular dynamics simulations of a Zinc finger protein.",

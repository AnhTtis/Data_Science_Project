    "abstract": "There has always been an ambiguous connection between quantum metrology and criticality. We clarify this relationship in a unitary parametrization process with a Hamiltonian governed by su(1,1) Lie algebra. Based on this type of Hamiltonian, we investigate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound of the coupling strength in the quantum Rabi model close to the phase transition point. We show that the generator $\\mathcal{H}$ in the unitary parametrization process can be treated as an extended brachistochrone problem on the $x-y$ plane and a linear function of time in the $z$ direction. In addition, we find that the value of quantum Fisher information is proportional to the sixth power of the evolution time when the system is close to the phase transition point.",

This paper presents an efficient semi-supervised architecture for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, which achieves \textit{more} in terms of performance with \textit{less} computational costs, \textit{less} annotations, and \textit{less} trainable model parameters (\ie, \textit{Less is More}, LiM3D). Our architecture consists of three novel contributions: the SDSC convolution module,  the {\samplshort} sampling strategy, and the pseudo-labeling method informed by LiDAR reflectivity. These individual components can be applied to any 3D semantic segmentation architecture to reduce the gap between semi or weakly-supervised and fully-supervised learning on task performance, whilst managing model complexity and computation costs.

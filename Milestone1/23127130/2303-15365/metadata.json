    "abstract": "The paper presents the application of a new impulse excitation diagram (IED) to help realize high-energy orbits in nonlinear energy harvesting systems. In the case of non-linearity, we can deal with the occurrence of coexisting solutions and the proposed diagram allows for the use of the impulse excitation method in order to change the solution. For this purpose, the author's IED diagram was presented to determine the characteristics, duration and moment of initiation of the external disturbing impulse in order to jump to another orbit. An application example is the quasizero energy harvester and two different impulse characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary conditions is widely believed to originate from the intrinsic spectral topology under periodic boundary conditions. If the eigenspectra under periodic boundary conditions have no spectral windings (e.g., piecewise arcs) or a finite area on the complex plane, there will be no non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries. In this article, we demonstrate another scenario beyond this perception by introducing a two-dimensional periodically driven model. The effective Floquet Hamiltonian lacks intrinsic spectral topology and is proportional to the identity matrix (representing a single point on the complex plane) under periodic boundary conditions. Yet, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits a second-order skin effect that is robust against perturbations and disorder under open boundary conditions. We further reveal the dynamical origin of these second-order skin modes and illustrate that they are characterized by a dynamical topological invariant of the full time-evolution operator.",

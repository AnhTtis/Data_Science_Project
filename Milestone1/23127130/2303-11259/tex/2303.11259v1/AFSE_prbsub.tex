\begin{abstract}
The non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary conditions is widely believed to originate from the intrinsic spectral topology under periodic boundary conditions. If the eigenspectra under periodic boundary conditions have no spectral windings (e.g., piecewise arcs) or a finite area on the complex plane, there will be no non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries. In this article, we demonstrate another scenario beyond this perception by introducing a two-dimensional periodically driven model. The effective Floquet Hamiltonian lacks intrinsic spectral topology and is proportional to the identity matrix (representing a single point on the complex plane) under periodic boundary conditions. Yet, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits a second-order skin effect that is robust against perturbations and disorder under open boundary conditions. We further reveal the dynamical origin of these second-order skin modes and illustrate that they are characterized by a dynamical topological invariant of the full time-evolution operator.

\section{Introduction}
Non-Hermitian physics has recently garnered significant research interest. Many classical optical and mechanical systems, electric circuits, open quantum systems, and single-particle Green functions with non-zero self-energy are described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or matrices \cite{AshidaGongUeda,BBK2021RevModPhys}. Several unique features of non-Hermitian systems have been discovered, including PT symmetry \cite{PT1998Bender,PT2002Bender,PT2009Longhi,PT2011Hu,PT2012Regensburger,PT2014Feng,PT2014Zhu,PT2015Yuce,PT2017Ashida,PT2018ElGanniny}, the non-Hermitian skin effect \cite{AnomalousESLee,YaoWang,BiorthogonalKEBB,SSHLieu,ExactSolution,wang2023symmetric}, and exceptional points \cite{EP2018Shen,EP2015zhen,EP2016Doppler,EP2016xu,EP2017kozii,EP2017xu,EP2019Fu,EP2019miri,HuEP2022,HuEPclass,EPreview}. These unique features lead to a variety of tantalizing effects and phenomena in non-Hermitian systems without Hermitian counterparts \cite{SongYaoWang,HelicalDamping,InformationConstraint,Huknot,HuNHWSM,Hubartlett,NCNHWSM,SFL1,SFL2,SFL3}. Non-Hermitian systems have much richer topological phases \cite{Top2018Gong,ReflectionLJC}, as exemplified by the 38-fold symmetry classes for time-independent point gap topology \cite{KawabataShiozakiUedaSato,ZhouLee}, and 54-fold symmetry classes for time-independent line gap topology and time-dependent systems \cite{DefectsLiuChen,FloquetLHC}.

In previous studies, the paradigmatic non-Hermitian skin effect has been attributed to the spectral topology under periodic boundary conditions. Specifically, in the complex-energy plane, the appearance of skin modes with open boundaries depends on the existence of spectral winding \cite{SkinTopoOKSS,SkinTopoZYF} or finite spectral area \cite{Fang2D} under periodic boundary conditions. The skin modes can be categorized into different orders, where the $n$th-order ($n\leq d$) skin effect in $d$-dimensional systems with $L^d$ lattice sites indicates that the number of accumulated eigenstates at the $(d-n)$-dimensional boundary scales as $O(L^{d-n+1})$ \cite{SO2020Kawabata,SO2020Okugawa,SO2021Zou}. The appearance of skin modes necessitates the introduction of a generalized Brillouin zone, through which the usual bulk-edge correspondence can be restored.

This article presents a novel scheme that transcends the previous perception. As proof of principle, we introduce a two-dimensional Floquet driving system whose Floquet Hamiltonian is proportional to the identity matrix and has no intrinsic spectral topology. However, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits the second-order non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of these skin modes against perturbations and disorders and delve into their dynamical origins by explicitly working out the edge theory. We show that the skin modes are characterized by a dynamical topological invariant from the full time-evolution operator.

\section{Model}
We consider a bilayer hexagonal lattice structure [See Fig. \ref{Fig1} (a)] and a ten-step Floquet driving sequence $H_{s1}\rightarrow H_{s2}\rightarrow ... \rightarrow H_{s10}$. The $n$-th time step inside a driving period is governed by the time-independent Hamiltonian $H_{sn}$. We set $H_{s6}=H_{s3},~H_{s7}=H_{s4},~H_{s8}=H_{s5},~H_{s9}=-H_{s2},~H_{s10}=H_{s1}$. They are given by
 \begin{equation*}
 %   \begin{split}
      H_{s1}({\bf k})=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
        H_A& 0\\
     0 & H_A
      \end{array}
      \right ];       H_{s2}({\bf k})=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
      0& -i\mathbb{I}\\
      i\mathbb{I}& 0
    \end{array}
    \right ];
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  H_{s3}({\bf k})=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    H_1({\bf k},g_0)& 0\\
 0 & H_3({\bf k},g_0)
  \end{array}
  \right ]; \\  %\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  H_{s4}({\bf k})&=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    H_2({\bf k},g_0) & 0\\
    0 & H_2({\bf k},g_0)
    \end{array}
    \right ];\\
  H_{s5}({\bf k})&=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    H_3({\bf k},g_0) & 0\\
     0 & H_1({\bf k},g_0)
      \end{array}
    \right ],  \\
    \label{Hjk4}
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}
where
 \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
  H_1({\bf k},g)&= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  0 &  e^{g+i{\bf k}\cdot {\bf a}_1}\\
   e^{-g-i{\bf k}\cdot {\bf a}_1} & 0
  \end{array}
  \right ];  \\
  H_2({\bf k},g)&= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    0 &  e^{-g+i{\bf k}\cdot {\bf a}_2}\\
     e^{g-i{\bf k}\cdot {\bf a}_2} & 0
    \end{array}
    \right ];\\
  H_3({\bf k},g)&=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
      0 & e^{-g+i{\bf k}\cdot {\bf a}_3}\\
       e^{g-i{\bf k}\cdot {\bf a}_3} & 0
      \end{array}
    \right ];\\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    H_A=H_1({\bf k},g_1)+H_2({\bf k},g_2)+H_3({\bf k},g_3). \label{Hjk4}
 % \end{split}
  \end{equation}
 Here $g_0, g_1, g_2,$ $g_3$ are tunable non-reciprocal parameters between neighboring lattice sites.
  ${\bf a}_1=(-\frac{a}{2},-\frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}})$, ${\bf a}_2=(0 ,\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}})$,
  ${\bf a}_3=(\frac{a}{2},-\frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}})$. ($a=1$ is the lattice constant.) ${\bf k}$ is the lattice momentum.  $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity matrix. The time duration for each step is denoted as $t_1$, $t_2$,..., $t_{10}$, respectively. In this paper, we set $t_{j}=t_{11-j}$ for $j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ and $g_1=g_2=0$. Figs. \ref{Fig1}(b)(c) sketch the non-reciprocal Hamiltonians in each step and the Floquet driving protocol.
  \begin{figure}[t]

(d) Spatial profiles of the eigenstates. The parameters are $g_0=0.2$ and $t_1=0$. The system size is $L\times L=20\times 20$.\label{Fig1}}
\end{figure}

The above driven system fulfills a type-K symmetry in the generalized Bernard-LeClair (GBL) class,
  \begin{equation}
    H({\bf k},t)=KH^*(-{\bf k},- t)K^{-1}, ~~KK^*=- \mathbb{I}, \label{Ksys}
  \end{equation}
set by the driving protocol $H_{sj}({\bf k},t)=KH_{s11-j}^*(-{\bf k},- t)K^{-1}$ ($j=1,2,3,4,5$). Here  $K=\sigma_y\otimes \mathbb{I}$ ($\sigma_y$ is Pauli matrix). The Floquet operator ($U$) is defined as the time evolution operator in one full period $T=\sum_{j=1}^{10}t_j$,
\begin{equation}
  U=e^{-iH_{s10}t_{10}}e^{-iH_{s9}t_{9}}... e^{-iH_{s1}t_{1}}.
\end{equation}
The Floquet Hamiltonian is the effective static Hamiltonian that stroboscopically tracks the time evolution. It is defined as $H_F=\frac{i}{T}ln(U)$. We always take $t_2=t_3=t_4=t_5=\frac{\pi}{2}$ in this article unless otherwise stated.

Notably, when $t_1=0$, the time evolution operator is easily solvable and given simply by $U({\bf k})=-\mathbb{I}$, with the corresponding bulk Floquet Hamiltonian being $H_{F}({\bf k})=0$. Surprisingly, there are $O(L)$ eigenstates located at one single corner under open boundary condition, while the other eigenstates are extended across the whole system, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig1}(d) for $g_3= 0.2$. These localized states are known as the second-order skin modes and have previously been associated with the eigenspectra of finite area on the complex plane or topological properties \cite{SO2020Kawabata,SO2020Okugawa,SO2021Zou} of the bulk Hamiltonian under periodic boundary conditions. However, in this model, the spectra of the Floquet Hamiltonian represent only a single point on the complex plane, without any topological structure or spectral area. Therefore, this model lacks any static counterparts and a complete understanding of the appearance of these skin modes requires an account of the full-time evolution.

      \label{Fig2}}
\end{figure}

 \section{Perturbation and disorder}
Next, we demonstrate the robustness of the second-order skin effect against perturbations (i.e., deviating from the ideal case described above.) We introduce a nonzero value for parameter $t_1$ and investigate the interplay between the first- and second-order skin effects. Additionally, we show that the second-order skin effect is resistant to disorder: the skin modes survive even in the presence of significant disorder strength.
 \subsection{Perturbation}
Let us deviate from the ideal case of Fig. \ref{Fig1} and take $g_3=-0.4$, $t_1=0.8$ with other parameters unchanged. Fig. \ref{Fig2}(a) plots the spatial profiles of the eigenstates $|\psi_{j}({\bf r},1)|$ and $|\psi_{j}({\bf r},2)|$ $(j=1,2,...,4L^2-4)$ with open boundary condition. Here $z=1$, or $2$ denotes the top or bottom layer, $j$ labels the eigenstate, and ${\bf r}=(x,y)$ labels the lattice site. It is clear that there are $O(L)$ eigenvectors located at the bottom right corner and $O(L^2)$ eigenvectors located at the top left corner. That is, the first-order skin modes start to emerge, while the second-order skin modes persist. When $t_1$ increases to $1$, all eigenvectors are located at the top left corner as depicted in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(b).

To scrutinize the second-order skin effect, we define a partial inverse partition ratio of eigenvector $\psi_{j}({\bf r},z)$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  I_{cipr}(j)= \frac{\sum_{{\bf r \in \mathcal{A}}}[|\psi_{j}({\bf r},1)|^4+|\psi_{j}({\bf r},2)|^4]}{\sum_{{\bf r}}[|\psi_{j}({\bf r},1)|^2+|\psi_{j}({\bf r},2)|^2]}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
It has support on the bottom right part of the lattice sites with $\mathcal{A}= \left\{(x,y)|(x+\sqrt{3}y)>\frac{\sqrt{3}(L+1)}{2}, y<\frac{\sqrt{3}(L-1)}{4}\right\}$. We dub it as the corner inverse partition ratio (CIPR) and define the mean CIPR (MCIPR) over all eigenstates as
\begin{equation}
I_{mcipr}=\frac{\sum_{j}I_{cipr}(j)}{4L^2-4}.
\end{equation}
In Fig. \ref{Fig2}(c), the quantity $I_{mcipr}$ is plotted as a function of $t_1$. The decrease in $I_{mcipr}$ with increasing $t_1$ is due to the emergence of first-order skin modes and the growth of the localization length for the second-order skin modes. The small jittering in the plot may be due to finite-size effects or
the in-cell wave functions' relative changes with the variation of $t_1$. In a broad range of values for $t_1$, both first-order and second-order skin modes can be found, localized on different corners. However, as $t_1$ increases beyond a certain threshold, the first-order skin effect dominates, suppressing the second-order skin modes and pulling them towards the top left corner, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(b). $I_{mcipr}$ can be used as an order parameter, and the threshold value is reached at around $t_1=0.9$, where all second-order skin modes have been eliminated (i.e., they have infinite localization length). To estimate the threshold value of $I_{mcipr}$, the presence of a few extended states and the rest are localized first-order skin modes is assumed. The critical value of $I_{mcipr}$ scales as $I_{mcipr}\propto 1/(16L^2)$, where $L$ is the system size. In Fig. \ref{Fig2}(d), the spectral gap (absolute value) is plotted as a function of $t_1$. Here, we take open boundary conditions along $\bf{a}_3$ and its perpendicular direction and utilize the non-Bloch band theory (or generalized Brillouin zone) to obtain the bulk spectra. The gap decreases and closes around $t_1=0.5$, indicating a bulk topological transition that will be discussed later.

    \begin{figure}[t]
      \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.35in]{fig3.pdf}}
      \caption{Robustness of second-order skin modes with respect to disorder. Spatial profiles of all eigenstates $|\psi_{j}({\bf r},1)|^2$ and $|\psi_{j}({\bf r},2)|^2$ for disorder strength (a) $W_D=1$.(b) $W_D=100$. Other parameters are $t_1=\pi/20$, $g_0=0.2$, and $g_3=0$. The system size is $L\times L=20\times 20$.
        \label{Fig3}}
      \end{figure}
\subsection{Disorder}
Now let us consider the effect of disorder and take $t_1=\pi/20$, $g_0=0.2$, and $g_3=0$. We add a time-independent disorder $H_{diso}$ to each step of the system's Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
 H_{diso}=\sum_{\bf r}[ w_d({\bf r})a_{{\bf r},1}^{\dagger}a_{{\bf r},1}+w_d({\bf r})a_{{\bf r},2}^{\dagger}a_{{\bf r},2}],
\end{equation}
where $a_{{\bf r},z}^{\dagger}, a_{{\bf r},z} (z=1,2)$ are creation and annihilation operations on the $\bf r$ lattice site in $z$ layer, respectively. $w_d({\bf r})$ is random variable with constant probability distribution in the interval $[-W_D,W_D]$. $w_d({\bf r}_i)$ and $w_d({\bf r}_j)$ $({\bf r}_i\ne {\bf r}_j)$ are independent of each other.
Figs. \ref{Fig3} (a) and (b) plot the spatial profiles of $|\psi_{j}({\bf r},1)|$ and $|\psi_{j}({\bf r},2)|$ $(j=1, 2,..., 4L^2-4)$ with $W_D=0.1$ and $W_D=100$, respectively. We can see that the second-order skin modes persist in a broad region of disorder strength and coexist with Anderson localization states.

\section{Edge theory and topological number}
A major advantage of our model is that it is analytically solvable under certain conditions, e.g., in the absence of disorder and $t_1=0$. This would greatly help us to gain an intuitive understanding of the emergence of second-order skin modes. For this case, the bulk Floquet operator is trivial. However, we have nontrivial edge states which are dynamically induced and the Floquet operator of
the top, bottom, left, and right edges (denoted as $U_T$, $U_B$, $U_L$, and $U_R$, respectively) are
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    U_L=&\sum_{n}\frac{1}{2}[e^{-4g_0}(a_{uA,n+2}^{\dagger} -a_{dA,n+2}^{\dagger})a_{uA,n}
    \\+&e^{4g_0}(a_{uA,n}^{\dagger}-a_{dA,n}^{\dagger})a_{uA,n+2}
    \\+&e^{-4g_0}(-a_{uA,n+2}^{\dagger}+a_{dA,n+2}^{\dagger})a_{dA,n}
\\+&e^{4g_0}(a_{uA,n}^{\dagger}+a_{dA,n}^{\dagger})a_{dA,n+2}]
\\-&\sum_{n}(a_{uB,n}^{\dagger}a_{uB,n}+a_{dB,n}^{\dagger}a_{dB,n}) \label{Ul};
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
U_R=&\sum_{n}\frac{1}{2}[e^{4g_0}(a_{uB,n}^{\dagger}-a_{dB,n}^{\dagger})a_{uB,n+2}
\\+&e^{-4g_0}(a_{uB,n+2}^{\dagger}-a_{dB,n+2}^{\dagger})a_{uB,n}
\\-&e^{4g_0}(-a_{uB,n}^{\dagger}-a_{dB,n}^{\dagger})a_{dB,n+2}
\\+&e^{-4g_0}(a_{uB,n+2}^{\dagger}+a_{dB,n+2}^{\dagger})a_{dB,n}]
\\-&\sum_{n}(a_{uA,n}^{\dagger}a_{uA,n}+a_{dA,n}^{\dagger}a_{dA,n}) \label{Ur};
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
U_T=&\sum_{x}\frac{1}{2}[e^{4g_0}(a_{uB,x+2}^{\dagger}-a_{dB,x+2}^{\dagger})a_{dB,x}
\\+&e^{-4g_0}(a_{uB,x}^{\dagger}+a_{dB,x}^{\dagger})a_{uB,x+2}
\\-&e^{4g_0}(-a_{uB,x+2}^{\dagger}-a_{dB,x+2}^{\dagger})a_{dB,x}
\\+&e^{-4g_0}(a_{uB,x}^{\dagger}+a_{dB,x}^{\dagger})a_{dB,x+2}]
\\-&\sum_{x}(a_{uA,x}^{\dagger}a_{uA,x}+a_{dA,x}^{\dagger}a_{dA,x}) \label{Ut};
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
U_B=&\sum_{x}\frac{1}{2}[e^{-4g_0}(a_{uA,x}^{\dagger}-a_{dA,x}^{\dagger})a_{uA,x+2}

\\-&e^{-4g_0}(a_{uA,x}^{\dagger}-a_{dA,x}^{\dagger})a_{dA,x+2}
\\+&e^{4g_0}(a_{uA,x+2}^{\dagger}+a_{dA,x+2}^{\dagger})a_{dA,x}]
\\-&\sum_{x}(a_{uB,x}^{\dagger}a_{uB,x}+a_{dB,x}^{\dagger}a_{dB,x}) \label{Ub}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here $a_{zm,x}^{\dagger}$ and $a_{zm,x}$ ($z=u,d$ and $m=A,B$) are the
creation and annihilation operators on the $z$ layer, $x$-th unit cell, and $m$ sublattice.
$x$ is the cell index along ${\bf x}$ direction [See Fig. \ref{Fig1}(a)]. $u$ and
$d$ represent $1$ and $2$ layer, respectively. Similarlly, $a_{zm,n}^{\dagger}$ and $a_{zm,n}$ are the
creation and annihilation operators on $z$ layer, $n$-th unit cell, and $m$ site, respectively.
$n$ is the cell index along ${\bf n}$ direction [See Fig. \ref{Fig1}(a)]. Fourier transform of Eqs. (\ref{Ul})-(\ref{Ub}) brings us to the momentum space and we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    U_L&=\sum_{k_1}A_{k_1}^{\dagger}\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
      L_A& 0\\
   0 & -\mathbb{I}
    \end{array}
    \right ]A_{k_1};  \\
U_R&=\sum_{k_1}A_{k_1}^{\dagger}\left[ \begin{array}{cc}

\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}

\end{array}
\right ].\\
  \label{Hjk4}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In our notation, $A_{k_1}=[a_{uAk_1},a_{dAk_1},a_{uBk_1},a_{dBk_1}]$,
$B_{k_2}=[a_{uAk_2},a_{dAk_2},a_{uBk_2},a_{dBk_2}]$,
$a_{zmn}=\sum_{k_1}e^{ik_1n}a_{zmk_1}$, and $a_{zmx}=\sum_{k_2}e^{ik_2x}a_{zmk_2}$, $z=u,d$ and $m=A,B$.
$k_1$ and $k_2$ are the momenta along ${\bf n}$ and ${\bf x}$ directions, respectively. The above edge Floquet operators can be considered as similar to the Hatano-Nelson model, with non-reciprocal hoppings. When a full open boundary is applied in both directions, the eigenvectors of $U_L$ and $U_R$ are situated along the bottom edges, while the eigenvectors of $U_T$ and $U_B$ are located on the right edges. The combination of these edge Floquet operators results in the accumulation of edge states at the bottom right corner of all eigenvectors.

While the second-order skin effect can be intuitively understood through these effective edge Floquet operators, the stability of these skin modes and their origin are encoded in a dynamical topological invariant, as discussed below. For convenience, we denote $U({\bf k},t)$ as the time-evolution operator of this model. According to Table I of Ref. \cite{FloquetLHC}, this model belongs to the GBL class K2a and has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification. For Floquet systems, the description of the system's topological properties needs to take into account its micro-motion operator $\tilde{U}=U({\bf k},t)e^{i H_Ft}$. A Hermitianization procedure is then applied and the associated Hermitian operator is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    H_{\tilde{U}}&=\left [ \begin{array}{cc}
      0& \tilde{U}({\bf k},t)\\
      (\tilde{U}({\bf k},t)^{\dagger}& 0
    \end{array}
    \right ].
  \label{Hjk4}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
By treating time $t$ as another momentum, the Hamiltonian $H_{\tilde{U}}$ can be classified as belonging to the three-dimensional Hermitian CII class \cite{ChiuRev,TeoKane}. Denoting $|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle,(\alpha=1,2,3,4)$ as the occupied eigenstates of $H_{\tilde{U}}$ with negative eigenenergies, the non-Abelian Berry connection is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A^{\alpha,\beta}({\bf k},t)=\langle \psi_{\alpha}|\nabla_{\bf k}\psi_{\beta}\rangle \cdot d{\bf k}
+\langle \psi_{\alpha}|\nabla_{t}\psi_{\beta}\rangle \cdot dt.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The desired $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant is then the second Chern-Simons topological number $W_{CS}=CS$ $mod$ $2$ with \cite{ChiuRev,TeoKane}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
CS=\frac{-1}{8\pi^2}\int_{BZ\times t\in[0,T]}Tr[AdA+\frac{2}{3}A^3].
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Our numerical calculations show that $W_{CS}=1$ before the gap closure in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(d), while it is not well-defined after the gap closure. The Chern-Simons topological number dictates the existence of topologically protected helical edge states. The non-reciprocal couplings along the boundaries collapse them into second-order skin modes under full open boundary conditions.

A special case worth mentioning is when $t_2=0$ and $t_3=t_4=t_5=\pi/2$. In this case, the two layers are decoupled, and each layer reduces to a previously studied model (Sec. IV A of Ref. \cite{FloquetLHC}). The topological invariants of the layers are given by three-dimensional winding numbers, with values of $1$ and $-1$, respectively. These winding numbers dictate the existence of topological edge states for each layer. If we take open boundary conditions along the ${\bf x}$ direction and periodic boundary conditions along the ${\bf n}$ direction, the type-K symmetry enforces a two-fold degeneracy (for the real part) at $k=\pi$ at the top and bottom edges (see Appendix A for details). As long as the real gap of the Floquet Hamiltonians persists, this degeneracy cannot be removed. Therefore, the topological edge states are stable and protected by the Floquet Hamiltonian's real gap, even when we deviate from the special case (e.g., by tuning $t_1$ and $t_2$ to non-zero values).

 \section{Generalization and realization}

One potential implementation of our model and driving protocol (in GBL class K2a) is through the two-dimensional unitary random walk (RW), a widely used platform of Floquet topological phases. The recipe of our setup is the anomalous Floquet topological insulator in class A \cite{RW2018chen}. By coupling two such RWs with opposite three-winding numbers ($+1$ and $-1$), we can obtain an anomalous Floquet topological insulator in class AII. To implement the non-Hermitian terms in the Floquet operators, we utilize polarization-dependent photon gain/loss, which respects type-K symmetry \cite{RW2017xiao}. The appearance of second-order skin modes in this setup should be confirmed by observing pronounced photon localizations near one of the system corners. Another possible platform for implementing our model is through open systems. A more detailed discussion of this approach can be found in Appendix B.

 \section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the emergence of second-order skin modes in a two-dimensional Floquet driving system, where the bulk Floquet band is trivially flat and %without any bulk Hamiltonian topology 
characterized by an identity Floquet operator $-\mathbb{I}$. Our scheme surpasses prior knowledge that the non-Hermitian skin effect only arises from intrinsic bulk topology or finite spectral area under periodic boundary conditions in the static systems. Additionally, we have shown that these second-order skin modes are %stable and
robust against perturbations and disorders. We have further revealed the topological origin of these skin modes from the edge theory and the Chern-Simons dynamical topological invariant. Generalization to high-dimensional systems or other symmetry classes will be left for future study.

\section{Proof of the real-part degeneracy of the Floquet spectra of at high symmetry point with type-K symmetry: $H({\bf k},t)=KH^*(-{\bf k},- t)K^{-1}, ~~KK^*=- \mathbb{I}$}
The type-K symmetry is
\begin{equation}
  H({\bf k},t)=KH^*(-{\bf k},- t)K^{-1}, ~~KK^*=- \mathbb{I}.
\end{equation}
According to Eq.(20) of Ref. \cite{FloquetLHC}, the Floquet operator fulfills
\begin{equation}
  [U^*(-{\bf k})]^{-1}=K^{-1}U({\bf k})K, ~~KK^*=- \mathbb{I}.
\end{equation}
It follows that the eigenfunction $\psi_j({\bf k})$ and eigenenergy $E_j({\bf k})$ of $U({\bf k})$ ($E_j({\bf k})=\rho_j({\bf k}) e^{i\theta_j({\bf k})}, \rho_j({\bf k})>0, 0\le \theta_j({\bf k})<2\pi$) satisfy
\begin{equation}
  U({\bf k})\psi_j({\bf k})=E_j({\bf k})\psi_j({\bf k}).
\end{equation}
Thus, we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  &E_j({\bf k})\psi_j({\bf k})=U({\bf k})\psi_j({\bf k})=K[U^*(-{\bf k})]^{-1}K^{-1}\psi_j({\bf k}),  \\ \\
  \iff \quad &E_j({\bf k})K^{-1}\psi_j({\bf k})=[U^*(-{\bf k})]^{-1}K^{-1}\psi_j({\bf k}) ,           \\  \\
  \iff \quad &E_j({\bf k})U^*(-{\bf k})K^{-1}\psi_j({\bf k})=K^{-1}\psi_j({\bf k}),                   \\  \\
  \iff \quad &U(-{\bf k})(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k})=(E_j({\bf k})^*)^{-1}(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
At high symmetry point ${\bf k}_0$ (${\bf k}_0=-{\bf k}_0$), we have
\begin{equation}
  U({\bf k}_0)(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0)=(E_j({\bf k}_0)^*)^{-1}(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0).
\end{equation}
The Floquet Hamiltonian is $H_F({\bf k})=\frac{i}{T}ln(U({\bf k}))$. Here we choose the imaginary part of $ln()$ function to be in $[0,2\pi)$ interval. Note that both $\psi_j({\bf k}_0)$ and $(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0)$ are
eigenfunctions of $H_F({\bf k}_0)$, with their associated eigenenergies $\frac{1}{T}[ln[\rho_j({\bf k})]i-\theta_j({\bf k})]$ and $\frac{1}{T}[-ln[\rho_j({\bf k})]i-\theta_j({\bf k})]$. If $\psi_j({\bf k}_0)$ and $(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0)$ are not degenerate (with the same real part of eigenenergies), we have
\begin{equation}
  \psi_j({\bf k}_0)=e^{i\delta}(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0) \label{s1}.
\end{equation}
Thus
\begin{equation}
  (K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0)= (K^*)^{-1}(e^{i\delta}(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0))^*=-e^{-i\delta}\psi_j({\bf k}_0),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \iff \quad \psi_j({\bf k}_0)=-e^{i\delta}(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0),
\end{equation}
which contradicts Eq. (\ref{s1}). Therefore, $\psi_j({\bf k}_0)$ and $(K^*)^{-1}\psi_j^*({\bf k}_0)$ are degenerate eigenfunctions (with the same real part of eigenenergies).

\section{Realization of the model in open quatum systems}
Let us consider Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the Lindblad equation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\rho}{dt} %=\mathscr{L}\rho
  =\mathcal{L}[\rho]=-i[H,\rho]+\sum _{\mu}\left(2L_{\mu}\rho L_{\mu}^{\dagger}-\left\{L_{\mu}^{\dagger}L_{\mu},\rho\right\}\right) ,
  \label{lindbladeq}
  \end{equation}
  where $\rho$ is the density matrix, $H$ is systems' Hamiltonian, $L_{\mu}$ is the Lindblad operator. They are all time dependent. Similarly to Appendix D of Ref. \cite{InformationConstraint},
  if each Lindblad operator is a linear combination of annihilate operators, we have
 \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
   &|\langle0| (a_{j_2}(t)a^{\dagger}_{j_1}(0)+a^{\dagger}_{j_1}(0)a_{j_2}(t))|0\rangle|^2 \\
          =&|\langle 0| a_{j_2}(t)a^{\dagger}_{j_1}(0)|0\rangle|^2  \\
          =&|\langle0|e^{\mathcal{L}(\Delta t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[e^{\mathcal{L}(2\Delta t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[...[
          e^{\mathcal{L}(t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[a_{j_2}(0)]]...]]|j_1\rangle|^2  \\
          =&|Tr[e^{\mathcal{L}(\Delta t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[e^{\mathcal{L}(2\Delta t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[...[
            e^{\mathcal{L}(t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[a_{j_2}(0)]]...]]|j_1\rangle \langle0|]|^2  \\
          =&|Tr[a_{j_2}(0) e^{\mathcal{L}(t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[...[e^{\mathcal{L}(2\Delta t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[e^{\mathcal{L}(\Delta t)^{\dagger}\Delta t}[|j_1\rangle \langle0|]]]...]]|^2  \\
          =&|Tr[a_{j_2}(0) e^{-iH_{eff}(t)\Delta t }...e^{-iH_{eff}(2\Delta t)\Delta t } e^{-iH_{eff}(\Delta t)\Delta t }|j_1\rangle \langle0|]|^2  \\
          =&|Tr[ e^{-iH_{eff}(t)\Delta t }...e^{-iH_{eff}(2\Delta t)\Delta t } e^{-iH_{eff}(\Delta t)\Delta t }|j_1\rangle \langle0|a_{j_2}(0) ]|^2  \\
          =&|\langle j_2| e^{-iH_{eff}(t)\Delta t }...e^{-iH_{eff}(2\Delta t)\Delta t } e^{-iH_{eff}(\Delta t)\Delta t }|j_1\rangle|^2.  \\
  \end{split} \label{ip2}
  \end{equation}
Here $H_{eff}(t)=H(t)-i\sum_{\mu}^{L}L^{l\dagger}_{\mu}(t)L^l_{\mu}(t)$, $L^l_{\mu}(t)$ is a time-dependent Lindblad operator which is a linear combination of annihilate operator. $j_1=({\bf r}_1,z_1,m_1)$ and $j_2=({\bf r}_2,z_2,m_2)$,
 ${\bf r}_1$ and ${\bf r}_2$ are the two dimensional coordinates, $z_1,z_2=1,2$ are layer index,
 $m_1,m_1=A,B$ are sublattice index. The single particle
evolution is governed by $H_{eff}(t)$. Thus, we can construct a ten-step driven open quantum system to
realize the model in the main text. The Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators in each steps are
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    &h_{1}=\sum_{{\bf r},z=1,2}(a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},zA}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,zB}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,zB}a_{{\bf r},zA}+a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},zA}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,zB}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,zB}a_{{\bf r},zA}+\beta_3 a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},zA}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,zB}
    +\beta_3 a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,zB}a_{{\bf r},zA});  \\

    &L^1_{{\bf r},2}=\sqrt{\gamma_3}(a_{{\bf r},1A}-ia_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,1B}) \\
    &h_{2}=\sum_{\bf r}(a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},1A}a_{{\bf r},2A}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},1B}a_{{\bf r},2B}+h.c.);  \\
    &h_{3}=\sum_{\bf r}\beta_0(a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},1A}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,1B}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,1B}a_{{\bf r},1A}+a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},2A}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,2B}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,2B}a_{{\bf r},2A});  \\
    &L^3_{{\bf r},1}=\sqrt{\gamma_0}(a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,1B}-ia_{{\bf r},1A}) \\
    &L^3_{{\bf r},2}=\sqrt{\gamma_0}(-ia_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,2B}+a_{{\bf r},2A}) \\
    &h_{4}=\sum_{\bf r}\beta_0(a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},1A}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,1B}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,1B}a_{{\bf r},1A}+a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},2A}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,2B}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,2B}a_{{\bf r},2A});  \\
    &L^4_{{\bf r},1}=\sqrt{\gamma_0}(a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,1B}-ia_{{\bf r},1A}) \\
    &L^4_{{\bf r},2}=\sqrt{\gamma_0}(a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_2,2B}-ia_{{\bf r},2A}) \\
    &h_{5}=\sum_{\bf r}\beta_0(a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},1A}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,1B}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,1B}a_{{\bf r},1A}+a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},2A}a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,2B}
    +a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,2B}a_{{\bf r},2A});  \\
    &L^5_{{\bf r},1}=\sqrt{\gamma_0}(a_{{\bf r},1A}-ia_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_3,1B}) \\
    &L^5_{{\bf r},2}=\sqrt{\gamma_0}(a_{{\bf r}+{\bf a}_1,2B}-ia_{{\bf r},2A}) \\
    &h_6=h_3, \quad L^6_{{\bf r},1}=L^3_{{\bf r},1}, \quad L^6_{{\bf r},2}=L^3_{{\bf r},2}; \quad
    h_7=h_4, \quad L^7_{{\bf r},1}=L^4_{{\bf r},1}, \quad L^7_{{\bf r},2}=L^4_{{\bf r},2}; \\
    & h_8=h_5, \quad L^8_{{\bf r},1}=L^5_{{\bf r},1}, \quad L^8_{{\bf r},2}=L^5_{{\bf r},2}; \quad
    h_9=-h_2; \quad h_{10}=h_1, \quad L^{10}_{{\bf r},1}=L^{1}_{{\bf r},1}, \quad L^{10}_{{\bf r},2}=L^{1}_{{\bf r},2}.
  \label{lind1} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here ${\bf r}$ is the two dimensional coordinate, $a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r},zm}$
and $a_{{\bf r},zm}$ ($z=1,2$ and $m=A,B$) are creation and annihilation operators on
${\bf r}$ cell, $z$-th layer, and $m$ site. $\beta_0=\frac{1}{2}(e^{-g_0}+e^{g_0})$,
$\gamma_0=\frac{1}{2}(e^{g_0}-e^{-g_0})$, $\beta_3=\frac{1}{2}(e^{-g_3}+e^{g_3})$,
$\gamma_3=\frac{1}{2}(e^{g_3}-e^{-g_3})$.
The driven sequences in one period is      
\begin{equation}
  (h_1,L^1_{{\bf r},z})\rightarrow (h_2,0)
  \rightarrow (h_3,L^3_{{\bf r},z}) \rightarrow (h_4,L^4_{{\bf r},z})
  \rightarrow (h_5,L^5_{{\bf r},z}) \rightarrow (h_6,L^6_{{\bf r},z})
  \rightarrow (h_7,L^7_{{\bf r},z}) \rightarrow (h_8,L^8_{{\bf r},z})
  \rightarrow (h_9,0) \rightarrow (h_{10},L^{10}_{{\bf r},z}) \label{seq1}.
\end{equation}
The driven time for each steps are $t_1$, $t_2$, ..., $t_{10}$, respectively.
According to Eq. (\ref{ip2}), for this system we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
   &|\langle0| (a_{j_2}(T)a^{\dagger}_{j_1}(0)+a^{\dagger}_{j_1}(0)a_{j_2}(T))|0\rangle|^2 \\
          =&|\langle 0| a_{j_2}(T)a^{\dagger}_{j_1}(0)|0\rangle|^2  \\
          =&|\langle j_2| e^{-i\hat{H}_{s10}t_{10} }...e^{-i\hat{H}_{s2}t_2 } e^{-i\hat{H}_{s1}t_1 }|j_1\rangle|^2.  \\
  \end{split} \label{effe}
\end{equation}
Except for the shift by a constant matrix, $\hat{H}_{s1}$, $\hat{H}_{s2}$,..., $\hat{H}_{s1}$ take the form of $H_{s1}$, $H_{s2}$,...$H_{s10}$ in momentum space, respectively (under basis
$A_B=[a_{{\bf k},1A},a_{{\bf k},1B},a_{{\bf k},2A},a_{{\bf k},2B}]$).
Going the beyond single--article limit and using the conclusions in Ref. \cite{prosen2008third,diehl2008quantum,SongYaoWang}, or Appendix A of
Ref. \cite{HelicalDamping}, the Green function
\begin{equation} 
  \Delta_{{\bf r}_1z_1m_1,{\bf r}_2z_2m_2}(t)=
  Tr[\rho(t)a^{\dagger}_{{\bf r}_1z_1m_1}a_{{\bf r}_2z_2m_2}]
\end{equation}
satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \Delta(nT)=
  e^{-2n\mathbb{I}(\gamma_3t_1+\gamma_0 (t_3+t_4+t_5))}(e^{-iH_{s10}t_{10}}...e^{-iH_{s2}t_2}e^{-iH_{s1}t_1})^n\Delta(0)
  (e^{iH_{s1}^{\dagger}t_{1}}e^{iH_{s2}^{\dagger}t_2}...e^{iH_{s10}^{\dagger}t_{10}})^n \label{Gf},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{I}$ is identity matrix, $n$ is positive integer.
According to Eq. (\ref{Gf}), the many-particle dynamics is also governed by the model in the main text.

    "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of computing $\\text{deg}(f^n)$, the degrees of iterates of a birational map $f:\\mathbb{P}^N\\rightarrow\\mathbb{P}^N$. For this goal, we develop a method based on two main ingredients: the factorization of a polynomial under pull-back of $f$, based on local indices of a polynomial associated to blow-ups used to resolve the contraction of hypersurfaces by $f$, and the propagation of these indices along orbits of $f$.\n  For maps admitting algebraically stable modifications $f_X:X\\rightarrow X$, where $X$ is a variety obtained from $\\mathbb P^N$ by a finite number of blow-ups, this method leads to an algorithm producing a finite system of recurrent equations relating the degrees and indices of iterated pull-backs of linear polynomials. We illustrate the method by three representative two-dimensional examples. It is actually applicable in any dimension, and we will provide a number of three-dimensional examples as a separate companion paper.",

    "abstract": "The repeating FRB 20121102A was localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy and found to be co-located with a persistent radio source (PRS). FRB 20190520B is only the second known source sharing phenomenology akin to FRB 20121102A's, with similar burst activity, host galaxy properties, as well as being associated with a PRS. PRS emission is potentially a calorimeter, allowing us to estimate the energy output of the central FRB engine. Independently of FRB studies, PRSs have been found in dwarf galaxies and interpreted as intermediate mass black holes. To improve our understanding of such sources associated with dwarf galaxies, it is imperative to increase the known sample size. Here, we present a search for compact radio sources coincident with dwarf galaxies, discuss source candidates and planned strategies to differentiate them between candidate FRB hosts and intermediate mass black holes.",

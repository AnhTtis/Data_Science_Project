    "abstract": "We introduce a generalized frustrated Dicke trimer model where three Dicke models are coupled in sequence via direct photon hopping and investigate the stability of a recently found frustrated superradiant phase and the associated two critical scalings [Phys.Rev.Lett. 128, 163601] in the presence of two symmetry-breaking perturbations. The first type of perturbation breaks time-reversal symmetry by synthesizing an artificial gauge field in the cavity and is manifested in the phase of the photon hopping amplitude. We find that this type of perturbation demolishes the two critical scalings but allows the emergence of a new scaling behavior with unconventional exponent $1.5$ in the frustrated superradiant phase and finite critical fluctuations when approaching the critical point from the normal phase. Remarkably, the two critical scalings appear again at a tricritical point in both the normal phase and superradiant phase. The second type of perturbation comes from tuning the anisotropy of the Dicke model, such that in the isotropic case the $Z_2$ parity symmetry of the Dicke model turns into a $U(1)$ continuous symmetry of the Tavis-Cummings model. We find the emergence of a zero-energy mode in the superradiant phase which can be attributed to a phase redundancy of the ground state solutions in the isotropic model.",

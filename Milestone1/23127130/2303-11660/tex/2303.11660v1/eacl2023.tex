\section*{Limitations}
One of the biggest challenge in opinion summarization is the multi-document setting where each document represents one product review. Since the number of reviews for a product tends to be large, it would be unrealistic to concatenate all input reviews and train to generate a summary in an end-to-end fashion limited by modern hardware capacity, for example, the GPU memory needed is quadratic w.r.t the input length for all transformer-based PLM. In this work, we tackle this problem by pre-filtering reviews using some heuristics (aspect seed words matching and NLI model selecting) into sub-elements of reviews with much smaller sizes. However, information is very likely to get lost and become incomplete in the pre-filtering phase, leading to inaccurate summarization. Our approach is exactly facing this problem. One way to address this drawback is to first condense each review into an encoding that contains key information of the review such as opinion aspect and opinion sentiment, and then aggregate all review vectors to generate a summary. \citet{amplayo-lapata-2021-informative} call this pipeline as \textsc{Condense-Abstract} and it has been used in both supervised and unsupervised general opinion summarization \cite{chu2019meansum, coavoux-etal-2019-unsupervised, iso-etal-2021-convex-aggregation, amplayo-lapata-2021-informative, isonuma-etal-2021-unsupervised}.

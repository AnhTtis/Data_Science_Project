In this work, we propose two simple yet effective unsupervised approaches that generate aspect and general opinion summaries by training on synthetic datasets. \textsc{SW-LOO} constructs synthetic datasets simply by exact-matching aspect seed words and outperforms existing methods consistently on all metrics and datasets. Being the first work that generates aspect summaries without using aspect seed words, \textsc{NLI-LOO} constructs synthetic datasets with an out-of-the-box NLI model and achieves on-par and sometimes even better performances compared with existing methods.

\section{Problem Formulation}

Let $C$ denote a corpus of reviews on entities $\{ e_1, e_2, \dots \}$ (products or business). Let $A_e = \{ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_M \}$ denotes a set of aspects (e.g., \textit{food} or \textit{location} for a hotel) that are relevant for the domain of entities. For each entity $e$, we define its review set as $R_e = \{ r_1, r_2, \dots, r_N \}$. Each review $r$ is a collection of sentences $ \{x_1, x_2, \dots\} $ and each sentence $x$ is a sequence of tokens $\{ w_1, w_2, \dots \}$. Each aspect $a$ is represented by a small set of \textit{seed words} (e.g., \textit{meal} or \textit{buffet} for \textit{food} aspect) $ S_a = \{ v_1, v_2, \dots \}$. Our approaches generate two types of opinion summaries: (a) \textit{general} summary that contains salient opinions over \textit{all} aspects of the entities; and (b) \textit{aspect} summary that focuses on only one specific aspect $a \in A_e$.

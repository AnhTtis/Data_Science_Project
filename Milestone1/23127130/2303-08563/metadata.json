    "abstract": "We give a birational description of the reduced schemes underlying the irreducible components of the nilpotent cone and the $\\mathbb{C}^\\times$-fixed point locus of length two in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. By producing criteria for wobbliness, we are able to determine wobbly fixed point components of type $(n_0,n_1)$ and prove that these are precisely $\\mathrm{U}(n_0,n_1)$-wobbly components. We compute the virtual equivariant multiplicities of fixed points as defined by Hausel-Hitchin and find that they are polynomial for all partitions other than $(2,1)$ and $(4,3)$. In particular, this proves that they provide an obstruction to the existence of very stable fixed points only for very specific components.",

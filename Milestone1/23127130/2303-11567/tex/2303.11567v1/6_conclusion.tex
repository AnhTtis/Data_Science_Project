\section{Conclusion}
We presented a novel one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy to achieve fully convolutional end-to-end dense detection without NMS postprocessing. By assigning soft labels to ambiguous anchors and dynamically adjusting their positive and negative degrees in the training process, we enabled the detectors strong feature representation and duplicated prediction removal abilities at the same time. The proposed o2f method exhibited superior performance to state-of-the-art end-to-end dense detectors on the COCO benchmark. Its advantages became more obvious on crowed scenes, as we demonstrated on the CrowdHuman dataset. In addition, our proposed o2f method can also be applied to detection related tasks such as instance segmentation.

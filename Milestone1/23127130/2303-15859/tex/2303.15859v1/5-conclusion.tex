We propose OpenInst, a simple yet effective query-based method for open-world instance segmentation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both cross-category and cross-dataset generalization evaluations, outperforming prior dense proposal-based and query-based methods while having a simpler structure. Our study shows that training query-based detectors solely with geometric information can lead to a robust open-world detector. Moreover, we discover that OpenInst performs well even without learning any objectness. We hope that OpenInst will serve as a strong baseline for future research and contribute to the open-world community.




% Inspired by the effectiveness and conciseness of OLN, we aim to find how geometric cues help localize objects. We have presumed that geometric cues work in two folds: serving as a learning objective and a ranking/filtering indicator. To figure out which part plays a primary role, we select query based method QueryInst as our baseline model testing geometric cues, so as to exclude the influence brought by the ranking/filtering mechanism in dense proposal-based methods. We find that box IoU serves as the best learning objective for open-world instance segmentation. What surprises us more is that OpenInst works fine even without learning any objectness. We hope this discovery may assist future research to explore the localization mechanism more thoroughly.

% Inspired by the success of OLN (Object Localization Network), we aim to examine the underlying mechanisms of geometric cues in OLN. These cues influence the detector in two ways within OLN, serving both as a learning objective and as a ranking/filtering indicator. To determine the primary role of these geometric cues, we disentangled the two aspects by incorporating them into query-based detectors, such as QueryInst, resulting in the creation of the SparseOLN.
% In SparseOLN, the classification branch is replaced with geometry-based branches, yielding state-of-the-art results in various settings and datasets for open-world instance segmentation. Specifically, in the COCO$\to$UVO scenario, SparseOLN achieves a mask AR of 53.3, suppressing the previous best performance by 2.0 AR. 
% Additionally, our study reveals that objectness is not an essential component in the open-world instance segmentation task. SparseOLN, without any objectness as a learning objective, still performs well with only a 0.2 AR decrease from the state-of-the-art result.

Open-world instance segmentation has recently gained significant popularitydue to its importance in many real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, and remote sensing. However, previous methods have either produced unsatisfactory results or relied on complex systems and paradigms. We wonder if there is a simple way to obtain state-of-the-art results. Fortunately, we have identified two observations that help us achieve the best of both worlds: 1) query-based methods demonstrate superiority over dense proposal-based methods in open-world instance segmentation, and 2) learning localization cues is sufficient for open world instance segmentation. Based on these observations, we propose a simple query-based method named OpenInst for open world instance segmentation. OpenInst leverages advanced query-based methods like QueryInst and focuses on learning localization cues. Notably, OpenInst is an extremely simple and straightforward framework without any auxiliary modules or post-processing, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. Specifically, in the COCO$\to$UVO scenario, OpenInst achieves a mask AR of 53.3, outperforming the previous best methods by 2.0 AR with a simpler structure. We hope that OpenInst can serve as a solid baselines for future research in this area.

    "abstract": "A nonrelativistic quantum theory of dark matter particles in a spherical halo is developed by using a new asymmetric equation, which is complementary to the Schrödinger equation. The theory predicts that each dark matter halo has its core and envelope with very distinct physical properties. The core is free of any quantum structure and its dark matter particles are in random motion and frequently collide with each other. However, the envelope has a global quantum structure that contains quantized orbits populated by the particles. Applications of the theory to dark matter halos with given density profiles are described, and physical implications and predictions of the theory are discussed.",

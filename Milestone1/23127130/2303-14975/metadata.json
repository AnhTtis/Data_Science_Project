    "abstract": "We describe all possible topological structures of typical one-parameter bifurcations of gradient flows on the 2-sphere with holes in the case that the number of singular point of flows is at most six. To describe structures, we separatrix diagrams of flows. The saddle-node singularity is specified by selecting a separatrix in the diagram of the flow befor the bifurcation and the saddle connection is specified by a separatrix, which conect two saddles.",

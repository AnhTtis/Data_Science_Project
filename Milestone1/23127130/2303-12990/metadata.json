    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in polymer-based data storage we introduced the new problem of characterizing the code rate and designing constant-weight binary $B_2$-sequences. Binary $B_2$-sequences are collections of binary strings of length $n$ with the property that the real-valued sums of all distinct pairs of strings are distinct. In addition to this defining property, constant-weight binary $B_2$-sequences also satisfy the constraint that each string has a fixed, relatively small weight $ω$ that scales linearly with $n$. The constant-weight constraint ensures low-cost synthesis and uniform processing of the data readout via tandem mass spectrometers. Our main results include upper bounds on the size of the codes formulated as entropy-optimization problems and constructive lower bounds based on Sidon sequences.",

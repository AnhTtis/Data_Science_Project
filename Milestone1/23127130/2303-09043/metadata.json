    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) permits the evaluation of an arbitrary function on encrypted data. However, FHE ciphertexts, particularly those based on lattice assumptions such as LWE/RLWE are very large compared to the underlying plaintext. Large ciphertexts are hard to communicate over the network and this is an obstacle to the adoption of FHE, particularly for clients with limited bandwidth. In this work, we propose the first technique to compress ciphertexts sent from the server to the client using an additive encryption scheme with smaller ciphertexts. Using the additive scheme, the client sends auxiliary information to the server which is used to compress the ciphertext. Our evaluation shows up to 95% percent and 97% compression for LWE and RLWE ciphertexts, respectively.",

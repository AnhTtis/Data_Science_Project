    "abstract": "We analyze the advantage of cell size control strategies in growing populations under mortality constraints. We demonstrate a general advantage of the adder control strategy in the presence of growth-dependent mortality, and for different size-dependent mortality landscapes. Its advantage stems from epigenetic heritability of cell size, which enables selection to act on the distribution of cell sizes in a population to avoid mortality thresholds and adapt to a mortality landscape.",

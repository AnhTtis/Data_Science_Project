abstract = {Diffusion-limited annihilation, A + A → 0, and coalescence, A + A → A, may both be exactly analyzed in one dimension. While the concentrations of A particles in the two processes bear a simple relation, the inter-particle distribution functions (IPDF) exhibit remarkable differences. However, the IPDF is known exactly only for the coalescence process. We obtain the IPDF for the annihilation process, based on the Glauber spin approach and assuming that the distances between nearest-particle pairs are statistically independent. This assumption is supported by computer simulations. Our analysis sheds further light on the relationship between the annihilation and the coalescence models.}

  abstract={Dynamical urn models, such as the Ehrenfest model, played an important role in the early days of statistical mechanics. Dynamical many-urn models generalize the former models in two respects: the number of urns is macroscopic, and thermal effects are included. These many-urn models are exactly solvable in the mean-field geometry. They allow analytical investigations of the characteristic features of nonequilibrium dynamics referred to as aging, including the scaling of correlation and response functions in the two-time plane and the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This paper contains a general presentation of these models, as well as a more detailed description of two dynamical urn models, the backgammon model and the zeta urn model.}

In all cases a scaling regime is entered for sufficiently long times, where the characteristic length scale is the 'domain size' L(t) approximately t12/, for Tf=0, and the 'nonequilibrium correlation length', xi (t) approximately t1z/, for Tf=Tc. The equal-time correlation function has the expected scaling forms f(r/L(t)) and r-(d-2+ eta )fc(r/ xi (t)) for Tf=0 and Tc respectively. The scaling function fc(x) has interesting short-distance behaviour which is elucidated using scaling arguments and by in - and 1/n-expansions. The T=0 scaling function f(x) depends on whether the spin correlations present in the initial conditions are of long or short range, as does the exponent which describes the decay of the autocorrelation function, A(t)=((Si(t))Si(O)) approximately L(t)-. Results for a quench from the equilibrium critical state to Tf=0 are consistent with theoretical predictions.}

The three main subjects which we address are: (i) Phenomenological models of aging (coarsening, trap models), (ii) Analytical results for the low-temperature dynamics of mean-field models (corresponding to the mode-coupling equations); and (iii) Simple non-disordered models with glassy dynamics. We discuss the interrelation between these approaches, and also with previous work in the field. Several open problems are underlined – in particular the precise relation between mean-field like (or mode-coupling) descriptions and finite dimensional problems. }

supporting the dimensionality dependence of the scaling exponent of the autoresponse

Also, in the presence of diverging thermodynamical fluctuations at the critical point the behaviour of the model is shown to be of the replica symmetry breaking type and there are hints of a non-trivial ultrametric structure.

We introduce a dimensionless quantity that turns out to be time independent at the critical temperature. The procedure does not need equilibration and allows for a relatively fast identification of the critical temperature. The method is first tested in the ferromagnetic Ising model and in the two-dimensional EA model and then applied to the one-dimensional Ising spin glass with power law interactions. Here we always find a finite critical temperature also in the presence of a uniform external field, in agreement with the mean-field picture for the low-temperature phase of spin glasses.}

Long supposed to be a consequence of the slow dynamics of glassy systems only, ageing phenomena could also be identified in the phase-ordering kinetics of simple ferromagnets. As a phenomenological approach Henkel et al. developed a group of local scale transformations under which two-time autocorrelation and response functions should transform covariantly. This work is to extend previous numerical tests of the predicted scaling functions for the Ising model by Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional q-state Potts models with q=3 and 8, which, in equilibrium, undergo temperature-driven phase transitions of second and first order, respectively.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General},
	abstract = {The ordering dynamics of a system with a non-conserved order parameter is considered following a quench into the ordered phase from high temperature. Newman and Bray (1990) have set up an expansion in powers of 1/n for the O(n) model to obtain correlation functions and the two-time exponent lambda , but their calculation contains a simplifying assumption which is incorrect. Tight upper and lower bounds for lambda are obtained as a function of the space dimension d. These bounds exclude the result of Newman and Bray, although the dependence of lambda on d is qualitatively very similar. Comparison with simulations shows that the first-order 1/n calculation does not agree with numerical results as well as previously thought.}

	journal = {Adv. Phys.},
	abstract = {The breakdown of ergodic behaviour is discussed as a general phenomenon in condensed matter physics. Broken symmetry is a particular case of this broken ergodicity. In a system that is non-ergodic on physical timescales the phase point is effectively confined in one subregion or component of phase space. Theoretical treatments of such systems should compute thermal averages over one component at a time. The probability distribution of physical properties can then be obtained from occurrence probabilities for different components, and moments of these distributions may be used for predicting the results of typical measurements. A two-level statistical mechanics is therefore proposed. Various aspects of the breakdown of ergodicity are discussed, including: the definition of components; mechanisms for the confinement of components; methods for computing the properties of one component; the choice of occurrence probabilities for different components; and average thermodynamic properties of broken ergodicity systems. The theory is illustrated by application to well-understood systems. It is also applied to the spin glass, which is reviewed in some detail. The broken ergodicity viewpoint is combined with a suggested characterization of the components in a spin glass, involving a bifurcation cascade. Together these provide a qualitative explanation for the irreversibility signature, the long time decays, the apparent failure of linear response theory and Maxwell relations, and blocking.}

The long time dynamics of correlations and responses are studied in detail in the different dynamical regimes and the validity of fluctuation–dissipation relations (or its violation) are shown. In particular, we show that the fluctuation–dissipation ratio X(t+tw,tw) is asymptotically a function only of the waiting time tw in the aging regime and that X→0 as tw→∞. The results are valid in any finite dimension d and for 0<σ<2 where short-range behavior is recovered. We also solve the T=0 Cahn–Hilliard dynamics of this model (conserved order parameter). An analysis of the multiscaling behavior of the autocorrelation function is presented."

In particular, we study the imaginary part of the constrained free-energy branch that corresponds to the metastable phase. Although droplets are not introduced explicitly, the metastable free energy is obtained in excellent agreement with field-theoretical droplet-model predictions. The finite-size scaling properties are different in the weak-field and intermediate-field regimes, and we identify the corresponding different critical-droplet shapes. For intermediate fields, we show that the surface free energy of the critical droplet is given by a Wuff construction with the equilibrium surface tension. We also find a prefactor exponent in complete agreement with the field-theoretical droplet model. Our results extend the region of validity for known results of this field-theoretical droplet model, and they indicate that this transfer-matrix approach provides a nonperturbative numerical continuation of the equilibrium free energy into the metastable phase."

	abstract = {The study of critical properties of systems with long-range interactions has attracted, in recent decades, a continuing interest and motivated the development of several analytical and numerical techniques, in particular in connection with spin models. From the point of view of the investigation of their criticality, a special role is played by systems in which the interactions are long-range enough that their universality class is different from the short-range case and, nevertheless, they maintain the extensivity of thermodynamical quantities. Such interactions are often called weak long-range. In this paper we focus on the study of the critical behaviour of spin systems with weak-long range couplings using functional renormalization group, and we review their remarkable properties. For the sake of clarity and self-consistency, we start from classical spin models and we then move to quantum spin systems.}

\section{Introduction}
Graph spanners are sparse subgraphs that approximately preserve pairwise shortest-path distances. Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected unweighted graph on $n$ vertices and let $f:\mathbb{R}_+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be a function. We say that a subgraph $H\subseteq G$ is a spanner with \emph{stretch function} $f$ iff for every pair $s, t\in V$, $\dist_H(s, t)\leq f(\dist_G(s, t))$. The research on spanners focuses on the optimal trade-offs between the stretch function $f$ and the sparsity (the number of edges) of the spanner $H$.

One extreme case is that we allow $f(d)$ to be significantly greater than $d$, and such spanners are known as \emph{multiplicative} spanners. It was shown that for every integer $k\ge 1$, there always exists a subgraph $H$ with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges and stretch function $f(d) = (2k-1)d$ \cite{althofer1993sparse}. Furthermore, this sparsity bound is tight under the Girth Conjecture of Erd{\"o}s \cite{erdos1963extremal}.

Another extreme case is that we restrict $f$ to be very close to $d$. In particular, $f(d) = d + O(1)$. There has been a line of previous work studying the sparsity of spanners with such stretch functions. When $f(d) = d+2$, it was shown that graph $G$ always has a spanner with $O(n^{3/2})$ edges \cite{aingworth1999fast}; when $f(d) = d+4$, a construction of spanner with $\tilde O(n^{7/5})$ edges was proposed in \cite{chechik2013new}; when $f(d) = d+6$, spanners with $O(n^{4/3})$ edges were known to exist by \cite{baswana2010additive}. For the lower bound side, in a recent breakthrough \cite{abboud20174}, it was proved that, for any constant $\epsilon>0$, there are graphs such that any spanner with $O(n^{4/3-\eps})$ edges has stretch $n^{\Omega(1)}$. Hence, we already have an almost complete understanding of the spanner sparsity when $f(d) = d + O(1)$.

Besides the two extreme cases mentioned above, much less is known when $f$ lies in intermediate regimes. Two notable regimes studied in previous works are the \emph{sublinear additive} regime where $f(d) = d + o(d)$, and the \emph{additive} regime where $f(d) = d + o(n)$.

As for sublinear additive spanners, Thorup and Zwick  \cite{thorup2006spanners} were the first to design a nontrivial construction of sublinear additive spanners when $f(d) = d + O(d^{1-1/k})$ where $k\geq 2$ is a constant integer, and the number of edges in the spanner is bounded by $O(n^{1 + 1/k})$. This sparsity bound was later improved to $O\bigg(n^{1+\frac{(3/4)^{k-2}}{7-2\cdot(3/4)^{k-2}}}\bigg)$ in \cite{pettie2009low}. The sparsity bound for the special case where $k=2$ was subsequently improved to $\tilde O(n^{20/17})$ by \cite{chechik2013new}. These algorithms also work for a non-constant $k$, but here we only focus on the case where $k$ is a constant, as we are mainly interested in the stretch/size dependency on $d$ and $n$. On the lower bound side, Abboud, Bodwin, and Pettie \cite{abboud2018hierarchy} proved that there exists hard instances where any spanner of stretch $f(d) = d + O(d^{1-1/k})$ must contain at least $\Omega\bigg(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}-o(1)}\bigg)$ edges for each constant $k\ge 2$. Thus, there still exists a large gap between sparsity upper and lower bounds for sublinear additive spanners.

For the additive regime where $f(d) = d + o(n)$, the tail term $f(d) - d$ is usually called the \emph{additive stretch}. A natural question is to study the best additive stretch that can be achieved by spanners with $\tilde{O}(n)$ edges. The first nontrivial construction was given by \cite{pettie2009low} with an additive stretch of $O(n^{9/16})$, which was improved subsequently by \cite{bodwin2015very, bodwin2016better} to $O(n^{3/7+\eps})$ for any constant $\epsilon>0$. On the negative side, the first stretch lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/22})$ was proved in \cite{abboud20174}, and later on raised to $\Omega(n^{1/7})$ by a sequence of works \cite{huang2021lower,lu2022better,bodwin2022new}.

\subsection{Our results}
As our primary result, we construct sublinear additive spanners that almost match the %unconditional 
lower bound from \cite{abboud2018hierarchy}.

\begin{theorem}\label{sublinear}
For any undirected unweighted graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, any constant $\delta>0$ and any integer $k\ge 2$, there is a sublinear spanner $H\subseteq G$ with stretch function $f(d)=d+O_{\delta,k}(d^{1-1/k})$ and  $O\bigg(n^{1+\frac{1+\delta}{2^{k+1}-1}}\bigg)$ edges\footnote{$O_{\delta, k}(\cdot)$ hides factors only dependent on constants $\delta, k$.}.
\end{theorem}


%In other words, the correct constant $c$ for exponential base is $2$. Our bound significantly improves upon the previous bounds \cite{pettie2009low,chechik2013new}, and almost matches the lower bound proved in \cite{abboud2018hierarchy}\footnote{We note that our upper bound does not contradict the lower bound $\Omega\bigg(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^k-1}-o(1)}\bigg)$ proved in \cite{abboud2018hierarchy}, since the lower bounds are for stretch with small factors hidden in $O_{k,\delta}(\cdot)$. In fact, our bound should be compared with their lower bound for $d^{1-\frac{1}{k+1}}$ spanners, which is $\Omega\bigg(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}-o(1)}\bigg)$, and is almost optimal.}.

%Note that, for any parameter $\delta>0$, if we let $\eps=\frac{\delta}{10k(2^{k+1}-1)}$, then \Cref{sublinear} gives a sublinear spanner with stretch function $f(d)=d+2^{O(k^2 2^k/\delta)}\cdot d^{1-1/k}$ on $O(n^{1+\frac{1+\delta}{2^{k+1}-1}})$ edges. In other words, for any constant $\delta>0$, there is a sublinear additive spanner of stretch function $f(d)=d+O_{\delta,k}(d^{1-1/k})$ and size $O(n^{1+\frac{1+\delta}{2^{k+1}-1}})$.


%Next, we study fast algorithms for constructing additive spanners. Suppose now we want to find a sparse subgraph $H\subseteq G$ such that $\dist_H(s, t)\leq \dist_G(s, t) + \err(n)$ for some small error term $e$. It is known that when $|E(H)| = 2^{O(1/\epsilon)}n$, $\err(n)$ can be made $O(n^{3/7+\epsilon})$ \cite{bodwin2016better}. However, its construction time is $\tilde{O}(mn)$ since it requires computing all-pairs shortest paths which is at least quadratic. As our secondary result, we show a subquadratic time construction algorithm.

Our second result is a slightly improved bound on linear size additive spanners upon the bound $O(n^{3/7+\eps})$ of \cite{bodwin2016better}. In addition, we show that such a spanner can be computed in subquadratic time, while previous constructions in \cite{bodwin2016better,bodwin2015very} need the computation of all-pairs shortest paths in $G$ which takes time $O(\min\{mn, n^{2.373} \})$.

\begin{theorem}\label{subquad}
For any undirected unweighted graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ egdges, there exists a spanner with $O(n^{0.403})$ additive stretch and $O(n)$ edges. Moreover, such a spanner can be computed in time $\tilde{O}\big(m + n^{13/7}\big)$.
\end{theorem}

We start with preliminaries in \Cref{sec: prelim}. We provide a construction for pairwise additive spanners in \Cref{sec: pairwise}, which will be a building block in the proof of \Cref{sublinear} which appears in \Cref{sec: sublinear spanner}.
Next, we show the construction of subset spanners in \Cref{sec: subset}, which will be a crucial subroutine used in the algorithm of \Cref{subquad}. Lastly, we provide the proof of \Cref{subquad} in \Cref{sec: subq}.

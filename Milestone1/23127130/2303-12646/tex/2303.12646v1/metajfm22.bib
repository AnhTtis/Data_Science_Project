   abstract = {Hierarchical structures with constituents over multiple length scales are found in various natural materials like bones, shells, spider silk and others, all of which display enhanced quasistatic mechanical properties, such as high specific strength, stiffness, and toughness. At the same time, the role of hierarchy on the dynamic behavior of metamaterials remains largely unexplored. This study numerically and experimentally assesses the effect of bioinspired hierarchical organization as well as of viscoelasticity on the wave attenuation properties of continuous elastic metamaterials. We consider single-phase metamaterials formed by self-similar unit cells with different hierarchical levels and types of hierarchy. Two types of structures are considered: a hub-spoke geometry with thin connecting elements and nested hierarchical organization, and a crosslike porous geometry with external hierarchical organization. In the first, hierarchical elements occur at similar size scales, while in the second they differ by one order of magnitude. Results highlight a number of advantages through the introduction of structural hierarchy. Band gaps relative to the corresponding nonhierarchical structures are mostly preserved in both types of structures, but additional hierarchically-induced band gaps also appear, and the hierarchical configuration allows the tuning of band-gap frequencies to lower frequencies in the crosslike porous geometry, with a simultaneous significant reduction of the global structural weight. We show that even small viscoelastic effects are essential in determining the overall attenuation behavior, including between band gaps. Finally, we verify the numerically-predicted multifrequency band gaps by experimental characterization of the transmission properties of crosslike structures. The approach we propose allows the incorporation of hierarchical organization in existing metamaterial configurations, with the corresponding improvement of wave-damping properties, thus extending application possibilities for elastic metamaterials to multiple frequency scales.},

   abstract = {The study of phononic materials and structures is an emerging discipline that lies at the crossroads of vibration and acoustics engineering and condensed matter physics. Broadly speaking, a phononic medium is a material or structural system that usually exhibits some form of periodicity, which can be in the constituent material phases, or the internal geometry, or even the boundary conditions. As such, its overall dynamical characteristics are compactly described by a frequency band structure, in analogy to an electronic band diagram. With roots extended to early studies of periodic systems by Newton and Rayleigh, the field has grown to encompass engineering configurations ranging from trusses and ribbed shells to phononic crystals and metamaterials. While applied research in this area has been abundant in recent years, treatment from a fundamental mechanics perspective, and particularly from the standpoint of dynamical systems, is needed to advance the field in new directions. For example, techniques already developed for the incorporation of damping and nonlinearities have recently been applied to wave propagation in phononic materials and structures. Similarly, numerical and experimental approaches originally developed for the characterization of conventional materials and structures are now being employed toward better understanding and exploitation of phononic systems. This article starts with an overview of historical developments and follows with an in-depth literature and technical review of recent progress in the field with special consideration given to aspects pertaining to the fundamentals of dynamics, vibrations, and acoustics. Finally, an outlook is projected onto the future on the basis of the current trajectories of the field. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

   abstract = {Interest in floating breakwaters has been generated in recent years because the concept offers the potential of providing a less expensive alternative to traditional, solid wall type barriers for providing permanent wave protection to the thousands of new recreational boat harbors and marinas that have been built in the past 20 years. Also, they may be able to provide temporary, mobile wave protection during construction and installation of offshore facilities for oil transfer and production operations, defense facilities and other offshore structures in deeper water (depths exceeding 50 to 100 feet). The engineering director of one of the largest and most active offshore oil producing companies recently stated that they would be willing to pay up to $6 million for a mobile, floating breakwater that had the proven capability to significantly reduce risks due to wave action during offshore erection in the North Sea or elsewhere. Considering the investment in just one deep water oil production platform already exceeds $100,000,000, the worth of such a reusable, wave protection system during the critical erection period of a platform should be large.},

We solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations coupled with the volume of fluid technique for the modeling of the liquid phases with the interface, an immersed body method for the solid objects and an iterative strong–coupling procedure for the fluid–structure interaction. The flow incompressibility is enforced via the solution of a Poisson equation which, owing to the density jump across the interfaces of the liquid phases, has to resort to the splitting procedure of Dodd and Ferrante [1]. The solver is validated through comparisons against classical test cases for fluid–structure interaction like migration of particles in a pressure–driven channel, multiphase flows, ‘water exit’ of a cylinder and a good agreement is found for all tests. Furthermore, we show the application of the solver to the case of a surface gravity wave propagating over a submerged reversed pendulum and verify that the solver can reproduce the energy exchange between the wave and the pendulum. Finally the three–dimensional spilling breaking of a wave induced by a submerged sphere is considered.},

   abstract = {In this study, a numerical model based on the complete solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is proposed to predict the behavior of the submerged circular cylinder wave energy converter (WEC) subjected to highly nonlinear incident waves. The solution is obtained using a control volume approach in conjunction with the fast-fictitious-domain-method for treating the solid objects. To validate the model, the numerical results are compared with the available analytical and experimental data in various scenarios where good agreements are observed. First, the free vibrations of a solid object in different non-dimensional damping ratios and the free decay of a heaving circular cylinder on the free surface of a still water are simulated. Next, the wave energy absorption efficiency of a circular cylinder WEC calculated from the model is compared with that of the available experiments in similar conditions. The results show that tuning the converter based on the linear theory is not satisfactory when subjected to steep incident waves while the numerical wave tank (NWT) developed in the current study can be effectively employed in order to tune the converter in such conditions. The current NWT is able to predict the wave-body interactions as long as the turbulence phenomena are not important which covers a wide range of Reynolds and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Laboratory physical models are a valuable tool for coastal engineers. Physical models help us to understand the complex hydrodynamic processes occurring in the nearshore zone and they provide reliable and economic engineering design solutions. This book is about the art and science of physical modeling as applied in coastal engineering. The aim of the book is to consolidate and synthesize into a single text much of the knowledge about physical modeling that has been developed worldwide. This book was written to serve as a graduate-level text for a course in physical modeling or as a reference text for engineers and researchers engaged in physical modeling and laboratory experimentation. The first three chapters serve as an introduction to similitude and physical models, covering topics such as advantages and disadvantages of physical models, systems of units, dimensional analysis, types of similitude and various hydraulic similitude criteria applicable to coastal engineering models. Practical application of similitude principles to coastal engineering studies is covered in Chapter 4 (Hydrodynamic Models), Chapter 5 (Coastal Structure Models) and Chapter 6 (Sediment Transport Models). These chapters develop the appropriate similitude criteria, discuss inherent laboratory and scale effects and overview the technical literature pertaining to these types of models. The final two chapters focus on the related subjects of laboratory wave generation (Chapter 7) and measurement and analysis techniques (Chapter 8).

   abstract = {Metamaterials and photonic/phononic crystals have been successfully developed in recent years to achieve advanced wave manipulation and control, both in electromagnetism and mechanics. However, the underlying concepts are yet to be fully applied to the field of fluid dynamics and water waves. Here, we present an example of the interaction of surface gravity waves with a mechanical metamaterial, i.e., periodic underwater oscillating resonators. In particular, we study a device composed of an array of periodic submerged harmonic oscillators whose objective is to absorb wave energy and dissipate it inside the fluid in the form of heat. The study is performed using a state-of-the-art direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation in its two-dimensional form with free boundary and moving bodies. We use a volume of fluid interface technique for tracking the surface and an immersed boundary method for the fluid-structure interaction. We first study the interaction of a monochromatic wave with a single oscillator and then add up to four resonators coupled only fluid-mechanically. We study the efficiency of the device in terms of the total energy dissipation and find that by adding resonators, the dissipation increases in a nontrivial way. As expected, a large energy attenuation is achieved when the wave and resonators are characterized by similar frequencies. As the number of resonators is increased, the range of attenuated frequencies also increases. The concept and results presented herein are of relevance for coastal protection applications.},

Managing the nonlinearities of a dynamic elastic system, however, remains a challenge, and the need now exists for new strategies to model and design these wave nonlinearities. Inspired by recent research on soft architected rotating-square structures, we propose herein a design for a nonlinear elastic metasurface with the capability to achieve nonlinear acoustic wave reflection control. The designed metasurface is composed of a single layer of rotating squares connected to thin and highly deformable ligaments placed between a rigid plate and a wall. It is shown that during the process of reflection at normal incidence, most of the incoming fundamental wave energy can be converted into the second harmonic wave. A conversion coefficient of approximately 0.8 towards the second harmonic is derived with a reflection coefficient of <0.05 at the incoming fundamental frequency. The theoretical results obtained using the harmonic balance method for a monochromatic pump source are confirmed by time-domain simulations for wave packets. The reported design of a nonlinear acoustic metasurface can be extended to a large family of architected structures, thus opening new avenues for realistic metasurface designs that provide for nonlinear or amplitude-dependent wave tailoring.},

   abstract = {Phononic materials are periodically arranged building blocks in the form of material properties, geometries, and/or boundary conditions. This synthetic architecture makes phononic materials capable of manipulating mechanical waves that have potential applications across multiple disciplines of physics and engineering. Initial studies have been focused on linear phononic materials that assume small-amplitude waves. The incorporation of nonlinearity, however, has been shown to open opportunities for a new realm of dynamic responses valid beyond the small-amplitude regime. Acknowledging this potential, research in the field has undergone a paradigm shift in the last decade or so by exploiting various sources of nonlinearities within phononic materials. A comprehensive overview of the origin of nonlinearities and how they are modeled, solved, and realized in phononic materials, and specifically, what role nonlinearity plays in enabling rich nonlinear wave responses, is crucial for the future advancement of the field. In this review, we discuss recent advances in nonlinear wave propagation in phononic materials and metamaterials by drawing links between different phononic media and their nonlinearity-induced behaviors. We first briefly discuss the analytical methods employed to solve nonlinear wave propagation problems by focusing on foundational models. We then review physics-based sources of nonlinearities, primarily, material, geometric, and contact nonlinearities and elucidate nonlinear wave responses enabled by them in phononic materials and metamaterials. Finally, we outline existing challenges and possible future directions in nonlinear phononics and metamaterials.},

   abstract = {Coastal zones constitute one of the most heavily populated and developed land zones in the world. Despite the utility and economic benefits that coasts provide, there is no reliable global-scale assessment of historical shoreline change trends. Here, via the use of freely available optical satellite images captured since 1984, in conjunction with sophisticated image interrogation and analysis methods, we present a global-scale assessment of the occurrence of sandy beaches and rates of shoreline change therein. Applying pixel-based supervised classification, we found that 31% of the world's ice-free shoreline are sandy. The application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines thus identified resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984-2016. Analysis of the satellite derived shoreline data indicates that 24% of the world's sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, while 28% are accreting and 48% are stable. The majority of the sandy shorelines in marine protected areas are eroding, raising cause for serious concern.},

   abstract = {<p> Sea level rise (SLR) will cause shoreline retreat of sandy coasts in the absence of sand supply mechanisms. These coasts have high touristic and ecological value and provide protection of valuable infrastructures and buildings to storm impacts. So far, large-scale assessments of shoreline retreat use specific datasets or assumptions for the geophysical representation of the coastal system, without any quantification of the effect that these choices might have on the assessment. Here we quantify SLR driven potential shoreline retreat and consequent coastal land loss in Europe during the twenty-first century using different combinations of geophysical datasets for (a) the location and spatial extent of sandy beaches and (b) their nearshore slopes. Using data-based spatially-varying nearshore slope data, a European averaged SLR driven median shoreline retreat of 97 m (54 m) is projected under RCP 8.5 (4.5) by year 2100, relative to the baseline year 2010. This retreat would translate to 2,500 km <sup>2</sup> (1,400 km <sup>2</sup> ) of coastal land loss (in the absence of ambient shoreline changes). A variance-based global sensitivity analysis indicates that the uncertainty associated with the choice of geophysical datasets can contribute up to 45% (26%) of the variance in coastal land loss projections for Europe by 2050 (2100). This contribution can be as high as that associated with future mitigation scenarios and SLR projections. </p>},

Deep learning can automate this process and widen the realm of nonlinear geometries and devices. This research illustrates a deep learning framework used to create an optimal plasmonic design for a nonlinear metamaterial. The algorithm produces a plasmonic pattern that can maximize the second-order nonlinear effect of a nonlinear metamaterial. A nanolaminate metamaterial is used as a nonlinear material, and plasmonic patterns are fabricated on the prepared nanolaminate to demonstrate the validity and efficacy of the deep learning algorithm. The optimal pattern produced yielded second-harmonic generation from the nanolaminate with normal incident fundamental light. The deep learning architecture applied in this research can be expanded to other optical responses and light-matter interaction processes.},

   abstract = {A novel design concept for a wave energy converter (WEC) is presented and analysed. Its purpose is to balance the theoretical capacity for power absorption against engineering design issues which plague many existing WEC concepts. The WEC comprises a fully submerged buoyant circular cylinder tethered to the sea bed by a simple mooring system which permits coupled surge and roll motions of the cylinder. Inside the cylinder a mechanical system of pendulums rotate with power generated by the relative rotation rates of the pendulums and the cylinder. The attractive features of this design include: making use of the mooring system as a passive component of the power take off (PTO); using a submerged device to protect it from excessive forces associated with extreme wave conditions; locating the PTO within the device and using a PTO mechanism which does not need to be constrained; exploiting multiple resonances of the system to provide a broad-banded response. A mathematical model is developed which couples the hydrodynamic waves forces on the device with the internal pendulums under a linearized framework. For a cylinder spanning a wave tank (equivalent to a two-dimensional assumption) maximum theoretical power for this WEC device is limited to 50 % maximum efficiency. However, numerical results show that a systematically optimized system can generate theoretical efficiencies of more than 45 % over a 6 s range of wave period containing most of the energy in a typical energy spectrum. Furthermore, three-dimensional results for a cylinder of finite length provide evidence that a cylinder device twice the length of its diameter can produce more than its own length in the power of an equivalent incident wave crest.},

Born in the soil, seismic metamaterials have emerged from the field of tuned-resonators buried in the soil, around building's foundations or near the soil-structure interface as local seismic isolators. Forests of trees have been interpreted as above-surface resonators, and coined natural seismic metamaterials.

   abstract = {In this paper, we compare the heave, surge, and pitch dynamics of a submerged cylindrical point absorber, simulated using potential flow and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The potential flow model is based on the time-domain Cummins equation, whereas the CFD model uses the fictitious domain Brinkman penalization technique. The submerged cylinder is tethered to the seabed using a power take-off (PTO) unit, which restrains the heave, surge, and pitch motions of the converter and absorbs energy from all three modes. It is demonstrated that the potential theory overpredicts the amplitudes of heave and surge motions, whereas it results in an insignificant pitch for a fully submerged axisymmetric converter. It also underestimates the slow drift of the buoy, which the CFD model is able to capture reliably. Furthermore, we use fully resolved CFD simulations to study the performance of a three degrees of freedom cylindrical buoy under varying PTO coefficients, mass density of the buoy, and incoming wave heights. It is demonstrated that the PTO coefficients predicted by the linear potential theory are sub-optimal for waves of moderate and high steepness. The wave absorption efficiency improves significantly when a value higher than the predicted value of the PTO damping is selected. Simulations with different mass densities of the buoy show that converters with low mass densities have an increased tension in their PTO and mooring lines. Moreover, the mass density also influences the range of resonance periods of the device. Finally, simulations with different wave heights show that at higher heights, the wave absorption efficiency of the converter decreases and a large portion of available wave power remains unabsorbed.},

In a recent paper ( 1 ) the reflexion of surface waves by a submerged plane barrier has been considered, and it has been shown that there is a reflected wave of finite amplitude at a great distance from the barrier, so that the coefficient of reflexion (the ratio of the amplitudes, at a great distance from the barrier, of the reflected and incident waves) is finite. In this paper it is shown that in the case of reflexion by a submerged circular cylinder, the coefficient of reflexion is zero, with the result that the only effect of the obstacle at a great distance is that there is a phase-difference between the incident and transmitted waves, their amplitudes being the same. Only one case has been worked out in detail numerically, and the method employed is such that the condition that the section of the cylinder must be a stream-line has been satisfied only to an approximation; it is, however, shown that the coefficient of reflexion is zero in the general case.},

A familiar example is the accelerated motion of a sphere through an ideal (inviscid and irrotational) fluid, which has an added mass equal to one-half the mass of the fluid displaced. The period of oscillation of a simple pendulum in a vacuum is independent of its mass because of the equivalence of gravitational and inertial masses. In contrast, in a fluid both buoyancy and added mass affect the period. We present experimental results on simple pendula of different materials oscillating in various fluids.

   abstract = {Axisymmetric point absorbers are mostly designed as floating buoys that extract power from heave motion. Power absorption limits of such wave energy converters (WECs) are governed by the displaced volume of the buoy and its ability to radiate waves. In the case of fully submerged WECs, the power performance becomes a function of additional variables including the proximity to the mean surface level of the water, body shape and the maximum stroke length of the power take-off system. Placing the body below the water surface increases its survivability in storm conditions but changes the hydrodynamic properties of the WEC including maximum absorbed power. This paper investigates the differences between floating and fully submerged point absorber converters from the number of perspectives including energy extraction, bandwidth, and optimal size for a particular wave climate. The results show that when compared with floating converters, fully submerged buoys: (i) generally absorb less power at longer wavelengths, (ii) have narrower bandwidth, (iii) cannot be replaced by smaller units of the same total volume without a significant loss of power, and (iv) have a significant advantage as they can effectively utilise several modes of motion (e.g. surge and heave) in order to increase power generation.},

   abstract = {<p>The humble pendulum is often invoked as the archetype of a simple, gravity driven, oscillator. Under ideal circumstances, the oscillation frequency of the pendulum is independent of its mass and swing amplitude. However, in most real-world situations, the dynamics of pendulums is not quite so simple, particularly with additional interactions between the pendulum and a surrounding fluid. Here we extend the realm of pendulum studies to include large amplitude oscillations of heavy and buoyant pendulums in a fluid. We performed experiments with massive and hollow cylindrical pendulums in water, and constructed a simple model that takes the buoyancy, added mass, fluid (nonlinear) drag and bearing friction into account. To first order, the model predicts the oscillation frequencies, peak decelerations and damping rate well. An interesting effect of the nonlinear drag captured well by the model is that, for heavy pendulums, the damping time shows a non-monotonic dependence on pendulum mass, reaching a minimum when the pendulum mass density is nearly twice that of the fluid. Small deviations from the model’s predictions are seen, particularly in the second and subsequent maxima of oscillations. Using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV), we reveal that these deviations likely arise due to the disturbed flow created by the pendulum at earlier times. The mean wake velocity obtained from PIV is used to model an extra drag term due to incoming wake flow. The revised model significantly improves the predictions for the second and subsequent oscillations.</p>},

   abstract = {The motion of a tethered spherical buoy subjected to incident regular waves was measured in a wave tank. Transverse instability was observed when the period of the wave generated was close to one-half of the natural period of the buoy. The transverse instability confirmed as Mathieu type was predominant at the surface but diminished with increase in the depth of submergence. The stable and unstable zones were determined on the Mathieu's instability diagram. Experimental results were in agreement with the predicted zone of instability for a two degree of freedom oscillation problem of Mathieu type which has a periodically varying spring constant. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Grue1992,
   abstract = {Nonlinear diffraction of low-amplitude gravity waves in deep water due to a slightly submerged obstacle is studied experimentally in a wave channel and theoretically. The obstacle is either a circular cylinder or a rectangular shelf. The incoming waves (with wavelength A) undergo strong nonlinear deformations at the obstacle when the wave amplitude is finite. An infinite number of superharmonic waves are then introduced to the flow. Their wavelengths far away from the obstacle are A/4, A/9, A/16,.. . , due to the dispersion relation being quadratic in the wave frequency. The superharmonic wave amplitudes grow with increasing incoming wave amplitude up to saturation values. They are found to be prominent at the obstacle's lee side and vanishingly small at the weather side. The second-and third-harmonic wave amplitudes are, surprisingly, in several examples found to be comparable to the incoming wave amplitude. Up to 25% of the incoming energy flux may be transferred to the shorter waves. The theoretical model accounts for nonlinearity by the Boussinesq equations in the shallow region above the obstacle, with patching to linearized potential theory in the deep water. The theory explains both qualitatively and quantitatively the trends observed in the experiments up to breaking.},

   abstract = {Measurements of forces experienced by a submerged horizontal cylinder with its axis parallel to the crests in deep-water waves reveal nonlinear components with frequencies up to three times the fundamental wave frequency. The dominant nonlinear contribution to the loading is a t the third order in the wave amplitude, and, for Keulegan4arpenter numbers approaching 2, its magnitude was found to be as much as one-half that of the inertia force. It is suggested that the third-order force is associated with circulation generated by steady streaming in the oscillatory boundary layer on the cylinder. At higher Keulegan-Carpenter numbers, form drag becomes increasingly important, and velocity measurements close to the cylinder show the rapid development of the wake. Observations of nonlinear features of the transmitted waves are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Metamaterials exploit local resonances to reflect acoustic signals with wavelengths well above the characteristic size of the material's structure. This has allowed obtaining materials that present low-frequency (albeit narrow) band gaps or devices for optical and acoustic cloaking. In this work, we propose to use an array of resonating structures (herein termed a " metastructure") buried around sensitive buildings to control the propagation of seismic waves. These seismic metastructures consist of arrays of cylindrical tubes containing a resonator suspended by soft bearings. To obtain broadband attenuation characteristics, each resonator in the array is designed to exhibit a different eigenfrequency. We study the response of these systems using numerical analysis and scaled (1:30) experiments. We target wave mitigation in the infrasound regime (1-10 Hz), a range of frequencies relevant for the protection of large buildings.},

This gives rise to a low-frequency resonant band gap in which water waves can be strongly reflected by the resonator array. For a damping resonator array, the resonant gap can also dramatically modify the absorption efficiency of water waves. The results provide a mechanism to block water waves and should find applications in ocean wave energy extraction. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

@article{Davies1984,
   abstract = {Surface waves travelling in water of finite depth may be scattered by a region of undulating bottom topography. The present study is concerned with the idealized two-dimensional situation in which long-crested surface waves are incident upon a patch of long-crested regular bottom ripples. The principal question examined concerns the amount of incident wave energy that is reflected by the ripple patch. Linear perturbation theory is used to show that the reflection coefficient is both oscillatory in the quotient of the length of the patch and the surface wavelength, and also strongly dependent upon the quotient of the surface and bed wavelengths. In particular, there is a Bragg resonance between the surface waves and the ripples, which is associated with the reflection of incident wave energy. A secondary question concerns the nature of the wave field in the immediate vicinity of the ripple patch. In resonant cases, it is shown how the partially standing wave on the upwave side of the ripple patch gives way, in an almost linear manner over the patch itself, to a progressive transmitted wave on the downwave side. The theoretical predictions are compared with an extensive set of laboratory observations made in a wave tank, Comparisons relating both to the reflection coefficient, and also to the wave field over the ripple patch, are shown to give consistently good agreement. Finally, the implications of the results for sediment transport on an erodible bed are examined.},

New experiments are performed to verify the existence of the cutoff detuning frequency, the dispersive nature of the first-order wave envelope, and the radiation of second-order long waves. Measured transient and quasi-steady responses to incident wave packets and uniform wavetrains are compared with corresponding theoretical results. For quasi-steady incident waves of relatively small steepness it is found necessary to improve the theory to the second order in bar slope, in order that the calculated short-wave envelopes agree with those measured over the bars.</p>},

@article{Kar2020,
   abstract = {Bragg scattering of long gravity waves by an array of floating elastic plates in the presence of a series of rectangular trenches is studied under the assumption of linearized water wave theory and small amplitude structural response. Bragg reflection occurs in the case of an array of multiple floating flexible plates and trenches in isolation or combination, and the number of sub-harmonic peaks between two consecutive peaks is two less than the number of plates/trenches. In the case of long-wave scattering by an array of trenches in the absence of floating plates, wave reflection becomes zero minimum for a certain fixed wavenumber at the end of the first cycle (as referred to 0 < k1h1 < 0.32), irrespective of the even/odd number of trenches. Furthermore, the Bragg resonant reflection pattern of the second cycle is a mirror image of the reflection occurring in the first cycle. Conversely, the symmetric pattern of Bragg reflection exhibited in the case of an array of trenches does not occur for an array of plates in isolation or for plates and trenches in combination. Between consecutive harmonic peaks, the minima/maxima in the wave reflection occur in the case of the even/odd number of trenches/plates in isolation. In contrast, it occurs within the first cycle in the case of trenches and plates in combination. Between consecutive harmonic peaks, maxima/minima of wave reflection coincide for a certain wavenumber, irrespective of the even/odd number of trenches/plates in isolation. In addition, these maxima attained for a certain wavenumber for the even number of trenches/plates are 180° out of phase to that of minima for an odd number of trenches/plates. However, similar phenomena occur within the first cycle of Bragg resonance in the case of trenches and plates in combination. Moreover, the amplitude of oscillation in the wave reflection increases with an increase in plate rigidity. Time-dependent motion due to Bragg scattering by trenches and plates is demonstrated in different cases.},

\begin{abstract}
Glyph-based visualization is one of the main techniques for visualizing complex multivariate data. With small glyphs, data variables are typically encoded with relatively low visual and perceptual precision. Glyph designers have to contemplate the trade-offs in allocating visual channels when there is a large number of data variables. While there are many successful glyph designs in the literature, there is not yet a systematic method for assisting visualization designers to evaluate different design options that feature different types of trade-offs. In this paper, we present an evaluation scheme based on the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology. The scheme provides designers with a structured way to consider their glyph designs from a range of perspectives, while rendering a semi-quantitative template for evaluating different design options. In addition, this work provides guideposts for future empirical research to obtain more quantitative measurements that can be used in MCDA-aided glyph design processes.

Her research is mainly on human joint and lower-limb biomechanics and gait analysis. In collaboration with colleagues in Oxford, she helped to develop a multi-segment foot model and a method for estimating the position of the hip joint centre, both of which are now used worldwide in motion capture studies of gait. Her other research has added to our knowledge of foot and ankle biomechanics and the mechanics of the human knee joint, its ligaments, and its replacement.

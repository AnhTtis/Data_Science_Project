    "abstract": "The one-dimensional pseudo-Leja sequences introduced in \\cite{bialas2012pseudo}, as an alternative to Leja sequences, provides us with good interpolation nodes for the approximation of holomorphic functions. Here, we propose a definition of multidimensional pseudo-Leja sequences associated to a compact set $K$ of the complex space $\\mathbb{C}^n$ which generalizes well, both the one-dimensional version and the multidimensional Leja sequences. We show that these sequences can be used to calculate the transfinite diameter of $K$. We also present a relation to the pluricomplex Green function associated to $K$. Subsequently, we show that pseudo-Leja sequences for a Cartesian product of compact sets (which can be of different dimensions) are obtained by intertwining the pseudo-Leja sequences of the underlying compact sets. We prove that these intertwining sequences provide good interpolation points in the case of a Cartesian product of compact planar sets. Finally, we give a method to extract pseudo-Leja sequences from admissible meshes.",

In this paper, we tackled stock trend prediction in a novel way. We used four daily stock prices to jointly predict their trends for an arbitrary length of time. We introduced the first fully 2D-convolutional model for predicting stock trends based on the semantic segmentation of these price frames. We used Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to extract high-quality features from raw daily prices and encode them in coarse multi-scale feature maps in parallel. Using a deconvolutional decoder, segmentation maps are generated. With increasing parallel encoder modules, or in other words, input time horizon, we show that along with highly accurate overall results, the maximum performance day can move to earlier or later days. We demonstrated that change in encoder input frame size or parallel modules can result in a different accuracy pattern in the segmentation map, one resulting in astonishing short-term prediction accuracy and the other with very impressive long-term predictions. We also compared our model with other deep learning models for different time ranges, proving the superior performance of the proposed network. Experimental results of well-known fully convolutional models for semantic segmentation show that these models have a high potential for the task of stock trend prediction.

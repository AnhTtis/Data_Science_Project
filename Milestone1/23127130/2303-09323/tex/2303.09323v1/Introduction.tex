Stock price and trend forecasting remain a classic complex field in economics. Huge challenges exist due to the random, non-stationary, non-linear, and noisy behavior of stock markets, as well as highly interconnected influencing factors such as political, economic, media, and psychological variables. Over recent years, deep learning models have become predominant and powerful tools in financial market analysis through non-linear, multivariate, and data-driven analysis, with numerous promising results in the domain \cite{LONG2020106205,info12060250,anand2021comparison,mehtab2020time}. Among relevant variants in deep learning models, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), have been widely presented in stock trend forecasting along with other time series classification problems.\\

RNNs with LSTM have been extensively adopted as the main elements for sequence analysis \cite{cho2014learning,chung2014empirical}. These models generate sequential hidden states, each depending on the current timestep’s input features and the previous hidden state. While recurrent models are conceptually intriguing for time series analysis, it has been found that for many tasks across domains, feed-forward models can substitute for recurrent models without sacrificing accuracy \cite{chen2017cnn,bai2018empirical}. Besides, their inherently sequential procedure precludes parallelization and can become the performance bottleneck. \cite{park2016fully} demonstrated that a convolutional network can achieve better performance over a recurrent network while being more than 10 times smaller. The local perception and weight sharing of CNN can greatly reduce the number of parameters, thus improving the performance and efficiency of the model.\\

These have motivated extending the easily parallelizable convolutional models for more efficient time series analysis tasks. More importantly, convolutional models can effectively extract multi-scale localized spatial features with little to no need to pre-processed data \cite{abbas2019comprehensive}, \cite{doering2017convolutional}. \cite{oil} proved that convolutional models with 2-dimensional input actually do perform better for short-term prediction than other feed-forward networks neural network models with vector input. To this end, many researchers transform price time-series data into images and then extract multi-scale temporal features using CNN to predict stock trends \cite{candlestick}. Deep convolutional networks show remarkable performance in prediction accuracy for long-range stock trading period \cite{kusuma2019using}, and in some cases, for short-term price forecasting \cite{oil}. Predicting the stock prices in the short-term range relies on short-term trends while getting the long-term range prediction relies on discovering different trading patterns. By careful design of a convolutional network, it is achievable to do both. Despite many published works that adopt convolutional networks for trend prediction, the existing CNN architectures are rather unsophisticated and unrefined.\\

We use intra-correlated market time-series from daily historical stock prices, including open, high, low, and close prices for a timeframe of T trading days. These short-term price frames are then fed to parallel deep convolutional encoders to extract local temporal features in multiple scales. In order to capture the long-term dependency, we fuse same-scale features from consecutive price frames before gradually upsampling these deep coarse feature maps back to the full-size segmentation map and consequently make predictions on the up/down trends. This way, the short-term price frame patterns are extracted from the input frames, and at the same time, long-term dependency is accounted for by incorporating multiple price frames.\\

We compared our proposed architecture with other deep learning models for stock market change trend forecasting based on historical prices and showed the superb performance of our network over previous recursive and feed-forward models. We also experimented with several other fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation to show the efficiency of both our model and other similar 2D-FCN models for this task. Lastly, with a small modification, we achieved different interesting patterns in segmentation maps for the next 20 days of trend forecasting. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item		This paper first proposes a two-dimensional intra-daily price matrix to simulate the image input style to perform semantic segmentation tasks. The final segmentation mask corresponds to the up/down trend of all the next T days' open, high, low, and close prices.\\
    
    \item 	We propose a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network that extracts and incorporates short-term and long-term patterns effectively. We use ASPP blocks to better extract the patterns with different receptive fields, and multiple levels of down-sampling to gain deep coarse feature stacks from multiple consecutive price frames.  After fusing extracted features from parallel encoder streams, a symmetrical up-sampling has been performed to reach the full-scale segmentation map for the next T days prices' change directions. \\

    \item We conducted a comprehensive experiment to study the output dense classification patterns by incorporating additional input frames. We found that not only do the overall results improve with an increased input time horizon, but the pattern also changes, resulting in the most accurate day being pushed further toward the middle of the output timeframe.\\
    
    \item  	To demonstrate the performance of the proposed network, the experimental results are evaluated from two aspects: trend prediction evaluation and semantic segmentation evaluation. In trend prediction performance evaluation, we compare the proposed model with several deep learning-based trend prediction methods. For the latter, we experiment with other infamous fully convolutional semantic segmentation networks to jointly predict future daily prices. In both aspects, our proposed architecture highly outperforms other approaches.\\

\abstract{Market financial forecasting is a trending area in deep learning. Deep learning models are capable of tackling the classic challenges in stock market data, such as its extremely complicated dynamics as well as long-term temporal correlation. To capture the temporal relationship among these time-series data, recurrent neural networks are employed. However, it is difficult for recurrent models to learn to keep track of long-term information.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been utilized to better capture the dynamics and extract features for both short-term and long-term forecasting. However, semantic segmentation and its well-designed fully convolutional networks have never been studied for time-series dense classification. We present a novel approach to predict long-term daily stock price change trends with fully 2D-convolutional encoder-decoders. We generate input frames with daily open, high, low, and close prices for a time-frame of T days. The aim is to predict future trends by pixel-wise classification of the current price frame. We propose a hierarchical CNN structure to encode multiple price frames to multiscale latent representation in parallel using Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) blocks and take that temporal coarse feature stacks into account in the decoding stages. Our hierarchical structure of CNNs make it capable of capturing both long and short-term temporal relationships effectively. The effect of increasing the input time horizon via incrementing parallel encoders has been studied with interesting and substantial changes in the output semantic segmentation maps. We achieve overall accuracy and AUC of \%78.18 and 0.88 for joint trend prediction over the next 20 days, surpassing other semantic segmentation approaches. One variation of the proposed framework results in \%83.19 in accuracy for four prices trends predictions of the next day, and the other variation achieves \%88.14 for the tenth day, the highest in a 20-day time-frame. Finally, we compared our proposed model with several deep learning models that were specifically designed for technical analysis and found that for different output horizons, our proposed model variations outperformed the other models.}

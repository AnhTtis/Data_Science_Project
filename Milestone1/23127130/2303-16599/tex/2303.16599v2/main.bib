@article{aue2013,
	abstract = {This paper gives an account of some of the recent work on structural breaks in time series models. In particular, we show how procedures based on the popular cumulative sum, CUSUM, statistics can be modified to work also for data exhibiting serial dependence. Both structural breaks in the unconditional and conditional mean as well as in the variance and covariance/correlation structure are covered. CUSUM procedures are nonparametric by design. If the data allows for parametric modeling, we demonstrate how likelihood approaches may be utilized to recover structural breaks. The estimation of multiple structural breaks is discussed. Furthermore, we cover how one can disentangle structural breaks (in the mean and/or the variance) on one hand and long memory or unit roots on the other. Several new lines of research are briefly mentioned.},

	abstract = {Several widely used tests for a changing mean exhibit nonmonotonic power in finite samples, due to ``incorrect'' estimation of nuisance parameters under the alternative. In this paper, we study the issue of nonmonotonic power in testing for changing mean. We investigate the asymptotic power properties of the tests, using a new framework where alternatives are characterized as having ``large'' changes. The asymptotic analysis provides a theoretical explanation to the power problem. Modified tests that have monotonic power against a wide range of alternatives of structural change are proposed. Instead of estimating the nuisance parameters based on ordinary least squares residuals, the proposed tests use modified estimators, based on nonparametric regression residuals. It is shown that tests based on the modified long-run variance estimator provide an improved rate of divergence of the tests under the alternative of a change in mean. Tests for structural breaks based on such an estimator are able to remain consistent, while still retaining the same asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of constant mean.},

 abstract = {A test for long-run memory that is robust to short-range dependence is developed. It is an extension of the "range over standard deviation" or R/S statistic, for which the relevant asymptotic sampling theory is derived via functional central limit theory. This test is applied to daily and monthly stock returns indexes over several time periods and, contrary to previous findings, there is no evidence of long-range dependence in any of the indexes over any sample period or sub-period once short-range dependence is taken into account. Illustrative Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the modified R/S test has power against at least two specific models of long-run memory, suggesting that stochastic models of short-range dependence may adequately capture the time series behavior of stock returns.},

We introduce a new concept of physical dependent processes in the space of square integrable functions, which adopts the idea of basis decomposition of functional data in these spaces, and derive Gaussian and multiplier bootstrap approximations for sums of high-dimensional functional time series. These results have numerous important statistical consequences. Exemplarily, we consider the development of joint simultaneous confidence bands for the mean functions and the construction of tests for the hypotheses that the mean functions in the panel dimension are parallel. The results are illustrated by means of a small simulation study and in the analysis of Canadian temperature data.}},

 abstract = {We develop a procedure for analyzing multivariate nonstationary time series using the SLEX library (smooth localized complex exponentials), which is a collection of bases, each basis consisting of waveforms that are orthogonal and time-localized versions of the Fourier complex exponentials. Under the SLEX framework, we build a family of multivariate models that can explicitly characterize the time-varying spectral and coherence properties. Every model has a spectral representation in terms of a unique SLEX basis. Before selecting a model, we first decompose the multivariate time series into nonstationary components with uncorrelated (nonredundant) spectral information. The best SLEX model is selected using the penalized log energy criterion, which we derive in this article to be the Kullback—Leibler distance between a model and the SLEX principal components of the multivariate time series. The model selection criterion takes into account all of the pairwise cross-correlation simultaneously in the multivariate time series. The proposed SLEX analysis gives results that are easy to interpret, because it is an automatic time-dependent generalization of the classical Fourier analysis of stationary time series. Moreover, the SLEX method uses computationally efficient algorithms and hence is able to provide a systematic framework for extracting spectral features from a massive dataset. We illustrate the SLEX analysis with an application to a multichannel brain wave dataset recorded during an epileptic seizure.},

The asymptotic distribution of an estimator based on the local infinite autoregressive representation is derived, and asymptotic formulas for the mean squared error of the estimator, and the asymptotically optimal bandwidth are obtained. In spite of long memory, the optimal bandwidth turns out to be of the order n-1/5 and inversely proportional to the square of the second derivative of d. In this sense, local estimation of d is comparable to regression smoothing with iid residuals."

We adopt a semi-parametric approach in order to avoid fitting a time-varying parametric model, such as tvARFIMA, to the observed data. We study the asymptotic behavior of a local log-regression wavelet estimator of the time-dependent d. Both simulations and a real data example complete our work on providing a fairly general approach."

abstract = {We propose a rank-test of the null hypothesis of short memory stationarity possibly after linear detrending. For the level-stationarity hypothesis, the test statistic we propose is a modified version of the popular KPSS statistic, in which ranks substitute the original observations. We prove that the rank KPSS statistic shares the same limiting distribution as the standard KPSS statistic under the null and diverges under I(1) alternatives. For the trend-stationarity hypothesis, we apply the same rank KPSS statistic to the residuals of a Theil–Sen regression on a linear trend. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the Theil–Sen estimator under short memory errors and prove that the Theil–Sen detrended rank KPSS statistic shares the same weak limit as the least-squares detrended KPSS. We study the asymptotic relative efficiency of our test compared to the KPSS and prove that it may have unbounded efficiency gains under fat-tailed distributions compensated by very moderate efficiency losses under thin-tailed distributions. For this and other reasons discussed in the body of the article our rank KPSS test turns out to be a valuable alternative to the KPSS for most real-world economic and financial applications. The weak convergence results and asymptotic representations proved in this article should interest a wider audience than that concerned with stationarity testing, as they extend to ranks analogous invariance principles widely used in unit-root econometrics.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper considers the application of long-memory processes to describing inflation for ten countries. We implement a new procedure to obtain approximate maximum likelihood estimates of an ARFIMA—GARCH process; which is fractionally integrated I(d) with a superimposed stationary ARMA component in its conditional mean. Additionally, this long memory process is allowed to have GARCH type conditional heteroscedasticity. On analysing monthly post-World War II CPI inflation for ten different countries, we find strong evidence of long memory with mean reverting behaviour for all countries except Japan, which appears stationary. For three high inflation economies there is evidence that the mean and volatility of inflation interact in a way that is consistent with the Friedman hypothesis.},

The proposed time-varying ARFIMA–GARCH model is applied to the monthly CPI inflation rates of the seven advanced economies (G7) from 1955 to 2014. The main finding of this study is that neglecting structural changes in the inflation level and volatility appears to overestimate the long run and GARCH persistence. Moreover, the identified shifts in the inflation dynamics are in line with economic and political events that marked the examined period.}

abstract="In the last decade, several HRV based novel methodologies for describing and assessing heart rate dynamics have been proposed in the literature with the aim of risk assessment. Such methodologies attempt to describe the non-linear and complex characteristics of HRV, and hereby the focus is in two of these characteristics, namely long memory and heteroscedasticity with variance clustering. The ARFIMA-GARCH modeling considered here allows the quantification of long range correlations and time-varying volatility. ARFIMA-GARCH HRV analysis is integrated with multimodal brain monitoring in several acute cerebral phenomena such as intracranial hypertension, decompressive craniectomy and brain death. The results indicate that ARFIMA-GARCH modeling appears to reflect changes in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) dynamics related both with the Acute Brain Injury (ABI) and the medical treatments effects.",

abstract = {This paper addresses an important problem of modeling and prediction of phenomena with antipersistent behavior and variance changing in time. As a proper stochastic model we propose an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) process with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) noise. First, we introduce a simple identification and validation algorithm for such model. Second, we apply the algorithm to weekday data of hot water usage at urban residential blocks. We extract the deterministic sinusoidal component from the data and fit successfully the ARFIMA–GARCH model to the stochastic part. The goodness of fit is checked by examining model errors and prediction performance. All analyses are performed by the rigorous statistical procedure. The proposed model allows for real-time accurate predictions and when implemented at a hot water supply level will lead to a better optimization of the control system and energy efficiency use.}

Conventional QR econometric techniques lose their validity when predictors are highly persistent. I adopt and extend a methodology called IVX filtering (Magdalinos and Phillips, 2009) that is designed to handle predictor variables with various degrees of persistence. The proposed IVX-QR methods correct the distortion arising from persistent multivariate predictors while preserving discriminatory power. Simulations confirm that IVX-QR methods inherit the robust properties of QR. These methods are employed to examine the predictability of US stock returns at various quantile levels.}

In particular, the proposed medium band least squares (MBLS) estimator uses sample-size-dependent trimming of frequencies in the vicinity of the origin to account for such contamination. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the MBLS estimator are established, a feasible inference procedure is proposed, and rigorous tools for assessing the cointegration strength and testing MBLS against the existing narrow band least squares estimator are developed. Finally, the asymptotic framework for the MBLS estimator is used to provide new perspectives on volatility factors in an empirical application to long-span realized variance series for S\&P 500 equities.}

In particular, we consider models that have two features: time-varying trends and errors belonging to a class of locally stationary processes. The proposed procedure provides an efficient methodology for estimating, predicting and handling missing values for non-stationary processes. We consider a truncated infinite-dimensional state space representation and, with the Kalman filter algorithm we estimate the parameters of the model. As suggested by the Monte Carlo simulation studies, the performance of the Kalman filter approach is very good, even with small sample sizes. Finally, the proposed methodology is used in two real life applications.}

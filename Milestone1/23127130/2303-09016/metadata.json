    "abstract": "In this article we investigate the rough paths structure of a process $X_t$ living in a fixed Wiener chaos. Specifically, we formulate various types of rough lifts of $X_t$ and study their properties. As application, we study the integrabilities of quantities related to rough differential equations driven by $X_t$.",

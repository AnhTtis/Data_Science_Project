    "abstract": "Macroscopic assemblies of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are desirable materials because of the excellent CNT properties. Amongst the methods of production of these CNT materials, the dry-draw fabrication where CNT fibers (CNTFs) are directly pulled out from a CNT forest is known to provide good physical properties. Although it is known that vertical alignment of CNT bundles within the CNT forest is important, the mechanisms behind the dry-draw fabrication of CNTFs are still not completely understood. The simplest known dry-draw model consists of CNT bundles laterally interacting by only van der Waals forces (vdWf). Here, by fully atomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the simplest dry-draw model does not produce CNTFs. We also show one important condition for a pair of adjacent CNT bundles to connect themselves under vdWf only and discuss why it leads to the failure of the simplest model.",

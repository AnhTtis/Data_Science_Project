We consider Partial Quantifier Elimination (PQE) on propositional CNF
formulas with existential quantifiers. In contrast to \ti{complete}
quantifier elimination, PQE allows to unquantify a \ti{part} of the
formula.  In this paper, we present two PQE algorithms: \Eg and
\egp. \Eg is a simple SAT-based algorithm whereas \egp is a
modification of \Eg that is more powerful and robust.  We show that
PQE can be used to generate properties of combinational and sequential
circuits.  Property generation can be viewed as a generalization of
testing.  Its goal is to check if a design has an \ti{unwanted}
property and thus is buggy. We used PQE to generate an unwanted
invariant for a buggy FIFO buffer.  We also applied PQE to invariant
generation for HWMCC benchmarks. Finally, we used PQE to generate
properties of combinational circuits mimicking symbolic simulation.
Our experiments show that PQE can efficiently generate properties for
realistic designs.

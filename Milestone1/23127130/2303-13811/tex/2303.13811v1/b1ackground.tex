\section{Some Background}
\label{sec:bg}
In this section, we discuss some research relevant to PQE and property
generation.  Information on BDD based QE can be found
in~\cite{bryant_bdds1,bdds_qe}. SAT based QE is described in
\cite{blocking_clause,fabio,cofactoring,cav09,cav11,cmu,nik1,nik2,cadet_qe}.
Our first PQE solver called \dpqe was introduced in~\cite{hvc-14}. It
is based on redundancy based reasoning that was first introduced
in~\cite{fmcad12} in terms of variables and then in~\cite{fmcad13} in
terms of clauses. The main flaw of \dpqe is as follows. Consider
taking a clause $C$ out of \prob{X}{F}. Suppose \dpqe proved $C$
redundant in a subspace where $F$ is \ti{satisfiable} and some
\ti{quantified} variables are assigned. The problem is that \dpqe
cannot simply assume that $C$ is redundant every time it re-enters
this subspace~\cite{qe_learn}. The root of the problem is that
redundancy is a \ti{structural} rather than semantic property. That
is, redundancy of a clause in a formula $\xi$ (quantified or not) does
not imply such redundancy in every formula logically equivalent to
$\xi$. 

Since \egp uses \dpqe as a subroutine, the former has the same
learning problem as the latter. In~\cite{cert_tech_rep}, we showed
that the learning problem above can be potentially solved using the
machinery of certificate clauses.  So, in the future, the performance
of PQE solving can be drastically improved via enhanced learning in
subspaces where $F$ is satisfiable. In~\cite{cert_tech_rep}, we also
introduced a PQE solver called \Apqe based on the machinery of
certificate clauses. The relation between \egp and \Apqe was explained
in Section~\ref{sec:rel}.


We are unaware of research on property generation for combinational
circuits. As for invariants, the existing procedures typically
generate some ``auxiliary'' invariants helping to prove a predefined
property. For instance, they generate loop
invariants~\cite{loop_invars} or invariants relating internal points
of circuits checked for equivalence ~\cite{ec_invars}. Another example
of auxiliary invariants are clauses generated by \ict to make an
invariant $P$ inductive~\cite{ic3}.  As we showed in
Section~\ref{sec:inv_gen_exper} (experiment 3), the invariants
generated by PQE are different from those produced by \ict.

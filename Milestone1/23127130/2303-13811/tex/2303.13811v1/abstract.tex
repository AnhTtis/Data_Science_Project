We study partial quantifier elimination (PQE) for propositional CNF
formulas with existential quantifiers. PQE is a generalization of
quantifier elimination where one can limit the set of clauses taken
out of the scope of quantifiers to a small subset of clauses. The
appeal of PQE is that many verification problems (e.g. equivalence
checking and model checking) can be solved in terms of PQE and the
latter can be dramatically simpler than full quantifier
elimination. We show that PQE can be used for property generation that
can be viewed as a generalization of testing. The objective here is to
produce an \ti{unwanted} property of a design implementation thus
exposing a bug. We introduce two PQE solvers called \Eg
and \Egp\!. \Eg is a very simple SAT-based algorithm. \egp is more
sophisticated and robust than \Eg.  We use these PQE solvers to find
an unwanted property (namely, an unwanted invariant) of a buggy FIFO
buffer. We also apply them to invariant generation for sequential
circuits from a HWMCC benchmark set. Finally, we use these solvers to
generate properties of a combinational circuit that mimic symbolic
simulation.

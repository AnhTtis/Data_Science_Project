    "abstract": "The predicted increase in the number of patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) to treat cancer calls for an optimized use of resources. To manually schedule patients on the linear accelerators delivering RT is a time-consuming and challenging task. Operations research (OR), a discipline in applied mathematics, uses a variety of analytical methods to improve decision-making. In this paper, we study the implementation of an OR method that automatically generates RT patient schedules at an RT center with ten linear accelerators. The OR method is designed to produce schedules that mimic the objectives used in the clinical scheduling while following the medical and technical constraints. The resulting schedules are clinically validated and compared to manually constructed, historical schedules for a time period of one year. It is shown that the use of OR to generate schedules decreases the average patient waiting time by 80%, improves the consistency in treatment times between appointments by 80%, and increases the number of treatments scheduled the machine best suited for the treatment by more than 90% compared to the manually constructed clinical schedules, without loss of performance in other quality metrics. Furthermore, automatically creating patient schedules can save the clinic many hours of administrative work every week.",

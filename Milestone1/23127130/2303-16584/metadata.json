    "abstract": "Fluorescence excitation by absorption of entangled photon pairs can reduce disadvantages of classical imaging techniques, like higher signal levels at low excitation power with simultaneous reduction of phototoxicity. However, current entangled photon pair sources are unreliable for fluorescence detection. To overcome this issue, ultra bright entangled photon pair source are desirable to based on nonlinear waveguides are promising candidates to enable fluorescence excitation by entangled photons. In this paper, a source consisting of a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide was developed and its key characteristics analysed. To demonstrate its suitability as key component for imaging experiments, the entangled two-photon absorption behavior of CdSe/ZnS quantum dot solutions was experimentally investigated.",

    "abstract": "Detecting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding genetic mechanisms, disease pathogenesis, and drug design. However, with the fast-paced growth of biomedical literature, there is a growing need for automated and accurate extraction of PPIs to facilitate scientific knowledge discovery. Pre-trained language models, such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have shown promising results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluated the PPI identification performance of various GPT and BERT models using a manually curated benchmark corpus of 164 PPIs in 77 sentences from learning language in logic (LLL). BERT-based models achieved the best overall performance, with PubMedBERT achieving the highest precision (85.17%) and F1-score (86.47%) and BioM-ALBERT achieving the highest recall (93.83%). Despite not being explicitly trained for biomedical texts, GPT-4 achieved comparable performance to the best BERT models with 83.34% precision, 76.57% recall, and 79.18% F1-score. These findings suggest that GPT models can effectively detect PPIs from text data and have the potential for use in biomedical literature mining tasks.",

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis to reveal the weaknesses of state-of-the-art Vietnamese language models. Our experiments show that while Vietnamese language models demonstrate good lexical and grammatical abilities in Vietnamese, they show inferior performances when questions require high-level semantic knowledge to successfully identify the unanswerability. This general result from our analysis shows that the inferior performances of Vietnamese language models on Machine Reading Comprehension task are mainly due to its inferior ability in grasping the big ``picture'' of the given context.

Besides, our analysis also show that Vietnamese MRC benchmarks overestimate the comprehension skills of models in some language aspects, so  state-of-the-art performances on MRC benchmarks does not accurately reflect the progress of Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension.

    "abstract": "Using the Hayward-Kodama temperature for the apparent horizon, it is found that matter content in the Universe is not thermodynamically stable, and the entry to the late accelerated expansion is actually a second order phase transition. The cosmological model used for the purpose is one that imitates the $Λ$CDM model, the favoured model for the present Universe.",

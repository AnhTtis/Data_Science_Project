    "abstract": "We present experimental observations of the spatial distribution of large inertial particles suspended in a turbulent swirling flow at high Reynolds number. The plastic particles, which are tracked using several high speed cameras, are heavier than the working fluid so that their dynamics results from a competition between gravitational effects and turbulent agitation. We observe two different regimes of suspension. At low rotation rate, particles are strongly confined close to the bottom and are not able to reach the upper region of the tank whatever their size or density. At high rotation rate, particles are loosely confined: small particles become nearly homogeneously distributed while very large objects are preferentially found near the top as if gravity was reversed. We discuss these observations in light of a minimal model of random walk accounting for particle inertia and show that large particles have a stronger probability to remain in the upper part of the flow because they are too large to reach descending flow regions. As a consequence particles exhibit random horizontal motions near the top until they reach the central region where the mean flow vanishes, or until a turbulent fluctuation gets them down.",

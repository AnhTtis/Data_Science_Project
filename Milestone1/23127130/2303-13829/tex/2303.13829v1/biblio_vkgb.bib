@article{bib:qureshi2008_EPJB,
abstract = {Turbulent transport of material inclusions plays an important role in many natural and industrial situations. Being able to accurately model and predict the dynamics of dispersed particles transported by a turbulent carrier flow, remains a challenge. One critical and difficult point is to develop models which correctly describe the dynamics of particles over a wide range of sizes and densities. Our measurements show that acceleration statistics of particles dispersed in a turbulent flow do exhibit specific, and so far unpredicted, size and density effects and that they preserve an extremely robust turbulent signature with lognormal fluctuations, regardless of particles size and density. This has important consequences in terms of modeling for the turbulent transport of dispersed inclusions.},

In this article, we report some motivations behind the Lagrangian description of turbulence and focus on the statistical properties of particles when advected by fully developed turbulent flows. By means of a detailed comparison between experimental and numerical results, we review the physics of particle acceleration, Lagrangian velocity structure functions, and pairs and shapes evolution. Recent results for nonideal particles are discussed, providing an outlook on future directions.},

abstract = {The distribution of glass beads in suspension in a stirred tank was examined as a function of the stirrer type, and the size and concentration of the solid particles. The axial and radial profiles of the solid concentration were ascertained by sampling the suspension. The radial profiles were generally flat; this allowed the description of the suspension by a mono dimensional model, based on turbulent dispersion. A dimensionless number was theoretically derived, and was able to correlate the variation in the quality of the suspension, for a given geometric system, as a function of stirrer speed, particle size and concentration. The same correlation was verified successfully with data obtained by other authors.}

A simple model based on a turbulent diffusion support mechanism is developed in order to interpret the observed longitudinal concentration profiles. The model is based on Kolmogorov theory of isotropic turbulence and the settling characteristics of the particles. The reasonable agreement between the theory and the measurements indicates a general applicability for the proposed model.}

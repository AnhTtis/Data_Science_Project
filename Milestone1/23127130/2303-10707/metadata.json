    "abstract": "According to our understanding of stellar evolution, early-type stars have radiative envelopes and convective cores due to a steep temperature gradient produced by the CNO cycle. Some of these stars (mainly, the subclasses Ap and Bp) have strong magnetic fields, enough to be directly observed using the Zeeman effect. Here, we present 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of an $2 ~M_{\\odot}$ A-type star using the star-in-a-box model. Our goal is to explore if the modeled star is able to maintain a magnetic field as strong as the observed ones, via a dynamo driven by its convective core, or via maintaining a stable fossil field configuration coming from its early evolutionary stages, using different rotation rates. We created two models, a partially radiative and a fully radiative one, which are determined by the value of the heat conductivity. Our model is able to explore both scenarios, including convection-driven dynamos.",

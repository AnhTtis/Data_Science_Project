    "abstract": "Based on our recent paper [arXiv:2206.12176 (2022)], we propose a scalable heteronuclear architecture of parallel implementation of CNOT gates in arrays of alkali-metal neutral atoms for quantum information processing. We considered a scheme where we perform CNOT gates in a parallel manner within the array, while they are performed sequentially between the pairs of neighboring qubits by coherently transporting an array of atoms of one atomic species (ancilla qubits) using an array of mobile optical dipole traps generated by a 2D acousto-optic deflector (AOD). The atoms of the second atomic species (data qubits) are kept in the array of static optical dipole traps generated by spatial light modulator (SLM). The moving ancillas remain in the superposition of their logical ground states without loss of coherence, while their transportation paths avoid overlaps with the spatial positions of data atoms. We numerically optimized the system parameters to achieve the fidelity for parallelly implemented CNOT gates around $F=95\\%$ for the experimentally feasible conditions. Our design can be useful implementation of surface codes for quantum error correction. Renyi entropy and mutual information are also investigated to characterize the gate performance.",

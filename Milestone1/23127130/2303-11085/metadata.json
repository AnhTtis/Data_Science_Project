    "abstract": "Spectroscopic factors involving well bound nucleons in light nuclei are calculated with standard shell model, no-core shell model and Gamow shell model. Continuum coupling is included exactly in the Gamow shell model, due to the use of the Berggren basis, which contains bound, resonance and scattering states. Conversely, it is absent from standard and no-core shell models, where a basis of harmonic oscillator states is used. As the A - 1 nuclei for which spectroscopic factors are calculated are either weakly bound or unbound, coupling to continuum is prominent, even though the A nuclei are well bound. It is then showed that Gamow shell model can properly reproduce experimental data and is a predictive tool for detailed nuclear structure at drip-line, contrary to standard and no-core shell model.",

    "abstract": "An algorithm based on a deep probabilistic architecture referred to as a tree-structured sum-product network (t-SPN) is considered for cell classification. The t-SPN is constructed such that the unnormalized probability is represented as conditional probabilities of a subset of most similar cell classes. The constructed t-SPN architecture is learned by maximizing the margin, which is the difference in the conditional probability between the true and the most competitive false label. To enhance the generalization ability of the architecture, L2-regularization (REG) is considered along with the maximum margin (MM) criterion in the learning process. To highlight cell features, this paper investigates the effectiveness of two generic high-pass filters: ideal high-pass filtering and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filtering. On both HEp-2 and Feulgen benchmark datasets, the t-SPN architecture learned based on the max-margin criterion with regularization produced the highest accuracy rate compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms that include convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms. The ideal high-pass filter was more effective on the HEp-2 dataset, which is based on immunofluorescence staining, while the LOG was more effective on the Feulgen dataset, which is based on Feulgen staining.",

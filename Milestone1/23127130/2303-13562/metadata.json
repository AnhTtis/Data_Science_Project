    "abstract": "Reservoir Computing has found many potential applications in the field of complex dynamics. In this article, we exploit the exceptional capability of the echo-state network (ESN) model to make it learn a unidirectional coupling scheme from only a few time series data of the system. We show that, once trained with a few example dynamics of a drive-response system, the machine is able to predict the response system's dynamics for any driver signal with the same coupling. Only a few time series data of an $A-B$ type drive-response system in training is sufficient for the ESN to learn the coupling scheme. After training even if we replace drive system $A$ with a different system $C$, the ESN can reproduce the dynamics of response system $B$ using the dynamics of new drive system $C$ only.",

    "abstract": "The paper describes a new supply capacity evaluation model based on the non-extensive statistical entropy. The traditional EW-TOPSIS model is selected as baseline and the GRA method is used to modify it. The correction results in the non-extensive parameter q which leads to the so-called q-EW-TOPSIS model. This new model has advantages over the traditional EW-TOPSIS model, including the ability to accurately evaluate indicator weights with smaller sample sizes and weaker rules, and a more stable and closer-to-complete structure due to the use of entropy evaluation and mutual restriction between indicators. This study provides a more reliable and universal modified EW model. It is proved to be a more compatible model with systems and own greater credibility.",

This paper proposes a novel TBP-Former for vision-centric joint perception and prediction. We design a pose-synchronized BEV encoder module using a cross-view attention mechanism to solve the distortion issues in previous works. Furthermore, we propose a powerful spatial-temporal pyramid transformer for BEV feature extraction and BEV state prediction. Experiments show that i) TBP-Former improves the prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods significantly; and ii) both PoseSync BEV Encoder and STPT contribute to better performances.

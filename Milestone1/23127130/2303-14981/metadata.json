    "abstract": "This paper concerns the linear Landau damping for the two species Vlasov-Poisson system for ions and electrons near Penrose stable equilibria. The result is an extension of the result on the one species Vlasov-Poisson equation by Mouhout and Villani. Different from their work we do not describe the ions as a background species but as a species which is also described by a separate Vlasov equation. We show an exponential decay of the electric energy for the linearised system near Penrose stable equilibria.",

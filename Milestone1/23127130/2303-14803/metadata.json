    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct new families of asymmetric quantum surface codes (AQSCs) over non-orientable surfaces of genus $g\\geq 2$ by applying tools of hyperbolic geometry. More precisely, we prove that if the genus $g$ of a non-orientable surface is even $(g=2h)$, then the parameters of the corresponding AQSC are equal to the parameters of a surface code obtained from an orientable surface of genus $h$. Additionally, if $S$ is a non-orientable surface of genus $g$, we show that the new surface code constructed on a $\\{p, q\\}$ tessellation over $S$ has the ratio $k/n$ better than the ratio of an AQSC constructed on the same $\\{p, q\\}$ tessellation over an orientable surface of the same genus $g$.",

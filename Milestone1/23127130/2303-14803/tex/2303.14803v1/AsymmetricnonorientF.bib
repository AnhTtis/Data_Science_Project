		abstract = {We study properties of stabilizer codes that permit a local description on a
			regular D-dimensional lattice. Specifically, we assume that the stabilizer
			group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes) can be generated by local
			Pauli operators such that the support of any generator is bounded by a
			hypercube of constant size. Our first result concerns the optimal scaling of
			the distance \$d\$ with the linear size of the lattice \$L\$. We prove an upper
			bound \$d=O(L^{D-1})\$ which is tight for D=1,2. This bound applies to both
			subspace and subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability
			of stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory. Any
			stabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally
			transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate the
			stabilizer condition. A degenerate ground-state of this Hamiltonian corresponds
			to the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for D=1,2 the height of the
			energy barrier separating different logical states is upper bounded by a
			constant independent of the lattice size L. The same result holds if there are
			unused logical qubits that are treated as "gauge qubits". It demonstrates that
			a self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes in
			dimensions D=1,2. This result is in sharp contrast with the existence of a
			classical self-correcting memory in the form of a two-dimensional ferromagnet.
			Our results leave open the possibility for a self-correcting quantum memory
			based on 2D subsystem codes or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes.},

		abstract = {We propose a family of exactly solvable toy models for the {AdS}/{CFT}
			correspondence based on a novel construction of quantum error-correcting codes
			with a tensor network structure. Our building block is a special type of tensor
			with maximal entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an
			isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire
			tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the
			bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical
			degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of
			entanglement in the {AdS}/{CFT} correspondence; in particular, the {Ryu-Takayanagi}
			formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many
			cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary
			regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk
			operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of
			{AdS}/{CFT} recently proposed by Almheiri et. al in <a {href="/abs/1411.7041">arXiv}:1411.7041</a>.},

				abstract={We propose a procedure for constructing new classes of codes, called polygonal color codes. This technique expands the triangular color codes introduced by Bombin and Martin-Delgado in 2007. Triangular color codes, built on a two-dimensional Euclidean surface with three edges, implement the entire Clifford group, but they only encode one qubit. In our case, polygonal color codes are constructed on two-dimensional surfaces with n edges, with n â‰¥ 3 , increasing the number of encoded qubits. Considering a surface with boundary and evaluating the generators of the first homology group of this surface, we may increase the dimension of the code without losing the transversal implementation of the Clifford group. In addition, we construct two codes, one with 2 and one with 3 encoded qubits, which exemplify the method and show that we can generate codes with better parameters than the known triangular codes. For one of these constructions, we also give general parameters.}

				year="1995",

				pages="254--282",
				abstract="As in the Euclidean case, questions of constructibility by straightedge and compass involve consideration of certain algebraic number fields called quadratic-surd fields. They are obtained by starting with the rational field and adjoining square roots in succession. Roughly speaking, a point with polar coordinates r, $\theta$ can be constructed in the Euclidean case if r and sin $\theta$ are in such a field (in which case cos $\theta$ and tan $\theta$ are also in such a field), while in the hyperbolic case, the point can be constructed if tanh r and sin $\theta$ are in such a field. The first two sections give the proof (which is not short) that if the point can be constructed, then tanh r and sin $\theta$ are in a quadratic-surd field. Section 11.6 contains the proof (also not short) that every such point can be constructed. As a result, there are certain differences between Euclidean and the hyperbolic cases. In the hyperbolic case, a segment cannot in general be trisected, while some circles can be squared (that depends on the radius). In the general theory, the constructions start with a single given line and a single given point on that line, but no segment of unit length, because a unit of length is implied by the hyperbolic axioms. Certain construction problems are considered in which other things are given in advance, for example constructing the angle of parallelism II (y), when a segment of length y is given. Since any two ideal points in the hyperbolic plane determine a unique line, it is assumed that the straightedge can draw the line between any two ideal points, but it is shown in Section 11.9 that that is not really necessary. All constructions can be made (with more trouble) if the straightedge is only assumed to be able to draw a line between any two finite points. The purpose of the last section is to show that constructibility is not merely a matter of interest for engineering or draftsmanship, but also throws light on the geometry itself. The set of constructible points (it is a countable set!) constitutes a geometry that satisfies all the axioms of the hyperbolic plane, except that there is no axiom of completeness, either for the real number system â„ or for the points on a line. (Those axioms are of course not categorical, since, in particular, the ordinary hyperbolic plane satisfies them.)",

abstract={Two new families of asymmetric quantum codes are constructed in this paper. The first one is derived from the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction applied to classical Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, providing quantum codes with parameters [[N = l(ql−1), K = l(ql−2d + c + 1), dz≥ d/dx≥ (d−c)]]q, where q is a prime power and d > c + 1, c ≥ 1, l ≥ 1 are integers. The second family is derived from the CSS construction applied to classical generalized RS codes, generating quantum codes with parameters [[N = mn, K = m(2k−n + c), dz≥ d/dx≥ (d−c)]]q, where q is a prime power, 1 < k < n < 2k + c ≤ qm, k = n − d + 1, and n, d > c + 1, c ≥ 1, m ≥ 1 are integers. Although the second proposed construction generalizes the first one, the techniques developed in both constructions are slightly different. These new codes have parameters better than or comparable to the ones available in the literature. Additionally, the proposed codes can be utilized in quantum channels having great asymmetry, that is, quantum channels in which the probability of occurrence of phase-shift errors is large when compared to the probability of occurrence of qudit-flip errors.},

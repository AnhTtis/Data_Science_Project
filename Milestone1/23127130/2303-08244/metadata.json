    "abstract": "There has been substantial research undertaken on the role of computational systems that encourage autotelic creativity. Previous studies on the role of software in autotelic creativity have not explored code editing tools in much detail. This study sets out to examine the role of code editing tools in autotelic creativity. The principal findings of this research are that existing code editors can be adapted to support casual creativity, and that casual creators exhibit standard interaction design patterns.",

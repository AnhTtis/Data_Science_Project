    "abstract": "We consider equal-mass periodic Toda oscillators with balanced loss-gain for two and three particles. The two-particle system is integrable with the Hamiltonian and the genralized total momentum being two integrals of motion. The model in its full generality is not amenable to exact analytic solutions, and investigated numerically showing existence of regular periodic solutions. The three-particle equal-mass periodic Toda lattice is considered in presence of balanced loss-gain and velocity mediated coupling. The system is Hamiltonian for the special case whenever the strength of the velocity-mediated coupling is half of the strength of the loss-gain. The model admits regular and chaotic solutions for vanishing as well as non-vanishing velocity-mediated coupling, including the Hamiltonian system. The chaos is induced due to the presence of balanced loss-gain, since undriven equal-mass Toda lattice is non-chaotic. The chaotic behaviour is studied in detail for the Hamiltonian system as well as for the system with vanishing velocity mediated coupling by using time series, Poincaré sections, auto-correlation function, power spectra, Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation diagram.",

    "abstract": "We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a universal law for the element Mn, which greatly enhances vacancy diffusion through an anomalous Friedel Oscillation effect in a series of Ni-based concentrated solid-solution alloys, regardless of the type of atom involved. The antiferromagnetic element Mn possesses a unique half-filled 3d electron structure, creating split virtual bound states near the Fermi energy level and producing a large local magnetic moment after vacancy formation. The resultant electron spin oscillations reduce the number of electrons involved in charge density oscillations, destroying charge screening and lowering potential interaction at the saddle point between the vacancy and diffusing atom. This ultimately facilitates vacancy diffusion by reducing energy level variations of conduction band electrons during the diffusion process. These findings offer valuable insights into atom diffusion mechanisms and open up new avenues for manipulating defect properties through unique element design, thereby enabling the creation of high-performance alloys in a broad range of fields.",

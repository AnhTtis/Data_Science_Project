\begin{abstract}
The problem of studying the two seemingly unrelated sets of invariants forming the Segre and the Verlinde series has gone through multiple different adaptations including a version for the virtual geometries of Quot schemes on surfaces and Calabi-Yau fourfolds. 
Our work is the first one to address the equivariant setting for both $\CC^2$ and $\CC^4$ by examining higher degree contributions which have no compact analogue. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For $\CC^2$, we work mostly with virtual geometries of Quot schemes. After connecting the equivariant series in degree zero to the existing results of the first author for compact surfaces, we extend the Segre-Verlinde correspondence to all degrees and to the reduced virtual classes. Apart from it, we conjecture an equivariant symmetry between two different Segre series building again on previous work.
    \item For $\CC^4$, we give further motivation for the definition of the Verlinde series. Based on empirical data and additional structural results, we conjecture the equivariant Segre-Verlinde correspondence and the Segre symmetry analogous to the one for $\CC^2$.

%\subsection{Non-virtual invariants on surfaces} 
\subsection{Definitions of Segre and Verlinde invariants}

Let $Y$ be a smooth quasi-projective variety. For a torsion-free sheaf $E$, the Quot scheme $\quot_Y(E,n)$ parameterizes quotients
\[E\twoheadrightarrow F\]
such that
\[\rk(F)=0,\quad c_1(F)=0,\quad \chi(F)=n.\]
When $Y=\CC^2$ is a toric surface or $Y=\CC^4$ is a toric Calabi-Yau 4-fold, we shall define equivariant Segre and Verlinde invariants on these Quot schemes and find relations between them. In the non-equivariant case where $Y$ is a smooth projective curve, surface, or a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, such relations are called Segre-Verlinde correspondences and are studied in \cite{KHilb,boj,Bojko2,GM,G_ttsche_2022,johnson,Marian_2021}.


The Segre and Verlinde invariants are defined by taking integrals or Euler characteristics of various insertions constructed using \emph{tautological bundles} 
 \[V^{[n]}=p_*(\mathcal{F}\otimes q^*V)\]
 on $\quot_Y(E,n)$ constructed for some vector bundle $V$ on $Y$. Here $$\quot_Y(E,n)\xleftarrow{p}\quot_Y(E,n)\times Y\xrightarrow{q}Y$$ are projections, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the universal quotient sheaf. This definition extends to the Grothendieck groups and associates to each $\alpha\in K^0(Y)$ the \textit{tautological class} $\alpha^{[n]}\in K^0(\quot_Y(E,n))$.  

\subsubsection{Equivariant invariants on Hilbert schemes of surfaces}

Let $S$ be a toric quasi-projective surface with an action of $\T=(\CC^*)^2$. Before introducing the equivariant invariants, we give a brief summary of equivariant cohomology and equivariant integration with a further background in Section \ref{sec:equivar-coho}. Given a $\T$-representation $V$, define its \emph{equivariant characteristic classes} by considering the associated bundle 
\[E\T\times_\T V\-> E\T\times_\T\{\pt\}=B\T\]
and taking its characteristic classes in $H^*(B\T)=H^*_\T(\pt)$. Denote $c^\T,s^\T,e_\T,\ch_\T,\td_\T$ the equivariant Chern class, Segre class, Euler class, Chern character, and Todd class respectively. From here forward, we will always use equivariant classes for toric varieties, and we will omit the torus $\T$ from the notations when it is clear from the context. In our equivariant setting, the integration $\int_{\hilb^n(S)}$ denotes the equivariant push-forward, and $\chi$ refers to the equivariant Euler characteristic.

Consider $E=\O_S$, so $\quot_S(\O_S,n)$ is the smooth Hilbert scheme $\hilb^n(S)$ parametrizing ideal sheaves of 0-dimensional subschemes of $S$ of length $n$. The action of $\T$ on $S$ lifts to an action of $\T$ on $\hilb^n(S)$, giving an equivariant structure to $\a^{[n]}$ for any equivariant K-theory class $\a\in K_\T(S)$. The \emph{Segre and Chern series}, first defined by \cite{Tyurin_1994} in the study of Donaldson invariants, are respectively
\equanum{\label{defn:chern-series}I^{\mathcal{S}}(\alpha;q):=&\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\int_{\hilb^n(S)}s(\alpha^{[n]}),\\
I^{\mathcal{C}}(\alpha;q):=&\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\int_{\hilb^n(S)}c(\alpha^{[n]}).}
These series are related by $c(\alpha^{[n]})=s(-\alpha^{[n]})$. The \emph{Verlinde series} is originally defined for moduli spaces of bundles on curves but it has since then been extended even to moduli spaces of torsion-free sheaves on surfaces in \cite{G_ttsche_2022}. For Hilbert schemes it was defined originally in \cite{EGL} in a slightly different form than we use here:
\equa{I^{\mathcal{V}}(\a;q):=&\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\chi(\hilb^n(S),\det(\a^{[n]})).
}


\subsubsection{Virtual invariants on Quot schemes}
In general, Quot schemes are not smooth, in which case we do not have a deformation invariant fundamental class to integrate against. One way to resolve this issue is to work with a virtual fundamental class $[\quot_Y(E,n)]^\vir$.

For a smooth projective surface $S$ and a vector bundle $E$, a perfect obstruction theory for $\quot_Y(E,n)$ of virtual dimension $nN$ was constructed in \cite[Lemma 1]{MOP1} and \cite[Proposition 5]{stark}. When $E$ is a torsion-free sheaf, the same was remarked in \cite{Bojko2}. To this perfect obstruction theory, one may associate a virtual fundamental class $[\quot_S(E,n)]^\vir$ \cite{BF,LiTian} and a virtual structure sheaf $\O^\vir$ \cite{k-local-vir}.  The virtual invariants are defined similarly as before, with the usual fundamental class replaced by the virtual class $[\quot_S(E,n)]^\vir$, and the Euler characteristic replaced by the virtual Euler characteristic $\chi^\vir(-):=\chi(-\otimes \O^\vir)$ which are both invariant under the deformation of the complex structure of $S$.
 
Unlike for surfaces and Fano 3-folds, the usual obstruction theory for a Quot scheme of a Calabi-Yau 4-fold $X$ is not perfect, so the previous method does not induce a virtual fundamental class. However, using the method of \cite{RICOLFI} and tools from \cite{Oh:2020rnj}, a virtual class $[\quot_X(E,n)]^\vir_{o(\mathcal{L})}\in H_{2nN}(\quot_X(E,n),\ZZ)$ was constructed in \cite[§2.1]{Bojko2} for $X$ a \emph{strict} Calabi-Yau 4-fold and $E$ a simple rigid locally-free sheaf. Here $\mathcal{L}$ denotes the determinant line bundle $\det\mathbf{R}\shom_{q}(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{I})$ on $\quot_X(E,n)$ where $\mathcal{I}$ is the universal subsheaf. As indicated by the subscript, this class is dependent on some choice of orientation $o(\mathcal{L})$, that is a choice of a square root of the isomorphism
\[Q:\mathcal{L}\otimes\mathcal{L}\->\O_{\quot_X(E,n)}\]
induced by Serre duality. There is also no canonical virtual structure sheaf, and instead, we have a ``twisted" virtual structure sheaf $\hat{\O}^\vir$. The motivation for this notation comes from its relation to the twisted virtual structure sheaf $\hat{\O}^\vir_{\NO}$ of Nekrasov--Okounkov \cite{NO} which was made precise in \cite[(84), §8]{Oh:2020rnj}. Without going into details, $\hat{\O}^\vir_{\NO}$ is defined from the usual virtual structure sheaf $\O^\vir$ on a moduli space with obstruction theory by twisting with $\text{det}^{\frac{1}{2}}\big(K^\vir\big)$ where $K^\vir$ is the virtual cotangent bundle. Square roots of determinant line bundles appear also in the construction of $\hat{\O}^\vir$, but this time they are used to make the result independent of the choices made. Another distinguishing feature is that 
$$
\hat{\O}^\vir\in K_0\big(\quot_Y(E,n), \ZZ\big[2^{-1}\big]\big)
$$
is not an integer class precisely because of the square-root determinant line bundles. To obtain integer invariants, the first author introduced in \cite[§5.3]{boj} and \cite[§1.4]{Bojko2} the \textit{untwisted virtual structure sheaf}
$$
\O^\vir = \hat{\O}^\vir\otimes \mathsf{E}^{\frac{1}{2}}\,,\qquad \mathsf{E} = \det\big((E^*)^{[n]}\big)\,.
$$
In Section \ref{sec:CY4ktheory}, we motivate this definition further by showing in the case  of $X=\CC^4$ that $\mathsf{E}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ naturally appears in the construction of $\hat{\O}^\vir$ as the only term that is not an integer class. As a consequence, we prove
\begin{proposition}[Proposition \ref{prop:integral}]
The untwisted virtual structure sheaf is integral:
$$
\O^\vir\in K_0\big(\quot_X(E,n), \ZZ\big)\,.
$$
\end{proposition}

Before defining the equivariant virtual invariants on $Y=\CC^d$, $d=2,4$, we describe the torus action used on $\quot_Y(E,n)$. Let \[\T_0=(\CC^*)^d/(\sim)=\{(t_1,\ldots,t_d):t_1,\ldots,t_d\neq 0\}/(\sim)\]
act on $Y$ naturally, where we quotient by the subgroup $\<\sim\>=\<t_1t_2t_3t_4\>$ when $d=4$. Let $
\T_1=(\CC^*)^N=\{(y_1,\dots,y_n):y_i\neq 0\}$ and $E=\oplus_{i=1}^N\O_Y\<y_i\>$ be the $\T_1$-equivariant bundle of rank $N$ with weights $y_1,\dots, y_N$. This induces a $\T_0\times \T_1$-action on $\quot_Y(E,n)$ by acting on the middle term of the sequence
\[0\->I\->E\->F\->0.\]
Let $\alpha\in K_{\T_0}(Y)$, then we can write
\[\alpha=[\oplus_{i=1}^r\O_Y\<v_i\>]-[\oplus_{i=r+1}^{r+s}\O_Y\<v_i\>]\]
where $v_1,\dots,v_{r+s}$ are its $\T_0$-weights. However, instead of thinking of $v_i$ as $\T_0$-weights, we would like to view them as generic parameters. Therefore we introduce an additional torus $\T_2=(\CC^*)^{r+s}$ acting on $\CC^r\times \CC^s$. Set $\T:=\T_0\times \T_1\times \T_2$ and denote
\equa{&K_\T(\pt)=\ZZ[t_1^{\pm1},\dots,t_d^{\pm1};y_1^{\pm1},\dots,y_N^{\pm1};v_1^{\pm1},\dots,v_{r+s}^{\pm1}]/(\sim),\\
&H^*_\T(\pt)=\CC[\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_d;m_1,\dots,m_N;w_1,\dots,w_{r+s}]/(\sim).
}
where we quotient by the ideals $(\sim)=(t_1t_2t_3t_4-1)$ and $(\sim)=(\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3+\lambda_4)$ respectively when $d=4$.

In the surface case, the equivariant virtual invariants is be defined using virtual equivariant localization of \cite{vir-loc,k-local-vir} in an analogous way as we did for the non-virtual case. For toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, the equivariant Donaldson invariants were first introduced in Cao-Leung \cite[§8]{Cao:2014bca}; the K-theoretic equivariant invariants were predicted by Cao-Kool-Monavari \cite{CKM} and formalized by J. Oh and R. P. Thomas \cite[§7]{Oh:2020rnj} using the twisted virtual structure sheaf $\hat{\O}^\vir$ and their virtual equivariant localization. 
The \textit{equivariant virtual Segre, Chern} and \textit{Verlinde series} for $\a$ on $\quot_Y(E,n)$ are respectively
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_Y(E,\a;q)&:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\int_{[\quot_Y(E,n)]^\vir}s(\alpha^{[n]}),\\
{\mathcal{C}}_Y(E,\a;q)&:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\int_{[\quot_Y(E,n)]^\vir}c(\alpha^{[n]}),\\
{\mathcal{V}}_Y(E,\a;q)&:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\chi^\vir(\quot_Y(E,n),\det(\a^{[n]})).
}
\begin{remark}
It is important to note that the above definitions, when $Y=X=\CC^4$, are dependent on a choice of orientation $o(\mathcal{L})$. This induces signs at each fixed point $Z\in\quot_X(E,n)^\T$, which are suppressed from the notation. We denote the sign at $Z$ to be $(-1)^{o(\mathcal{L})|_{Z}}$ and call $o(\mathcal{L})$ a \emph{choice of signs}.
\end{remark}

When $N=1$, the weight on $E=\O_Y\<y_1\>$ is not necessary as this extra action does not affect the fixed locus, so we sometimes ignore it by setting $y_1=1$. By definition, the coefficients of the Chern and Segre series are rational functions in the cohomological parameters $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_d,m_1,\ldots,m_N,w_1,\ldots,w_{r+s}$. For the Verlinde series, they are in K-theoretic parameters $t_1,\ldots,t_d,y_1\ldots,y_N,v_1\ldots,v_{r+s}$. Using the identification of Remark \ref{rmk:K-H-identification}, they can be viewed as functions in the cohomological parameters as well. Define
\equa{\ast_{Y,i}(E,\a;q):=\ast_Y(E,\a;q)|_{\deg\vec\lambda,\vec m,\vec w=i}}
to be the part with total degree $i$ in those variables, for $\ast\in\{{\mathcal{S}},{\mathcal{C}},{\mathcal{V}}\}$. More precisely, by restricting a multi-variable function to a certain degree, we mean the following.
\begin{definition}\label{defn:degree}
Let $f(z_1,\dots,z_k)$ be a function in the ring of fractions of $\CC[\![z_1,\dots,z_k]\!]$. Consider the formal Laurent series expansion of $f(bz_1,\dots,bz_k)$ in the variable $b$:
\[f(bz_1,\dots,bz_k)=\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty f_i(z_1,\dots z_k)b^i.\]
For $i\in\ZZ$, the part of $f$ with \emph{total degree $i$} is 
\[f(z_1,\dots,z_k)|_{\deg \vec{z}=i}:=f_i(z_1,\dots,z_k).\]
\end{definition}





\subsubsection{Reduced invariants on Quot schemes of surfaces}

When $S$ is a $K$-trivial surface, the obstruction on $\quot_S(E,n)$ contains a trivial summand making $e(T^\vir)$ vanish, as a result, the invariants all vanish. We may instead consider the reduced classes and invariants from Gromov-Witten theory and stable pair theory \cite{KT}, which has been employed to study the enumerative geometry of Hilbert schemes in for instance \cite{reduced}. In the case of $\quot_S(E,n)$, a reduced perfect obstruction theory can be obtained by removing one copy of $\O_{\quot_S(E,n)}$ from the usual obstruction for Quot schemes. The equivariant analogue of a $K$-trivial surface would be $S=\CC^2$ with the action of the 1-dimensional torus $\T_0=\{(t_1,t_2):t_1t_2=1\}$. Let $T^\redu$ be the virtual tangent bundle obtained from the reduced obstruction theory. For $E=\oplus_{i=1}^N\O_S\<y_i\>$ and $\a=[\oplus_{i=1}^r\O_S\<v_i\>]-[\oplus_{i=r+1}^s\O_S\<v_i\>]$, we define the \emph{reduced Segre, Chern, Verlinde series} to be respectively
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}^{\redu}(E,\alpha;q)&:=\sum_{n>0}^\infty q^n\int_{[\quot_S(E,n)]^\redu}s(\alpha^{[n]}),\\
{\mathcal{C}}^{\redu}(E,\alpha;q)&:=\sum_{n>0}^\infty q^n\int_{[\quot_S(E,n)]^\redu}c(\alpha^{[n]}),
\\
{\mathcal{V}}^{\redu}(E,\a;q)&:=\sum_{n>0}^\infty q^n\int_{[\quot_S(E,n)]^\redu}\td(T^\redu)\ch(\det(\alpha^{[n]})).
}




\subsection{Summary of results for surfaces}
\subsubsection{Computation of Chern series}

Consider the case $S=\CC^2$ with the $\T=(\CC^*)^2$-action. Using the tools from \cite{GM}, we are able to compute the virtual Chern series of line bundles for Hilbert schemes as follows in Section \ref{sec:chern-rank-2}. Note that in the non-equivariant setting, this can be retrieved from \cite[Corollary 15]{OP}.
\begin{corollary}
Let $S=\CC^2$, and $L=\O_S\<v_1\>$ a $\T$-equivariant line bundle over $S$. We have
\equa{{\mathcal{C}}_S(\O_S,L;q)=\left(\frac1{1-q}\right)^{\int_Sc(L)c_1(S)}.}
\end{corollary}
By extracting the part with the lowest total degree in $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,w_1$, we obtain the following 2-dimensional analogue to the Donaldson-Thomas partition function for $\CC^3$ \cite[Theorem 1]{MNOP2}, or Cao-Kool's formulation of Nekrasov's conjecture for $\CC^4$ \cite[Appendix B]{CK1}.
\begin{corollary}[Corollary \ref{cor:nek2d}]\label{cor:vanishing-intro}
For $S=\CC^2$, the following equality holds
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^n\int_{[\hilb^n(S)]^\vir}1=e^{\frac{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}{\lambda_1\lambda_2}q}.\]
\end{corollary}

\subsubsection{Universal series expressions}

A common approach used to find closed formulas for the Segre and Verlinde series is by computing their universal series. In the non-virtual Hilbert scheme case for projective surfaces, it was proven in \cite{EGL} using methods of cobordism classes that the Segre and Verlinde invariants admit the following universal series expressions
\[I^{\mathcal{C}}(\alpha;q)=A_0(q)^{c_2(\alpha)}A_1(q)^{\chi(\det(\alpha))}A_2(q)^{\frac12\chi(\O_S)}A_3(q)^{c_1(\a)K_S-\frac12K_S^2}A_4(q)^{K_S^2},\]
\equanum{\label{eqn:univ-Verlinde}I^{\mathcal{V}}(\a,q)=B_1(q)^{\chi(\det(\a))}B_2(q)^{\frac12\chi(\O_S)}B_3(q)^{c_1(\a)K_S-\frac12K_S^2}B_4(q)^{K_S^2}}
where the products in the exponents are intersection products. The series $A_i(x),B_i(x)$ are universal in the sense that they only depend on $\alpha$ through the rank and are independent of the surface. Explicit formulas for these series were conjectured and computed in \cite{Lehn_1999,MOP,Marian_2021,EGL,GM}.
The Segre-Verlinde correspondence in this case concerns the relations between $A_i$ and $B_i$. It was first proposed by D. Johnson and Marian-Oprea-Pandharipande in relation to the study of Le Potier’s strange duality \cite{MOP,DJon} and recently proven by G\"ottsche-Mellit \cite{GM}.

For virtual invariants on Quot schemes of a smooth projective surface $S$ and torsion-free sheaf $E$, the universal series expressions are given by \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Bojko2}:
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_S(E,\a;q)&=A_1^\vir(q)^{c_1(S)c_1(\a)}A_2^\vir(q)^{c_1(S)^2}A_3^\vir(q)^{c_1(S)c_1(E)},\\
{\mathcal{V}}_S(E,\a;q)&=B_1^\vir(q)^{c_1(S)c_1(\a)}B_2^\vir(q)^{c_1(S)^2}B_3^\vir(q)^{c_1(S)c_1(E)}.\\
}
The explicit formulas are computed in \cite[Theorem 17]{KHilb} for $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2$ and in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Bojko2} for $A_3,B_3$.


Unlike the compact case where the invariants are simply numbers, the equivariant invariants can contain terms of various degrees in $H_\T^*(\pt)_\loc$. This is reflected by the following theorem where the virtual equivariant Segre and Verlinde invariants are written as infinite products of series labeled by partitions. The notations for partitions are set in Section \ref{sec:partition}. For a partition $\mu$ and a K-theory class $\a$, denote \[c_\mu(\a):=\prod_{i=1}^{\ell(\mu)}c_{\mu_i}(\a).\]

\begin{theorem}[Theorem \ref{thm:SV-univ-sieres}]\label{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro}
Let $S=\CC^2$. For any $r\in\ZZ$, $N>0$, there exist universal power series $A_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q),B_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)$, dependent on $N$ and $r$, such that for $E=\oplus_{i=1}^{N}\O_S\<y_i\>$ and $\a\in K_\T(S)$ of rank $r$, the equivariant virtual Segre and Verlinde series on $\quot_S(E,n)$ can be written as the following infinite products
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_S(E,\alpha;q)=&\prod_{\mu,\nu,\xi\text{ partitions}}A_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)^{\int_{S}c_\mu(\a) c_\nu(S)  c_\xi(E)c_1(S)},\\
{\mathcal{V}}_S(E,\alpha;q)=&\prod_{\mu,\nu,\xi\text{ partitions}}B_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)^{\int_{S}c_\mu(\a) c_\nu(S)  c_\xi(E)c_1(S)},\\
{\mathcal{C}}_S(E,\alpha;q)=&\prod_{\mu,\nu,\xi\text{ partitions}}C_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)^{\int_{S}c_\mu(\a) c_\nu(S)  c_\xi(E)c_1(S)}.
}
\end{theorem}

The series in the above expressions are universal in the sense that they depend on the input $\a$ only by its rank $r$. Sometimes for clarity, we will add superscripts $N,r$ to indicate the ranks of $E$ and $\a$. Note that the series labeled by $\mu,\nu,\xi$ are exponentiated to homogeneous rational functions in 
\[H_\T^*(\pt)_\loc=\CC(\lambda_1,\lam_2;m_1,\ldots,m_N;w_1,\ldots,w_{r+s})\]
of degree $|\mu|+|\nu|+|\xi|-1$. The degree 0 terms occur when one of $\mu,\nu,\xi$ is the partition $(1)$ and the rest are the empty partition $(0)$. The argument of Section \ref{sec:proj-reduction} shows that the series with degree 0 exponents are necessarily equal to the series from in the projective case, that is
\equanum{\label{eqn:proj-equi}&A_{(1),(0),(0)}(q)=A_{1}^\vir(q),\indent A_{(0),(1),(0)}(q)=A_{2}^\vir(q),\indent A_{(0),(0),(1)}(q)=A_{3}^\vir(q),\\
&B_{(1),(0),(0)}(q)=B_{1}^\vir(q),\indent B_{(0),(1),(0)}(q)=B_{2}^\vir(q),\indent B_{(0),(0),(1)}(q)=B_{3}^\vir(q).}


The universal series expressions of the reduced invariants take a much simpler form; as opposed to having series exponentiated to some powers of cohomology classes, we have the following additive expressions.
\begin{theorem}[Theorem \ref{cor:reduced-series}]\label{thm:reduced-intro}
When $S=\CC^2$, the equivariant reduced Segre and Verlinde series for $E=\oplus_{i=1}^N\O_S\<y_i\>$ and $\a\in K_\T(S)$ are
\equa{
{\mathcal{S}}^{\redu}(E,\a;q)=&\sum_{\mu,\nu,\xi}\log\left(A_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)\right)\cdot \int_S c_\mu(\a)c_\nu(S)c_\xi(E),\\
{\mathcal{V}}^{\redu}(E,\a;q)=&\sum_{\mu,\nu,\xi}\log\left(B_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)\right)\cdot \int_S c_\mu(\a)c_\nu(S)c_\xi(E),\\
{\mathcal{C}}^{\redu}(E,\a;q)=&\sum_{\mu,\nu,\xi}\log\left(C_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)\right)\cdot \int_S c_\mu(\a)c_\nu(S)c_\xi(E)\\
}
where $A_{\mu,\nu,\xi}, B_{\mu,\nu,\xi}$ and $C_{\mu,\nu,\xi}$ are the same series from Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro}.
\end{theorem}


\subsubsection{Virtual Segre-Verlinde correspondence}
When $Y$ is compact, the virtual Segre-Verlinde correspondence has been proven for compact surfaces and Calabi-Yau 4-folds \cite[Theorem 1.6]{Bojko2} for torsion-free sheaves $E$ to be
\[{\mathcal{S}}_Y(E,\alpha;q)={\mathcal{V}}_Y(E,\alpha;(-1)^Nq).\]

As a corollary of this result, Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro} and the relations (\ref{eqn:proj-equi}), we first prove the following ``weak" equivariant Segre-Verlinde correspondence.


\begin{corollary}[Corollary \ref{cor:SV2d-virtual}]\label{cor:weak-SV2d-virtual-intro}
In the setting of Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro}, we have the following correspondence
\equa{A_{\mu,\nu,\xi}(q)&=B_{\mu,\nu,\xi}((-1)^Nq).
}
whenever one of $\mu,\nu,\xi$ is $(1)$ and the other two are $(0)$. In particular, the degree 0 part satisfies
\[{\mathcal{S}}_{S,0}(E,\alpha;q)-{\mathcal{V}}_{S,0}(E,\alpha;(-1)^Nq)=\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{f_n}{(\lambda_1\lambda_2)^{n-2}}\cdot\left(\int_S c_1(S)\right)^2\cdot q^n\]
for some terms $f_n\in H_\T^{2n-2}(\pt)$ dependent on $\a$ through its rank and Chern classes.
\end{corollary}
This is weak in the sense that only the series whose powers are degree 0 satisfy the usual correspondence, while Computations for small values of $n$ show that the terms $f_n$ can be non-zero so the naive correspondence does not hold in all degrees. One might instead ask whether there are any other relations between the series in all cohomological degrees generalizing the above corollary.


We are able to give a complete answer relating $B_{\mu,\nu,\xi}$ and $C_{\mu,\nu,\xi}$ once the sizes of the partitions $|\mu|,|\xi|$ are fixed and $\nu = (0)$. This is represented in Figure \ref{fig:sv}, but before stating our result, some further notation is needed. Given any partition $\mu$, integer $a\in\ZZ$ and $n> 0$, the binomial coefficients for $\mu$ is
\[\binom{a}{\mu}:=\prod_{i=1}^{\ell(\mu)}\binom{a}{\mu_i},\] 
and the downward factorial of $a$ by $n$ is
\[(a)_{(n)}:=a\cdot(a-1)\cdots(a-n+1),\] 
\[(a)_{(-1)}:=\frac1{a+1}.\] 

\begin{theorem}[Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-deg-pos}]\label{thm:SV2d-deg-pos-intro}
For rank $r\geq 0$ and integers $k_1,k_2\geq 0$ with $k:=k_1+k_2$, the universal series of Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro} satisfy
\equa{k_1!k_2!\sum_{|\mu|=k_1}\sum_{|\xi|=k_2}\binom{r}{\mu}\binom{N}{\xi}\log A_{\mu,(0),\xi}(q)&=-r\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-n(r+N))_{(k-1)}}{n}\binom{-nr-1}{nN-1}q^n,\\
k_1!k_2!r^{k_1}\sum_{|\xi|=k_2}\binom{N}{\xi}\log B_{(1)_{k_1},(0),\xi}(q)&=-r^{k}\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{k-2}\binom{-nr-1}{nN-1}\left((-1)^Nq\right)^n.}
Furthermore, we have
\equa{
&k_1!k_2!\sum_{|\mu|=k_1}\sum_{|\xi|=k_2}\binom{r}{\mu}\binom{N}{\xi}\log C_{\mu,(0),\xi}(q)=r\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(n(r-N))_{(k-1)}}{n}\binom{nr-1}{nN-1}q^n,
}
which can be compared to the identities above by replacing $r$ with $-r$.
\end{theorem}
In particular, setting $k=1$, the first two equalities of this theorem give 
\[A_{(1),(0),(0)}(q)=\left(B_{(1),(0),(0)}((-1)^Nq)\right),\]
\[A_{(0),(0),(1)}(q)=\left(B_{(0),(0),(1)}((-1)^Nq)\right).\]
This is consistent with the Segre-Verlinde correspondence in degree 0 from Corollary \ref{cor:weak-SV2d-virtual-intro}. Going one degree higher by setting $k=2$, we get the following correspondence.
\begin{corollary}[Corollary \ref{cor:sv2d-deg1}]\label{cor:sv2d-deg1-intro}
For rank $r\geq 0$, the universal series of Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro} satisfy the following correspondences
\equa{&\indent A_{(1,1),(0),(0)}(q)^{-r}A_{(2),(0),(0)}(q)^{\frac{-(r-1)}{2}}=B_{(1,1),(0),(0)}\left((-1)^Nq\right)^{r+N},\\
&\indent A_{(1),(0),(1)}(q)^{-r}=B_{(1),(0),(1)}\left((-1)^Nq\right)^{r+N},\text{ and }\\
&\indent A_{(0),(0),(1,1)}(q)^{-rN}A_{(0),(0),(2)}(q)^{\frac{-r(N-1)}{2}}\\
&=B_{(0),(0),(1,1)}\left((-1)^Nq\right)^{N(r+N)}B_{(0),(0),(2)}\left((-1)^Nq\right)^{\frac{(N-1)(r+N)}{2}}.
}
\end{corollary}

It is natural to expect that applying Lagrange inversion to the expressions 
in Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-deg-pos-intro} will simplify the formulae. In Section \ref{sec:closed-form}, we use this to phrase the higher degree Segre and Verlinde series in terms of applying differential operators of comparable form to a single function $\f(t)=\log(1+t)$ with common variable change except for the usual sign $q\leadsto (-1)^Nq$.
\begin{theorem}[Theorem \ref{cor:SV2d-closed}]\label{cor:SV2d-closed-intro}
Let $\f(t)=\log(1+t)$ and $\psi(t)=Nt^{-1}+r(1+t)^{-1}$. Define the differential operator
\[ D_\psi=\frac{1}{\psi}\cdot \frac{d}{dt}.\]
Furthermore, use the notation
\[D_{\mathcal{S}}^{(k)}=(-(r+N)D_\psi)_{(k-1)},\indent D_{\mathcal{V}}^{(k)}=r^{k-1}D_\psi^{k-1}\]
for $k\geq 0$ where $D_\psi^{-1}(-)$ denotes integrating $\psi\cdot (-)$ assuming a constant term 0. In the setting of Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-deg-pos-intro}, we have the following relations
\equa{
k_1!k_2!\sum_{|\mu|=k_1}\sum_{|\xi|=k_2}\binom{r}{\mu}\binom{N}{\xi}\log A_{\mu,(0),\xi}(q)&=-r\sum_{i=1}^N\left(D_{\mathcal{S}}^{(k)}\f\right)(H_i),\\
k_1!k_2!r^{k_1}\sum_{|\xi|=k_2}\binom{N}{\xi}\log B_{(1)_{k_1},(0),\xi}\left((-1)^Nq\right)&=-r\sum_{i=1}^N\left(D_{\mathcal{V}}^{(k)}\f\right)(H_i)}
where $H_i$ are the Newton-Puiseux solutions to $H_i^N=q(1+H_i)^{-r}$.
\end{theorem}

In this theorem, setting $k=1$ allows us to retrieve the degree 0 parts for both the Segre and Verlinde invariants using the function $\f$, hence the Segre-Verlinde correspondence of Corollary \ref{cor:weak-SV2d-virtual-intro}. When $k=2$, we get a relation in the degree 1 part which is equivalent to Corollary \ref{cor:sv2d-deg1-intro}. In general, the Segre and Verlinde relations are obtained by applying $D_{\mathcal{S}}^{(k)}$ and $D_{\mathcal{V}}^{(k)}$ to $\f$. Figure \ref{fig:sv} summarizes these observations.

\begin{remark}
The above results only dealt with the $\nu=(0)$ case. When $\nu=(1)$, similar techniques of Section \ref{sec:reduced-computation} can be applied to the term \cite[(4.24)]{Bojko2}, if an explicit expression for it is found. For $|\nu|>1$, the same techniques no longer work due to limitations of Lemma \ref{lem:differential}.

Also proven in \cite[Theorem 1.7]{Bojko2} is a symmetry for virtual Segre series, which states
\[{\mathcal{S}}_Y(E,V;(-1)^Nq)={\mathcal{S}}_Y(V,E;(-1)^rq)\]
for torsion free sheaves $E$ and $V$ of rank $N$ and $r$ respectively. Similar to Corollary \ref{cor:weak-SV2d-virtual-intro}, we have the following weak version of this symmetry.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:sv-sym2d-intro}
In the setting of Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro}, for $\a=V=\oplus_{i=1}^{r}\O_S\<v_i\>$, we have the following symmetry
\equa{A^{N,r}_{\mu,\nu,\xi}((-1)^Nq)&=A^{r,N}_{\xi,\nu,\mu}((-1)^rq)
}
whenever one of $\mu,\nu,\xi$ is $(1)$ and the other two are $(0)$. In degree 0, we have
\[{\mathcal{S}}_{S,0}(E,V;(-1)^Nq)-{\mathcal{S}}_{S,0}(V,E;(-1)^rq)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{g_n}{(\lambda_1\lambda_2)^{n-2}}\cdot\left(\int_S c_1(S)\right)^2\cdot q^n\]
for some terms $g_n\in H_\T^{2n-2}(\pt)$.
\end{corollary}

Motivated by our study of the higher degree Segre series in Section \ref{sec:sym} which as we see after using Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-deg-pos-intro} are symmetric under interchanging $\mu$ and $\xi$\textemdash the partitions keeping track of Chern classes of $\alpha$ and $E$ respectively, we conjecture the following \textit{strong Segre symmetry}.
\begin{conjecture}\label{con:strong-sym}
Let $r,N>0$, $S=\CC^2$. For $E=\oplus_{i=1}^N\O_S\<y_i\>,V=\oplus_{i=1}^r\O_S\<v_i\>$, we have the following symmetry
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_{S}(E,V;(-1)^Nq)={\mathcal{S}}_{S}(V,E;(-1)^rq).}
\end{conjecture}
We checked that this condition holds using a program in the cases summarized in \eqref{eq:2dsegsym}.




\subsubsection{Reduced Segre-Verlinde correspondence}
For the reduced invariants on $S=\CC^2$, let us denote ${\mathcal{S}}_i^{\redu}$ and ${\mathcal{V}}_i^{\redu}$ the degree $i$ parts of the reduced Segre and Verlinde series respectively, in the sense of Definition \ref{defn:degree}. In this setting, the fact that the series from Theorem \ref{thm:reduced-intro} are the same ones from Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-virtual-intro} allows us to obtain relations from the non-reduced case. For example, the Segre-Verlinde correspondence of Corollary \ref{cor:weak-SV2d-virtual-intro} and symmetry of Corollary \ref{cor:sv-sym2d-intro} give the following reduced Segre-Verlinde correspondence and symmetry in degree $-1$. 
\begin{corollary}
We have the following correspondence in degree $-1$:
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_{-1}^{\redu}(E,V;q)%&=\log(A_{(1),(0),(0)}(q))\int_S c_1(\a)+\log(A_{(0),(0),(1)}(q))\int_S c_1(E)\\
%&=\log(B_{(1),(0),(0)}((-1)^Nq))\int_S c_1(\a)+\log(B_{(0),(0),(1)}((-1)^Nq))\int_S c_1(E)\\
&={\mathcal{V}}_{-1}^{\redu}(E,\a;(-1)^Nq).
}
When $\a=V$ is an equivariant vector bundle, we have the following symmetry:
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_{-1}^{\redu}(E,V;(-1)^Nq)%&=\log(A_{(1),(0),(0)}^{N,r}((-1)^Nq))\int_S c_1(V)+\log(A_{(0),(0),(1)}^{N,r}((-1)^Nq))\int_S c_1(E)\\
%&=\log(A_{(1),(0),(0)}^{r,N}((-1)^rq))\int_S c_1(V)+\log(A_{(0),(0),(1)}^{r,N}((-1)^rq))\int_S c_1(E)\\
&={\mathcal{S}}_{-1}^{\redu}(V,E;(-1)^rq).
}
\end{corollary}

Let $\alpha\in K_\T(S)$ with rank $r>0$. Write $c_1\lambda=c_1(\a)$ and $c_2\lambda^2=c_2(\a)$ for some $c_1,c_2\in\QQ$, then we can use the Theorem \ref{thm:reduced-intro} to show that for some series $A_2(q),A_1(q),A_0(q),B_1(q),B_0(q)$, dependent on $r$ and $N$,
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_0^{\redu}(E,\alpha;q)|_{m_1=\dots=m_N=0}&=-\log \left(A_{(2),(0)}(q)\right)\cdot c_2-\log \left(A_{(1,1),(0)}(q)\right)\cdot c_1^2+\log \left(A_{(0),(2)}(q)\right)\\
&=:A_2(q)c_2+A_1(q)c_1^2+A_0(q),\\
{\mathcal{V}}_0^{\redu}(E,\alpha;q)|_{m_1=\dots=m_N=0}&=-\log \left(B_{(1,1),(0)}(q)\right)\cdot c_1^2+\log \left(B_{(0),(2)}(q)\right)\\
&=:B_1(q)c_1^2+B_0(q).}
These degree 0 terms should correspond to the ones for compact K3-surfaces and their reduced invariants. In particular, one can use the results obtained in Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-deg-pos-intro}, Theorem \ref{cor:SV2d-closed-intro}, and the ones below to predict the Segre and the Verlinde series in the compact case and describe their correspondences.

 Corollary \ref{cor:sv2d-deg1-intro} provides relations between $A_1,A_2$ and $B_1$, and we have the following formula for $B_1(q)$ obtained from Theorem \ref{thm:SV2d-deg-pos-intro} by setting $k_1=2,k_2=0$.
\begin{corollary}

The series $B_1(q)$ is explicitly given by
\[[q^n]B_1(q)=-\frac{1}{2}\binom{n(N+r)-1}{nr}\]
for $n,r>0$.
\end{corollary}


We give some conjectural formulas for $A_0,B_0$ in terms of $A_1,B_1$ when $N=1$, respectively, checked for $n\leq 20,r<5$.
\begin{conjecture}
When $N=1$ and $r\in\ZZ$, we have
\[[q^n]B_0(q)=\frac16\left(\binom{r+1}{2}(n-1)-1\right)[q^n]B_1(q).\]
When $N=1$, $r<-1$ and $n>1$, we have
\[[q^n]A_0(q)=\frac{1}{12} r (n r + n + 2)[q^n]A_1(q).\]
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{Correspondence for 4-folds and other observations}
\subsubsection{Segre-Verlinde correspondence}
Since all toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds are non-compact, we do not know how the invariants in the non-compact case relate to the ones in the compact case. We have seen for the surface case the powers on the universal series have a factor of $c_1(S)$. Considering the series given in \cite[Proposition 4.13]{boj} and \cite[(3.38)]{Bojko2}, together with Section \ref{sec:factor}, we see that this term should be replaced by $c_3(X)$ in the 4-fold case. Motivated by Corollary \ref{cor:weak-SV2d-virtual-intro} and \ref{cor:sv-sym2d-intro}, we conjecture a weak Segre-Verlinde correspondence and symmetry for $X=\CC^4$. 

\begin{conjecture}\label{con:sv4d-intro}
Let $X=\CC^4$, $E=\oplus_{i=1}^{N}\O_X\<y_i\>$, $V=\oplus_{i=1}^{r}\O_X\<v_i\>$, and $\a\in K_\T(X)$, then for some choice of signs $o(\mathcal{L})$, we have the following symmetry and correspondence
\equa{{\mathcal{S}}_X(E,V;(-1)^Nq)&={\mathcal{S}}_X(V,E;(-1)^rq),\\
{\mathcal{S}}_{X,0}(E,\alpha;q)-{\mathcal{V}}_{X,0}(E,\alpha;(-1)^Nq)&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_n}{(\lambda_1\lambda_2\lam_3\lam_4)^{n-2}}\cdot\left(\int_X c_3(X)\right)^2\cdot q^n}
for some terms $F_n\in H_\T^{4n-6}(\pt)$ dependent on $\a$ through its rank and Chern classes.
\end{conjecture}
We checked both the correspondence and symmetry using a computer program as summarized in \eqref{eq:4DSVcomp} and \eqref{eq:4DSymp}.

\subsubsection{Nekrasov's conjectures}
In \cite[Appendix B]{CK1}, Y. Cao and M. Kool gave a mathematical formulation of Nekrasov's conjecture \cite[§5]{Mag}. 
\begin{comment}
\begin{conjecture}[Cao-Kool]
Let $X=\CC^4$, there exist choices of signs $o(\mathcal{L})$ such that
\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty q^n\int_{[\hilb^n(X)]^\vir}1=e^{-\frac{(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)(\lambda_2+\lambda_3)(\lambda_1+\lambda_3)}{\lambda_1\lambda_2\lambda_3(\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3)}q}=\exp\left(-q\int_Xc_{3}(X)\right)\]
\end{conjecture}
\end{comment}
We generalize this to Quot schemes of $\CC^2$ and $\CC^4$ as follows.
\begin{conjecture}\label{con:cao-kool-quot}
Let $Y=\CC^d$, $E=\oplus_{i=1}^{r+1}\O_Y\<y_i\>$, and $V=\oplus_{i=1}^r\O_Y\<v_i\>$. When $d=2$, or $d=4$ with some choice of signs $o(\mathcal{L})$, we have
\[{\mathcal{C}}_Y(E,V;q)=\exp\left(q\int_Yc_{d-1}(Y)\right).
\]
\end{conjecture}
Note that when $N=1$ and $Y=\CC^2$, this is exactly Corollary \ref{cor:vanishing-intro}. When $Y=\CC^4$, we shall show that this conjecture is a consequence of Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's conjecture \cite[§2.5]{magcolor} using a Quot scheme version of Cao-Kool-Monavari's cohomological limit \cite[Appendix A]{CKM} in Proposition \ref{prop:nek-con-limit}. For $Y=\CC^2$, we check it for $N=2,3,4,5$ up to and including $n=7,4,2,2$ respectively.

Since $[\quot_Y(E,n)]^\vir$ has virtual dimension $nN$, we have $C^N_Y(V;q)=1$ when $N>r$ in the compact case simply for degree reason, which means the corresponding Verlinde series is also trivial due to the Segre-Verlinde correspondence. In the non-compact case, the above conjectures suggest that they may contain negative degree terms. However, with a computer calculation for $Y=\CC^2$, $N=2,3,4,5$ and all possible $r$, up to and including $n=8,5,2,2$, we see a complete vanishing when $N>r+1$ for Chern numbers, and when $r<N$ for rank $-r$ Verlinde numbers.
\begin{conjecture}\label{con:low-rank-vanish}
Let $Y=\CC^d$, $N>1$, and $E=\oplus_{i=1}^{N}\O_Y\<y_i\>$. When $d=2$, or $d=4$ with some choice of signs, we have for $r=0,1,\dots,N-2$ and $V=\oplus_{i=1}^r\O_Y\<v_i\>$,
\equa{{\mathcal{C}}_Y(E,V;q)=1.}
Furthermore, for $r=1,\dots,N-1$, we have
\[{\mathcal{V}}_Y(E,-[V];q)=1.\]
\end{conjecture}
In Proposition \ref{prop:nek-con-limit}, we also show that the Chern series part of this conjecture for $d=4$ is a consequence of Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's Conjecture \ref{con:nek2}.

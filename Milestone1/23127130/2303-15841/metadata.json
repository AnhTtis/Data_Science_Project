    "abstract": "As the largest blockchain platform that supports smart contracts, Ethereum has developed with an incredible speed. Yet due to the anonymity of blockchain, the popularity of Ethereum has fostered the emergence of various illegal activities and money laundering by converting ill-gotten funds to cash. In the traditional money laundering scenario, researchers have uncovered the prevalent traits of money laundering. However, since money laundering on Ethereum is an emerging means, little is known about money laundering on Ethereum. To fill the gap, in this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on Ethereum money laundering networks through the lens of a representative security event on \\textit{Upbit Exchange} to explore whether money laundering on Ethereum has traditional traits. Specifically, we construct a money laundering network on Ethereum by crawling the transaction records of \\textit{Upbit Hack}. Then, we present five questions based on the traditional traits of money laundering networks. By leveraging network analysis, we characterize the money laundering network on Ethereum and answer these questions. In the end, we summarize the findings of money laundering networks on Ethereum, which lay the groundwork for money laundering detection on Ethereum.",

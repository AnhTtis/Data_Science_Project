\section{Introduction}
The metaverse~\cite{lee2021all}, a shared digital place where users may communicate and collaborate using a variety of virtual tools, has the potential to revolutionize how we study, socialize, and pass the time. Although researchers have made great strides, making a fascinating and engaging tailored metaverse experience is still a work in progress. For instance, learning to accommodate a wide variety of user interactions using natural language processing (NLP) is a significant obstacle on the path to generating a unique metaverse experience. The OpenAI-developed state-of-the-art language model ChatGPT offers a potent answer in this situation. ChatGPT's natural language processing features allow programmers to make a wide variety of useful applications, such as digital assistants, educational companions, unique forms of entertainment, and individualized itineraries.

\section{ChatGPT as a Destroyer}
It's also possible that new technologies and services will emerge to compete with or even replace the metaverse industry. Here are a few ways that ChatGPT or other language models could have a negative impact on the metaverse market share:




\subsection{Engagement Detraction (Figure~\ref{fig:detraction}).}
Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by language models could potentially replace human interaction in the metaverse, resulting in lower user engagement and socialization. If users become overly reliant on AI-powered interactions, the immersive experience that the metaverse is supposed to provide may suffer.
Users may become so accustomed to communicating with chatbots and virtual assistants and miss out on human interaction nuances such as body language, facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues. This could result in a less immersive and fulfilling metaverse experience.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{figs/detraction.png}
     \caption{Less socialization.}\label{fig:detraction}
   \end{minipage}\hfill
   \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{figs/competitor.png}
     \caption{Virtual experience competitor.}\label{fig:competitor}
   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Furthermore, if users primarily interact with chatbots and virtual assistants, there may be a lack of diversity in the types of interactions that take place within the metaverse. Chatbots and virtual assistants may be programmed to respond to specific types of queries or commands in specific ways, which may result in a more limited range of interaction and less spontaneity in user-to-user communication. This could eventually undermine the immersive experience that the metaverse is supposed to provide.

\subsection{Virtual Experience Competitor (Figure~\ref{fig:competitor}).}
Language models could pave the way for the creation of alternative types of virtual reality experiences that do not necessitate the same level of immersion as the metaverse. ChatGPT, for example, could be used to create virtual chat rooms that do not necessitate the same level of 3D graphics and virtual environment design that the metaverse does. If users find that virtual chat rooms powered by ChatGPT meet their needs, they may be less likely to explore the more immersive virtual worlds available in the metaverse. This could result in a shift away from more immersive virtual worlds and toward simpler virtual chat rooms in terms of market share.

Furthermore, if ChatGPT can generate high-quality virtual chat rooms with minimal effort, competitors may find it easier to enter the market and create similar offerings. This could mean more competition and a smaller market share for existing metaverse companies focused on creating more complex and immersive virtual worlds.


\subsection{Formulaic Content Generation}
Contents created by ChatGPT-like language models may become formulaic and unoriginal because, in the end, language models are trained on massive amounts of existing text which may limit their ability to create truly unique content. For example, if a virtual world within the metaverse is generated by a language model using pre-written scripts, the resulting world may feel sterile and uninspired. The virtual world's content may lack the depth and complexity that comes from human creativity and imagination, failing to engage users and keep them coming back.

\section{Moving forward}
A number of important problems, as summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:concern}, are worth addressing for the better integration of ChatGPT and Metaverse:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Privacy and data security. The user data on which ChatGPT relies heavily may contain private information such as browsing history, location information, and conversations. This raises privacy and data security concerns because hackers or other bad actors may gain access to or steal this information. researchers must take strong security precautions to protect user data, and consumers must be made aware of the collection and use of their data.
    \item Defamation and fake news. ChatGPT can generate intelligent and persuasive responses, but it is not always accurate or reliable, which means it has the potential to spread false information and fake news. Users should be taught how to critically evaluate the presented information, and researchers should take care to validate the veracity of ChatGPT's responses.
    \item Stereotyping and negative behavior reinforcement. The language creation features of ChatGPT have the potential to support unfavorable attitudes and prejudices. For example, programming a virtual assistant to respond to users in a passive or subservient manner can perpetuate abusive or sexist behavior. Virtual assistants and other metaverse apps must be designed in a way that promotes good habits and values. researchers must be aware of these risks.
    \item Unrealistic expectations. Users' expectations may be inflated as a result of ChatGPT's personalized and targeted responses, particularly when it comes to education or mental health care. Users may expect virtual assistants to respond quickly and completely to complex queries or issues, but this may not always be the case. Researchers must manage user expectations and ensure that virtual assistants provide the appropriate levels of assistance.
    \item Dependence on technology. Using ChatGPT and other virtual assistants in the metaverse may lead to a greater reliance on technology and less on interpersonal contact. As a result, socialization, communication, and emotional health may all suffer. Researchers must consider these risks when creating metaverse apps, balancing the benefits of technology with the importance of human connection and interaction.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}
The metaverse industry is still in its infancy, it's unclear what kinds of virtual experiences will be most popular and profitable in the long run at this point. ChatGPT-powered services could potentially complement rather than compete with metaverse services and could help to expand the overall market for metaverse experiences. Furthermore, ChatGPT can be used to supplement and enhance human creativity in the metaverse. As the metaverse develops, so will opportunities for ChatGPT and other forms of NLP in MMORPGs. The need for interactive and unique experiences will grow as more people join the metaverse. ChatGPT is just one example of a natural language processing and generation technology that may be used to build a variety of useful and entertaining virtual assistants and companion applications. ChatGPT's potential for facilitating the development of sophisticated conversational agents in the metaverse is an intriguing avenue for potential future study. With reinforcement learning and other methods, these agents could acquire a deeper comprehension of user actions and reactions in order to provide more tailored and interesting interactions. 
While researchers have an amazing chance to create individualized and engaging virtual experiences by combining ChatGPT with the metaverse, they need to be aware of the obstacles so as to make the virtual world a safe and ethical place for all users.

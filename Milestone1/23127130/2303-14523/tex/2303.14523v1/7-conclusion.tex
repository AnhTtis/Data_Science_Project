\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented an open hierarchical taxonomy for smart contract vulnerabilities. The taxonomy is up-to-date according to the current state of the practice and is prepared to handle future modifications and evolution. To build the taxonomy we began by analyzing current vulnerability classification schemes for blockchain, we also analyzed announced detection capabilities of research on smart contract vulnerability detection, and we followed an iterative process to structure the taxonomy. We discussed the proposed taxonomy characteristics and coverage against the state of the practice. In particular, we analyzed the announced detection ability of current industry-level tools and mapped it to the different identified vulnerabilities. As future work, we plan on using this taxonomy as basis to define a benchmark for smart contract vulnerability detection tools.

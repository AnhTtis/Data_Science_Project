    "abstract": "We consider a class of pursuit-evasion differential games in which the evader has continuous access to the pursuer's location, but not vice-versa. There is a remote sensor (e.g., a radar station) that can sense the evader's location upon a request from the pursuer and communicate that sensed location to the pursuer. The pursuer has a budget on the total number of sensing requests. The outcome of the game is determined by the sensing and motion strategies of the players. We obtain an equilibrium sensing strategy for the pursuer and an equilibrium motion strategy for the evader. We quantify the degradation in the pursuer's pay-off due to its sensing limitations.",

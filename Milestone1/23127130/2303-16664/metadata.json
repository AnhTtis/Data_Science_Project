    "abstract": "In this present work, we study the radial and non-radial perturbation stability of neutron stars in which the matter is disformally coupled to the metric. First, we set the equations of the neutron star in a static and spherically symmetric background. Then, we calculate the second-order perturbations of the action that describes our theory for both axial and polar modes. From the resulting expressions, we derive the conditions to avoid the Laplacian and ghost instabilities at the center of the star and when the radial coordinate tends to infinity. In addition, a numerical analysis is performed to investigate the stability of a particular model with a constant disformal function denoted as $Λ$. We found that the chosen model is stable against the Laplacian instability in a small range of the constant $Λ$.",

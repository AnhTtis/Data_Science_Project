    "abstract": "We define a homogeneous De Giorgi class of order $p = 2$ that contains the solutions of evolution equations of the types $\\uprho (x,t) u_t + A u = 0$ and $(\\uprho (x,t) u)_t + A u = 0$, where $\\uprho > 0$ almost everywhere and $A$ is a suitable elliptic operator. \\\\ For functions belonging to this class we prove an inhomogeneous Harnack inequality, i.e. a Harnack inequality that takes into account the mean value of $\\uprho$ in different regions of $Ω\\times (0,T)$. \\\\ As a consequence we get a Harnack inequality for solutions, and in these case only for solutions, of elliptic-parabolic equations and of forward-backward parabolic equations. \\\\ As a byproduct one obtains Hölder continuity for solutions of a subclass the first equation: in particular the solutions of this subclass are Hölder continuous in the interface where $\\uprho$ changes its sign.",

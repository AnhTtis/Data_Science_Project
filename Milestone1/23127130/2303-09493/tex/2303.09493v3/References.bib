Meas{\textasciitilde}ements of the critical conditions for the onset of the flow transition, made by systematically varying the piate separation in the parallef-plate geometry, demonstrate that this rotational instability is a function of the angular velocity in the flow and initially grows exponentially in time, in agreement with theoretical predictions for an Oldroyd-B model. However, experiments show that the dist{\textasciitilde}ban{\textasciitilde}e which causes this flow transition is nonaxisymmetric, over-stable in time and subcritical in \$, Spectral analysis also shows that the nonlinear flow which ultimately develops is temporally aperiodic. These features of the flow transition do not agree with the existing theoretical analysis. The experimentally constructed flow-stability diagram shows that, for a given fluid, the {\textasciitilde}stabi{\textasciitilde}ty occurs at a critical Deborah number which is insensitive to the specific geometrical parameters, temperature, and shear-rate of the flow. This interpretation of the elastic instability clarifies recent measurements of the flow stability for the Ml viscoelastic test fluid.},

Our calculations are compared with their well-known point-particle counterparts; they show that the average free distances obtained from the point-particle approximations are reasonable only at small volume fractions (less than 0.05 in the more favorable two-dimensional problems).

	abstract = {This book is about two special topics in rheological fluid mechanics: the elasticity of liquids and asymptotic theories of constitutive models. The major emphasis of the book is on the mathematical and physical consequences of the elasticity of liquids; seventeen of twenty chapters are devoted to this. Constitutive models which are instantaneously elastic can lead to some hyperbolicity in the dynamics of flow, waves of vorticity into rest (known as shear waves), to shock waves of vorticity or velocity, to steady flows of transonic type or to short wave instabilities which lead to ill-posed problems. Other kinds of models, with small Newtonian viscosities, give rise to perturbed instantaneous elasticity, associated with smoothing of discontinuities as in gas dynamics. There is no doubt that liquids will respond like elastic solids to impulses which are very rapid compared to the time it takes for the molecular order associated with short range forces in the liquid, to relax. After this, all liquids look viscous with signals propagating by diffusion rather than by waves. For small molecules this time of relaxation is estimated as lQ-13 to 10-10 seconds depending on the fluids. Waves associated with such liquids move with speeds of 1 QS cm/s, or even faster. For engineering applications the instantaneous elasticity of these fluids is of little interest; the practical dynamics is governed by diffusion, ·say, by the Navier-Stokes equations. On the other hand, there are other liquids which are known to have much longer times of relaxation.},

Acknowledgements I started writing this book in 1967 at the invitation of Clifford Truesdell. It was to be a short work on the energy theory of stability and if I had stuck to that I would have finished the writing many years ago. The theory of stability has developed so rapidly since 1967 that the book I might then have written would now have a much too limited scope. I am grateful to Truesdell, not so much for the invitation to spend endless hours of writing and erasing, but for the generous way he has supported my efforts and encouraged me to higher standards of good work. I have tried to follow Truesdell's advice to write this work in a clear and uncomplicated style. This is not easy advice for a former sociologist to follow; if I have failed it is not due to a lack of urging by him or trying by me. My research during the years 1969-1970 was supported in part by a grant from the Guggenheim foundation to study in London.},

	abstract = {It was a pleasure to read this important book. To understand and predict the development of turbulent flows represents both a continuing scientific challenge and also a serious practical problem in many different fields. Professor Pope has based his book on graduate level lecture courses on turbulence that he has presented at MIT and at Cornell University. It is intended for students in engineering, applied mathematics, oceanography and atmospheric sciences, as well as researchers and practising engineers. The emphasis is on turbulent flows, rather than on the theory of homogeneous turbulence, and only constant-density, nonreacting flows are considered. The author states that his aim is to explain concepts and develop the necessary mathematical tools, rather than to provide a practical guide to turbulence modelling. The text is divided into two parts. Part I provides an introduction to turbulent flows and the fundamental physical processes involved. Topics discussed in separate chapters include: the equations of fluid motion, the statistical description of turbulent flows, the mean flow equations, free shear flows, scales of turbulent motion and wall flows. The chapter on statistical methods for turbulence is particularly good; together with the related appendices it represents a valuable and accessible introduction to the subject. Several approaches for modelling or simulating turbulent flows are then described in Part II, in which the various chapters describe direct numerical simulation (DNS), turbulent viscosity models such as the k-ε model, Reynolds stress and related second-moment models, probability density function (pdf) models and large-eddy simulation (LES) techniques. Finally, some necessary mathematical tools are summarized in ten Appendices dealing with a wide range of relevant topics including tensors, Dirac delta functions, Fourier transforms, random processes, derivation of pdf equations, characteristic functions and stochastic descriptions of diffusion processes. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on modelling and simulation of turbulent flows. A unified treatment of the different types of model has enabled the author to make valuable connections between them and to reach clear and logical conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Over many years Professor Pope has made very important contributions to the development and application of pdf methods for the prediction of nonreactive and also reactive turbulent flows. The chapter on this subject is an exceptionally clear description of these powerful and often under-utilized simulation methods. The final chapter, on LES, provides an excellent introduction, with valuable and novel insights into both the promise and the problems of this relatively new and rapidly developing approach. It should be compulsory reading for many LES practitioners. Each section of the book contains a number of exercises, which typically invite the reader either to derive an expression that is quoted in the text or to generalize an analysis set out in the text. These exercises are often divided into several stages, and contain appropriate instructions, so that a diligent student will find his or her way through them. An advantage of the extensive use of appendices and student exercises is that analytical clarity and physical understanding are not obscured by unnecessary algebraic detail or by the need to review basic mathematical tools. The result is an exceptionally clear presentation, together with an often penetrating critique of both classical methods and recent developments in the theory and modelling of turbulent flows. There is excellent cross-referencing between one section and another, and an extensive and up-to-date bibliography. I strongly recommend this book to advanced students of fluid mechanics, to their teachers and to all researchers, engineers and others with a professional interest in turbulent flows. K N C Bray},

This review aims to provide a clear and accessible description of fractional viscoelastic models for a broad audience and to demonstrate the ability of these models to deliver a unified approach for the characterisation of power-law materials. The use of a consistent framework for the analysis of rheological data would help classify the empirical behaviours of soft and biological materials, and better understand their response.},

The resulting materials exhibit complex bulk and interfacial rheological responses, and often display a distinctive power-law response under standard rheometric deformations. These power laws are not conveniently described using conventional rheological models, without the introduction of a large number of relaxation modes. We present a constitutive framework using fractional derivatives to model the power-law responses often observed experimentally. We first revisit the concept of quasi-properties and their connection to the fractional Maxwell model (FMM). Using Scott-Blair's original data, we demonstrate the ability of the FMM to capture the power-law response of ‘highly anomalous’ materials. We extend the FMM to describe the viscoelastic interfaces formed by bovine serum albumin and solutions of a common food stabilizer, Acacia gum. Fractional calculus allows us to model and compactly describe the measured frequency response of these interfaces in terms of their quasi-properties. Finally, we demonstrate the predictive ability of the FMM to quantitatively capture the behaviour of complex viscoelastic interfaces by combining the measured quasi-properties with the equation of motion for a complex fluid interface to describe the damped inertio-elastic oscillations that are observed experimentally.},

Our results offer strong support for recent theories involving a stress-dependent effective contact friction among particles. We show, however, that in the DST regime, where theory might lead one to expect steady-state shear bands oriented layerwise along the vorticity axis, the real flow is unsteady. To explain this, we argue that steady-state banding is generically ruled out by the requirement that, for hard non-Brownian particles, the solvent pressure and the normal-normal component of the particle stress must balance separately across the interface between bands. (Otherwise, there is an unbalanced migration flux.) However, long-lived transient shear bands remain possible.},

	abstract = {It was first demonstrated experimentally by H. Giesekus in 1965 that the second normal stress difference in polymers can induce a secondary flow within the cross-section of a non-axisymmetric conduit. In this paper, we show through simulations that the same may be true for suspensions of rigid non-colloidal particles that are known to exhibit a strong negative second normal stress difference. Typically, the magnitudes of the transverse velocity components are small compared to the average axial velocity of the suspension; but the ratio of this transverse convective velocity to the shear-induced migration velocity is characterized by the shear-induced migration Péclet number χ which scales as B2/a2, B being the characteristic length scale of the cross-section and a being the particle radius. Since this Péclet number is kept high in suspension experiments (typically 100 to 2500), the influence of the weak circulation currents on the concentration profile can be very strong, a result that has not been appreciated in previous work. The principal effect of secondary flows on the concentration distribution as determined from simulations using the suspension balance model of Nott \&amp; Brady (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 275, 1994, p. 157) and the constitutive equations of Zarraga et al. (J. Rheol. vol. 44, 2000, p. 185) is three-fold. First, the steady-state particle concentration distribution is no longer independent of particle size; rather, it depends on the aspect ratio B/a. Secondly, the direction of the secondary flow is such that particles are swept out of regions of high streamsurface curvature, e.g. particle concentrations in corners reach a minimum rather than the local maximum predicted in the absence of such flows. Finally, the second normal stress differences lead to instabilities even in such simple geometries as plane-Poiseuille flow.},

	abstract = {Following our first report (A Groisman and V Steinberg 2000 Nature 405 53), we present an extended account of experimental observations of elasticity-induced turbulence in three different systems: a swirling flow between two plates, a Couette–Taylor (CT) flow between two cylinders, and a flow in a curvilinear channel (Dean flow). All three set-ups had a high ratio of the width of the region available for flow to the radius of curvature of the streamlines. The experiments were carried out with dilute solutions of high-molecular-weight polyacrylamide in concentrated sugar syrups. High polymer relaxation time and solution viscosity ensured prevalence of non-linear elastic effects over inertial non-linearity, and development of purely elastic instabilities at low Reynolds number (Re) in all three flows. Above the elastic instability threshold, flows in all three systems exhibit features of developed turbulence. They include: (i) randomly fluctuating fluid motion excited in a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and (ii) significant increase in the rates of momentum and mass transfer (compared with those expected for a steady flow with a smooth velocity profile). Phenomenology, driving mechanisms and parameter dependence of the elastic turbulence are compared with those of the conventional high-Re hydrodynamic turbulence in Newtonian fluids. Some similarities as well as multiple principal differences were found. In two out of three systems (swirling flow between two plates and flow in the curvilinear channel), power spectra of velocity fluctuations decayed rather quickly, following power laws with exponents of about −3.5. It suggests that, being random in time, the flow is rather smooth in space, in the sense that the main contribution to deformation and mixing (and, possibly, elastic energy) is coming from flow at the largest scale of the system. This situation, random in time and smooth in space, is analogous to flows at small scales (below the Kolmogorov dissipation scale) in high-Re turbulence.},

	abstract = {Suspensions are composed of mixtures of particles and fluid and are omnipresent in natural phenomena and in industrial processes. The present paper addresses the rheology of concentrated suspensions of non-colloidal particles. While hydrodynamic interactions or lubrication forces between the particles are important in the dilute regime, they become of lesser significance when the concentration is increased, and direct particle contacts become dominant in the rheological response of concentrated suspensions, particularly those close to the maximum volume fraction where the suspension ceases to flow. The rheology of these dense suspensions can be approached via a diversity of approaches that the paper introduces successively. The mixture of particles and fluid can be seen as a fluid with effective rheological properties but also as a two-phase system wherein the fluid and particles can experience relative motion. Rheometry can be undertaken at an imposed volume fraction but also at imposed values of particle normal stress, which is particularly suited to yield examination of the rheology close to the jamming transition. The response of suspensions to unsteady or transient flows provides access to different features of the suspension rheology. Finally, beyond the problem of suspension of rigid, non-colloidal spheres in a Newtonian fluid, there are a great variety of complex mixtures of particles and fluid that remain relatively unexplored.},

	abstract = {Solids dispersion is an important part of hydraulic fracturing, both in helping to understand phenomena such as tip screen-out and spreading of the pad, and in new process variations such as cyclic pumping of proppant. Whereas many frac fluids have low viscosity, e.g. slickwater, others transport proppant through increased viscosity. In this context, one method for influencing both dispersion and solids-carrying capacity is to use a yield stress fluid as the frac fluid. We propose a model framework for this scenario and analyse one of the simplifications. A key effect of including a yield stress is to focus high shear rates near the fracture walls. In typical fracturing flows this results in a large variation in shear rates across the fracture. In using shear-thinning viscous frac fluids, flows may vary significantly on the particle scale, from Stokesian behaviour to inertial behaviour across the width of the fracture. Equally, according to the flow rates, Hele-Shaw style models give way at higher Reynolds number to those in which inertia must be considered. We develop a model framework able to include this range of flows, while still representing a significant simplification over fully three-dimensional computations. In relatively straight fractures and for fluids of moderate rheology, this simplifies into a one-dimensional model that predicts the solids concentration along a streamline within the fracture. We use this model to make estimates of the streamwise dispersion in various relevant scenarios. This model framework also predicts the transverse distributions of the solid volume fraction and velocity profiles as well as their evolutions along the flow part.},

Its effectiveness is corroborated by analyzing the dynamics of ideal single mode Maxwell fluids and by means of a direct comparison with both bulk-rheology measurements and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations data transformed via a generalized Maxwell model. When adopted to transform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations data, the unbiased nature of the tool reveals new insights into the materials’ linear viscoelastic properties, especially at high frequencies, where conventional tools struggle to interpret the data and molecular dynamics simulations actually provide their most statistically accurate predictions. The wideband nature of i-Rheo GT offers the opportunity to better elucidate the link between materials’ topologies and their linear viscoelastic properties—from atomic length scales at frequencies of the order of terahertz up to mesoscopic length scales of molecular diffusion phenomena occurring over time scales of hours.},

We show how these recirculation regions originate and evolve and suggest a physical mechanism for their formation. Furthermore, comparing experiments and numerical simulations, the presence of vortex breakdown is found to be an excellent predictor of particle capture.

	abstract = {Dilute suspensions of repulsive particles exhibit a Newtonian response to flow that can be accurately predicted by the particle volume fraction and the viscosity of the suspending fluid. However, such a description fails when the particles are weakly attractive. In a simple shear flow, suspensions of attractive particles exhibit complex, anisotropic microstructures and flow instabilities that are poorly understood and plague industrial processes. One such phenomenon, the formation of log-rolling flocs, which is ubiquitously observed in suspensions of attractive particles that are sheared while confined between parallel plates, is an exemplar of this phenomenology. Combining experiments and discrete element simulations, we demonstrate that this shear-induced structuring is driven by hydrodynamic coupling between the flocs and the confining boundaries. Clusters of particles trigger the formation of viscous eddies that are spaced periodically and whose centers act as stable regions where particles aggregate to form flocs spanning the vorticity direction. Simulation results for the wavelength of the periodic pattern of stripes formed by the logs and for the log diameter are in quantitative agreement with experimental observations on both colloidal and noncolloidal suspensions. Numerical and experimental results are successfully combined by means of rescaling in terms of a Mason number that describes the strength of the shear flow relative to the rupture force between contacting particles in the flocs. The introduction of this dimensionless group leads to a universal stability diagram for the log-rolling structures and allows for application of shear-induced structuring as a tool for assembling and patterning suspensions of attractive particles.},

	abstract = {A combined experimental, numerical and theoretical investigation of the geometric scaling of the onset of a purely elastic flow instability in serpentine channels is presented. Good qualitative agreement is obtained between experiments, using dilute solutions of flexible polymers in microfluidic devices, and three-dimensional numerical simulations using the upper-convected Maxwell model. The results are confirmed by a simple theoretical analysis, based on the dimensionless criterion proposed by Pakdel \& McKinley (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 77, 1996, pp. 2459–2462) for onset of a purely elastic flow instability. Three-dimensional simulations show that the instability is primarily driven by the curvature of the streamlines induced by the flow geometry and not due to the weak secondary flow in the azimuthal direction. In addition, the simulations also reveal that the instability is time-dependent and that the flow oscillates with a well-defined period and amplitude close to the onset of the supercritical instability.},

It appears as a solitary vortex pair (“diwhirl”) in Couette flow with highly elastic polymer solutions. In contrast to the usual solitons the diwhirls are stationary. It is also a new object in fluid dynamics—a pair of vortices that build a single entity. The diwhirls arise as a result of a purely elastic instability through a hysteretic transition at negligible Reynolds numbers. It is suggested that the vortex flow is driven by the same forces that cause the Weissenberg effect.},

	abstract = {A pseudo-solid domain mapping technique, based on a finite strain model, coupled with a DEVSS finite element formulation is applied to study the effects of viscoelasticity on free surface displacement flows. The flow type analyzed is the displacement of a dilute polymeric solution, modeled by a FENE-CR constitutive equation, in a Hele Shaw Cell. Our study indicates the presence of two distinct flow regimes. In the absence of gravity, a recirculation flow at low Ca (Ca {\textless} 1.0) and a bypass flow at high Ca (Ca {\textgreater} 1.0), are observed. In the recirculation flow we observe the formation of elastic stress boundary layers in the capillary transition region (the thickness of which decrease with increasing elasticity), an increase in the hydrodynamic film thickness with increasing elasticity and a meniscus invasion when the stresses in the elastic boundary layer become very large. We have also qualitatively studied the effect of channel wall divergence on the flow dynamics and ascertained that the elastic stress boundary layer formation is a purely local phenomenon and largely independent of geometric considerations. For the bypass flow, in addition to the elastic stress boundary layer in the capillary transition region, an additional elastic stress boundary layer near the bubble tip is observed. As the Wi is increased, film thickening is observed but no meniscus invasion occurs. We have also studied the effect of gravity on both flows. Addition of gravity in recirculation flow results in a film thinning effect and an increase in the normal stresses in the capillary transition regime. For the bypass flow, even a small amount of gravity introduces recirculation. Finally, we discuss how both flows are elastically unstable and plausible mechanisms for the onset of instability are suggested.},

This method is briefly described, and the main benchmark flows currently used in computational rheology to assess the performance of numerical methods are presented. Outstanding issues in numerical methods and novel and challenging applications of viscoelastic fluids, some of which require further developments in numerical methods, are discussed.

The equations of mass and momentum conservation are derived, and the Cauchy stress tensor makes its first of many appearances. The Navier–Stokes equations are derived, along with their inertialess limit, the Stokes equations. Models used to describe complex fluid phenomena such as shear-dependent viscosity and viscoelasticity are then discussed, beginning with generalized Newtonian fluids. The Carreau–Yasuda and power-law fluid models receive special attention, and a mechanical instability is shown to exist for highly shear-thinning fluids. Differential constitutive models of viscoelastic flows are then described, beginning with the Maxwell fluid and Kelvin–Voigt solid models. After providing the foundations for objective (frame-invariant) derivatives, the linear models are extended to mathematically sound nonlinear models including the upper-convected Maxwell and Oldroyd-B models and others. A derivation of the upper-convected Maxwell model from the kinetic theory perspective is also provided. Finally, normal stress differences are discussed, and the reader is warned about common pitfalls in the mathematical modeling of complex fluids.},

	abstract = {We review constitutive modeling of solutions and melts of linear polymers, focusing on changes in rheological behavior in shear and extensional flow as the concentration increases from unentangled dilute, to entangled, to dense melt. The rheological changes are captured by constitutive equations, prototypes of which are the FENE-P model for unentangled solutions and the DEMG model for entangled solutions and melts. From these equations, and supporting experimental data, for dilute solutions, the extensional viscosity increases with the strain rate from the low–strain rate to the high–strain rate asymptote, but in the densely entangled state, the high–strain rate viscosity is lower than the low–shear rate value, especially when orientation-dependent friction is accounted for. In shearing flow, shear thinning increases dramatically as the entanglement density increases, which can eventually lead to a shear-banding inhomogeneity. Recent improvements in constitutive modeling are paving the way for robust and accurate numerical simulations of polymer fluid mechanics and industrial processing of polymers.},

It is shown that the settling process in a viscoelastic Boger fluid is time-dependent and inhomogeneous; both experiments and simulations exhibit the formation of particle-rich, fast-settling regions and particle-depleted regions with backflow. The settling process in a Newtonian fluid is investigated for comparison and is shown to be homogeneous, with velocity fluctuations that decay following random mixing. In the viscoelastic Boger fluid, the mean settling rate is higher than that measured in a similar Newtonian suspending fluid, and in our experiments, higher than that of a single particle settling in isolation. When a cross shear flow is imposed, the mean settling rate in the viscoelastic Boger fluid is drastically reduced; the magnitude of the reduction is greater than that measured for a single particle, suggesting that both fluid elasticity and the suspension's particle volume fraction have important effects.},

	abstract = {Newtonian liquids that contain even small amounts (∼ppm) of flexible polymers can exhibit viscoelastic behavior in extensional flows. Here, the effects of the presence of DNA molecules in viscous fluids on the dynamics of filament thinning and drop breakup are investigated experimentally in a cross-slot microchannel. Both bulk flow and single molecule experiments are presented. Suspensions of DNA molecules of different molecular weights (MW) are used, namely λ-DNA (MW = 3 × 107) and T4 DNA (MW = 1 × 108). Results of both dilute (c/c* = 0.5) and semi-dilute (c/c* = 1) suspensions are compared to those of a viscous, Newtonian liquid. Results show that the dynamics of the high MW, semi-dilute suspension of T4 DNA are similar to viscoelastic fluids such as slow, exponential decay of the fluid thread and beads-on-a-string morphology. The exponential decay rate of the filament thickness is used to measure the steady extensional viscosity of all fluids. We find that the semi-dilute T4 DNA suspension exhibits extensional strain rate thinning extensional viscosity, while for all other fluids the extensional viscosity is independent of strain rate. Direct visualization of fluorescently labeled λ-DNA molecules using high-speed imaging shows that the strong flow in the thinning fluid threads provide sufficient forces to stretch the majority of DNA molecules away from their equilibrium coiled state. The distribution of molecular stretch lengths, however, is very heterogeneous due to molecular individualism and initial conditions.},

	abstract = {We present a 3D numerical investigation of the viscometric functions for suspensions in viscoelastic fluids under steady shear including comparisons with theoretical predictions in the dilute regime and experimental results for non-colloidal suspensions in a Boger fluid. The comparison with dilute suspension theoretical predictions resolves a discrepancy in the literature regarding the second normal stress difference calculated using the Landau–Lifshitz averaging procedure versus using the ensemble averaging procedure. We also determine that the particle contribution to the stress in a dilute suspension in viscoelastic fluids shear-thickens in all viscometric material properties and we present the scaling of the viscometric functions with the Weissenberg number (Wi). This shear-thickening behavior is fundamentally different from that shown in 2D numerical simulations which are attributed to elongation flow effects between particles. Comparisons with experimental results at volume fraction ϕ=0.05, which is the lowest volume fraction available in existing experimental measurements of bulk viscometric functions, highlight the important role of long range hydrodynamic interactions between particles to fully describe the suspension rheology even at low volume fractions. We investigate the effect of hydrodynamic interactions in the flow, vorticity, and gradient directions and show that these interactions can greatly enhance or decrease the viscometric functions as well as change the shear rate dependent behavior of the suspension.},

To elucidate the key factor for the quantitative prediction of the shear thickening in suspensions in viscoelastic fluids, direct numerical simulations of many-particle suspensions in a multi-mode Oldroyd-B fluid are performed using the smoothed profile method. Suspension flow under simple shear flow is solved under periodic boundary conditions by using Lees–Edwards boundary conditions for particle dynamics and a time-dependent oblique coordinate system that evolves with mean shear flow for fluid dynamics. Semidilute many-particle suspensions up to a particle volume fraction of 0.1 are investigated. The presented numerical results regarding the bulk rheological properties of the shear-thickening behaviour agree quantitatively with recent experimental results of semidilute suspensions in a Boger fluid. The presented result clarifies that an accurate estimation of the first normal stress difference of the matrix in the shear-rate range where the shear thickening starts to occur is crucial for the quantitative prediction of the suspension shear thickening in a Boger fluid matrix at around the Weissenberg number Wi=1Wi=1\{Wi\}=1 by an Oldroyd-B model. Additionally, the effect of suspension microstructures on the suspension viscosity is examined. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the flow pattern and the elastic stress development change with the volume fraction and Weissenberg number.},

Particular focus is placed on the particle-induced fluid stress, which is the dominant contribution to the shear thickening behavior, especially at moderate to high Weissenberg numbers. We determine the Weissenberg number scaling for both the magnitude of the particle-induced fluid stress and the volume containing most of the particle-induced fluid stress to understand the overall suspension behavior at moderate Weissenberg numbers. Furthermore, we analyze the flow type in the regions of significant polymer-induced fluid stress and find that the stretch of polymers in strain-dominated flow within closed streamlines around the particles generates the large stresses that contribute to the thickening behavior. Thus, understanding the response of the suspending fluid to extensional deformation is important for predicting the shear rheology of the bulk suspension. Lastly, we explore the effect of polymer viscosity and polymer extensibility on the behavior of the particle-induced fluid stress.},

    . Qualitative changes in the flow dynamics are observed compared with dilute suspensions which were studied previously and are known to promote the cycles of hibernating and active turbulence. In contrast, at moderate concentration of particles, these cycles are entirely absent at the same level of fluid elasticity. In addition, instead of the commonly anticipated polymer drag reduction, a drag increase is observed when elasticity exceeds a threshold Weissenberg number. The higher drag is examined at various scales, starting from a global stress balance and down to the level of the particle microstructure. A key factor is the increase in polymer stresses, while the Reynolds shear stress is nearly eradicated. An explanation is provided by analysing the polymer conformation tensor using appropriate measures of its departure from the equilibrium state, with particular focus on the fluid in the vicinity of the particles. It is also demonstrated that viscoelasticity markedly affects both the diffusion and migration dynamics of the particles: diffusion is inhibited due to suppression of turbulent activity and, as a result, reduced mixing of particles and faster decorrelation of their motion; migration is preferential towards the channel centre, which leads to appreciable clustering in that region, which has a direct impact on the local polymer stresses.},

The settling process in a Newtonian fluid is investigated for comparison and is shown to be homogeneous, with velocity fluctuations that decay following random mixing. In the viscoelastic Boger fluid, the mean settling rate is higher than that measured in a similar Newtonian suspending fluid, and in our experiments, higher than that of a single particle settling in isolation. When a cross shear flow is imposed, the mean settling rate in the viscoelastic Boger fluid is drastically reduced; the magnitude of the reduction is greater than that measured for a single particle, suggesting that both fluid elasticity and the suspension's particle volume fraction have important effects.},

	abstract = {Experimental observations and linear stability calculations are presented for the stability of torsional flows of viscoelastic fluids between two parallel coaxial disks, one of which is held stationary while the other is rotated at a constant angular velocity. Beyond a critical value of the dimensionless rotation rate, or Deborah number, the purely circumferential, viscometric base flow becomes unstable with respect to a nonaxisymmetric, time-dependent motion consisting of spiral vortices which travel radially outwards across the disks. Video-imaging measurements in two highly elastic polyisobutylene solutions are used to determine the radial wavelength, wavespeed and azimuthal structure of the spiral disturbance. The spatial characteristics of this purely elastic instability scale with the rotation rate and axial separation between the disks; however, the observed spiral structure of the secondary motion is a sensitive function of the fluid rheology and the aspect ratio of the finite disks.Very near the centre of the disk the flow remains stable at all rotation rates, and the unsteady secondary motion is only observed in an annular region beyond a critical radius, denoted R*1. The spiral vortices initially increase in intensity as they propagate radially outwards across the disk; however, at larger radii they are damped and the spiral structure disappears beyond a second critical radius, R*2. This restabilization of the base viscometric flow is described quantitatively by considering a viscoelastic constitutive equation that captures the nonlinear rheology of the polymeric test fluids in steady shearing flows. A radially localized, linear stability analysis of torsional motions between infinite parallel coaxial disks for this model predicts an instability to non-axisymmetric disturbances for a finite range of radii, which depends on the Deborah number and on the rheological parameters in the model. The most dangerous instability mode varies with the Deborah number; however, at low rotation rates the steady viscometric flow is stable to all localized disturbances, at any radial position.Experimental values for the wavespeed, wavelength and azimuthal structure of this flow instability are described well by the analysis; however, the critical radii calculated for growth of infinitesimal disturbances are smaller than the values obtained from experimental observations of secondary motions. Calculation of the time rate of change in the additional viscous energy created or dissipated by the disturbance shows that the mechanism of instability for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations is the same, and arises from a coupling between the kinematics of the steady curvilinear base flow and the polymeric stresses in the disturbance flow. For finitely extensible dumb-bells, the magnitude of this coupling is reduced and an additional dissipative contribution to the mechanical energy balance arises, so that the disturbance is damped at large radial positions where the mean shear rate is large.Hysteresis experiments demonstrate that the instability is subcritical in the rotation rate, and, at long times, the initially well-defined spiral flow develops into a more complex three-dimensional aperiodic motion. Experimental observations indicate that this nonlinear evolution proceeds via a rapid splitting of the spiral vortices into vortices of approximately half the initial radial wavelength, and ultimately results in a state consisting of both inwardly and outwardly travelling spiral vortices with a range of radial wavenumbers.},

	abstract = {This paper is an pedagogical essay on the scenario of the instabilities and the transition to turbulence in visco-elastic polymer ﬂows. When polymers are long, they get easily stretched by the shear present in ﬂows, and the viscosity of the solution or melt is large. As a result, inertial effects are usually negligible as the Reynolds numbers are small but the ﬂuid is strongly nonNewtonian due to the shear-induced elasticity and anistropy, and the slow relaxation effects. The dimensionless number governing these nonNewtonian effects is the Weissenberg number Wi. From a number of precise experiments and theoretical investigations in the last ﬁfteen years, it has become clear that as the Weissenberg number increases, visco-elastic ﬂuids exhibit ﬂow instabilities driven by the anisotropy of the normal stress components and the curvature of the streamlines. The combination of these normal stress effects that drive laminar curved ﬂow unstable and the possibilty of the elastic effects to store energy in high shear regions and to dump it elsewhere in less sheared regions, appears to be strongly self-enhancing: Instabilities and the transition to a turbulent regime driven by these elastic forces, are often found to be hysteretic and strongly subcritical (nonlinear). There are two main underlying themes of this introductory essay. First of all, that it is proﬁtable to let one be motivated by transition scenarios in Newtonian ﬂuids as a function of Reynolds number, when investigating possible transition scenarios in visco-elastic ﬂuids as a function of Weissenberg number. Secondly, that the self-enhancing effects of polymer stretching will also cause subcritical instabilities in visco-elastic parallel shear ﬂows. The aim of this paper is to introduce and discuss these issues at a pictorial level which is accessible for a nonexpert. After introducing some of the basic ingredients of polymer rheology we follow a number of the important theoretical and experimental developments of the last ﬁfteen years and discuss the picture that emerges from it. We then turn to a discussion of recent theoretical and numerical approaches aimed at establishing whether visco-elastic parallel shear ﬂows indeed also exhibit a subcritical transition to elastic turbulence. We show how a simple extension of the well-known condition of Pakdel and McKinley for the instability threshold of curved ﬂows, can be extended to the nonlinear (subcritical) instability scenario of parallel visco-elastic shear ﬂows. This extension predicts the critical amplitude for the nonlinear instability to decrease as 1/Wi2 and to be independent of the wavenumber k of the perturbations. The fact that the threshold is k-independent over a large range of k’s suggest that many modes will be excited at the same time, and hence that the instability will generally drive the ﬂow turbulent. Implications of these results and an outlook for the future are discussed as well.},

	abstract = {Particles suspended in viscoelastic media are known to develop string-like structures when being sheared at sufficiently high shear rates. The occurrence of these strings has been attributed to normal stress effects, and it has been suggested that a critical Weissenberg number of 10 governs their appearance. This assumption is tested here, using suspensions of monodisperse polystyrene spheres. The level of viscosity and elasticity, as well as the degree of shear thinning of the suspending fluid, have been varied over a wide range of values. The critical Weissenberg number for the onset of string formation, as detected by microscopy, was not constant but ranged from 0.5 to 16.5 in contrast with literature results. Suspensions in highly elastic Boger fluids did not display any alignment at all, even at Weissenberg numbers as high as 260. Small angle light scattering (SALS) was used to calculate an alignment factor. It provides an objective and quantitative measure for the degree of alignment of the particles. It also makes it possible, in some cases, to determine precisely the interparticle spacing in the strings. The kinetics of string formation can be studied as well, they seem to be strain-controlled. SALS experiments with different gap spacings have been used to demonstrate that the string formation occurs in the bulk of the liquid rather than at the walls of the cell.},

	abstract = {Flow-induced structures in suspensions containing spheres in viscoelastic suspending media were investigated by microscopy and rheo-optical methods. Suspensions of monodisperse polystyrene spheres with diameters ranging from 1.2 to 2.8 μm and dispersed in aqueous solutions of hydroxypropylcellulose were studied in simple shear flows. Optical microscopy observations as well as small-angle light-scattering (SALS) experiments were performed using a parallel plate geometry. In agreement with previous work, necklaces of particles aligned in the flow direction were observed when shearing faster then a critical shear rate, which was found to be independent of particle size. In contrast to earlier work, however, the role of particle migration was found to be of prime importance. Particles were shown to migrate toward the plates where the particles assembled and aligned in strings running in the flow direction. For the smallest particles (1 μm diameter), the formation of particle doublets or short strings along the vorticity direction was observed at low shear rates, which flipped to an orientation into the flow direction and grew into longer strings at higher shear rates. SALS experiments were used to quantify the degree of alignment and its dependence on particle size, shear rate, and gap. For the system under investigation, the degree of alignment was found to increase with increasing shear rate and particle size and with decreasing gap. The present results suggest that, depending on the details of the suspending medium and the size and nature of the suspended particles, the formation of aligned structures is affected by the relative magnitude of the colloidal and hydrodynamic forces and the kinetics of string formation versus the kinetics of migration.},

In general, self-organization is driven by interparticle potentials and is opposed by the chaotic dynamics characteristic of many driven non-equilibrium systems. Here we introduce a new model that shows how the irreversible collisions that generally produce diffusive chaotic dynamics can also cause a system to self-organize to avoid future collisions. This can lead to a self-organized non-fluctuating quiescent state, with a dynamical phase transition separating it from fluctuating diffusing states. We apply the model to recent experiments on periodically sheared particle suspensions where a transition from reversible to irreversible behaviour was observed. New experiments presented here exhibit remarkable agreement with this simple model. More generally, the model and experiments provide new insights into how driven systems can self-organize.},

We successfully test the setup by measuring the Brownian diffusion and flow velocity of dilute colloidal suspensions, both at rest and under shear. The potentialities of the apparatus are explored in the start-up shear of a biogel. For small shear deformations, γ≤2\%, the rheological response of the gel is linear. However, striking deviations from affine deformation are seen from the very onset of shear, due to temporally and spatially heterogeneous rearrangements having intriguing similarities with a stick-slip process.},

The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},

    However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken.
    We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator.
    This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series.
    We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively.
    We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples.
    Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework.
    In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory.
    It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science.
    We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

Key principles, achievements, and challenges are discussed.

Here I review the current understanding of the equilibrium phase behaviour, structure, phase transition kinetics, and metastability of this model colloid–polymer mixture. These ﬁndings form a useful reference point for understanding more complex mixtures.

Sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the ℓ1-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm well-suited for large problems.

Here we show in non-Newtonian fluids a transition sequence to ‘elastic turbulence’ due to elasticity from polymers, with negligible inertia. Multiple dynamic states are found linking the base flow to ‘elastic turbulence’ in the flow between a rotating and stationary disk, including circular and spiral rolls. Also, a surprising progression from apparently ‘chaotic’ flow to periodic flow and then to ‘elastic turbulence’ is found. These transitions are found in experiments where either shear stress or shear rate is incrementally increased and then held at fixed values; the modes found following stable base flow are ‘stationary ring’, ‘competing spirals’, ‘multi-spiral chaotic’ and ‘spiral bursting’ modes, followed then by ‘elastic turbulence’. Each mode has a distinct rheological signature, and accompanying imaging of the secondary-flow field (simultaneous with rheological measurement) reveals kinematic structures including stationary and time-dependent rolls. The time-dependent changes in the secondary-flow structure can be related to the time-dependent viscosity in the case of several of the modes. Finally, the effect of polymer concentration on the transitional pathway modes is studied systematically.},

Exact solutions of this equation are obtained from solutions of a linear equation which are analogous to Bloch bands for a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential. On some contours of the stream function, the order parameter approaches a limit, and on others it depends increasingly sensitively upon position. However, in the long-time limit a local average of the order parameter is a smooth function of position in both cases.

	abstract = {We applied a recently developed microrheology technique based on colloidal magnetic tweezers to measure local viscoelastic moduli and active forces in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum. The active transport of nonmagnetic beads taken up by phagocytosis was analyzed by single particle tracking, which allowed us to measure the length of straight steps and the corresponding velocities of the movements. The motion consists of a superposition of nearly straight long-range steps (step length in the micrometer range) and local random walks (step widths about 0.1 µm). The velocities for the former type of motion range from 1 to 3 µm/s. They decrease with increasing bead size and are attributed to rapid active transport along microtubuli. The short-range local motions exhibit velocities of less than 0.5 µm/s and reflect the internal dynamics of the cytoplasm. Viscoelastic response curves were measured by application of force pulses with amplitudes varying between 50 {pN} and 400 {pN}. Analysis of the response curves in terms of mechanical equivalent circuits yielded cytoplasmic viscosities varying between 10 and 350 Pa s. Simultaneous analysis of the response curves and of the bead trajectories showed that the motion of the beads is determined by the local yield stress within the cytoplasmic scaffold and cisternae, which varies between σ=30 Pa and 250 Pa. The motion of intracellular particles is interpreted in terms of viscoplastic behavior and the apparent viscosity is a measure of the reciprocal rate of bond breakage within the cytoplasmatic network. The viscoelastic moduli are interpreted as dynamic quantities which depend sensitively on the amplitude of the forces, and the rate of bond breakage is determined by the Arrhenius-Kramers law with the activation energy being reduced by the work performed by the applied force. In agreement with previous work, we provide evidence that the myosin {II}-deficient cells exhibit higher yield stresses, suggesting that the function of myosin {II} as a cross-linker is taken over by the other (non-active) cross-linkers.},

Microtubules are polar filaments that undergo dynamic instability, i.e. transition between phases of growth and shrinkage. This allows microtubules to explore the inner space of the cell, generate pushing and pulling forces and remodel themselves into arrays with different geometry and function such as the mitotic spindle. To do this, eukaryotic cells employ an arsenal of regulatory proteins to control microtubule dynamics spatially and temporally. Plants and microorganisms have developed secondary metabolites that perturb microtubule dynamics, many of which are in active use as cancer chemotherapeutics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Here, we summarize the methods used to visualize microtubules and to measure the parameters of dynamic instability to study both microtubule regulatory proteins and the action of small molecules interfering with microtubule assembly and/or disassembly.},

In motile, rapidly deforming cells such as human neutrophils, bulk cytoplasmic flow couples cell deformation to the transport and dispersion of cytoplasmic particles. Using particle-tracking measurements in live neutrophil-like cells, we demonstrate that fluid flow associated with the cell deformation contributes to the motion of small acidic organelles, dominating over diffusion on timescales above a few seconds. We then use a general physical model of particle dispersion in a deforming fluid domain to show that transport of organelle-sized particles between the cell periphery and the bulk can be enhanced by dynamic deformation comparable to that observed in neutrophils. Our results implicate an important mechanism contributing to organelle transport in these motile cells: cytoplasmic flow driven by cell shape deformation.},

Here, we introduce force-spectrum-microscopy ({FSM}) to directly quantify random forces within the cytoplasm of cells and thereby probe stochastic motor activity. This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using {FSM}, we show that force fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, {FSM} has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states.},

Here, we identify a robust and unified relationship between cell stiffness and cell volume. As a cell spreads on a substrate, its volume decreases, while its stiffness concomitantly increases. We find that both cortical and cytoplasmic cell stiffness scale with volume for numerous perturbations, including varying substrate stiffness, cell spread area, and external osmotic pressure. The reduction of cell volume is a result of water efflux, which leads to a corresponding increase in intracellular molecular crowding. Furthermore, we find that changes in cell volume, and hence stiffness, alter stem-cell differentiation, regardless of the method by which these are induced. These observations reveal a surprising, previously unidentified relationship between cell stiffness and cell volume that strongly influences cell biology.},

	abstract = {This study reports the design, realization, and characterization of a multi-pole magnetic tweezers that enables us to maneuver small magnetic probes inside living cells. So far, magnetic tweezers can be divided into two categories: I), tweezers that allow the exertion of high forces but consist of only one or two poles and therefore are capable of only exerting forces in one direction; and {II}), tweezers that consist of multiple poles and allow exertion of forces in multiple directions but at very low forces. The magnetic tweezers described here combines both aspects in a single apparatus: high forces in a controllable direction. To this end, micron scale magnetic structures are fabricated using cleanroom technologies. With these tweezers, magnetic flux gradients of ∇B = 8 × 103 T m−1 can be achieved over the dimensions of a single cell. This allows exertion of forces up to 12 {pN} on paramagnetic probes with a diameter of 350 nm, enabling us to maneuver them through the cytoplasm of a living cell. It is expected that with the current tweezers, {picoNewton} forces can be exerted on beads as small as 100 nm.},

	abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of nocodazole can block cells in mitosis without net microtubule disassembly and resulted in the hypothesis that this block was due to a nocodazole-induced stabilization of microtubules. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of nanomolar concentrations of nocodazole on microtubule dynamic instability in interphase cells and in vitro with purified brain tubulin. Newt lung epithelial cell microtubules were visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy and cells were perfused with solutions of nocodazole ranging in concentration from 4 to 400 {nM}. Microtubules showed a loss of the two-state behavior typical of dynamic instability as evidenced by the addition of a third state where they exhibited little net change in length (a paused state). Nocodazole perfusion also resulted in slower elongation and shortening velocities, increased catastrophe, and an overall decrease in microtubule turnover. Experiments performed on {BSC}-1 cells that were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin, incubated in nocodazole for 1 h, and visualized by using low-light-level fluorescence microscopy showed similar results except that nocodazole-treated {BSC}-1 cells showed a decrease in catastrophe. To gain insight into possible mechanisms responsible for changes in dynamic instability, we examined the effects of 4 {nM} to 12 {microM} nocodazole on the assembly of purified tubulin from axoneme seeds. At both microtubule plus and minus ends, perfusion with nocodazole resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in elongation and shortening velocities, increase in pause duration and catastrophe frequency, and decrease in rescue frequency. These effects, which result in an overall decrease in microtubule turnover after nocodazole treatment, suggest that the mitotic block observed is due to a reduction in microtubule dynamic turnover. In addition, the in vitro results are similar to the effects of increasing concentrations of {GDP}-tubulin ({TuD}) subunits on microtubule assembly. Given that nocodazole increases tubulin {GTPase} activity, we propose that nocodazole acts by generating {TuD} subunits that then alter dynamic instability.},

The velocities for the former type of motion range from 1 to 3 µm/s. They decrease with increasing bead size and are attributed to rapid active transport along microtubuli. The short-range local motions exhibit velocities of less than 0.5 µm/s and reflect the internal dynamics of the cytoplasm. Viscoelastic response curves were measured by application of force pulses with amplitudes varying between 50 {pN} and 400 {pN}. Analysis of the response curves in terms of mechanical equivalent circuits yielded cytoplasmic viscosities varying between 10 and 350 Pa s. Simultaneous analysis of the response curves and of the bead trajectories showed that the motion of the beads is determined by the local yield stress within the cytoplasmic scaffold and cisternae, which varies between σ=30 Pa and 250 Pa. The motion of intracellular particles is interpreted in terms of viscoplastic behavior and the apparent viscosity is a measure of the reciprocal rate of bond breakage within the cytoplasmatic network. The viscoelastic moduli are interpreted as dynamic quantities which depend sensitively on the amplitude of the forces, and the rate of bond breakage is determined by the Arrhenius-Kramers law with the activation energy being reduced by the work performed by the applied force. In agreement with previous work, we provide evidence that the myosin {II}-deficient cells exhibit higher yield stresses, suggesting that the function of myosin {II} as a cross-linker is taken over by the other (non-active) cross-linkers.},

	abstract = {Microtubules are key players in cellular self-organization, acting as structural scaffolds, cellular highways, force generators and signalling platforms. Microtubules are polar filaments that undergo dynamic instability, i.e. transition between phases of growth and shrinkage. This allows microtubules to explore the inner space of the cell, generate pushing and pulling forces and remodel themselves into arrays with different geometry and function such as the mitotic spindle. To do this, eukaryotic cells employ an arsenal of regulatory proteins to control microtubule dynamics spatially and temporally. Plants and microorganisms have developed secondary metabolites that perturb microtubule dynamics, many of which are in active use as cancer chemotherapeutics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Here, we summarize the methods used to visualize microtubules and to measure the parameters of dynamic instability to study both microtubule regulatory proteins and the action of small molecules interfering with microtubule assembly and/or disassembly.},

In motile, rapidly deforming cells such as human neutrophils, bulk cytoplasmic flow couples cell deformation to the transport and dispersion of cytoplasmic particles. Using particle-tracking measurements in live neutrophil-like cells, we demonstrate that fluid flow associated with the cell deformation contributes to the motion of small acidic organelles, dominating over diffusion on timescales above a few seconds. We then use a general physical model of particle dispersion in a deforming fluid domain to show that transport of organelle-sized particles between the cell periphery and the bulk can be enhanced by dynamic deformation comparable to that observed in neutrophils. Our results implicate an important mechanism contributing to organelle transport in these motile cells: cytoplasmic flow driven by cell shape deformation.},

Here, we introduce force-spectrum-microscopy ({FSM}) to directly quantify random forces within the cytoplasm of cells and thereby probe stochastic motor activity. This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using {FSM}, we show that force fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, {FSM} has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states.},

Here, we identify a robust and unified relationship between cell stiffness and cell volume. As a cell spreads on a substrate, its volume decreases, while its stiffness concomitantly increases. We find that both cortical and cytoplasmic cell stiffness scale with volume for numerous perturbations, including varying substrate stiffness, cell spread area, and external osmotic pressure. The reduction of cell volume is a result of water efflux, which leads to a corresponding increase in intracellular molecular crowding. Furthermore, we find that changes in cell volume, and hence stiffness, alter stem-cell differentiation, regardless of the method by which these are induced. These observations reveal a surprising, previously unidentified relationship between cell stiffness and cell volume that strongly influences cell biology.},

	abstract = {This study reports the design, realization, and characterization of a multi-pole magnetic tweezers that enables us to maneuver small magnetic probes inside living cells. So far, magnetic tweezers can be divided into two categories: I), tweezers that allow the exertion of high forces but consist of only one or two poles and therefore are capable of only exerting forces in one direction; and {II}), tweezers that consist of multiple poles and allow exertion of forces in multiple directions but at very low forces. The magnetic tweezers described here combines both aspects in a single apparatus: high forces in a controllable direction. To this end, micron scale magnetic structures are fabricated using cleanroom technologies. With these tweezers, magnetic flux gradients of ∇B = 8 × 103 T m−1 can be achieved over the dimensions of a single cell. This allows exertion of forces up to 12 {pN} on paramagnetic probes with a diameter of 350 nm, enabling us to maneuver them through the cytoplasm of a living cell. It is expected that with the current tweezers, {picoNewton} forces can be exerted on beads as small as 100 nm.},

	abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of nocodazole can block cells in mitosis without net microtubule disassembly and resulted in the hypothesis that this block was due to a nocodazole-induced stabilization of microtubules. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of nanomolar concentrations of nocodazole on microtubule dynamic instability in interphase cells and in vitro with purified brain tubulin. Newt lung epithelial cell microtubules were visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy and cells were perfused with solutions of nocodazole ranging in concentration from 4 to 400 {nM}. Microtubules showed a loss of the two-state behavior typical of dynamic instability as evidenced by the addition of a third state where they exhibited little net change in length (a paused state). Nocodazole perfusion also resulted in slower elongation and shortening velocities, increased catastrophe, and an overall decrease in microtubule turnover. Experiments performed on {BSC}-1 cells that were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin, incubated in nocodazole for 1 h, and visualized by using low-light-level fluorescence microscopy showed similar results except that nocodazole-treated {BSC}-1 cells showed a decrease in catastrophe. To gain insight into possible mechanisms responsible for changes in dynamic instability, we examined the effects of 4 {nM} to 12 {microM} nocodazole on the assembly of purified tubulin from axoneme seeds. At both microtubule plus and minus ends, perfusion with nocodazole resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in elongation and shortening velocities, increase in pause duration and catastrophe frequency, and decrease in rescue frequency. These effects, which result in an overall decrease in microtubule turnover after nocodazole treatment, suggest that the mitotic block observed is due to a reduction in microtubule dynamic turnover. In addition, the in vitro results are similar to the effects of increasing concentrations of {GDP}-tubulin ({TuD}) subunits on microtubule assembly. Given that nocodazole increases tubulin {GTPase} activity, we propose that nocodazole acts by generating {TuD} subunits that then alter dynamic instability.},

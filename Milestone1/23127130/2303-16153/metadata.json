    "abstract": "Given two time series, A and B, sampled asynchronously at different times {t_A_i} and {t_B_j}, termed \"ticks\", how can one best estimate the correlation coefficient ρbetween changes in A and B? We derive a natural, minimum-variance estimator that does not use any interpolation or binning, then derive from it a fast (linear time) estimator that is demonstrably nearly as good. This \"fast tickwise estimator\" is compared in simulation to the usual method of interpolating changes to a regular grid. Even when the grid spacing is optimized for the particular parameters (not often possible in practice), the fast tickwise estimator has generally smaller estimation errors, often by a large factor. These results are directly applicable to tick-by-tick price data of financial assets.",

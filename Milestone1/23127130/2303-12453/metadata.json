    "abstract": "The paper presents the low temperature expansion of the 2D Ising model in the presence of the magnetic field in powers of $x=\\exp(-J/(kT))$ and $z=\\exp(B/(kT))$ with full polynomials in $z$ up to $x^{88}$ and full polynomials in $x^4$ up to $z^{-60}$, in the latter case the polynomials are explicitly given. The new result presented in the paper is an expansion not in inverse powers of $z$ but in $(z^2+x^8)^{-k}$ where the subsequent coefficients (polynomials in $x^4$) turn out to be divisible by increasing powers of $(1-x^4)$. The paper describes both the analytic expansions of the partition function and the efficient combinatorial methods to get the coefficients of the expansion.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In histopathology, there is a hierarchical organization and interrelationship between cells and tissues. Hence, we hypothesize that it can be leveraged to improve the performance of cell detection tasks. Throughout this paper, we have shown evidence that such cell-tissue relationships exist across multiple setups. Indeed, we observe improvements when utilizing large FoVs with corresponding tissue annotations together with cell annotations in a multi-task learning approach, using simple neural architecture designs. Although the cell detection task clearly benefits from the multi-task learning framework, the improvement on the tissue segmentation task was not yet investigated, and we leave this topic as a future direction. We hope this work, especially the \ours dataset, initiates new and promising research directions in CPATH to further study the cell-tissue relationships and improve cell detection and tissue segmentation.

    "abstract": "This article provides a general iterative approximation to partial differential equations, and thus establish existence of smooth solution. The heart of the method is to contract (or expand) the boundary conditions uniformly in the domain, then using local and global correspondence to transform discrete step function to successive integration on the domain. Numerical scheme is discussed and tested for Navier-Stokes equation.",

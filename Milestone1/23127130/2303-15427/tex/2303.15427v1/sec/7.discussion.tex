Despite good performance and robustness across different scenes, our method still shows limitations from: (i) highly mismatched character poses may compromise inter-frame motion and lead to undesired results;
(ii) the temporal resolution and duration of D-NeRFs are still insufficient compared to graphics engine. Generating complex and long trajectory wrt active character motion can be laborious.

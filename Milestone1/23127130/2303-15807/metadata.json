    "abstract": "We develop a scheme of generating highly indistinguishable single photons from an active quantum Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain made from a collection of noisy quantum emitters. Surprisingly, the single photon emission spectrum of the active quantum chain is extremely narrow compared to that of a single emitter or topologically trivial chain. Moreover, this effect becomes dramatically strong close to the non-trivial-to-trivial phase transition point. Using this effect, we show that the single photon linewidth of a long topological quantum chain can become arbitrarily narrow, constituting an ideal source of indistinguishable single photons. Finally, taking specific examples of actual quantum emitters, we provide a microscopic and quantitative analysis of our model and analyze the most important parameters in view of the experimental realization.",

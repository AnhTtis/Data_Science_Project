abstract = {Internal tides power much of the observed small-scale turbulence in the ocean interior. To represent mixing induced by this turbulence in ocean climate models, the cascade of internal tide energy to dissipation scales must be understood and mapped. Here, we present a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks. The mapping relies on the following ingredients: (i) a global observational climatology of stratification; (ii) maps of the generation of M2, S2 and K1 internal tides decomposed into vertical normal modes; (iii) simplified representations of the dissipation of low-mode internal tides due to wave-wave interactions, scattering by small-scale topography, interaction with critical slopes and shoaling; (iv) Lagrangian tracking of low-mode energy beams through observed stratification, including refraction and reflection. We thus obtain a global map of the column-integrated energy dissipation for each of the four considered dissipative processes, each of the three tidal constituents and each of the first five modes. Modes ≥6 are inferred to dissipate within the local water column at the employed half-degree horizontal resolution. Combining all processes, modes and constituents, we construct a map of the total internal tide energy dissipation, which compares well with observational inferences of internal wave energy dissipation. This result suggests that tides largely shape observed spatial contrasts of dissipation, and that the framework has potential in improving understanding and modelling of ocean mixing. However, sensitivity to poorly constrained parameters and simplifying assumptions entering the parameterized energy sinks calls for additional investigation. The attenuation of low-mode internal tides by wave-wave interactions needs particular attention.}

    abstract = { The ocean circulation is a cause and consequence of fluid scale interactions ranging from millimeters to more than 10,000 km. Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10\% appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full water-column flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorter than approximately 100–200 km. At high frequencies, KE is dominated by internal waves with near-inertial frequencies (frequencies near the local Coriolis parameter), whose shears appear to be a major source of wave breaking and mixing in the ocean interior. }

abstract = {Because of its relevance for the global climate the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been a major research focus for many years. Yet the question of which physical mechanisms ultimately drive the AMOC, in the sense of providing its energy supply, remains a matter of controversy. Here we review both observational data and model results concerning the two main candidates: vertical mixing processes in the ocean's interior and wind-induced Ekman upwelling in the Southern Ocean. In distinction to the energy source we also discuss the role of surface heat and freshwater fluxes, which influence the volume transport of the meridional overturning circulation and shape its spatial circulation pattern without actually supplying energy to the overturning itself in steady state. We conclude that both wind-driven upwelling and vertical mixing are likely contributing to driving the observed circulation. To quantify their respective contributions, future research needs to address some open questions, which we outline.},

abstract = {Without deep mixing, the ocean would turn, within a few thousand years, into a stagnant pool of cold salty water with equilibrium maintained locally by near-surface mixing and with very weak convectively driven surface-intensified circulation. (This result follows from Sandström’s theorem for a fluid heated and cooled at the surface.) In this context we revisit the 1966 “Abyssal Recipes”, which called for a diapycnal diffusivity of 10-4m2/s (1cgs) to maintain the abyssal stratification against global upwelling associated with 25Sverdrups of deep water formation. Subsequent microstructure measurements gave a pelagic diffusivity (away from topography) of 10-5m2/s — a low value confirmed by dye release experiments. A new solution (without restriction to constant coefficients) leads to approximately the same values of global upwelling and diffusivity, but we reinterpret the computed diffusivity as a surrogate for a small number of concentrated sources of buoyancy flux (regions of intense mixing) from which the water masses (but not the turbulence) are exported into the ocean interior. Using the Levitus climatology we find that 2.1TW (terawatts) are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30Sverdrups of deep water formation. The winds and tides are the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior mixing. Tidal dissipation is known from astronomy to equal 3.7 TW (2.50±0.05TW from M2 alone), but nearly all of this has traditionally been allocated to dissipation in the turbulent bottom boundary layers of marginal seas. However, two recent TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric estimates combined with dynamical models suggest that 0.6–0.9TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of wind-driving suggests 1TW of additional mixing power. All values are very uncertain. A surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. Coupled with the findings that mixing occurs at a few dominant sites, there is a host of questions concerning the maintenance of the present climate state, but also that of paleoclimates and their relation to detailed continental configurations, the history of the Earth–Moon system, and a possible great sensitivity to details of the wind system.}

    abstract = {AbstractThe coexistence in the deep ocean of a finite, stable stratification, a strong meridional overturning circulation, and mesoscale eddies raises complex questions concerning the circulation energetics. In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deep water tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue. }

While the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to slow down under anthropogenic warming, the exact role of the AMOC in future climate change has not been fully quantified. Here, we present a method to stabilize the AMOC intensity in anthropogenic warming experiments by removing fresh water from the subpolar North Atlantic. This method enables us to isolate the AMOC climatic impacts in experiments with a full-physics climate model. Our results show that a weakened AMOC can explain ocean cooling south of Greenland that resembles the North Atlantic warming hole and a reduced Arctic sea ice loss in all seasons with a delay of about 6 years in the emergence of an ice-free Arctic in boreal summer. In the troposphere, a weakened AMOC causes an anomalous cooling band stretching from the lower levels in high latitudes to the upper levels in the tropics and displaces the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude jets poleward.}}

abstract = {An idealized numerical study of a northward propagating internal tide reveals a dramatic loss of energy to small-scale subharmonic instabilities near 28.9°N. Inspired by observations of the internal tide radiating northward from the Hawaiian Ridge, a three-dimensional numerical model is initialized with a northward baroclinic tidal flux of approximately 1.7 kW/m. After an initial spinup period, energy is quickly transferred from the baroclinic tide to subharmonic motions, with half the horizontal tidal wavenumber and small vertical scales, through nonlinear advection of horizontal tidal velocity gradients. Potential oceanic implications are twofold. First, once a steady-state has been reached, the instability acts as a partial filter of northward tidal flux between 27.5 and 29.5°N, in rough agreement with some altimetric tidal observations. Second, elevated shear of the subharmonic motions suggests the potential for elevated near-surface dissipation rates near the critical latitude that may be important for upper ocean mixing.},

abstract = {The traditional model of tidal dissipation is based on a frictional bottom boundary layer, in which the work done by bottom drag is proportional to a drag coefficient and the velocity cubed. However, away from shallow, coastal regions the tidal velocities are small, and the work done by the bottom boundary layer can account for only weak levels of dissipation. In the deep ocean, the energy flux carried by internal waves generated over rough topography dominates the energy transfer away from barotropic flow. A parameterization for the internal wave drag over rough topography is included as a dissipative mechanism in a model for the barotropic tides. Model results suggest that the inclusion of this dissipation mechanism improves hydro-dynamical models of the ocean tide. It also substantially increases the amount of modeled tidal dissipation in the deep ocean, bringing dissipation levels there into agreement with recent estimates from TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry data.},

abstract = {Using a parameterization for internal wave energy flux in a hydrodynamic model for the tides, we estimate the global distribution of tidal energy available for enhanced turbulent mixing. A relation for the diffusivity of vertical mixing is formulated for regions where internal tides dissipate their energy as turbulence. We assume that 30 ± 10\% of the internal tide energy flux dissipates as turbulence near the site of generation, consistent with an estimate based on microstructure observations from a mid-ocean ridge site. Enhanced levels of mixing are modeled to decay away from topography, in a manner consistent with these observations. Parameterized diffusivities are shown to resemble observed abyssal mixing rates, with estimated uncertainties comparable to standard errors associated with budget and microstructure methods.},

abstract = {Abstract An idealized two-dimensional numerical model is utilized to study internal wave generation by tide-topography interaction and wind forcing. Previous studies suggest that the quasi-universal Garrett-Munk (GM) internal wave spectrum can be generated and maintained only when energy is supplied from both the wind and the tides, while the present study shows that M2 tidal forcing alone is sufficient to generate a GM-like spectrum in a latitude band roughly between 17° and 29°, with the steepness parameter ε > 1, N0h0/u0 > 1 (N0 is buoyancy frequency, h0 topographic height, and u0 tidal amplitude), and a finite excursion parameter. The key lies in the generation of near-inertial waves (NIWs) by breaking internal tides and triadic resonant interactions around supercritical topography. Remarkably, in the northern South China Sea, tidal forcing can contribute a comparable amount of near-inertial energy as that contributed by the summer wind and thus is an important NIW generation mechanism.},

abstract = {Abstract Several studies have shown the existence of a critical latitude where the dissipation of internal tides is strongly enhanced. Internal tides are internal waves generated by barotropic tidal currents impinging rough topography at the seafloor. Their dissipation and concomitant diapycnal mixing are believed to be important for water masses and the large-scale ocean circulation. The purpose of this study is to clarify the physical processes at the origin of this strong latitudinal dependence of tidal energy dissipation. We find that different mechanisms are involved equatorward and poleward of the critical latitude. Triadic resonant instabilities are responsible for the dissipation of internal tides equatorward of the critical latitude. In particular, a dominant triad involving the primary internal tide and near-inertial waves is key. At the critical latitude, the peak of energy dissipation is explained by both increased instability growth rates, and smaller scales of secondary waves thus more prone to break and dissipate their energy. Surprisingly, poleward of the critical latitude, the generation of evanescent waves appears to be crucial. Triadic instabilities have been widely studied, but the transfer of energy to evanescent waves has received comparatively little attention. Our work suggests that the nonlinear transfer of energy from the internal tide to evanescent waves (corresponding to the 2f-pump mechanism described by Young et al., 2008, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112008001742) is an efficient mechanism to dissipate internal tide energy near and poleward of the critical latitude. The theoretical results are confirmed in idealized high-resolution numerical simulations of a barotropic M2 tide impinging sinusoidal topography in a linearly stratified fluid.},

    abstract = "{Recent numerical and observational studies have reported that resonant wave–wave interaction may be a crucial process for the energy loss of internal tides and the associated vertical water mixing in the midlatitude deep ocean. Special attention has been directed to the remarkable latitudinal dependence of the resonant interaction intensity; semidiurnal internal tides promptly lose their energy to near-inertial motions through parametric subharmonic instability equatorward of the critical latitudes 29°N/S, where half the tidal frequency coincides with the local inertial frequency. This feature contradicts the classical theoretical prediction that resonant wave–wave interaction does not play a major role in the tidal energy loss in the open ocean. By reformulating the kinetic equation for long internal waves and developing its calculation method, we estimate the energy decay rates of the low-vertical-mode semidiurnal internal tides interacting with the “ubiquitous” oceanic internal wave field. The result shows rapid energy decay of the internal tides, typically within O(10) days for the lowest-mode component, near their critical latitudes. This decay time is severalfold shorter than those in the classical studies and, additionally, varies by a factor of 2 depending on the local depth and density structure. We suggest from this study that the numerical integration of the kinetic equation is a more effective approach than recognized to determine the decay parameter of wave energy, which is indispensable for the global ocean models.}",

A two-dimensional plane wave fit method is employed to 1) suppress mesoscale contamination by extracting internal tides with both spatial and temporal coherence and 2) separately resolve multiple internal tidal waves. Global maps of amplitude, phase, energy, and flux of mode-1 M2 internal tides are presented. The M2 internal tides are mainly generated over topographic features, including continental slopes, midocean ridges, and seamounts. Internal tidal beams of 100–300 km width are observed to propagate hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Multiwave interference of some degree is widespread because of the M2 internal tide’s numerous generation sites and long-range propagation. The M2 internal tide propagates across the critical latitudes for parametric subharmonic instability (28.8°S/N) with little energy loss, consistent with the 2006 Internal Waves across the Pacific (IWAP) field measurements. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, the M2 internal tide loses significant energy in propagating across the equator; in contrast, little energy loss is observed in the equatorial zones of the Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific Oceans. Global integration of the satellite observations yields a total energy of 36 PJ (1 PJ = 1015 J) for all the coherent mode-1 M2 internal tides. Finally, satellite observed M2 internal tides compare favorably with field mooring measurements and a global eddy-resolving numerical model.}",

Here the internal wave reflection from concave and convex slopes that pass through the critical angle is investigated numerically using the nonhydrostatic Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm). Overturning, shear instability, and resultant mixing are examined. Results are compared with simulations of wave reflection from planar slopes with angles greater than, less than, and equal to the critical angle. In contrast to the analytic predictions, no reduction in mixing is found for the concave slope as compared with the other slopes. In all cases, stratification is eroded in a band above the slope, bounded at its outer edge by the internal wave characteristic. The difference between numerical and analytic results is caused by the nonlinearity of the numerical calculations, where the finite-amplitude flow leads to generation of upslope-propagating bores for a wide range of topographic slopes around the critical angle.}",

How can one meaningfully interpret the inferred rates of upwelling and diffusion?

I have attemped, wiothout much success, to interpret к froma variety of viewpoints: from mixing along the ocean boundaries, from thermodynamic and biological processes, and from internal tides. Following the work of Cox and Sandstrom (1962), it is found that surface tides are scattered by the irregular bottom into modes with an associated energy flux of 4 × 10−6 ergs g−1 (one sixth total tidal dissipation). Such modes can produce shear instability in the Richardson sence. It is found that internal tides provides a marginal but not impossible mechanism for turbulent diffusion in the interior oceans."

abstract = {The generation and propagation of internal tides from the shelf break in the Bay of Biscay is now a well-documented process, but a description of the spatial coherence of the internal tides has so far been impossible with conventional in situ observations. This paper first analyses the shelf measurements of internal tides and shows that by studying available remotely sensed images over a number of years, particularly in the visible band (which we term “sunglint” images), it is possible to gain significant insight into the spatial coverage, long-crestedness, and seasonal development of these features. The sunglint images provide a synoptic description of the internal tides, and show that they may occur up to 250 km onshelf from the shelf break with coherent crests extending over 400 km in the along shelf direction. The oceanic signal was observed to extend from the shelf break right across the Bay of Biscay (∼300 km). The images allow the tidal wavelengths to be reliably estimated both onshelf and offshelf from the shelf break, without complications arising from advection by the barotropic tide which occur when in situ measurements are made. A strong seasonal signal was found which results from the development of the stratification in the upper water column. By approximating observed temperature profiles, a simple two-layer model is developed for the onshelf waves which provides a relationship between the tidal wavelengths, and the thickness of and the temperature difference across, the upper layer. It is possible to use this relationship in combination with remote sensed images, providing sea-surface temperature and tidal wavelength, to infer the depth of the upper layer, which generally increases as the stratification develops, so allowing a simple method for estimating the stratification in the upper water column. The effect of nonlinearity is important in determining wave structure but has only a small effect on phase speed or wavelength in the presence of Earth's rotation.}

abstract = {Numerical experiments are performed using the MITgcm to investigate the interaction of a mode-one internal tide with barotropic and baroclinic mode-one mesoscale eddies. Results show that after a mode-one internal tide passes through a barotropic eddy, spatial hot and cold spots of energy flux are produced in beam-like patterns. The magnitude of the energy flux in the hot spots can exceed twice the incident flux while in the cold spots can reach nearly zero. Passing a mode-one internal tide through a mode-one baroclinic eddy results in the scattering of energy from the incident mode-one to modes two and higher. The higher mode waves are produced in beam-like patterns. For the parameter regime explored here, we find conversion efficiencies that reach 13\% for eddies of diameter 120 km. The Rossby numbers for our experiments are order one, corresponding to energetic mesoscale eddies that are typically found in western boundary current extensions and in the southern ocean. These eddies have length scales comparable to those of low-mode internal tides, and we expect that interaction between the two will be easily formed in locations where these phenomena coexist.},

abstract = {The sea-surface height signatures of internal tides in the deep ocean, amounting to a few centimeters or less, are studied using two complementary measurement types: satellite altimetry and island tide gauges. Altimetry can detect internal tides that maintain coherence with the astronomical forcing; island gauges can monitor temporal variability which, in some circumstances, is due to internal tides varying in response to changes in the oceanic medium. This latter mechanism is at work at Hilo and other stations on the northern coasts of the Hawaiian Islands. By detecting spatially coherent low-frequency internal-tide modulations, the tide gauges, along with inverted echo sounders at sea, suggest that the mean internal tide is also spatially coherent; satellite altimetry confirms this. At Hawaii and in many other places, Topex/Poseidon altimetry detects mean surface waves, spatially coherent and propagating great distances (> 1000 km) before decaying below background noise. When temporal variability is small, the altimetry (plus information on ocean density) sets useful constraints on energy fluxes into internal tides. At the Hawaiian Ridge, 15 GW of tidal power is being converted from barotropic to first-mode baroclinic motion. Examples elsewhere warn that a simplistic interpretation of the altimetry, without regard to variability, noise, or in situ information, may be highly misleading. With such uncertainties, extension of the Hawaiian results into a usefully realistic estimate of the global internal-tide energy balance appears premature at this time.}

The results of a model run in which diapycnal mixing depends on seafloor roughness are compared to a control run that uses a simple depth-dependent parametrization for vertical background diffusivity. A third model run is conducted that uses the horizontal mean of the topographically catalysed mixing as vertical profile in order to distinguish between the overall effect of larger diffusivities and the spatial heterogeneity of the novel mixing parametrization. The new mixing scheme results in a strengthening of the deep overturning cell and enhances equatorial upwelling. Surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean increase by about 1K (in the overall effect) whereas cooling of a similar magnitude in low latitudes is generated by the spatial heterogeneity of the mixing. The corresponding changes in the atmospheric circulation involve a weakening of the southern hemispheric Westerlies and a strengthening of the Walker circulation. Biogeochemical changes are dominated by an improved ventilation of the deep ocean from the south. Water mass ages decline significantly in the deep Indian Ocean and the deep North Pacific whereas oxygen increases in the two ocean basins. The representation of the global volume of water with an oxygen concentration lower than 90μmol/kg in the model is improved using the topography catalysed mixing. Furthermore, primary production is stimulated in equatorial regions through increased upwelling of nutrients and reduced in the oligotrophic gyres.}

,abstract = { Abstract Weakly nonlinear interactions among equatorial waves have been explored in this paper using the adiabatic version of the equatorial β-plane primitive equations in isobaric coordinates. Assuming rigid lid vertical boundary conditions, the conditions imposed at the surface and at the top of the troposphere were expanded in a Taylor series around two isobaric surfaces in an approach similar to that used in the theory of surface–gravity waves in deep water and capillary–gravity waves. By adopting the asymptotic method of multiple time scales, the equatorial Rossby, mixed Rossby–gravity, inertio-gravity, and Kelvin waves, as well as their vertical structures, were obtained as leading-order solutions. These waves were shown to interact resonantly in a triad configuration at the O(ε) approximation. The resonant triads whose wave components satisfy a resonance condition for their vertical structures were found to have the most significant interactions, although this condition is not excluding, unlike the resonant conditions for the zonal wavenumbers and meridional modes. Thus, the analysis has focused on such resonant triads. In general, it was found that for these resonant triads satisfying the resonance condition in the vertical direction, the wave with the highest absolute frequency always acts as an energy source (or sink) for the remaining triad components, as usually occurs in several other physical problems in fluid dynamics. In addition, the zonally symmetric geostrophic modes act as catalyst modes for the energy exchanges between two dispersive waves in a resonant triad. The integration of the reduced asymptotic equations for a single resonant triad shows that, for the initial mode amplitudes characterizing realistic magnitudes of atmospheric flow perturbations, the modes in general exchange energy on low-frequency (intraseasonal and/or even longer) time scales, with the interaction period being dependent upon the initial mode amplitudes. Potential future applications of the present theory to the real atmosphere with the inclusion of diabatic forcing, dissipation, and a more realistic background state are also discussed. }

This phase combination is called dynamical phase. Its evolution is studied for two integrable cases: a triad and a cluster formed by two connected triads, using a numerical method which is fully validated by monitoring the conserved quantities known analytically. We show that dynamical phases, usually regarded as equal to zero or constants, play a substantial role in the dynamics of the clusters. Indeed, some effects are i) to diminish the period of energy exchange τ within a cluster by 20 and more; ii) to diminish, at time scale τ, the variability of wave energies by 25% and more; iii) to generate a new time scale, T≫τ, in which we observe considerable energy exchange within a cluster, as well as a periodic behaviour (with period T) in the variability of the modes' energies. These findings can be applied, for example, to the control of energy input, exchange and output in tokamaks; for the explanation of some experimental results; to guide and improve the performance of experiments; to interpret the results of numerical simulations, etc.}

    abstract = { Internal gravity waves play a primary role in geophysical fluids: They contribute significantly to mixing in the ocean, and they redistribute energy and momentum in the middle atmosphere. Until recently, most studies were focused on plane wave solutions. However, these solutions are not a satisfactory description of most geophysical manifestations of internal gravity waves, and it is now recognized that internal wave beams with a confined profile are ubiquitous in the geophysical context. We discuss the reason for the ubiquity of wave beams in stratified fluids, which is related to the fact that they are solutions of the nonlinear governing equations. We focus more specifically on situations with a constant buoyancy frequency. Moreover, in light of recent experimental and analytical studies of internal gravity beams, it is timely to discuss the two main mechanisms of instability for those beams: (a) the triadic resonant instability generating two secondary wave beams and (b) the streaming instability corresponding to the spontaneous generation of a mean flow. }

abstract = {Ocean models based on consistent hydrostatic, quasi-hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic equation sets are formulated and discussed. The quasi-hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic sets are more accurate than the widely used hydrostatic primitive equations. Quasi-hydrostatic models relax the precise balance between gravity and pressure gradient forces by including in a consistent manner cosine-of-latitude Coriolis terms which are neglected in primitive equation models. Nonhydrostatic models employ the full incompressible Navier Stokes equations; they are required in the study of small-scale phenomena in the ocean which are not in hydrostatic balance. We outline a solution strategy for the Navier Stokes model on the sphere that performs efficiently across the whole range of scales in the ocean, from the convective scale to the global scale, and so leads to a model of great versatility. In the hydrostatic limit the Navier Stokes model involves no more computational effort than those models which assume strict hydrostatic balance on all scales. The strategy is illustrated in simulations of laboratory experiments in rotating convection on scales of a few centimeters, simulations of convective and baroclinic instability of the mixed layer on the 1- to 10-km scale, and simulations of the global circulation of the ocean.},

abstract = "Internal tides power much of the observed small-scale turbulence in the ocean interior. To represent mixing induced by this turbulence in ocean climate models, the cascade of internal tide energy to dissipation scales must be understood and mapped. Here, we present a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks. The mapping relies on the following ingredients: (i) a global observational climatology of stratification; (ii) maps of the generation of M2, S2 and K1 internal tides decomposed into vertical normal modes; (iii) simplified representations of the dissipation of low-mode internal tides due to wave-wave interactions, scattering by small-scale topography, interaction with critical slopes and shoaling; (iv) Lagrangian tracking of low-mode energy beams through observed stratification, including refraction and reflection. We thus obtain a global map of the column-integrated energy dissipation for each of the four considered dissipative processes, each of the three tidal constituents and each of the first five modes. Modes ≥6 are inferred to dissipate within the local water column at the employed half-degree horizontal resolution. Combining all processes, modes and constituents, we construct a map of the total internal tide energy dissipation, which compares well with observational inferences of internal wave energy dissipation. This result suggests that tides largely shape observed spatial contrasts of dissipation, and that the framework has potential in improving understanding and modelling of ocean mixing. However, sensitivity to poorly constrained parameters and simplifying assumptions entering the parameterized energy sinks calls for additional investigation. The attenuation of low-mode internal tides by wave-wave interactions needs particular attention."

abstract = {Abstract We investigate the role of deep-ocean topography in scattering energy from the large spatial scales of the low-mode internal tide to the smaller spatial scales of higher modes. The complete Green function method, which is not subject to the restrictions of the WKB approximation, is used for the first time to study the two-dimensional scattering of a mode-1 internal tide incident on subcritical and supercritical topography of any form in arbitrary stratifications. For an isolated Gaussian ridge in a uniform stratification, large amplitude critical topography is the most efficient at mode-1 scattering and small amplitude topography scatters with an efficiency on the order of 5–10\%. In a nonuniform stratification with a pycnocline, the results are qualitatively the same as for a constant stratification, albeit with the key features shifted to larger height ratios. Having validated these results by direct comparison with the results of nonlinear numerical simulations, and in the process demonstrated that WKB results are not appropriate for reasonable ocean predictions, we proceed to use the Green function approach to quantify the role of topographic scattering for the region of the Pacific Ocean surrounding the Hawaiian Islands chain. To the south, the Line Islands ridge is found to scatter ∼40\% of a mode-1 internal tide coming from the Hawaiian Ridge. To the north, realistic, small-amplitude, rough topography scatters ∼5–10\% of the energy out of mode 1 for transects of length 1000–3000 km. A significant finding is that compared to large extents of small-amplitude, rough topography a single large topographic feature along the path of a mode-1 internal tide plays the dominant role in scattering the internal tide.},

abstract = {Abstract Several studies have shown the existence of a critical latitude where the dissipation of internal tides is strongly enhanced. Internal tides are internal waves generated by barotropic tidal currents impinging rough topography at the seafloor. Their dissipation and concomitant diapycnal mixing are believed to be important for water masses and the large-scale ocean circulation. The purpose of this study is to clarify the physical processes at the origin of this strong latitudinal dependence of tidal energy dissipation. We find that different mechanisms are involved equatorward and poleward of the critical latitude. Triadic resonant instabilities are responsible for the dissipation of internal tides equatorward of the critical latitude. In particular, a dominant triad involving the primary internal tide and near-inertial waves is key. At the critical latitude, the peak of energy dissipation is explained by both increased instability growth rates, and smaller scales of secondary waves thus more prone to break and dissipate their energy. Surprisingly, poleward of the critical latitude, the generation of evanescent waves appears to be crucial. Triadic instabilities have been widely studied, but the transfer of energy to evanescent waves has received comparatively little attention. Our work suggests that the nonlinear transfer of energy from the internal tide to evanescent waves (corresponding to the 2f-pump mechanism described by Young et al., 2008, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112008001742) is an efficient mechanism to dissipate internal tide energy near and poleward of the critical latitude. The theoretical results are confirmed in idealized high-resolution numerical simulations of a barotropic M2 tide impinging sinusoidal topography in a linearly stratified fluid.},

Incident mode-1 energy fluxes of 20 and 2000 W m−1 are used to examine the linear regime and a more realistic situation.

Scattering to higher wave modes occurs in the lee of near-critical and supercritical seamounts and ridges. Nonlinear interactions transfer energy into the mode-1 M4 internal tide.

For the near-critical and supercritical ridges with realistic stratification, elevated mixing is found over the leading edge of the topography and along a tidal beam up to the first surface bounce. A transition from a beam structure near the topography to a low-mode structure farther away occurs due to an increased contribution from the mode-1 internal tide as it refracts around the topography and not due to turbulent dissipation.

abstract = {The traditional model of tidal dissipation is based on a frictional bottom boundary layer, in which the work done by bottom drag is proportional to a drag coefficient and the velocity cubed. However, away from shallow, coastal regions the tidal velocities are small, and the work done by the bottom boundary layer can account for only weak levels of dissipation. In the deep ocean, the energy flux carried by internal waves generated over rough topography dominates the energy transfer away from barotropic flow. A parameterization for the internal wave drag over rough topography is included as a dissipative mechanism in a model for the barotropic tides. Model results suggest that the inclusion of this dissipation mechanism improves hydro-dynamical models of the ocean tide. It also substantially increases the amount of modeled tidal dissipation in the deep ocean, bringing dissipation levels there into agreement with recent estimates from TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry data.},

abstract = {Astronomical data reveals that approximately 3.5 terawatts (TW) of tidal energy is dissipated in the ocean. Tidal models and satellite altimetry suggest that 1 TW of this energy is converted from the barotropic to internal tides in the deep ocean, predominantly around regions of rough topography such as mid-ocean ridges. A global tidal model is used to compute turbulent energy levels associated with the dissipation of internal tides, and the diapycnal mixing supported by this energy flux is computed using a simple parameterization. The mixing parameterization has been incorporated into a coarse resolution numerical model of the global ocean. This parameterization offers an energetically consistent and practical means of improving the representation of ocean mixing processes in climate models. Novel features of this implementation are that the model explicitly accounts for the tidal energy source for mixing, and that the mixing evolves both spatially and temporally with the model state. At equilibrium, the globally averaged diffusivity profile ranges from 0.3 cm2s−1 at thermocline depths to 7.7 cm2s−1 in the abyss with a depth average of 0.9 cm2s−1, in close agreement with inferences from global balances. Water properties are strongly influenced by the combination of weak mixing in the main thermocline and enhanced mixing in the deep ocean. Climatological comparisons show that the parameterized mixing scheme results in a substantial reduction of temperature/salinity bias relative to model solutions with either a uniform vertical diffusivity of 0.9 cm2s−1 or a horizontally uniform bottom-intensified arctangent mixing profile. This suggests that spatially varying bottom intensified mixing is an essential component of the balances required for the maintenance of the ocean’s abyssal stratification.}

A relation for the diffusivity of vertical mixing is formulated for regions where internal tides dissipate their energy as turbulence. We assume that 30 ± 10\% of the internal tide energy flux dissipates as turbulence near the site of generation, consistent with an estimate based on microstructure observations from a mid-ocean ridge site. Enhanced levels of mixing are modeled to decay away from topography, in a manner consistent with these observations. Parameterized diffusivities are shown to resemble observed abyssal mixing rates, with estimated uncertainties comparable to standard errors associated with budget and microstructure methods.},

We formulate an anisotropic autocovariance function that has five free parameters describing the amplitude, anisotropic orientation and aspect ratio, characteristic length, and Hausdorff (fractal) dimension of seafloor topography. Parameters estimated from various seafloor regions by an inversion of Sea Beam data indicate that the seafloor exhibits a wide range of stochastic characteristics within the constraints of the model. Synthetic topography can be generated at arbitrary scale and resolution from the Gaussian model using a Fourier method. Color images of these synthetics are useful for illustrating the stochastic behavior of the model.},

ABSTRACT = {Breaking internal waves are an important contributor to mixing in the stratified ocean interior. We use two-dimensional, nonhydrostatic numerical simulations to examine the breaking of internal waves generated by tidal flow over sinusoidal bottom topography. We explore the sensitivity of the internal wave breaking to the topographic steepness and Coriolis frequency, focusing on the vertical structure of kinetic energy dissipation and the ratio of local dissipation to the barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion. When the tidal frequency is twice the local Coriolis frequency, wave breaking above the topography is driven by wave–wave interactions which transfer wave energy from the tidal forcing frequency to the inertial frequency. The greater shear associated with the inertial frequency waves leads to enhanced dissipation in a thick layer above the topography. The topographic steepness strongly modulates this dependence of dissipation on Coriolis frequency; for some steep sinusoidal topographies, most wave energy propagates downward into the topographic troughs, eliminating the possibility for significant breaking above the topographic peaks. Current parameterizations of tidal dissipation in use in global ocean models need to be adapted to include the dependence of the local dissipation on both the Coriolis frequency and the topographic steepness.},

ABSTRACT = {Internal waves in a stratified fluid with a constant buoyancy frequency were studied, with special attention given to rogue modes, extreme waves, dynamical evolution, and Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou type recurrence phenomena. Rogue waves for triads in a general physical setting have recently been derived analytically, but the implications in a fluid mechanics context have not yet been fully assessed. Numerical simulations were conducted for cases of coupled triads where the common member is a daughter wave mode. In sharp contrast with previous studies, rogue modes instead of plane waves were used as the initial condition. Furthermore, spatial dependence was incorporated. Rogue or extreme waves in one set of triads provided a possible mechanism for significant energy transfer among modes of the internal wave spectrum, in addition to the other known theories, e.g., weak turbulence. Remarkably, Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou recurrence types of growth and decay cycles arose, similar to those observed for surface gravity wave groups governed by the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. These mechanisms will enhance our understanding of transport processes in oceans.},

abstract = {From the fact that the Garrett-Munk-like (GM-like) internal wave spectrum is maintained even in regions of weak local energy sources, it is believed that energy is continuously supplied to the local wave spectrum by internal waves propagating from source regions where they are generated by wind stress fluctuations or tide-topography interactions. In order to examine how the energy thus supplied by propagating internal waves cascades through the local wave spectrum down to small dissipation scales, we carry out three sets of numerical experiments where the quasi-equilibrium internal wave spectrum obtained by Hibiya et al. [1996] is perturbed with forcing applied to different parts of the low-frequency low-wavenumber portion. The evolution of the internal wave spectrum is examined over eight inertial periods after the forcing is applied. First, in experiment I the forcing is applied to the low-vertical-wavenumber inertial-frequency (ω=f) portion of the spectrum. In this case, no significant increase or decrease of spectral intensity can be seen within the two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum. Next, in experiment II the forcing is applied at low-vertical wavenumbers in the frequency range of 2f<ω<3f. In contrast to the result of experiment I, high-vertical-wavenumber near-inertial spectral values are seen to increase, exceeding the GM level as time progresses. Finally, in experiment III the forcing is applied at low-vertical wavenumbers in the frequency range of 1.6f<ω<2f. Although the spectral location of the forcing is very close to that assumed in experiment II, no appreciable energy transfer to high-vertical wavenumbers occurs in this case. From the results of these numerical experiments it is shown that the energy transfer to the small dissipation scales is dominated by parametric subharmonic instability which transfers energy from low-vertical-wavenumber waves with frequencies over 2f to high-vertical-wavenumber near-inertial (f<ω<2f) waves. This supports the model for the dynamic balance of the internal wave spectrum proposed by Hibiya et al. [1996] that with the increase (or decrease) of energy supply to the local internal wave spectrum, high-vertical-wavenumber near-inertial current shear is enhanced (or diminished) leading to an increase (or decrease) in the rate of energy dissipation at critical layers.},

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of a propagating primary wave decaying into secondary waves through three-wave interactions. Such a possibility exists in an inviscid isothermal atmosphere when the vertical wavelength is small compared to the scale height. Initially, the amplitude of the secondary waves grows exponentially, and this growth time decreases exponentially with height. This means that as the primary wave propagates upward its energy is continuously transfered to the secondary waves. This transfer becomes increasingly rapid with increasing height. It is shown that this process can take place even when the local Richardson number is more than 100, indicating dynamic stability.},

	abstract = {<p>An idealized numerical study of a northward propagating internal tide reveals a dramatic loss of energy to small-scale subharmonic instabilities near 28.9 degrees N. Inspired by observations of the internal tide radiating northward from the Hawaiian Ridge, a three-dimensional numerical model is initialized with a northward baroclinic tidal flux of approximately 1.7 kW/m. After an initial spinup period, energy is quickly transferred from the baroclinic tide to subharmonic motions, with half the horizontal tidal wavenumber and small vertical scales, through nonlinear advection of horizontal tidal velocity gradients. Potential oceanic implications are twofold. First, once a steady-state has been reached, the instability acts as a partial filter of northward tidal flux between 27.5 and 29.5 degrees N, in rough agreement with some altimetric tidal observations. Second, elevated shear of the subharmonic motions suggests the potential for elevated near-surface dissipation rates near the critical latitude that may be important for upper ocean mixing.</p>

The near‐resonant triad is comprised of mode‐one and ‐three waves of tidal frequency, which are directly forced by the tide‐topography interaction, and a second harmonic, mode‐two wave generated by the nonlinear interaction of these waves. A theory for these near‐resonant triads is presented and compared with the numerical simulations.}

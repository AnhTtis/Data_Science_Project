    "abstract": "We associate a Bratteli-type diagram to AH-algebras arising from generalized diagonal connecting maps. We use this diagram to give an explicit description of the connected components of the spectrum of an associated canonical C$^*$-diagonal. We introduce a topological notion on these connected components, that of being spectrally incomplete, and use it as a tool to show how various classes of AI-algebras, including certain Goodearl algebras and AH-algebra models for dynamical systems $([0,1],σ)$, do not admit unique inductive limit Cartan subalgebras. We focus on a class of spectrally complete C$^*$-algebras, namely the AF-algebras, and prove that they admit unique inductive limit Cartan subalgebras. This is done via a method that generalizes Elliott's proof of classification of AF-algebras to include Cartan pairs.",

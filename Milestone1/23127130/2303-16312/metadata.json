    "abstract": "The feature vector mapping used to represent chemical systems is a key factor governing the superior data-efficiency of kernel based quantum machine learning (QML) models applicable throughout chemical compound space. Unfortunately, the most accurate representations require a high dimensional feature mapping, thereby imposing a considerable computational burden on model training and use. We introduce compact yet accurate, linear scaling QML representations based on atomic Gaussian many-body distribution functionals (MBDF), and their derivatives. Weighted density functions (DF) of MBDF values are used as global representations which are constant in size, i.e. invariant with respect to the number of atoms. We report predictive performance and training data efficiency that is close to state of the art for two diverse datasets of organic molecules, QM9 and QMugs. Generalization capability has been investigated for atomization energies, HOMO-LUMO eigenvalues and gap, internal energies at 0 K, zero point vibrational energies, dipole moment norm, static isotropic polarizability, and heat capacity as encoded in QM9. MBDF based QM9 performance lowers the optimal Pareto front spanned between sampling and training cost to compute node minutes, effectively sampling chemical compound space with chemical accuracy at a speed of 37 molecules per core second.",

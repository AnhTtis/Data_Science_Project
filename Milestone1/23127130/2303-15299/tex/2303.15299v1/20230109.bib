  Abstract                 = {It is well known that the poles of a linear time-invariant controllable and observable system can be assigned arbitrarily by state feedback. When only the output is available, pole assignment is still possible by means of dynamic output feedback. In this paper the potential of time-varying memoryless output feedback is considered. It is shown that, up to some technical conditions, it is indeed possible to allocate the poles of a linear time-invariant discrete-time system by memoryless output feedback with periodic gains. The period of the gains is (n + 1) with n the order of the system. The power of the design technique is proved to be comparable to what can be achieved by the classical dynamic feedback approach.},

An immediate application of this result is that procedures and computational algorithms that were originally developed for assigning eigenvalues in regular systems become useful tools for pole assignment in singular systems.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a new framework for the analysis and synthesis of control systems, which constitutes a genuine continuous-time extension of results that are only available in discrete time. In contrast to earlier results the proposed methods involve a specific transformation on the Lyapunov variables and a reciprocal variant of the projection lemma, in addition to the classical linearizing transformations on the controller data. For a wide range of problems including robust analysis and synthesis, multichannel H2 stateand output-feedback syntheses, the approach leads to potentially less conservative LMI characterizations. This comes from the fact that the technical restriction of using a single Lyapunov function is to some extent ruled out in this new approach. Moreover, the approach offers new potentials for problems that cannot be handled using earlier techniques. As an instance, the eigenstructure assignment problem blended with Lyapunov-type constraints is given a simple and tractable formulation},

A reduced order precisely known model is obtained in such a way that the H 2 and/or the H����guaranteed norm of the error between the original (uncertain) system and the reduced one is minimized. The optimization problems are formulated in terms of coupled (nonconvex) linear matrix inequalities, being solved through iterative algorithms. Examples illustrate the results},

The remaining undesirable eigenvalues are replaced by other chosen values. This methodology is easy and permits to overcome some limitations encountered in the previous methods. Furthermore, our method is applied to solve the constrained control problem for linear invariants continuous-time systems. Indeed, the problem of finding a stabilising regulator matrix gain taking into account the asymmetrical control constraints is transformed to a Sylvester equation resolution.

  Abstract                 = {The paper considers the development of output feedback sliding mode controllers for a class of uncertain linear systems. The presence of stable invariant zeros and matched uncertainty is incorporated in the design procedure. The sufficient conditions for developing static output feedback sliding mode controllers are first reviewed. If `Kimura-Davison' conditions are satisfied, it is shown that it may not be possible to determine a static output feedback sliding mode controller. In this case, dynamic output feedback sliding mode control is necessary. It is shown that both the switching surface design problem for the static case and the switching surface and compensator design for the dynamic case may be formulated as a static output feedback problem for particular system triples. A robust design procedure is used to solve this static output feedback problem to minimise the effects of any unmatched uncertainty which will affect the reduced order sliding motion in many practical systems. A controller is synthesised to tolerate matched model uncertainty. The measurements of robustness are described. A numerical example demonstrates the procedure},

  Abstract                 = {Design techniques to satisfy closed-loop eigenstructure requirements in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) synthesis of multivariable control systems are considered. A design algorithm for eigenstructure assignment (eigenvalue and eigenvector placement) which combines analytical methods implemented via symbolic manipulations and numerical optimization procedures is presented. The methods are indirect in that the eigenstructure assignment is achieved without actually carrying out LQR synthesis but in such a way as to guarantee that the control law could be obtained from LQR synthesis. Elements of the feedback gain matrix or the Riccati matrix are used as design variables while the Kalman inequality or the Riccati equation is used as a constraint to ensure robustness. Several illustrative examples are presented},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the problem of controlling a linear continuous-time system with structured time-varying parameter uncertainties and input disturbances with a Lyapunov-function approach. In contrast with most of the previous results in the literature, we do not confine our attention to the class of quadratic Lyapunov functions. Conversely, the basic motivation of this paper is to determine whether there exist other functions that can be conveniently used as candidate Lyapunov functions. This question has a positive answer: the proposed class is that of polyhedral norms or, more generally, of polyhedral Minkowski functionals. We show that the class of these functions is universal in the sense that if the problem of ultimately bounding the state in an assigned convex set via state feedback control can be solved via a Lyapunov function and a continuous state-feedback compensator then it can be solved via a polyhedral Lyapunov function and a (possibly different) continuous control. Moreover, we show that the control can be piecewise linear. A numerical technique for constructing the controller is presented for the case in which the uncertainty constraint sets are polyhedral.},

The algorithm is computationally efficient since it operates on reduced-order decoupled algebraic discrete Lyapunov equations. Furthermore, the solutions at every iteration are computed by elementary matrix operations. Hence, the number of operations is minimal. Monotonicity of convergence is established under the existence conditions of unique positive solutions.},

The design uses only those state variables which can be measured. It is shown that for a controllable observable plant a compensator of orderbeta = min(nu_{c} - 1, nu_{o} - 1)is sufficient to achieve this result. Herenu_{c}(nu_{o})is the controllability (observability) index of the plant. This result is obtained by first showing that any multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant system may be made controllable (observable) from a single input (output) using only output feedback. The main result is then proved in a constructive manner which explicitly relates the compensator parameters to the coefficients of the desired characteristic polynomial.},

  abstract  = {Consider the affine matrix family A(x)=A0+â�����k=1mxkAk, mapping a design vector xâ����Rm into the space of n�����n real matrices. We are interested in the question of how to choose x to optimize the stability of the matrix A(x). A typical motivation is that one wishes to control the stability of the dynamical system z������A(x)z. A classic example is stabilization by output feedback. We take two approaches. Let ��±(X) denote the spectral abscissa (the largest real part of the eigenvalues) of a matrix X; as is well known, this quantity bounds the asymptotic decay rate of the trajectories of the associated dynamical system z������Xz. Our first approach to optimizing stability is to directly minimize the function ��±(A(x)). The spectral abscissa ��±(X) is a continuous but non-smooth, in fact non-Lipschitz, function of the matrix argument X, and finding a global minimizer of ��±(A(x)) is hard. We introduce a novel random gradient bundle method for approximating local minimizers, motivated by recent work on non-smooth analysis of the function ��±(X). Our second approach is to minimize a related function ��±��´(A(x)), where ��´ is a robustness parameter in (0,1). One motivation for the definition of the â���œrobust spectral abscissaâ���� ��±��´(X) is that it bounds transient peaks as well as asymptotic decay of trajectories of z������Xz. The function ��±��´(X) is Lipschitz but non-convex for ��´â����(0,1), approaching ��±(X) as ��´â������0 and the largest eigenvalue of 12(X+XT) as ��´â������1. We use a Newton barrier method to approximate local minimizers of ��±��´(A(x)). We compare the results of the two approaches on a number of interesting test cases.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, a technique for eigenstructure assignment of multi-degree-of-freedom vibrating systems with nonsmooth (piecewise linear) nonlinearities is presented. In such systems, only the exact eigenfrequencies and mode shapes (eigenvectors) of individual linear subregions are known, while the composite nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) occur on curved invariant manifolds in the configuration space. Three distinct control strategies which utilize methods for approximating the NNM frequencies and mode shapes are employed. These methods are based on previous extensions of the well-known bilinear frequency relation (BFR) to account for, a nonvanishing clearance. The first strategy, which employs the piecewise modal method (PMM) for approximating NNM frequencies, determines n constant actuator gains for an n degree-of-freedom system and results in eigenvalue (pole) placement only. The second strategy, which also results in eigenvalue placement, involves finding an approximate single-degree-of-freedom reduced model with one actuator gain for the mode to be controlled. The third strategy allows the designer to shape the frequencies and mode shapes (eigenstructure) by using a full n times;n matrix of actuator gains and employing the local equivalent linear stiffness method (LELSM) for approximating NNM frequencies and mode shapes. These strategies are implemented via constant-gain feedback control and thus do not require the use of gain switching. The techniques are applied to two degree-of-freedom illustrative examples with two distinct types of nonlinearities: a bilinear clearance nonlinearity and a symmetric deadzone nonlinearity.},

It is assumed that the plant is a linear controllable, time-invariant, single-input (SI) or multiple-input (MI) system. This procedure allows the use of well-known continuous-time state feedback design methods to directly design discrete-time state-derivative feedback control systems.

  Abstract                 = {An approach that uses closed-loop controllability and disturbability conditions for the selection of closed-loop eigenstructures is proposed for the design of time-invariant linear systems with disturbance. For this approach, a nonlinear optimization technique is combined with the eigenstructure assignment technique. A performance index expressed in terms of the norm of the weighted controllability elements and the norm of the weighted disturbability elements is defined for the optimal selection of closed-loop eigenvalues and their corresponding reciprocal eigenvectors. The overall system sensitivity to external disturbance is greatly reduced by the proper selection of the weighting factors. The light damping closed-loop eigenvalues and their corresponding reciprocal eigenvectors of modes are chosen to be either decoupled from the external disturbance or have low sensitivity to the disturbance. A necessary and sufficient condition for the assignment of a set of closed-loop eigenvalues and their corresponding reciprocal eigenvectors is also developed},

No restriction is imposed on the shapes of the specified region. The proposed method is applicable to both the continuous���time case and the discrete���time case. When all the eigenvalues are just required to locate in the stable region, the proposed criterion will become the stability robustness criterion.

  Abstract                 = {This book presents a number of techniques for robustness analysis of uncertain systems. The theoretical basis for their development is derived from the application of convex optimization tools to problems involving positivity of homogeneous polynomial forms. Usually, stability and performance analysis of dynamic systems affected by structured uncertainties, requires the solution of non-convex optimization problems. Constructing a family of convex relaxations, namely convex optimisations, can provide upper or lower bound to the original problem. In this book convex relaxations for several robustness problems are derived by exploiting and providing new results on the theory of homogeneous polynomial forms. A framework is introduced for dealing with positivity of homogeneous forms via the solution of linear matrix inequalities, with examples including Lyapunov analysis of uncertain systems, computation of the parametric robust stability margin, and robust performance analysis for polytopic systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Seismic performance attributes of multi-story passive and semi-active tuned mass damper (PTMD and SATMD) building systems are investigated for 12-story moment resisting frames modeled as â������0+2â���™ stories and â������+4â���™ stories. Segmented upper portion of the stories are isolated as a tuned mass, and a passive viscous damper or semi-active resetable device is adopted as energy dissipation strategy. The semi-active approach uses feedback control to alter or manipulate the reaction forces, effectively re-tuning the system depending on the structural response. Optimum tuned mass damper control parameters and appropriate matching SATMD configurations are adopted from a companion study on a simplified two-degree-of-freedom system. Statistical performance metrics are presented for 30 probabilistically scaled earthquake records from the SAC project. Time history analyses are used to compute response reduction factors across a wide range of seismic hazard intensities. Results show that large SATMD systems can effectively manage seismic response for multi-degree-of freedom systems across a broad range of ground motions in comparison to passive solutions. Specific results include the identification of differences in the mechanisms by which SATMD and PTMD systems remove energy, based on the differences in the devices used. Additionally, variability is seen to be tighter for the SATMD systems across the suites of ground motions used, indicating a more robust control system. While the overall efficacy of the concept is shown the major issues, such as isolation layer displacement, are discussed in detail not available in simplified spectral analyses, providing further insight into the dynamics of these issues for these systems.

  Abstract                 = {Discusses analysis and synthesis techniques for robust pole placement in linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions, a class of convex regions of the complex plane that embraces most practically useful stability regions. The focus is on linear systems with static uncertainty on the state matrix. For this class of uncertain systems, the notion of quadratic stability and the related robustness analysis tests are generalized to arbitrary LMI regions. The resulting tests for robust pole clustering are all numerically tractable because they involve solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and cover both unstructured and parameter uncertainty. These analysis results are then applied to the synthesis of dynamic output-feedback controllers that robustly assign the closed-loop poles in a prescribed LMI region. With some conservatism, this problem is again tractable via LMI optimization. In addition, robust pole placement can be combined with other control objectives, such as H2 or H infin; performance, to capture realistic sets of design specifications. Physically motivated examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this robust pole clustering technique},

General multiple eigenvalues were dealt with and condition numbers were obtained for individual as well as clusters of eigenvalues. In this paper, we shall generalize the technique to the eigenvalue problem for regular periodic matrix pairs. Perturbation to eigenvalues, simple or multiple, finite or infinite, will be considered for perturbations of any size. For small perturbations, clusters of eigenvalues will be considered.},

There, a two-stage process is followed in which a subset of the desired eigenvectors is assigned in the first stage, followed by a dual set in the second stage. Depending upon the number of available degrees of freedom, and the manner in which they are distributed between the stages, it is possible that not all are used. A technique to recover these unused degrees of freedom in a final and independent stage is presented here. The technique, known as retro-assignment, is illustrated using an extension to the original numerical example. },

  Abstract                 = { In this paper, we describe an approach for generating accurate geometrically parameterized integrated circuit interconnect models that are efficient enough for use in interconnect synthesis. The model-generation approach presented is automatic, and is based on a multiparameter moment matching model-reduction algorithm. A moment-matching theorem proof for the algorithm is derived, as well as a complexity analysis for the model-order growth. The effectiveness of the technique is tested using a capacitance extraction example, where the plate spacing is considered as the geometric parameter, and a multiline bus example, where both wire spacing and wire width are considered as geometric parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated models accurately predict capacitance values for the capacitor example, and both delay and cross-talk effects over a reasonably wide range of spacing and width variation for the multiline bus example.},

  Abstract                 = {This note proposes a novel algorithm for robust partial eigenvalue assignment (RPEVA) problem for a cubic matrix pencil arising from modeling of vibrating systems with aerodynamic effects. The RPEVA problem for a cubic pencil is the one of choosing suitable feedback matrices to reassign a few (say k lt;3n) unwanted eigenvalues while leaving the remaining large number (3n-k) of them unchanged, in such a way that the the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix are as insensitive as possible to small perturbation of the data. The latter amounts to minimizing the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvector matrix. The problem is solved directly in the cubic matrix polynomial setting without making any transformation to a standard first-order state-space system. This allows us to take advantage of the exploitable structures such as the sparsity, definiteness, bandness, etc., very often offered by large practical problems. The major computational requirements are: i) solution of a small Sylvester equation, ii) QR factorizations, and iii) solution of a standard least squares problem. The least-squares problem result from matrix rank-two update techniques used in the algorithm for reassigning complex eigenvalues. The practical effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by implementational results on simulated data provided by the Boeing company},

The algorithms can be implemented with only a partial knowledge of the spectrum and the corresponding eigenvectors of the associated open-loop quadratic matrix pencil. Mathematical results are proved to guarantee that there will be no-spillover effects; that is, it is shown mathematically that the large-number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that need to remain unchanged will not be effected by feedback. Furthermore, the algorithms work directly in second-order setting allowing them to exploit structures such as sparsity, band, symmetry etc. These practical features of the algorithms make them ideally suited for real-life applications such as control and stabilization of large flexible space structures.},

Similarly, the eigenvectors of a symmetric definite linear pencil can be chosen to be orthogonal with respect to the pair. This paper presents the three sets of matrix weights with respect to which the eigenvectors of the symmetric definite quadratic pencil are orthogonal. One of these is used to derive an explicit solution of the partial pole assignment problem by state feedback control for a control system modeled by a system of second order differential equations. The solution may be of particular interest in the stabilization and control of flexible, large space structures where only a small part of the spectrum is to be reassigned and the rest of the spectrum is required to remain unchanged.},

It is also shown that almost any output feedback law will make the closed-loop system's poles be disjoint from any given finite set of points on the complex plane. It is then shown that any controllable observable system can be made controllable and observable with respect to any nontrivial input and output by applying almost all output feedback laws about the original system. These results have immediate application in pole assignment, in the controllability of parallel-connected systems, and in the identification problem. In addition, it is shown that, for any linear system and for almost all state feedback laws, the closed-loop system has the property that all modes of the system, except possibly those corresponding to the uncontrollable-unobservable part of the system, are observed in the output.},

The methods are extended to solve coupled Sylvester matrix equations. In our approach, we regard the unknown matrices to be solved as the system parameters to be identified, and propose a least-squares iterative algorithm by applying a hierarchical identification principle and by introducing the block-matrix inner product (the star product for short). We prove that the iterative solution consistently converges to the exact solution for any initial value. The algorithms proposed require less storage capacity than the existing numerical ones. Finally, the algorithms are tested on computer and the results verify the theoretical findings.},

  abstract  = { The problem of eigenvalue assignment with minimum sensitivity in multivariable descriptor linear systems via proportional plus partial derivative state feedback is considered. Different from the purely proportional state feedback case, the number of finite closed-loop eigenvalues is required to be equal to the system dimension. Based on a result in the perturbation theory of generalized eigenvalue problem of matrix pairs, the closed-loop eigenvalue sensitivity measures in terms of the closed-loop normalized right and left eigenvectors are established. By combining these measures and a recently proposed general parametric eigenstructure assignment result for descriptor linear systems via proportional plus derivative state feedback, the robust pole assignment problem is converted into an independent minimization problem. A simple algorithm in sequential order is obtained for solution to the problem of robust pole assignment in descriptor linear systems via proportional plus partial derivative state feedback. The closed-loop eigenvalues may be easily taken as a part of the design parameters and optimized within certain desired fields on the complex plane to improve robustness. Using the proposed algorithm, the optimality of the obtained solution to the robust pole assignment problem is totally dependent on the solution to the independent minimization problem. An example of order six is worked out with multiple solutions, both the indices and the numerical robustness test demonstrate the effect of the proposed approach. },

  abstract = {This paper describes a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based algorithm for the static and reduced-order output-feedback synthesis problems of nth-order linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with nu (respectively, ny) independent inputs (respectively, outputs). The algorithm is based on a ldquo;cone complementarity rdquo; formulation of the problem and is guaranteed to produce a stabilizing controller of order m les;n-max(nu,ny), matching a generic stabilizability result of Davison and Chatterjee (1971). Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm finds a controller with order less than or equal to that predicted by Kimura's generic stabilizability result (m les;n-nu-ny+1). A similar algorithm can be applied to a variety of control problems, including robust control synthesis},

  abstract  = { This paper deals with closed-loop eigenstructure assignment by output-feedback control in linear multivariable systems for the general case of multiple eigenvalues. The approach is algebraic in nature and operates directly on the closed-loop characteristic equation using fundamental properties of determinants and their derivatives. A compact form for the controller gain matrix is derived and expressed in terms of a set of parameter vectors that specify the non-uniqueness of the solution of the eigenvalue-assignment problem. Some of these parameter vectors assume restricted forms while others are free. A computational scheme is given in which the free parameter vectors are determined in such a way as to assign the corresponding eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors in a weighted least-square-error sense. An illustrative numerical example is included. },

These problems allow for capturing different performance specifications without resorting to approximations.

This multi-objective design allows for more flexible and accurate specification of the desirable closed-loop behaviour, both in the time and frequency domains.

The convergence of this method may be very slow if the initial matrix is not chosen carefully. A strategy for choosing better initial matrices has been recently proposed by Ivanov et al. They proved that this strategy can improve the convergence in general and observed from numerical experiments that dramatic improvement happens for the plus equation with some matrices A. It turns out that the matrices A are normal for those examples. In this note we prove a result that explains the dramatic improvement in convergence for normal (and thus nearly normal) matrices for the plus equation. A similar result is also proved for the minus equation.},

In this second part of the work a re-arrangement of the algorithm is presented which, although mathematically less transparent, removes the most obvious source of numerical instability and leads to a much simpler digital computer implementation. A FORTRAN program implementing this algorithm is available. Furthermore this implementation utilizes the apparently superfluous degrees of freedom in the algorithm to make available a choice of the eigenvectors as well as the eigenvalues of the eventual closed loop system matrix. },

Following from the second paper (Fletcher 1987) it remains to consider the assignment by real output feedback of a set of distinct eigenvalues consisting of a mixture of real numbers and complex conjugate pairs of non-real numbers. We examine the possibility that in the algorithm described in the first paper (Fletcher and Magni 1987) all the real eigenvalues can be assigned before any of the complex conjugate pairs. If this is possible then the argument of Fletcher (1987) can be used to complete the assignment. It is only from the failure of this possibility that the pathological cases detailed in the first paper can arise.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method for determining the maximum allowable perturbation, for a MIMO linear time-invariant uncertain system, such that the closed loop poles are assigned in a specified disk by static output feedback; the uncertainty being norm-2 bounded. A sufficient condition for d-stabilizability is derived. Hence, in order to solve the related optimization problem a genetic-like algorithm is performed. An illustrative example shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure },

It is shown that if the open-loop system satisfies certain structural conditions, a static output feedback gain can be easily computed, using a formula that simply involves the original system matrices and the parameters that define the disk. Among the conditions the system has to satisfy, the key one relies on a minimum phase argument. Square and non-square, proper and non-proper systems are considered. The main results are derived invoking the limiting behaviour of the optimal linear quadratic regulator for discrete-time systems. Some other implications are also presented.},

  abstract  = {It has been generally assumed that the use of Givens rotations provides significant advantages over the use of Householder transformations for the orthogonal decomposition of sparse matrices. It is also generally acknowledged that the opposite is true for dense matrices. In this paper, a way of applying Householder reflections is described which is competitive with or superior to the use of Givens rotations for sparse orthogonal decomposition. In other words, the advantage of Householder over Givens for dense matrices can carry over to the sparse case, provided that the implementation of the Householder scheme is done in a certain way. The approach relies heavily on the idea of general row merge trees developed by Liu [12]. Results of numerical experiments are provided which demonstrate the advantages of the new scheme. The method also appears to be attractive for use on vector computers.},

  abstract  = { A procedure for designing a constant gain feedback matrix which assigns the closed-loop poles of a linear time-invariant multivariable system to desired locations and at the same time minimizes the sensitivity of these poles to variations in the parameters of the plant is described in this paper. It is shown that this technique in which sensitivity considerations are an integral part of the design procedure yields better results compared to other pole assignment techniques using constant gain feedback controllers. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the design procedure. },

  abstract  = {We study the matrix equation X + A â��¤ X - 1 A = Q , where A is a complex square matrix and Q is complex symmetric. Special cases of this equation appear in Greenâ���™s function calculation in nano research and also in the vibration analysis of fast trains. In those applications, the existence of a unique complex symmetric stabilizing solution has been proved using advanced results on linear operators. The stabilizing solution is the solution of practical interest. In this paper we provide an elementary proof of the existence for the general matrix equation, under an assumption that is satisfied for the two special applications. Moreover, our new approach here reveals that the unique complex symmetric stabilizing solution has a positive definite imaginary part. The unique stabilizing solution can be computed efficiently by the doubling algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {A design procedure is developed that combines linear-quadratic optimal control with regional pole placement. Specifically, a static and dynamic output-feedback control problem is addressed in which the poles of the closed-loop system are constrained to lie in specified regions of the complex plane. These regional pole constraints are embedded within the optimization process by replacing the covariance Lyapunov equation by a modified Lyapunov equation whose solution, in certain cases, leads to an upper bound on the quadratic cost functional. The results include necessary and sufficient conditions for characterizing static output-feedback controllers with bounded performance and regional pole constraints. Sufficient conditions are also presented for the fixed-order (i.e. full- and reduced-order) dynamic output-feedback problem with regional pole constraints. Circular, elliptical, vertical strip, parabolic, and section regions are considered},

  Abstract                 = {Combined economic environmental dispatch problem (CEEDP) is one of the greatest challenges of the future smart grids. It aims at reducing the total cost during the power production process considering the growing environmental impact due to the emission of gaseous pollutants of fossil fuels. This study develops a robust distributed algorithm based on consensus protocols in multi-agent systems, to solve the smart grid CEEDP with a practical communication network consisting of a dynamic communication network, randomly communication failure, transmission delay and noise in communication channels. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed and cooperative in such a way that it eliminates the need for a central energy-management unit, or a leader. The performance of the fully decentralised consensus protocol was evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus test system. A comparison with previous consensus algorithms proves the supremacy of the proposed approach in terms of its robustness under dynamic communication network with randomly link failure.},

By applying the degrees of design freedom provided by eigenstructure assignment in linear systems, a state feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system satisfies H infin;-norm bound constraints on disturbance attenuation and pole constraints. The proposed design method is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) which can be easily solved by the MATLAB LMI toolbox. An example demonstrates the effect of the proposed design approach.},

The approach allows us to derive in a unifying way results in the state-space and polynomial frameworks.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a spectrally-weighted balanced truncation technique for RLC interconnects, a technique needed when the interconnect circuit parameters change as a result of variations in the manufacturing process. The salient features of this algorithm are the inclusion of parameter variations in the RLC interconnect, the guaranteed stability of the reduced transfer function, and the availability of provable frequency-weighted error bounds for the reduced-order system. This paper shows that the balanced truncation technique is an effective model-order reduction technique when variations in the circuit parameters are taken into consideration. Experimental results show that the new variational spectrally-weighted balanced truncation attains, on average, 20% more accuracy than the variational Krylov-subspace-based model-order reduction techniques while the run-time is also, on average, 5% faster},

  Abstract                 = {Pole assignment is a basic design method for synthesis of feedback control systems. In this paper, a gradient flow approach is presented for robust pole assignment in synthesizing output feedback control systems. The proposed approach is shown to be capable of synthesizing linear output feedback control systems via on-line robust pole assignment. Convergence of the gradient flow can be guaranteed. Moreover, with appropriate design parameters the gradient flow converges exponentially to an optimal solution to the robust pole assignment problem and the closed-loop control system based on the gradient flow is globally exponentially stable. These desired properties make it possible to apply the proposed approach to slowly time-varying linear control systems. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

The proposed control scheme is of the decentralized output feedback supplementary excitation control configuration which is most desirable in practice. Results obtained from the application of the proposed controller to the system studied, which is of longitudinal structure, show that exact assignment of the eigenstructure associated with the worst-damped electromechanical mode can be achieved.

  Abstract                 = {Power system stabilizer (PSS) design is addressed using an optimal reduced order model whose state variables are torque angles and speeds. System damping can be improved by using eigenvalue assignment, and the coordination of stabilizers can be achieved through eigenvector assignment by maintaining system mode shapes. The proportional-integral PSSs are derived by the optimal reduced order model. The effectiveness of the stabilizer is evaluated. By using the output feedback only, the result of eigenstructure assignment is more stable and much better than the assignment method based on the whole system model. Examples, a single-machine to infinite bus system and a multimachine system, are given to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results based on the whole system model are included for comparative analyses},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of the optimal eigenvalue assignment for multi-input linear systems is considered. It is proven that for an n-order system with m independent inputs, the problem is split into the following two sequential stages. Initially, the n-m eigenvalues are assigned using an (n-m)-order system. This assignment is not constrained to satisfy optimality criteria. Next, an m-order system is used to assign the remaining m eigenvalues in such a way that linear quadratic optimal criteria are simultaneously satisfied. Therefore, the original n-order optimal eigenvalue assignment problem is reduced to an m-order optimal assignment problem. Moreover, the structure of the equivalent m-order system permits further simplifications which lead to solutions obtained by inspection},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with robust pole assignment in synthesis of linear control systems via state and output feedbacks. First, both the pole assignment and robustness requirements are appropriately formulated as two optimization problems. Then, gradient flow models are developed for the on-line computation of feedback gain matrices that result in robust pole assignment by solving these two optimization problems. A technique is introduced to facilitate the real-time matrix inverse involved for realizing the gradient flow models. The resulting augmented gradient flows have desired convergence properties. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {A new non-linear control model is presented for active control of three-dimensional (3D) building structures. Both geometrical and material non-linearities are included in the structural control formulation. A dynamic fuzzy wavelet neuroemulator is presented for predicting the structural response in future time steps. Two dynamic coupling actions are taken into account simultaneously in the control model: (a) coupling between lateral and torsional motions of the structure and (b) coupling between the actuator and the structure. The new neuroemulator is validated using two irregular 3D steel building structures, a 12-story structure with vertical setbacks and an 8-story structure with plan irregularity. Numerical validations in both time and frequency domains demonstrate that the new neuroemulator provides accurate prediction of structural displacement responses, which is required in neural network models for active control of structures. In the companion paper, a floating-point genetic algorithm is presented for finding the optimal control forces needed for active non-linear control of building structures using the dynamic fuzzy wavelet neuroemulator presented in this paper.

  abstract  = {Numerical methods are described for determining robust, or well-conditioned, solutions to the problem of pole assignment by state feedback. The solutions obtained are such that the sensitivity of the assigned poles to perturbations in the system and gain matrices is minimized. It is shown that for these solutions, upper bounds on the norm of the feedback matrix and on the transient response are also minimized and a lower bound on the stability margin is maximized. A measure is derived which indicates the optimal conditioning that may be expected for a particular system with a given set of closed-loop poles, and hence the suitability of the given poles for assignment.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the problem of robust stability of a polynomial family whose coefficients are polynomial functions of the parameters of interests. The problem occurs in the design of a fixed order or fixed structure multivariable feedback controller , parametrized by a real design parameter vector , for a plant , containing a vector of uncertain parameters. The characteristic polynomials of such systems often contain coefficients which depend polynomially on and . Using results on sign-definite decomposition, a new stability test is developed that gives a sufficient condition for Hurwitz stability of the family of closed loop systems that result when and vary over prescribed boxes. This test is reminiscent of Kharitonov's Theorem, even though the family of polynomials considered here is certainly not restricted to be interval or even convex. Moreover the test does reduce to Kharitonov's Theorem for the special case of interval polynomials. Using this criterion recursively and modularly, sets of controllers that stabilize the family of uncertain plants are determined.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we develop efficient deterministic algorithms for globally minimizing the sum and the product of several linear fractional functions over a polytope. We will show that an elaborate implementation of an outer approximation algorithm applied to the master problem generated by a parametric transformation of the objective function serves as an efficient method for calculating global minima of these nonconvex minimization problems if the number of linear fractional terms in the objective function is less than four or five. It will be shown that the Charnes���Cooper transformation plays an essential role in solving these problems. Also a simple bounding technique using linear multiplicative programming techniques has remarkable effects on structured problems. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The proposed scheme assigns the maximum allowable number of closed-loop eigenvalues to desired locations, and determines the corresponding closed-loop eigenvectors as close to desired ones as possible. Additionally, the stability of the remaining closed-loop eigenvalues is guaranteed by the satisfaction of an appropriate Lyapunov equation. The overall design is robust with respect to time-varying parameter perturbations. The approach is applied to a literature example, where it is shown to capture the shape of the desired transient response},

The results of those parametric studies are invaluable in the selection of optimum TMD parameters. Few experimental verifications of TMD theory have been carried out, particularly those involving active control, but the results of those experiments generally compared well with those obtained by parametric studies. Despite some serious design constraints, a number of passive and active tuned mass damper systems have been successfully installed in tall buildings and other structures to reduce the dynamic response due to wind and earthquakes. The results of extensive full-scale measurement programs conducted on a significant number of these clearly show the effectiveness of the systems.},

  abstract  = { This paper presents a new methodology for diagonal dominance of large-scale systems via eigenstructure assignment. For a given large-scale system in general form, an equivalent descriptor system in the inputâ������output decentralized form is defined. Sufficient conditions for diagonal dominance of the closed-loop system are introduced. These conditions are in terms of the isolated subsystems. Based on them, interactions between subsystems can be considered as external disturbances for each isolated subsystem. Then a previously proposed approach is used for disturbance attenuation via dynamical output compensators based on complete parametric eigenstructure assignment. By attenuating disturbances, closed-loop poles of the overall system are placed in a desirable region, by assigning the eigenstructure of each isolated subsystem appropriately. The presented algorithm alleviates the necessity of choosing a suitable frequency in designing a pre-compensator, as required by previous methods. The designed controller is in the decentralized form and plays the role of pre-compensator as well. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

  abstract  = {A computation method for delivering a state feedback controller that assigns closed-loop eigenstructure with a minimum subspace separation and is robust towards unstructured perturbations is presented. The subspace separation is measured via the difference between two subspace projections, while the eigenstructure robustness is achieved by maximizing an upper bound on the allowable perturbation size such that the closed-loop system remains stable. By exploiting the Sylvester equation parametrization, the constraint of pole assignment can be satisfied intrinsically and the robust eigenstructure assignment design essentially becomes an unconstrained optimization task. Analytical gradient formulas of the objective functions to be handled are developed. The design approach is demonstrated through numerical examples. Copyright ��© 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The design is unique in that longitudinal and lateral/directional SAS are developed simultaneously using the same linear model. A simplified constrained controller is examined weighing complexity against performance, after which feed-forward gains are developed to translate desired pilot control to multisurface commands. For example, the NASA Oblique Wing Research Aircraft (OWRA) in transonic flight with the wing highly swept is presented as a demanding situation.},

  Abstract                 = { This work is concerned with the assignment of a desired PD-eigenstructure for linear time-varying systems. Despite its well-known limitations, gain scheduling control appeared to be a focus of the research efforts. Scheduling of frozen-time, frozen-state controllers for fast time-varying dynamics is known to be mathematically fallacious, and practically hazardous. Therefore, recent research efforts are being directed towards applying time-varying controllers. In this paper we: 1) introduce a differential algebraic eigenvalue theory for linear time-varying systems; and 2) propose a PD-eigenstructure assignment scheme via a differential Sylvester equation and a command generator tracker (CGT) for linear time-varying systems. The PD-eigenstructure assignment is utilized as a regulator. A feedforward gain for tracking control is computed by using the command generator tracker. The whole design procedures of the proposed PD-eigenstructure assignment scheme are systematic in nature. The scheme could be used to determine the stability of linear time-varying systems easily as well as to provide a new horizon of designing controllers for the linear time-varying systems. A missile flight control application is presented to validate the proposed schemes.},

We derive a new strong sufficiency condition which guarantees the arbitrary pole assignability of a given system having m inputs p outputs and McMillan degree n. This sufficiency condition misses the theoretical best possible necessary condition by one degree of freedom. The proof of the main result can be used to derive a numerical procedure. This numerical procedure is however very sensitive in the parameters and further research is required to investigate the conditions under which sensitivity occurs and whether the solution can be made more robust in this regard. },

  Abstract                 = {The partial pole assignment (PPA) problem is the one of reassigning a few unwanted eigenvalues of a control system by feedback to suitably chosen ones, while keeping the remaining large number of eigenvalues unchanged. The problem naturally arises in modifying dynamical behaviour of the system. The PPA has been considered by several authors in the past for standard stateâ������space systems and for quadratic matrix polynomials associated with second-order systems. In this paper, we consider the PPA for a cubic matrix polynomial arising from modelling of a vibrating system with aerodynamics effects and derive explicit formulas for feedback matrices in terms of the coefficient matrices of the polynomial. Our results generalize those of a quadratic matrix polynomial by Datta et al. (Linear Algebra Appl. 1997;257: 29) and is based on some new orthogonality relations for eigenvectors of the cubic matrix polynomial, which also generalize the similar ones reported in Datta et al. (Linear Algebra Appl. 1997;257: 29) for the symmetric definite quadratic pencil. Besides playing an important role in our solution for the PPA, these orthogonality relations are of independent interests, and believed to be an important contribution to linear algebra in its own right.

For specific applications, eigenstructure assignment can also be applied to achieve more general performance criteria. In this paper a new output feedback design approach using robust eigenstructure assignment to achieve prescribed mode input and output coupling is described. A minimisation technique is developed to improve both the mode coupling and the robustness of the system, whilst allowing the precision of the eigenvalue placement to be relaxed. An application to the design of an automatic flight control system is demonstrated.},

This paper presents a model order-reduction technique for RLC interconnect circuits that includes variational analysis to capture manufacturing variations. Matrix perturbation theory is combined with dominant-pole-analysis and Krylov-subspace-analysis methods to produce reduced-order models with direct inclusion of statistically independent manufacturing variations. The accuracy of the resulting variational reduced-order models is demonstrated on several industrial examples},

  Abstract                 = {A flight control system for enhancement of helicopter handing qualities is presented, and its robustness properties are analyzed. A design methodology that uses a combination of eigenstructure assignment and classical techniques to obtain desired dynamic response characteristics for high-performance helicopters is developed. The control laws designed using this methodology yield excellent dynamic response when applied to the design model. Stability robustness is evaluated using structured singular values and evaluation of mathematical models which include substantial variations in the aerocoefficients from their nominal values. The results of these tests reveal that although handling qualities are still acceptable, certain combinations of parameter variations can destabilize the helicopter, and certain commands can saturate the rate limits on the actuators},

A necessary and sufficient condition, formulated in the linear matrix inequality form, for eigenvalue clustering inside a specified disk is derived. Then, based on the condition, a state feedback gain is synthesized to ensure not only the closed-loop system is regular and impulse-free but all its finite eigenvalues lie in a specified open disk. For standard state-space systems, the above same problems are dealt with by solving the Lyapunov equation and the Riccati equation whose solutions are positive definite. However, we indicate that for generalized state-space systems the corresponding solutions are not positive definite any more},

The specification on the closed-loop poles is given in terms of a clustering region. The originality of this work is the choice of the region which can result from the union of disjoint and non-symmetric subregions. Such a choice is made possible by a technique that enables a partial pole placement via aggregation. The distribution of poles in various subregions can be chosen. The proposed conditions are formulated through an LMI approach and some robustness aspects are also considered from an analytical point of view.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with the optimum design of vibration absorbers utilized to reduce undesirable vibrational effects which are originated in linear structures by seismic excitations. The single linear tuned mass dampers problem is treated and it is assumed that earthquake can be represented by a stationary filtered stochastic process. In the present problem, the objective is to minimize the maximum of the dimensionless peak of displacement of the protected system with respect to the unprotected one. Moreover, the constrained optimization problem is also analysed, in which a limitation of tuned probability of failure is imposed, where failure is related to threshold crossing probability by the maximum displacement over an admissible value. Examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The variation of the optimum solution versus structural and input characteristics is analysed for the unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. A sensitivity analysis is carried out, and results are presented useful for the first design of the vibrations control strategy.},

To achieve high performance for general large and sparse matrices, a combination of tree and node level parallelism is used. Acceptable load balancing is obtained by the use of a pool-of-tasks approach. For the storage of frontal and update matrices, we use a buddy system based on Fibonacci blocks. It turns out to be more efficient than blocks of size 2i, as proposed by other authors. Also the order in which memory space for update and frontal matrices are allocated is shown to be of importance. An implementation of the proposed algorithm on the CRAY X-MP/416 (four processors), gives speedups of about three with about 20% of extra real memory space required.},

From an original idea by Yakubovich (1967), the approach has been developed under a combination of influences from the Western and Russian traditions of control theory. It is shown how a complex system can be described, using integral quadratic constraints (IQC) for its elementary components. A stability theorem for systems described by IQCs is presented that covers classical passivity/dissipativity arguments but simplifies the use of multipliers and the treatment of causality. A systematic computational approach is described, and relations to other methods of stability analysis are discussed. Last, but not least, the paper contains a summarizing list of IQCs for important types of system components},

We assume static perturbations on the system matrices and express the robustness of the stability in terms of complex stability radii. In the numerical procedure, these stability radii are maximized as a function of the controller parameters. This corresponds to a synthesis problem, which is solved by a quasi-continuous shaping of some frequency response plots.

The uncontrollable part of the system, if any, is then discarded, and the assignments are continued with the completely controllable part of the system. To give insight into the approach, a mathematical method for the solution is derived, without considering numerical issues, using the idea of deflation. It is shown how this method can be modified to derive a numerically efficient algorithm. The numerical stability of the algorithm is proved and a numerical example is presented},

It is shown, furthermore, that the freedom one has in addition to specifying the closed loop eigenvalues is precisely this: to choose one set of closed loop eigenvectors from this class. Included in the proof of this result is an algorithm for computing the matrix of feedback gains which gives the chosen closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors. A design scheme based on these results is presented which gives the designer considerable freedom to choose the distribution of the modes among the output components. One interesting feature is that the distribution of a mode among the output components can be varied even if the mode is not controllable.},

  abstract  = {The abiding problem of vibration absorption has occupied engineering scientists for over a century and there remain abundant examples of the need for vibration suppression in many industries. For example, in the automotive industry the resolution of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) problems is of extreme importance to customer satisfaction. In rotorcraft it is vital to avoid resonance close to the blade passing speed and its harmonics. An objective of the greatest importance, and extremely difficult to achieve, is the isolation of the pilot's seat in a helicopter. It is presently impossible to achieve the objectives of vibration absorption in these industries at the design stage because of limitations inherent in finite element models. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques whereby the dynamic of the system (possibly a car or a helicopter) can be adjusted after it has been built. There are two main approaches: structural modification by passive elements and active control. The state of art of the mathematical theory of vibration absorption is presented and illustrated for the benefit of the reader with numerous simple examples.},

Once these spaces have been determined, it is possible to assign the eigenvectors in two ways: one which performs desirable weightings of the system states for each mode permitting system decoupling, and the second which assigns eigenvectors iteratively, to make the corresponding eigenvalues as insensitive to perturbations in the system matrices as possible. A computational procedure for each of these techniques is described. The work is illustrated using the stability augmentation system control design problem for the lateral motion model of a nonlinear aircraft system. The modal requirements for this problem for the lateral motion model of a nonlinear aircraft system. The modal requirements for this problem are well known, and this enables a comparison of the two methods to be made.},

An application of the method to a helicopter system with time-varying parameters is considered in detail. The response of the adaptive system is compared with the corresponding response of a system with a fixed controller and a system using optimal control. The comparison reveals the almost optimal character of the adaptive system. (Author)},

Instead of a single stable point a stable polytope (or simplex) is preselected in the closed-loop characteristic polynomial coefficients space. A constructive procedure for generating stable polytopes is given starting from the unit hypercube of reflection coefficients of monic polynomials. This procedure is quite straightforward because for a special family of polynomials the linear cover of so-called reflection vectors is stable. The roots placement of reflection vectors is studied. If a stable target simplex is preselected then the robust output controller design task is solved by quadratic programming approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Moore's well-known result on the feedback assignment of eigenstructure in linear state-space systems [5] was generalized to descriptor systems in [9]. In this note we make some useful extensions to fill out the theory. To begin with, we do not assume controllability of the plant. It is shown that the maximum number of finite closed-loop eigenvalues is equal to dim (EL*), where L*is the supremal(A, E, R(B))-invariant subspace, in order to relate the possible closed-loop structure to the open-loop plant structure, we define a set of indexes for descriptor systems which are in many respects similar to the controllability indexes of state-space systems. In terms of these "controllability" indexes, we give a systematic approach to selecting the closed-loop eigenvectors. A major contribution of this note is the fact that it is geometric in nature, and hence avoids any decomposition of the system matrices into a special form (e.g., Weierstrass form [1]). The geometric setting introduced here should constitute a basis for further research in generalizing the well-known results in geometric system theory (disturbance decoupling, input/output decoupling, etc.) to singular systems.},

A key advantage to this new approach is that the number of unknowns, which must be found such that a solution is obtained, is significantly reduced. Another advantage is that, since there is no subjective component introduced in the formulation of the design method which may inhibit or bias the results in some way, several, and in some cases all, solutions can be generated. These solutions may then be examined and candidate designs may be selected. It is proposed that, if coupled to an application specific expert system, the presented methodology can greatly reduce design time while providing superior designs. An example is given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method},

  Abstract                 = {Eigenstructure assignment is a method which allows the incorporation of classical specifications on damping, settling time, and mode decoupling into a modern multivariable control framework. This method allows the designer to directly satisfy damping, settling time, and mode decoupling specifications by directly choosing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this paper, we combine eigenstructure assignment with gain scheduling to obtain an algorithm which does not require the non-singularity of a matrix at a particular value of the parameter. The eigenstructure assignment gain scheduling computation is a direct non-iterative expression for the plant which was considered by Shahruz and Behtash (1992). For each value of the parameter the gain expression is a natural extension of the gain computation for the standard linear plant which was considered by Sobel et al. (1989)},

In particular, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an output-feedback matrix K corresponding to a prescribed state-feedback matrix P is established which also leads directly to the matrix K in cases when the condition is satisfied. The condition derived in this paper requires neither the computation of generalized inverse matrices (Munro and Vardulakis 1973), nor the transformation of state vectors (Patel 1974), nor the determination of Luenberger canonical forms (Vardulakis 1976), and indicates very clearly that an output-feedback matrix K corresponding to a prescribed state-feedback matrix P exists only in very special circumstances.},

Then the stability robustness of p(s, k) can be measured by the maximal nonnegative number rho; with the property that if the gauge (or the Minkowski functional) of k with respect to the convex set is less than rho;, the polynomial pk is always stable. A unified approach is presented for computing the robustness measure rho;. The approach imbeds the problem considered into the framework of convex analysis so that some powerful tools in convex analysis can be used. The procedure for computing rho; that results from this approach is easy to implement. Various examples are included to illustrate the type of results which may be obtained },

A polynomial is said to be stable if its roots are contained in an arbitrarily pre-specified open set in the complex plane, and its stability robustness is then measured by the norm of the smallest parameter perturbation which destabilizes the polynomial. A simple and numerically effective procedure, which is based on the Hahn-Banach theorem of convex analysis and which is applicable for any arbitrary norm, is obtained to compute the stability robustness. The computation is then further simplified for the case when the norm used is the H��¶lder â��ž-norm, 2-norm or 1-norm.},

  abstract  = {Datta et al. solved the partial pole placement problem for the symmetric definite quadratic eigenvalue problem where part of the spectrum is relocated to predetermined locations and the rest of the spectrum remains unchanged. In this paper, the problem is solved by a hybrid combination of this result and the method of receptances. This allows for the partial assignment of desired poles with no spillover when there is time delay between the measured or estimated state and actuation of the control.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a simple, efficient and accurate method for complex eigenvalue assignment in the multi-input linear system is presented. The method considers both cases: all eigenvalues need to assign are complex (with their complex conjugates). The other case is the arbitrary eigenvalues need to assign are mixed (some are real and the others are complex which are closed under complex conjugations). The algorithm proposed in this method is a modification to the one proposed by Arnold and Datta [IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr. 35 (10) (1986) 1149] which considers the case where all the eigenvalues need to assign are only real. Also, it is a kind of extension to the algorithms suggested by Ramadan [in press] and Ramadan and El-Shazly [in press] where arbitrary preassigned complex and mixed eigenvalues are assigned for single-input case respectively.
The method first transforms the problem to block-Hessenberg form, of needed form, using orthogonal reduction, then a simple linear recursion is carried out to find the feedback matrix so that the closed-loop matrix has the prescribed eigenvalues. The main advantages of the algorithm, besides being simple and has recursive nature it avoids complex arithmetic and easy to program on computer. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the reduction process, the algorithm performance and the accuracy of the method.},

The main result is a compact parametric expression for the output feedback controller gain matrix explicitly characterized by two sets of free parameters: the set of n closed-loop system eigenvalues and a set of mr â������n design parameters for n-state, r-input, m-output systems. The free design parameters are determined by a sequential design procedure which automatically satisfies the basic orthogonality constraints on the left and right closed-loop eigenvectors under the condition m + r &gt; n. The principal benefits of the explicit characterization of a parametric class of output feedback controllers lie in the ability to directly accommodate various different design criteria. An illustration of the parametric output feedback design procedure is given by way of approximating the optimal full state regulator response of a fifth-order pilot plant evaporator model.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a method to compute a static state feedback control law which achieves a non strict pole assignment on a continuous or a discrete descriptor system. The specification on the closed-loop poles is given in terms of D -stability, i.e. in terms of a pole-clustering region D . In this work, the clustering region is possibly non path-connected since it can result from the union of disjoint and non symmetric subregions. Such a choice, which is original when the design of linear descriptor systems is concerned, is made possible by a technique that enables a partial pole placement via aggregation. The distribution of the finite poles in various subregions can be chosen. Some key steps of the procedure are addressed through strict LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities). This is an extension of a previous work from conventional to descriptor models. Therefore, not only stability is to be ensured but also, because of infinite poles, regularity and causality or impulse freeness (the whole of those properties being termed admissibility).},

A gain parameter condition for the regional eigenvalue/eigenstructure assignment is newly derived. This assignment condition is easily combined with H â��ž design by means of enhanced LMI characterisation. In the present approach, the desired assignment of closed-loop eigenvalues (i.e. poles) are not previously fixed but constrained into individual assignment regions to bring us more design freedom than classical exact assignment. The regional assignment discussed in this article never falls into an ordinary LMI root clustering because the union of assignment regions is disjoint in general. Each closed-loop eigenvector is also constrained into individual alignment cone. To show the practical use of the extra design freedom brought by regional assignment, a transient response shaping in H â��ž design is also discussed. A useful design algorithm based on linearisation algorithm is proposed. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an overview of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach to the multiobjective synthesis of linear output-feedback controllers. The design objectives can be a mix of H infin; performance, H2 performance, passivity, asymptotic disturbance rejection, time-domain constraints, and constraints on the closed-loop pole location. In addition, these objectives can be specified on different channels of the closed-loop system. When all objectives are formulated in terms of a common Lyapunov function, controller design amounts to solving a system of linear matrix inequalities. The validity of this approach is illustrated by a realistic design example},

  Abstract                 = {A technique to assign a desired eigensystem to an actively controlled structure and to optimize the controller and structural parameters is presented. The technique explicitly parametrizes the feedback gain matrices in terms of the eigensystem and structural matrices and then optimizes the closed-loop system by minimizing some norm related to the feedback gain matrices. The technique can optimize design criteria such as gain suppression, actuator and sensor placement, minimum number of sensors, structural stiffness, and system sensitivity to parameter variations. The technique is computationally efficient by being developed in second order form using real arithmetic and with an analytic gradient supplied for the design variables. Two analytical example problems are presented in which active control systems are designed using eigensystem assignment with parametric feedback. The first example assigns eigenvalues and optimizes the controller design for a three-story scale model building. The second example assigns decoupled vibration modes to eliminate rotation of a gyro box},

The state feedback problem is then reformulated in terms of the Sylvester equation. The transformed system matrices, along with certain assumed block forms for unknown matrices, enable the Sylvester equation to be decomposed and solved effectively. A distinct point of the proposed algorithm is that the solution procedure can be tailored to parallel implementation and is therefore fast.

Lallman (Journal of Guid., Contr., and Dyn., vol.12, no.3 pp.318-324, May-Jun, 1989) used eigenstructure assignment to design a yaw pointing/lateral translation controller for the linearized lateral dynamics of the flight propulsion control coupling aircraft. The authors propose an extension to the pseudo control strategy given by Sobel and Lallman which allows the designer to trade off the coupling in the lateral translational response with the minimum of the smaller singular value of (I+FG) by adjusting a two-dimensional parameter vector denoted by alpha;. When alpha; is the zero vector, then the new adjustable strategy reduces to the pseudo control shown by Sobel and Lallman. A new yaw pointing/lateral translation eigenstructure assignment controller is presented, which uses the new extension to the pseudo control strategy. The extension to the pseudo control strategy is shown to allow the designer freedom in trading off robustness and yaw pointing decoupling when using eigenstructure assignment},

  abstract  = {The operating conditions for a heat-integrated ethylene quench column are optimized and diagnosed for controllability and resiliency. Since a bank of seawater coolers largely meets the column's cooling duty requirements, the heat-exchanger by-pass flow fractions were optimized as a function of seawater temperature, using a specially adapted genetic algorithm. The controllability and resiliency of the quench column are studied and two alternative MIMO control configurations are investigated. Of particular interest was the impact of the nominal operating position of the bypass on disturbance rejection capacity. It was found that the resiliency of the column could be significantly enhanced by repositioning the nominal operating point of the main bypass valve and at the same time, the overall heat recovery in the seawater coolers could be enhanced, leading to significant savings in operating costs.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to research and development of structural control devices, with particular emphasis on alleviation of wind and seismic response of buildings and bridges. In both areas, serious efforts have been undertaken to develop the structural control concept into a workable technology, and today we have many such devices installed in a wide variety of structures. The focus of this state-of-the-art paper is on passive and active structural control systems. Passive systems encompass a range of materials and devices for enhancing structural damping, stiffness and strength. Active systems, which include active, hybrid and semi-active systems, employ controllable force devices integrated with sensors, controllers and real-time information processing. This paper includes a brief historical outline of their development and an assessment of the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of this exciting, and still evolving, technology. Also included in the discussion are their advantages and limitations in the context of seismic design and retrofit of civil engineering structures.},

The method involves setting up a quasi-convex program that solves a relaxation of the optimal Hinfin norm MOR problem. The method can generate guaranteed stable and passive reduced models and is very flexible in imposing additional constraints such as exact matching of specific frequency response samples. The proposed optimization-based approach is also extended to solve the parameterized model-reduction problem (PMOR). The proposed method is compared to existing moment matching and optimization-based MOR methods in several examples. PMOR models for large RF inductors over substrate and power-distribution grid are also constructed.},

  Abstract                 = {Eigenstructure assignment techniques have typically focused on the assignment of eigenvalues and in some MIMO cases, the additional assignment of best fit eigenvectors. While eigenvalue specification determines the stability and speed of response, eigenvector specification determines the shape of the transients. There is an important class of structural control problems where control of the transients and hence specification of the eigenvectors is equally if not more important than specification of the eigenvalues. We explore the conditions under which a closed-loop eigenvector may be assigned exactly to a linear system, and derive further conditions under which the closed-loop eigenvalue corresponding to this mode is stable},

In this formulation, a unified approach is presented for solving the pole assignment problem with various additional objectives. These objectives include optimizing a variety of performance indices, and imposing constraints on the output feedback matrix structure, e.g. decentralized structure. Conditions for the existence of the output feedback are discussed. However, the thrust of the paper is on the development of a convergent pole assignment algorithm. It is shown that when exact pole assignment is not possible, the method can be used to place the poles close to the desired locations. Examples are provided to illustrate the method},

  abstract  = {The problem of robust pole placement in structural vibration using receptance data is considered. Expressions are derived for the sensitivities of the eigenvalues to perturbations in the measurements and for robustness to measurement errors these sensitivity terms should be made as small as possible. A sequential multi-input state-feedback approach is described and by this procedure it is shown that a different eigenvalue may be assigned at each step without changing those eigenvalues assigned at previous steps. The columns of the force distribution matrix are chosen to excite easily the eigenvalue considered at the current step of the procedure. The sequential approach has the advantage of a characteristic equation that is linear in the control gains and is shown to be inherently more robust to measurement noise than the single-input method. The effects of sequential multi-input state feedback when combined with minimisation of eigenvalue sensitivity norms are investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {It is observed that an algorithm proposed in 1985 by Kautsky, Nichols, and Van Dooren (KNV) amounts to maximizing, at each iteration, the determinant of the candidate closed-loop eigenvector matrix X with respect to one of its columns (with unit-length constraint), subject to the constraint that it remains an achievable closed-loop eigenvector matrix. This interpretation is used to prove convergence of the KNV algorithm. It is then shown that a more efficient algorithm is obtained if det (X) is concurrently maximized with respect to two columns of X, and such a scheme is easily extended to the case where the eigenvalues to be assigned include complex conjugate pairs. Variations exploiting the availability of multiple processors are suggested. Convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are established. Their superiority is demonstrated numerically},

The controller can place all of the closed-loop poles within a circle, C(- f , 1/ g ) , with centre at - f and radius of 1/ g in the left half s-plane. The design method is based on transformation of the original system and then applying the bounded-real-lemma to the transformed system. It is shown that subjected to the solvability of an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE), output feedback controllers can then be systematically derived. Furthermore, the order of the controller is low and equals only the number of the open-loop poles lying outside the circle. A step-by-step design algorithm is given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the design method. },

The objective is to reduce the size of the LMI-region in order to address the performance of the system. An iterative scheme that starts from the Left Half Plane and proceeds to the intersection of a vertical strip and a conic sector is proposed, where the boundaries of this strip and the angle of the sector are reduced. Simulation studies are offered in order to investigate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

The advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not require the computation of characteristic polynomial coefficients or the eigenvalues of the original system, nor the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the transformed system. Its computational efficiency is demonstrated to be superior in comparison with some other commonly used techniques},

The result has previously been presented by the authors (1993) without proof. The relationship is analyzed and the result is proved. It is shown that among all systems with the same distinct pole set, the system with a complete orthonormal eigenvector set has minimum global regulation index values. It also means that the calculable regulation dynamic performance indices are the good measurement of the system performance, since it has been proved that better orthogonality of the system eigenvector set brings lager robust stable bound of the system.},

On the practical side, we derive explicit formulae for the required controlling force terms, which can reassign part of the spectrum to the desired values while leaving the remaining spectrum unchanged. On the mathematical side, unlike the classical Sturm-Liouville problem, our eigenvalue problem is associated with a cubic pencil with unbounded operators as coefficients and has many interesting new features, one of which is that a new controllability condition appears. This condition together with the known controllability condition in the quadratic case are necessary and sufficient. This sheds light on the adjustment of the model parameters. We also analyze the spectrum of the associated noncompact operator and in particular show that the discrete spectrums of controlled and uncontrolled systems lie outside a closed interval on the negative real axis.},

  Abstract                 = {An alternative eigenstructure assignment formulation which has inherent advantages over a previous formulation is introduced. A highly nonlinear performance index has been replaced by a quadratic one at the expense of an increase in the nonlinearity and number of constraints. Overall, the present formulation presents a significantly simpler problem from a numerical optimization viewpoint. Additionally, the gap between the achievable eigenstructure and the desired eigenstructure appears explicitly in the performance index as opposed to implicitly in its prior counterpart.

As an application of this result, it is shown that an open-loop system can be stabilized by linear feedback if and only if the unstable modes of its system matrix are controllable. A dual of this criterion is shown to be equivalent to the existence of an observer of Luenberger's type for asymptotic state identification.},

The QFT method for single-input/single-output (SISO) plants is used to obtain robust stability under the given plant-parameter uncertainties. Detailed designs are conducted with both the proposed EA/QFT approach and the direct MIMO QFT approach. The design results demonstrate the good performance and features of the proposed EA/QFT approach that may be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, an optimally distributed formation control approach is proposed for mixed-order multi-agent systems to achieve formation consistency with obstacle avoidance. The systems consist of unmanned aerial vehicles and ground robots. The authors present a formation consistency control for a mixed-order system under switching topologies. An optimally distributed method is developed by matrix transformation method and linear quadratic regulator theory, which leads to an optimisation on both horizontal and vertical control. For obstacle avoidance, a non-quadratic cost function is introduced based on optimal control. The resulting closed-loop mixed-order system is validated to be stable with an optimal performance. The formation consensus and obstacle avoidance are verified by simulations to show the effectiveness and potentials.},

The purpose of the problem is to design an uncertainty-independent filter such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties, the following filtering requirements are simultaneously satisfied: 1) the filtering process is asymptotically stable; 2) the poles of the filtering matrix are located inside a prescribed region that compasses the vertical strips, horizontal strips, disks, or conic sectors; 3) both the H2 norm and the H infin; norm on the respective transfer functions are not more than the specified upper bound constraints. We establish a general framework to solve the addressed multiobjective filtering problem completely. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the problem in terms of a set of feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An illustrative example is given to illustrate the design procedures and performances of the proposed method.},

The algorithm presented is iterative in nature and is based on alternating projection ideas. Each iteration of the algorithm involves a Schur matrix decomposition, a standard least-squares problem and a combinatorial least-squares problem. While the algorithm is not guaranteed to always find a solution, computational results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper studies a method that is used to have control in decentralized actuator type large-scale systems by sub-optimal poles assignment. This type of system can be often seen in computer controlled systems such as electric power systems, communication networks, and aerospace systems. Due to that the fast responses of the subsystems die out a lot faster than the main plain in this type of system, the states of the subsystems can be ignored to simplify the system by singularly perturbation methodology. The optimal poles found are based on a reduced-order model, therefore; the poles are called robust sub-optimal poles assignment. Finally, three easy steps are proposed to complete the robust sub-optimal pole assignment. How robust is this control method can be compared by the dominant pole of the original system and the poles of the reduced-order systems after implementing close-loop feedback.},

  Abstract                 = {A new design method is presented for proportional-integral (PI) controllers of first-order plants in the presence of time delays. In general, time delays can limit and degrade the achievable performance of the controlled system, and even induce instability. Thus, the PI gains should be selected carefully considering such effects of time delays. Unlike existing methods, the design method presented in this paper is based on solutions to delay differential equations, which are derived in terms of the Lambert W function. PI controllers for first-order plants with time delays are designed by obtaining the rightmost (i.e., dominant) eigenvalues in the infinite eigenspectrum of time-delay systems and assigning them to desired positions in the complex plane. The process is possible due to a novel property of the Lambert W function. The controllers designed using the presented method can improve the system performance and successfully stabilize an unstable plant. Also, sensitivity analysis of the rightmost eigenvalues is conducted, and the results compare favorably with those of a prediction-based method for eigenvalue assignment. Extension to design of PI-differential controllers is discussed with examples.},

A parametrized representation of the desired controllers is presented in terms of the feasible solutions to a certain linear matrix inequality system. Based on this, a solution to the minimum-effect guaranteed-performance design problem is presented in the sense that the required control effort is minimized subject to performance constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {A sufficient condition for the robust stability of a linear time-invariant system subject to linear time-varying structured state-space uncertainty is presented. This sufficient condition is a sum of terms each of which involves the ith right eigenvector, the ith left eigenvector, and the real part of the ith eigenvalue. This robustness result is less conservative than an earlier result which involves the modal matrix and the real part of the eigenvalue that is closest to the imaginary axis in the complex plane. A robust design is computed for the extended medium range air to air missile and the new design is compared with an earlier orthogonal projection eigenstructure assignment design. The new method uses the MATLAB optimization toolbox to minimize the integral of the roll rate with constraints on the real part of the dutch roll and roll mode eigenvalues, the damping ratios of the dutch roll and roll mode, the aileron and rudder deflection rates, and the sufficient condition for robust stability. The design satisfies the robustness condition while also yielding an improved transient response},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, an integrated design of fault detection, diagnosis and reconfigurable control for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is proposed. The scheme uses proportional-integral (PI) control structure in the reconfigurable controller so as to recover both the dynamic and steady-state performance of the pre-fault system and to reject unknown constant disturbances. A singular value decomposition (SVD) based eigenstructure assignment (EA) technique is developed to achieve online automatic redesign of the controller. Fault diagnosis and controller reconfiguration mechanisms are carried out using statistical hypothesis tests based on the information from a two-stage adaptive Kalman filter. To achieve improved reconfiguration performance, a multiple reconfiguration controller design scheme is exploited. The proposed approach can deal with: abrupt and incipient faults; total and partial faults; single, multiple and consecutive faults with different type of reference inputs, and with the ability to detect and compensate for unanticipated actuator faults which are described by loss of control effectiveness. The effectiveness of the approach has been demonstrated via two simulation examples},

It is an extension of the original dominant pole design (PID Controllers: Theory, Design, and Tuning, Instrument Society of America, Research Triangle park, NC, 1995.) for SISO systems. Unlike its SISO counterpart, where the controller parameters can be obtained analytically, the multi-loop version amounts to solving some coupled nonlinear equation with complex coefficients, for which closed-form formulae are not possible. A novel approach is developed to solve the equation using a â���œroot trajectoryâ���� method, in which the solution to our pole placement problem is found from intersection points between the â���œroot trajectoriesâ���� and the positive real axis. The design procedure is given and simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and comparisons are made with the BLT method.},

The methods programmed allow the straightforward design of sliding hyperplanes by various approaches including complete and partial eigenstructure assignment, and reduction of the sensitivity to unmatched parameter variations. In addition the user can design the control law and simulate the closed-loop system. This package can be used with little knowledge required of VSC theory},

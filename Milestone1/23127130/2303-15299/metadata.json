    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of cooperative control of heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) against Byzantine attacks. The agent affected by Byzantine attacks sends different wrong values to all neighbors while applying wrong input signals for itself, which is aggressive and difficult to be defended. Inspired by the concept of Digital Twin, a new hierarchical protocol equipped with a virtual twin layer (TL) is proposed, which decouples the above problems into the defense scheme against Byzantine edge attacks on the TL and the defense scheme against Byzantine node attacks on the cyber-physical layer (CPL). On the TL, we propose a resilient topology reconfiguration strategy by adding a minimum number of key edges to improve network resilience. It is strictly proved that the control strategy is sufficient to achieve asymptotic consensus in finite time with the topology on the TL satisfying strongly $(2f+1)$-robustness. On the CPL, decentralized chattering-free controllers are proposed to guarantee the resilient output consensus for the heterogeneous MASs against Byzantine node attacks. Moreover, the obtained controller shows exponential convergence. The effectiveness and practicality of the theoretical results are verified by numerical examples.",

Our experiments show that the proposed codec significantly outperforms the original neural speech codec with respect to the quality of synthesized speech when operating in the ultra-low bitrate regime. In addition, the subjective experiments indicate comparable to or better perceptual speech quality compared to conventional codecs operating at higher rates.

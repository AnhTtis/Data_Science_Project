    "abstract": "We have designed a passive spintronic diode based on a single skyrmion stabilized in a magnetic tunnel junction and studied its dynamics induced by voltage-controlled anisotropy (VCMA) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (VDMI). We have demonstrated that the sensitivity (rectified voltage over input microwave power) with realistic physical parameters and geometry can be larger than 10 kV/W which is one order of magnitude better than diodes employing a uniform ferromagnetic state. Our numerical and analytical results on the VCMA and VDMI-driven resonant excitation of skyrmions beyond the linear regime reveal a frequency dependence on the amplitude and no efficient parametric resonance. Skyrmions with a smaller radius produced higher sensitivities, demonstrating the efficient scalability of skyrmion-based spintronic diodes. These results pave the way for designing passive ultra-sensitive and energy efficient skyrmion-based microwave detectors.",

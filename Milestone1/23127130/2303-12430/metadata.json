    "abstract": "Differential central simple algebras are the main object of study in this survey article. We recall some crucial notions such as differential subfields, differential splitting fields, tensor products etc. Our main focus is on differential splitting fields which connects these objects to the classical differential Galois theory. We mention several known results and raise some questions along the line.",

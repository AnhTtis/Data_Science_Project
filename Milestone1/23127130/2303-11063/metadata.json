    "abstract": "Clarifying the electronic and magnetic properties of lutetium, lutetium dihydride, and lutetium oxide is very helpful to understand the emergent phenomena in lutetium-based compounds (such as room-temperature superconductivity). However, this kind of study is still scarce at present. Here, we report on the electronic and magnetic properties of lutetium metals, lutetium dihydride powders, and lutetium oxide powders. Crystal structures and chemical compositions of these samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, respectively. Electrical transport measurements show that the resistance of lutetium has a linear behavior depending on temperature, whereas the resistance of lutetium dihydride powders is independent of temperature. More interestingly, paramagnetism-ferromagnetism-spin glass transitions were observed at near 240 and 200 K, respectively, in lutetium metals. Our work uncovered the complex magnetic properties of Lu-based compounds.",

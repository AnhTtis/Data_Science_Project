\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
Stochastic complementarity systems are not well understood in literature.
This paper presents a study of SDLCS to perform covariance steering using particles. Under the assumption of uniqueness of trajectory ($\bar{F}$ is P-matrix) for complementarity systems, the proposed method is able to compute covariance controller for SDLCS. We presented an important-particle method to alleviate computational complexity of the resulting optimization problem. It is shown that our work could design open- and closed-loop controllers with chance constraints by appropriately considering the evolution of uncertainty for SDLCS.

In the future, we would like to study more general manipulation systems by relaxing the assumption on uniqueness of trajectory for SDLCS. Another limitation of this work is that the computation is still demanding. Thus, we would like to employ distributed optimization techniques such as ADMM \cite{boyd2011distributed}.

% There are many exciting future directions. Firstly, this work assumes that $F$ is P-matrix.
% Secondly, there would be a richer controller structure
% Thirdly, learning-rate with Neural net?

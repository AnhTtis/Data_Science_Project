    "abstract": "Noether and Lie symmetry analyses based on point transformations that depend on time and spatial coordinates will be reviewed for a general class of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems. The resulting symmetries are expressed in the form of generators whose time-dependent coefficients follow as solutions of sets of ordinary differential (``auxiliary'') equations. The interrelation between the Noether and Lie sets of auxiliary equations will be elucidated. The auxiliary equations of the Noether approach will be shown to admit invariants for a much broader class of potentials, compared to earlier studies. As an example, we work out the Noether and Lie symmetries for the time-dependent Kepler system. The Runge-Lenz vector of the time-independent Kepler system will be shown to emerge as a Noether invariant if we adequately interpret the pertaining auxiliary equation. Furthermore, additional nonlocal invariants and symmetries of the Kepler system will be isolated by identifying further solutions of the auxiliary equations that depend on the explicitly known solution path of the equations of motion. Showing that the invariants remain unchanged under the action of different symmetry operators, we demonstrate that a unique correlation between a symmetry transformation and an invariant does not exist.",

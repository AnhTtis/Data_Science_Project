  abstract = {The Kalman filter provides an effective solution to the linear Gaussian filtering problem. However where there is nonlinearity, either in the model specification or the observation process, other methods are required. Methods known generically as `particle filters' are considered. These include the condensation algorithm and the Bayesian bootstrap or sampling importance resampling (SIR) filter. These filters represent the posterior distribution of the state variables by a system of particles which evolves and adapts recursively as new information becomes available. In practice, large numbers of particles may be required to provide adequate approximations and for certain applications, after a sequence of updates, the particle system will often collapse to a single point. A method of monitoring the efficiency of these filters is introduced which provides a simple quantitative assessment of sample impoverishment and the authors show how to construct improved particle filters that are both structurally efficient in terms of preventing the collapse of the particle system and computationally efficient in their implementation. This is illustrated with the classic bearings-only tracking problem.},

  abstract = {The estimation of patient-specific tissue properties in the form of model parameters is important for personalized physiological models. However, these tissue properties are spatially varying across the underlying anatomical model, presenting a significance challenge of high-dimensional (HD) optimization at the presence of limited measurement data. A common solution to reduce the dimension of the parameter space is to explicitly partition the anatomical mesh, either into a fixed small number of segments or a multi-scale hierarchy. This anatomy-based reduction of parameter space presents a fundamental bottleneck to parameter estimation, resulting in solutions that are either too low in resolution to reflect tissue heterogeneity, or too high in dimension to be reliably estimated within feasible computation. In this paper, we present a novel concept that embeds a generative variational auto-encoder (VAE) into the objective function of Bayesian optimization, providing an implicit low-dimensional (LD) search space that represents the generative code of the HD spatially-varying tissue properties. In addition, the VAE-encoded knowledge about the generative code is further used to guide the exploration of the search space. The presented method is applied to estimating tissue excitability in a cardiac electrophysiological model. Synthetic and real-data experiments demonstrate its ability to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation with more than 10x gain in efficiency.}

  abstract = {The Laplacian pyramid is ubiquitous for decomposing images into multiple scales and is widely used for image analysis. However, because it is constructed with spatially invariant Gaussian kernels, the Laplacian pyramid is widely believed as being unable to represent edges well and as being ill-suited for edge-aware operations such as edge-preserving smoothing and tone mapping. To tackle these tasks, a wealth of alternative techniques and representations have been proposed, e.g., anisotropic diffusion, neighborhood filtering, and specialized wavelet bases. While these methods have demonstrated successful results, they come at the price of additional complexity, often accompanied by higher computational cost or the need to post-process the generated results. In this paper, we show state-of-the-art edge-aware processing using standard Laplacian pyramids. We characterize edges with a simple threshold on pixel values that allows us to differentiate large-scale edges from small-scale details. Building upon this result, we propose a set of image filters to achieve edge-preserving smoothing, detail enhancement, tone mapping, and inverse tone mapping. The advantage of our approach is its simplicity and flexibility, relying only on simple point-wise nonlinearities and small Gaussian convolutions; no optimization or post-processing is required. As we demonstrate, our method produces consistently high-quality results, without degrading edges or introducing halos.},

We demonstrate that independent, keyed transformations of counters produce a large alternative class of PRNGs with excellent statistical properties (long period, no discernable structure or correlation). These counter-based PRNGs are ideally suited to modern multi-core CPUs, GPUs, clusters, and special-purpose hardware because they vectorize and parallelize well, and require little or no memory for state. We introduce several counter-based PRNGs: some based on cryptographic standards (AES, Threefish) and some completely new (Philox). All our PRNGs pass rigorous statistical tests (including TestU01's BigCrush) and produce at least 264 unique parallel streams of random numbers, each with period 2128 or more. In addition to essentially unlimited parallel scalability, our PRNGs offer excellent single-chip performance: Philox is faster than the CURAND library on a single NVIDIA GPU.},

For example, in color enhancement of photographs, designers tweak multiple parameters such as "brightness" and "contrast" to obtain the best visual impression. Adjusting one parameter is easy; however, if there are multiple correlated parameters, the task becomes much more complex, requiring many trials and a large cognitive load. To address this problem, we present a novel extension of Bayesian optimization techniques, where the system decomposes the entire parameter tweaking task into a sequence of one-dimensional line search queries that are easy for human to perform by manipulating a single slider. In addition, we present a novel concept called crowd-powered visual design optimizer, which queries crowd workers, and provide a working implementation of this concept. Our single-slider manipulation microtask design for crowdsourcing accelerates the convergence of the optimization relative to existing comparison-based microtask designs. We applied our framework to two different design domains: photo color enhancement and material BRDF design, and thereby showed its applicability to various design domains.},

Yet, they are not necessarily stored efficiently, and standard graph representations such as adjacency lists waste a significant number of bits while graph compression schemes such as WebGraph often require time-consuming decompression. To address this, we propose Log(Graph): a graph representation that combines high compression ratios with very low-overhead decompression to enable cheaper and faster graph processing. The key idea is to encode a graph so that the parts of the representation approach or match the respective storage lower bounds. We call our approach "graph logarithmization" because these bounds are usually logarithmic. Our high-performance Log(Graph) implementation based on modern bitwise operations and state-of-the-art succinct data structures achieves high compression ratios as well as performance. For example, compared to the tuned Graph Algorithm Processing Benchmark Suite (GAPBS), it reduces graph sizes by 20-35\% while matching GAPBS' performance or even delivering speedups due to reducing amounts of transferred data. It approaches the compression ratio of the established WebGraph compression library while enabling speedups of up to more than 2\texttimes. Log(Graph) can improve the design of various graph processing engines or libraries on single NUMA nodes as well as distributed-memory systems.},

To achieve this, we use the red-blue pebble game to precisely model MMM dependencies and derive a constructive and tight sequential and parallel I/O lower bound proofs. Compared to 2D or 3D algorithms, which fix processor decomposition upfront and then map it to the matrix dimensions, it reduces communication volume by up to {$\surd$} times. COSMA outperforms the established ScaLAPACK, CARMA, and CTF algorithms in all scenarios up to 12.8x (2.2x on average), achieving up to 88\% of Piz Daint's peak performance.

We propose differential subspace search to allow efficient iterative user exploration in such a space, without relying on domain- or data-specific assumptions. We develop a general framework to extract low-dimensional subspaces based on a local differential analysis of the generative model, such that a small change in such a subspace would provide enough change in the resulting data. We do so by applying singular value decomposition to the Jacobian of the generative model and forming a subspace with the desired dimensionality spanned by a given number of singular vectors stochastically selected on the basis of their singular values, to maintain ergodicity. We use our framework to present 1D subspaces to the user via a 1D slider interface. Starting from an initial location, the user finds a new candidate in the presented 1D subspace, which is in turn updated at the new candidate location. This process is repeated until no further improvement can be made. Numerical simulations show that our method can better optimize synthetic black-box objective functions than the alternatives that we tested. Furthermore, we conducted a user study using complex generative models and the results show that our method enables more efficient exploration of high-dimensional latent spaces than the alternatives.},

  abstract = {Rendering radiative transfer through media with a heterogeneous refractive index is challenging because the continuous refractive index variations result in light traveling along curved paths. Existing algorithms are based on photon mapping techniques, and thus are biased and result in strong artifacts. On the other hand, existing unbiased methods such as path tracing and bidirectional path tracing cannot be used in their current form to simulate media with a heterogeneous refractive index. We change this state of affairs by deriving unbiased path tracing estimators for this problem. Starting from the refractive radiative transfer equation (RRTE), we derive a path-integral formulation, which we use to generalize path tracing with next-event estimation and bidirectional path tracing to the heterogeneous refractive index setting. We then develop an optimization approach based on fast analytic derivative computations to produce the point-to-point connections required by these path tracing algorithms. We propose several acceleration techniques to handle complex scenes (surfaces and volumes) that include participating media with heterogeneous refractive fields. We use our algorithms to simulate a variety of scenes combining heterogeneous refraction and scattering, as well as tissue imaging techniques based on ultrasonic virtual waveguides and lenses. Our algorithms and publicly-available implementation can be used to characterize imaging systems such as refractive index microscopy, schlieren imaging, and acousto-optic imaging, and can facilitate the development of inverse rendering techniques for related applications.},

Simulating water splashes near moving objects, which height field methods for water waves cannot capture, necessitates high resolutions. Such simulations can be carried out using the Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) method. However, the FLIP method is not efficient for the long-lasting water waves that propagate to long distances, which require sufficient depth for a correct dispersion relationship. This paper presents a new method to tackle this dilemma through an efficient hybridization of volumetric and surface-based advection-projection discretizations. We design a hybrid time-stepping algorithm that combines a FLIP domain and an adaptively remeshed Boundary Element Method (BEM) domain for the incompressible Euler equations. The resulting framework captures the detailed water splashes near moving objects with the FLIP method, and produces convincing water waves with correct dispersion relationships at modest additional costs.},

In this paper we extend the WRMC algorithm to a general control variate technique and exhibit the optimal choice of the control variate in terms of the asymptotic variance. We also give an example which shows that, in contradiction to the intuition of physicists, the WRMC algorithm can have an asymptotic variance larger than that of the Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm. However, in the particular case of the Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm called the Boltzmann algorithm, we prove that the WRMC algorithm is asymptotically better than the Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm. This last property is also true for the multiproposal Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm. In this last framework we consider a linear parametric generalization of WRMC, and we propose an estimator of the explicit optimal parameter using the proposals.}

This method, "Expectation Propagation," unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and varitmce, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be donvincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.}

In this paper, we introduce a novel random embedding idea to attack this problem. The resulting Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) algorithm is very simple and applies to domains with both categorical and continuous variables. The experiments demonstrate that REMBO can effectively solve high-dimensional problems, including automatic parameter configuration of a popular mixed integer linear programming solver.}

We present a new stochastic method for variational inference which exploits the geometry of the variational-parameter space and also yields simple closed-form updates even for non-conjugate models. We also give a convergence-rate analysis of our method and many other previous methods which exploit the geometry of the space. Our analysis generalizes existing convergence results for stochastic mirror-descent on non-convex objectives by using a more general class of divergence functions. Beyond giving a theoretical justification for a variety of recent methods, our experiments show that new algorithms derived in this framework lead to state of the art results on a variety of problems. Further, due to its generality, we expect that our theoretical analysis could also apply to other applications.}

  abstract = {Ray-based simulations have been shown to generate impressively realistic ultrasound images in interactive frame rates. Recent efforts used GPU-based surface ray-tracing to simulate complex ultrasound interactions such as multiple reflections and refractions. These methods are restricted to perfectly specular reflections (i.e., following only a single reflective/refractive ray), whereas real tissue exhibits roughness of varying degree at tissue interfaces, causing partly diffuse reflections and refractions. Such surface interactions are significantly more complex and can in general not be handled by such deterministic ray-tracing approaches. However, they can be efficiently computed by Monte-Carlo sampling techniques, where many ray paths are generated with respect to a probability distribution. In this paper we introduce Monte-Carlo ray-tracing for ultrasound. This enables the realistic simulation of ultrasound interactions such as soft shadows and fuzzy reflections. We discuss how to properly weight the contribution of each ray path in order to simulate the behavior of a beamformed ultrasound signal. Tracing many individual rays per transducer element is easily parallelizable on modern GPUs, as opposed to previous approaches based on recursive binary ray-tracing.}

  abstract = {Background:               Identification of systolic heart failure among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea is challenging. The reasons for dyspnea are often multifactorial. A focused physical evaluation and diagnostic testing can lack sensitivity and specificity. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-enabled ECG to identify patients presenting with dyspnea who have left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).                                         Methods:               We retrospectively applied a validated artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of LVSD (defined as LV ejection fraction {$\leq$}35\%) to a cohort of patients aged {$\geq$}18 years who were evaluated in the ED at a Mayo Clinic site with dyspnea. Patients were included if they had at least one standard 12-lead ECG acquired on the date of the ED visit and an echocardiogram performed within 30 days of presentation. Patients with prior LVSD were excluded. We assessed the model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.                                         Results:               A total of 1606 patients were included. Median time from ECG to echocardiogram was 1 day (Q1: 1, Q3: 2). The artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm identified LVSD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.86\textendash 0.91) and accuracy of 85.9\%. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were 74\%, 87\%, 97\%, and 40\%, respectively. To identify an ejection fraction {$<$}50\%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 0.88), 86\%, 63\%, and 91\%, respectively. NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) alone at a cutoff of {$>$}800 identified LVSD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.84).                                         Conclusions:               The ECG is an inexpensive, ubiquitous, painless test which can be quickly obtained in the ED. It effectively identifies LVSD in selected patients presenting to the ED with dyspnea when analyzed with artificial intelligence and outperforms NT-proBNP.

  abstract = {Recent research has seen several advances relevant to black-box VI, but the current state of automatic posterior inference is unclear. One such advance is the use of normalizing flows to define flexible posterior densities for deep latent variable models. Another direction is the integration of Monte-Carlo methods to serve two purposes; first, to obtain tighter variational objectives for optimization, and second, to define enriched variational families through sampling. However, both flows and variational Monte-Carlo methods remain relatively unexplored for black-box VI. Moreover, on a pragmatic front, there are several optimization considerations like step-size scheme, parameter initialization, and choice of gradient estimators, for which there are no clear guidance in the existing literature. In this paper, we postulate that black-box VI is best addressed through a careful combination of numerous algorithmic components. We evaluate components relating to optimization, flows, and Monte-Carlo methods on a benchmark of 30 models from the Stan model library. The combination of these algorithmic components significantly advances the state-of-the-art "out of the box" variational inference.},

Although it is straightforward to show that they have the same                                                   \$\$\textbackslash mathcal \{O\}(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{N\})\$\$                                                               O                       (                       1                       /                                                N                                              )                                                                                       convergence rate as standard importance samplers, where               N               is the number of Monte Carlo samples, the behaviour of adaptive importance samplers over the number of iterations has been left relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate an adaptation strategy based on convex optimisation which leads to a class of adaptive importance samplers termed               optimised adaptive importance samplers               (OAIS). These samplers rely on the iterative minimisation of the                                                   \$\$\textbackslash chi \^2\$\$                                                               {$\chi$}                       2                                                                                       -divergence between an exponential family proposal and the target. The analysed algorithms are closely related to the class of adaptive importance samplers which minimise the variance of the weight function. We first prove non-asymptotic error bounds for the mean squared errors (MSEs) of these algorithms, which explicitly depend on the number of iterations and the number of samples together. The non-asymptotic bounds derived in this paper imply that when the target belongs to the exponential family, the                                                   \$\$L\_2\$\$                                                               L                       2                                                                                       errors of the optimised samplers converge to the optimal rate of                                                   \$\$\textbackslash mathcal \{O\}(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{N\})\$\$                                                               O                       (                       1                       /                                                N                                              )                                                                                       and the rate of convergence in the number of iterations are explicitly provided.

Methods and Results               A systematic review was conducted to identify published original articles on end-to-end DL analysis of resting ECG signals for the detection of structural cardiac pathologies. Studies were excluded if the ECG was acquired by ambulatory, stress, intracardiac, or implantable devices, and if the pathology of interest was arrhythmic in nature. After duplicate reviewers screened search results, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included. Three articles used DL ECG to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89-0.93 and accuracy of 98\%. One study used DL ECG to detect left ventricular hypertrophy, achieving an AUC of 0.87 and accuracy of 87\%. Six articles used DL ECG to detect acute myocardial infarction, achieving an AUC of 0.88-1.00 and accuracy of 83-99.9\%. Two articles used DL ECG to detect stable ischaemic heart disease, achieving an accuracy of 95-99.9\%. DL algorithms, particularly those that used convolutional neural networks, outperformed rules-based algorithms and other machine learning algorithms.                                         Conclusions               DL is a promising technique to analyze resting ECG signals for the detection of structural cardiac pathologies, which has clinical applicability for more effective screening of asymptomatic populations and expedited diagnostic work-up of symptomatic patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.},

Using simple toy examples we review their theoretical underpinnings, and in particular show why adaptive MCMC algorithms might fail when some fundamental properties are not satisfied. This leads to guidelines concerning the design of correct algorithms. We then review criteria and the useful framework of stochastic approximation, which allows one to systematically optimise generally used criteria, but also analyse the properties of adaptive MCMC algorithms. We then propose a series of novel adaptive algorithms which prove to be robust and reliable in practice. These algorithms are applied to artificial and high dimensional scenarios, but also to the classic mine disaster dataset inference problem.},

  abstract = {Direction of arrival estimation is one of the most important issues in array signals processing. In this paper, a new method is presented for direction estimation of coherent wide-band signals. First of all, signal eigenvalues which have information of the direction of coherent signals, are extracted as primary vectors in each frequency bin. Afterwards, by constructing the innovative matrix H from signal eigenvalues, the de-correlation process is performed and the linear independent vectors of sources are extracted from SVD decomposition. Finally, by choosing transfer matrix, the signal subspace of the reference frequency is transferred to other frequency bins and the direction estimation process is performed by using TOPS algorithm. The proposed method does not need any knowledge of the number of sources and initial estimation of arrival angles. According to the simulation results, the CTOPS new method has a better performance than TOPS method in the presence of correlated sources.},

  abstract = {Multiscale manipulations are central to image editing but also prone to halos. Achieving artifact-free results requires sophisticated edge-aware techniques and careful parameter tuning. These shortcomings were recently addressed by the local Laplacian filters, which can achieve a broad range of effects using standard Laplacian pyramids. However, these filters are slow to evaluate and their relationship to other approaches is unclear. In this article, we show that they are closely related to anisotropic diffusion and to bilateral filtering. Our study also leads to a variant of the bilateral filter that produces cleaner edges while retaining its speed. Building upon this result, we describe an acceleration scheme for local Laplacian filters on gray-scale images that yields speedups on the order of 50\texttimes. Finally, we demonstrate how to use local Laplacian filters to alter the distribution of gradients in an image. We illustrate this property with a robust algorithm for photographic style transfer.},

  abstract = {We present a graph processing benchmark suite with the goal of helping to standardize graph processing evaluations. Fewer differences between graph processing evaluations will make it easier to compare different research efforts and quantify improvements. The benchmark not only specifies graph kernels, input graphs, and evaluation methodologies, but it also provides optimized baseline implementations. These baseline implementations are representative of state-of-the-art performance, and thus new contributions should outperform them to demonstrate an improvement. The input graphs are sized appropriately for shared memory platforms, but any implementation on any platform that conforms to the benchmark's specifications could be compared. This benchmark suite can be used in a variety of settings. Graph framework developers can demonstrate the generality of their programming model by implementing all of the benchmark's kernels and delivering competitive performance on all of the benchmark's graphs. Algorithm designers can use the input graphs and the baseline implementations to demonstrate their contribution. Platform designers and performance analysts can use the suite as a workload representative of graph processing.},

  abstract = {Shallow supervised 1-hidden layer neural networks have a number of favorable properties that make them easier to interpret, analyze, and optimize than their deep counterparts, but lack their representational power. Here we use 1-hidden layer learning problems to sequentially build deep networks layer by layer, which can inherit properties from shallow networks. Contrary to previous approaches using shallow networks, we focus on problems where deep learning is reported as critical for success. We thus study CNNs on image classification tasks using the large-scale ImageNet dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. Using a simple set of ideas for architecture and training we find that solving sequential 1-hidden-layer auxiliary problems lead to a CNN that exceeds AlexNet performance on ImageNet. Extending this training methodology to construct individual layers by solving 2-and-3-hidden layer auxiliary problems, we obtain an 11-layer network that exceeds several members of the VGG model family on ImageNet, and can train a VGG-11 model to the same accuracy as end-to-end learning. To our knowledge, this is the first competitive alternative to end-to-end training of CNNs that can scale to ImageNet. We illustrate several interesting properties of these models and conduct a range of experiments to study the properties this training induces on the intermediate layers.}

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses \textemdash{} the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Much of this zeitgeist has been driven by the success of frequentist methods like compressed sensing and LASSO regression, and it is often naively assumed that these properties immediately carry over to the corresponding Bayesian analyses. Sparsity in a Bayesian analysis, however, is induced by fundamentally different properties than those that induce sparsity in a frequentist analysis. In this case study I'll review how sparsity arises in frequentist and Bayesian analyses and discuss the often subtle challenges in implementing sparsity in practical Bayesian analyses.}

  abstract = {Under ideal conditions only a small neighborhood of model configurations will be consistent with both the observed data and the domain expertise we encode in our prior model, resulting in a posterior distribution that strongly concentrates along each parameter. This not only yields precise inferences and but also facilitates accurate estimation of those inferences. Under more realistic conditions, however, our measurements and domain expertise can be much less informative, allowing our posterior distribution to stretch across more expansive, complex neighborhoods of the model configuration space. These intricate uncertainties complicate not only the utility of our inferences but also our ability to quantify those inferences computationally. In this case study we will explore the theoretical concept of identifiability and its more geometric counterpart degeneracy that better generalizes to applied statistical practice. We will also discuss the principled ways in which we can identify and then compensate for degenerate inferences before demonstrating these strategies in a series of pedagogical examples.}

In this paper we use the underlying geometry of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to construct a universal optimization criteria for tuning the step size of the symplectic integrator crucial to any implementation of the algorithm as well as diagnostics to monitor for any signs of invalidity. An immediate outcome of this result is that the suggested target average acceptance probability of 0.651 can be relaxed to \$0.6 \textbackslash lesssim a \textbackslash lesssim 0.9\$ with larger values more robust in practice.},

  abstract = {Variational inference has recently emerged as a popular alternative to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in large-scale Bayesian inference. The core idea of variational inference is to trade statistical accuracy for computational efficiency. It aims to approximate the posterior, reducing computation costs but potentially compromising its statistical accuracy. In this work, we study this statistical and computational trade-off in variational inference via a case study in inferential model selection. Focusing on Gaussian inferential models (a.k.a. variational approximating families) with diagonal plus low-rank precision matrices, we initiate a theoretical study of the trade-offs in two aspects, Bayesian posterior inference error and frequentist uncertainty quantification error. From the Bayesian posterior inference perspective, we characterize the error of the variational posterior relative to the exact posterior. We prove that, given a fixed computation budget, a lower-rank inferential model produces variational posteriors with a higher statistical approximation error, but a lower computational error; it reduces variances in stochastic optimization and, in turn, accelerates convergence. From the frequentist uncertainty quantification perspective, we consider the precision matrix of the variational posterior as an uncertainty estimate. We find that, relative to the true asymptotic precision, the variational approximation suffers from an additional statistical error originating from the sampling uncertainty of the data. Moreover, this statistical error becomes the dominant factor as the computation budget increases. As a consequence, for small datasets, the inferential model need not be full-rank to achieve optimal estimation error. We finally demonstrate these statistical and computational trade-offs inference across empirical studies, corroborating the theoretical findings.},

However, MCMC sampling can be prohibitively slow, and it is important to explore alternatives. One class of alternatives is provided by variational methods, a class of deterministic algorithms that convert inference problems into optimization problems (Opper and Saad 2001; Wainwright and Jordan 2003). Thus far, variational methods have mainly been explored in the parametric setting, in particular within the formalism of the exponential family (Attias 2000; Ghahramani and Beal 2001; Blei et al. 2003). In this paper, we present a variational inference algorithm for DP mixtures. We present experiments that compare the algorithm to Gibbs sampling algorithms for DP mixtures of Gaussians and present an application to a large-scale image analysis problem.},

  abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

However, the tightness of TVO bounds was not previously known, an expensive grid search was used to choose a ``schedule'' of intermediate distributions, and model learning suffered with ostensibly tighter bounds. In this work, we propose an exponential family interpretation of the geometric mixture curve underlying the TVO and various path sampling methods, which allows us to characterize the gap in TVO likelihood bounds as a sum of KL divergences. We propose to choose intermediate distributions using equal spacing in the moment parameters of our exponential family, which matches grid search performance and allows the schedule to adaptively update over the course of training. Finally, we derive a doubly reparameterized gradient estimator which improves model learning and allows the TVO to benefit from more refined bounds. To further contextualize our contributions, we provide a unified framework for understanding thermodynamic integration and the TVO using Taylor series remainders.},

  abstract = {Many machine learning problems involve Monte Carlo gradient estimators. As a prominent example, we focus on Monte Carlo variational inference (MCVI) in this paper. The performance of MCVI crucially depends on the variance of its stochastic gradients. We propose variance reduction by means of Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. QMC replaces N i.i.d. samples from a uniform probability distribution by a deterministic sequence of samples of length N. This sequence covers the underlying random variable space more evenly than i.i.d. draws, reducing the variance of the gradient estimator. With our novel approach, both the score function and the reparameterization gradient estimators lead to much faster convergence. We also propose a new algorithm for Monte Carlo objectives, where we operate with a constant learning rate and increase the number of QMC samples per iteration. We prove that this way, our algorithm can converge asymptotically at a faster rate than SGD . We furthermore provide theoretical guarantees on qmc for Monte Carlo objectives that go beyond MCVI , and support our findings by several experiments on large-scale data sets from various domains.},

A systematic literature review of nested sampling algorithms and variants is presented. We focus on complete algorithms, including solutions to likelihood-restricted prior sampling, parallelisation, termination and diagnostics. The relation between number of live points, dimensionality and computational cost is studied for two complete algorithms. A new formulation of NS is presented, which casts the parameter space exploration as a search on a tree. Previously published ways of obtaining robust error estimates and dynamic variations of the number of live points are presented as special cases of this formulation. A new on-line diagnostic test is presented based on previous insertion rank order work. The survey of nested sampling methods concludes with outlooks for future research.},

BASS-ALE estimators are described which incorporate: source focusing, spatial/temporal noise decorrelating, a signal (or noise-only) subspace generated from the eigenstructure of the transformed spatial/temporal covariance matrix, and broadband source models. Through discussion and simulation, BASS-ALE estimators are compared to the coherent signal-subspace processor (a similar subspace method), and relative advantages of the two are identified.{$<>$}},

With this reformulation in hand, we prove sharper quantitative results, establish lower bounds, and raise a few new questions.

From these insights, we propose a modification to the training regime of \$\textbackslash beta\$-VAE, that progressively increases the information capacity of the latent code during training. This modification facilitates the robust learning of disentangled representations in \$\textbackslash beta\$-VAE, without the previous trade-off in reconstruction accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a common class of problems where a robot learns to perform a discovery task based on example solutions, or \textbackslash emph\{human demonstrations\}. As an example, this work considers the problem of ultrasound scanning, where a demonstration involves an expert adaptively searching for a satisfactory view of internal organs, vessels or tissue and potential anomalies while maintaining optimal contact between the probe and surface tissue. Such problems are often solved by inferring notional \textbackslash emph\{rewards\} that, when optimised for, result in a plan that mimics demonstrations. A pivotal assumption, that plans with higher reward should be exponentially more likely, leads to the de facto approach for reward inference in robotics. While this approach of maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning leads to a general and elegant formulation, it struggles to cope with frequently encountered sub-optimal demonstrations. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to cope with the class of problems where sub-optimal demonstrations occur frequently. We hypothesise that, in tasks which require discovery, successive states of any demonstration are progressively more likely to be associated with a higher reward. We formalise this \textbackslash emph\{temporal ranking\} approach and show that it improves upon maximum-entropy approaches to perform reward inference for autonomous ultrasound scanning, a novel application of learning from demonstration in medical imaging.},

The incident wavefields may be a mixture of coherent and noncoherent sources that are broadband and/or narrowband. Furthermore, the wavefields may be plane waves and/or spherical waves. An effective algorithmic approach is developed for solving the multiple source location problem in the signal and covariance domains. In each domain, it is necessary to represent a set of vectors as a linear combination of array steering vectors. Using this property, a generic descent algorithmic approach is developed for estimating the wavefield directions of arrival. The success of such iterative approaches is critically dependent on the generation of good estimates to initialize the algorithm. An effective initialization procedure is developed for this purpose. Direction-of-arrival estimates which arise from the proposed procedure are empirically found to be unbiased and low variance.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Importance Sampling (IS) is a method for approximating expectations under a target distribution using independent samples from a proposal distribution and the associated importance weights. In many applications, the target distribution is known only up to a normalization constant, in which case self-normalized IS (SNIS) can be used. While the use of self-normalization can have a positive effect on the dispersion of the estimator, it introduces bias. In this work, we propose a new method, BR-SNIS, whose complexity is essentially the same as that of SNIS and which significantly reduces bias without increasing the variance. This method is a wrapper in the sense that it uses the same proposal samples and importance weights as SNIS, but makes clever use of iterated sampling--importance resampling (ISIR) to form a bias-reduced version of the estimator. We furnish the proposed algorithm with rigorous theoretical results, including new bias, variance and high-probability bounds, and these are illustrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) have become very popular techniques to perform inference and learning in latent variable models as they allow us to leverage the rich representational power of neural networks to obtain flexible approximations of the posterior of latent variables as well as tight evidence lower bounds (ELBO). Com- bined with stochastic variational inference, this provides a methodology scaling to large datasets. However, for this methodology to be practically efficient, it is neces- sary to obtain low-variance unbiased estimators of the ELBO and its gradients with respect to the parameters of interest. While the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been previously suggested to achieve this [23, 26], the proposed methods require specifying reverse kernels which have a large impact on performance. Additionally, the resulting unbiased estimator of the ELBO for most MCMC kernels is typically not amenable to the reparameterization trick. We show here how to optimally select reverse kernels in this setting and, by building upon Hamiltonian Importance Sampling (HIS) [17], we obtain a scheme that provides low-variance unbiased estimators of the ELBO and its gradients using the reparameterization trick. This allows us to develop a Hamiltonian Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE). This method can be re-interpreted as a target-informed normalizing flow [20] which, within our context, only requires a few evaluations of the gradient of the sampled likelihood and trivial Jacobian calculations at each iteration.},

It then considers the fundamental audio processing tasks before discussing a range of Bayesian hierarchical models involving both time and frequency domain dynamic models. It shows that Bayesian analysis is applicable in audio signal processing in real environments where acoustical conditions and sound sources are highly variable, yet audio signals possess strong statistical structure.},

Second, we provide a general framework for sharpening mixing time bounds Markov chains initialized at a substantial distance from the target distribution over continuous spaces.

Crowdsourcing services provide an inexpensive and efficient means to acquire preferences over objects via labeling by sets of annotators. We propose a new model to predict a gold-standard ranking that hinges on combining pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing. In contrast to traditional ranking aggregation methods, the approach learns about and folds into consideration the quality of contributions of each annotator. In addition, we minimize the cost of assessment by introducing a generalization of the traditional active learning scenario to jointly select the annotator and pair to assess while taking into account the annotator quality, the uncertainty over ordering of the pair, and the current model uncertainty. We formalize this as an active learning strategy that incorporates an exploration-exploitation tradeoff and implement it using an efficient online Bayesian updating scheme. Using simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that the active learning strategy achieves significant reductions in labeling cost while maintaining accuracy.},

Unfortunately, exact Bayesian inference is rarely feasible in practice and approximation methods are usually employed, but do such methods preserve the generalization properties of Bayesian inference ? In this paper, we show that this is indeed the case for some variational inference (VI) algorithms. We consider a few existing online, tempered VI algorithms, as well as a new algorithm, and derive their generalization bounds. Our theoretical result relies on the convexity of the variational objective, but we argue that the result should hold more generally and present empirical evidence in support of this.

  abstract = {Bayesian inference provides an attractive online-learning framework to analyze sequential data, and offers generalization guarantees which hold even with model mismatch and adversaries. Unfortunately, exact Bayesian inference is rarely feasible in practice and approximation methods are usually employed, but do such methods preserve the generalization properties of Bayesian inference ? In this paper, we show that this is indeed the case for some variational inference (VI) algorithms. We consider a few existing online, tempered VI algorithms, as well as a new algorithm, and derive their generalization bounds. Our theoretical result relies on the convexity of the variational objective, but we argue that the result should hold more generally and present empirical evidence in support of this. Our work in this paper presents theoretical justifications in favor of online algorithms relying on approximate Bayesian methods.},

  abstract = {One of the key distinguishing aspects of underwater manipulation tasks is the perception challenges of the ocean environment, including turbidity, backscatter, and lighting effects. Consequently, underwater perception often relies on sonar-based measurements to estimate the vehicle's state and surroundings, either standalone or in concert with other sensing modalities, to support the perception necessary to plan and control manipulation tasks. Simulation of the multibeam echosounder, while not a substitute for in-water testing, is a critical capability for developing manipulation strategies in the complex and variable ocean environment. Although several approaches exist in the literature to simulate synthetic sonar images, the methods in the robotics community typically use image processing and video rendering software to comply with real-time execution requirements. In addition to a lack of physics-based interaction model between sound and the scene of interest, several basic properties are absent in these rendered sonar images\textendash notably the coherent imaging system and coherent speckle that cause distortion of the object geometry in the sonar image. To address this deficiency, we present a physics-based multibeam echosounder simulation method to capture these fundamental aspects of sonar perception. A point-based scattering model is implemented to calculate the acoustic interaction between the target and the environment. This is a simplified representation of target scattering but can produce realistic coherent image speckle and the correct point spread function. The results demonstrate that this multibeam echosounder simulator generates qualitatively realistic images with high efficiency to provide the sonar image and the physical time series signal data. This synthetic sonar data is a key enabler for developing, testing, and evaluating autonomous underwater manipulation strategies that use sonar as a component of perception.}

We show that such methods can also offer an efficient estimation tool in `static' set-ups, in which case {$\pi$}(\texttheta{} | y1, \ldots, yN) (n \&lt; N) is the only posterior distribution of interest but the preliminary exploration of partial posteriors {$\pi$}(\texttheta{} | y1, \ldots, yn) makes it possible to save computing time. A complete algorithm is proposed for independent or Markov models. Our method is shown to challenge other common estimation procedures in terms of robustness and execution time, especially when the sample size is important. Two classes of examples, mixture models and discrete generalised linear models, are discussed and illustrated by numerical results.}

When this information is not available, conventional approaches apply information theoretic criteria or multiple hypothesis tests to simultaneously estimate model order and parameter. These methods are usually computationally intensive, since ML estimates are required for a hierarchy of nested models. In this contribution, we propose a computationally efficient solution to avoid this full search procedure and address issues unique to the broadband case. Our max-search approach computes ML estimates only for the maximally hypothesized number of signals, and selects relevant components through hypothesis testing. Furthermore, we introduce a criterion based on the rank of the steering matrix to reduce indistinguishable components caused by overparameterization. Numerical experiments show that despite model order uncertainty, the proposed method achieves comparable estimation and detection accuracy as standard methods, but at much lower computational expense.},

Unfortunately, the slow convergence associated with EM makes it less attractive for practical applications. The SAGE algorithm proposed by Fessler and Hero (1994), based on the same idea of data augmentation, has the potential to speed up convergence and preserves the advantage of simple implementation. We study both algorithms within the framework of array processing. Theoretical analysis shows that SAGE has faster convergence speed than EM under certain conditions on observed and augmented information matrices. The analytical results are supported by numerical simulations carried out over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and various source locations.},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a day or night any-weather imaging modality that is an important tool in remote sensing. Most existing SAR image formation methods result in a maximum a posteriori image which approximates the reflectivity of an unknown ground scene. This single image provides no quantification of the certainty with which the features in the estimate should be trusted. In addition, finding the mode is generally not the best way to interrogate a posterior. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a sampling framework to SAR image formation. A hierarchical Bayesian model is constructed using conjugate priors that directly incorporate coherent imaging and the problematic speckle phenomenon which is known to degrade image quality. Samples of the resulting posterior as well as parameters governing speckle and noise are obtained using a Gibbs sampler. These samples may then be used to compute estimates, and also to derive other statistics like variance which aid in uncertainty quantification. The latter information is particularly important in SAR, where ground truth images even for synthetically-created examples are typically unknown. An example result using real-world data shows that the sampling-based approach introduced here to SAR image formation provides parameter-free estimates with improved contrast and significantly reduced speckle, as well as unprecedented uncertainty quantification information.},

A review of the state of the art shows that due to the specifics of the parallel applications, the variety of computing platforms, and the numerous performance degradation factors, no single loop scheduling technique can be a 'one-fits-all' solution to effectively optimize the performance of all parallel applications in all situations. The impact of irregularity in computational workloads and hardware systems, including operating system noise, on the performance of parallel applications, results in performance loss and has often been neglected in loop scheduling research, in particular, the context of OpenMP schedules. Existing dynamic loop self-scheduling techniques, such as trapezoid self-scheduling, factoring, and weighted factoring, offer an unexplored potential to alleviate this degradation in OpenMP due to the fact that they explicitly target the minimization of load imbalance and scheduling overhead. Through theoretical and experimental evaluation, this work shows that these loop self-scheduling methods provide a benefit in the context of OpenMP. In conclusion, OpenMP must include more schedules to offer a broader performance coverage of applications executing on an increasing variety of heterogeneous shared memory computing platforms.},

In our work, we introduce a new symmetric integration scheme for split HMC that does not rely on stochastic gradients. We show that our new formulation is more efficient than previous approaches and is easy to implement with a single GPU. As a result, we are able to perform full HMC over common deep learning architectures using entire data sets. In addition, when we compare with stochastic gradient MCMC, we show that our method achieves better performance in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

The random numbers used to initialize filters are a bias and determine if you will "win" and converge to a satisfactory local minimum so we call this The Filter Lottery. We observe that the 28x28 Inception-V3 model without Batch Normalization fails to train 26\% of the time when varying the random seed alone. This is a problem that affects the trial and error process of designing a network. Because random seeds have a large impact it makes it hard to evaluate a network design without trying many different random starting weights. This work aims to reduce the bias imposed by the initial weights so a network converges more consistently. We propose to evaluate and replace specific convolutional filters that have little impact on the prediction. We use the gradient norm to evaluate the impact of a filter on error, and re-initialize filters when the gradient norm of its weights falls below a specific threshold. This consistently improves accuracy on the 28x28 Inception-V3 with a median increase of +3.3\%. In effect our method RandomOut increases the number of filters explored without increasing the size of the network. We observe that the RandomOut method has more consistent generalization performance, having a standard deviation of 1.3\% instead of 2\% when varying random seeds, and does so faster and with fewer parameters.},

In recent years, the analysis of wide, deep BNNs has provided theoretical insight into their priors and posteriors. However, we have no analogous insight into their posteriors under approximate inference. In this work, we show that mean-field variational inference entirely fails to model the data when the network width is large and the activation function is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd activation functions and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the optimal mean-field variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space) distribution converges to the prior predictive distribution as the width tends to infinity. We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our theoretical results are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously observered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and constants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently too loose to be applicable in standard training regimes. Finally, we show that the optimal approximate posterior need not tend to the prior if the activation function is not odd, showing that our statements cannot be generalized arbitrarily.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference via standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as Metropolis-Hastings is too computationally intensive to handle large datasets, since the cost per step usually scales like O(n)O(n)O(n) in the number of data points nnn. We propose the Scalable Metropolis-Hastings (SMH) kernel that only requires processing on average O(1)O(1)O(1) or even O(1/n--{$\surd$})O(1/n)O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}) data points per step. This scheme is based on a combination of factorized acceptance probabilities, procedures for fast simulation of Bernoulli processes, and control variate ideas. Contrary to many MCMC subsampling schemes such as fixed step-size Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, our approach is exact insofar as the invariant distribution is the true posterior and not an approximation to it. We characterise the performance of our algorithm theoretically, and give realistic and verifiable conditions under which it is geometrically ergodic. This theory is borne out by empirical results that demonstrate overall performance benefits over standard Metropolis-Hastings and various subsampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Autoregressive (AR) time series models are widely used in parametric spectral estimation (SE), where the power spectral density (PSD) of the time series is approximated by that of the \textbackslash emph\{best-fit\} AR model, which is available in closed form. Since AR parameters are usually found via maximum-likelihood, least squares or the method of moments, AR-based SE fails to account for the uncertainty of the approximate PSD, and thus only yields point estimates. We propose to handle the uncertainty related to the AR approximation by finding the full posterior distribution of the AR parameters to then propagate this uncertainty to the PSD approximation by \textbackslash emph\{integrating out the AR parameters\}; we implement this concept by assuming two different priors over the model noise. Through practical experiments, we show that the proposed Bayesian autoregressive spectral estimation (BASE) provides point estimates that follow closely those of standard autoregressive spectral estimation (ASE), while also providing error bars. BASE is validated against ASE and the Periodogram on both synthetic and real-world signals.},

In this paper we focus on the key theoretical underpinnings of this new methodology, and simple (direct) Monte Carlo interpretations of the theory. There is considerable scope to tailor the theory introduced in this paper to particular application settings (such as the big data setting), construct efficient parallelised schemes, understand the approximation and computational efficiencies of other such unification paradigms, and explore new theoretical and methodological directions.},

Even so, it is well known that poor solutions whereby the latent posterior collapses to an uninformative prior are sometimes obtained in practice. However, contrary to conventional wisdom that largely assigns blame for this phenomena on the undue influence of KL-divergence regularization, we will argue that posterior collapse is, at least in part, a direct consequence of bad local minima inherent to the loss surface of deep autoencoder networks. In particular, we prove that even small nonlinear perturbations of affine VAE decoder models can produce such minima, and in deeper models, analogous minima can force the VAE to behave like an aggressive truncation operator, provably discarding information along all latent dimensions in certain circumstances. Regardless, the underlying message here is not meant to undercut valuable existing explanations of posterior collapse, but rather, to refine the discussion and elucidate alternative risk factors that may have been previously underappreciated.},

We start with classical arguments showing that general non-convex problems could not be solved efficiently in a reasonable time. Then we give a list of problems that can be solved efficiently to find the global minimizer by exploiting the structure of the problem as much as it is possible. Another way to deal with non-convexity is to relax the goal from finding the global minimum to finding a stationary point or a local minimum. For this setting, we first present known results for the convergence rates of deterministic first-order methods, which are then followed by a general theoretical analysis of optimal stochastic and randomized gradient schemes, and an overview of the stochastic first-order methods. After that, we discuss quite general classes of non-convex problems, such as minimization of {$\alpha$}-weakly quasi-convex functions and functions that satisfy Polyak\textendash\L ojasiewicz condition, which still allow obtaining theoretical convergence guarantees of first-order methods. Then we consider higher-order and zeroth-order/derivative-free methods and their convergence rates for non-convex optimization problems.},

Unfortunately, it is not clear how many steps need to be performed for optimal performance. In addition, the output of the intermediate steps are discarded and thus wasted somehow. We propose a new, waste-free SMC algorithm which uses the outputs of all these intermediate MCMC steps as particles. We establish that its output is consistent and asymptotically normal. We use the expression of the asymptotic variance to develop various insights on how to implement the algorithm in practice. We develop in particular a method to estimate, from a single run of the algorithm, the asymptotic variance of any particle estimate. We show empirically, through a range of numerical examples, that waste-free SMC tends to outperform standard SMC samplers, and especially so in situations where the mixing of the considered MCMC kernels decreases across iterations (as in tempering or rare event problems).},

We show that in expectation, the squared norm of the objective gradient averaged over the trajectory has an upper-bound which is explicit in the constants of the problem, parameters of the optimizer and the total number of iterations \$N\$. This bound can be made arbitrarily small: Adam with a learning rate \$\textbackslash alpha=1/\textbackslash sqrt\{N\}\$ and a momentum parameter on squared gradients \$\textbackslash beta\_2=1-1/N\$ achieves the same rate of convergence \$O(\textbackslash ln(N)/\textbackslash sqrt\{N\})\$ as Adagrad. Finally, we obtain the tightest dependency on the heavy ball momentum among all previous convergence bounds for non-convex Adam and Adagrad, improving from \$O((1-\textbackslash beta\_1)\^\{-3\})\$ to \$O((1-\textbackslash beta\_1)\^\{-1\})\$. Our technique also improves the best known dependency for standard SGD by a factor \$1 - \textbackslash beta\_1\$.},

Methods such as Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin (MALA) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which use gradient information to explore the target distribution, are popular variants of MCMC. The Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler is an alternative sampling method which, unlike MCMC, can readily utilise parallel computing architectures and also has tuning parameters not available to MCMC. One such parameter is the L-kernel which can be used to minimise the variance of the estimates from an SMC sampler. In this letter, we show how the proposal used in the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an advanced variant of HMC, can be incorporated into an SMC sampler to improve the efficiency of the exploration of the target space. We also show how the SMC sampler can be optimized using both a near-optimal L-kernel and a Hamiltonian proposal},

The performance of these approximations depends on (1) how well the variational family approximates the true posterior distribution, (2) the choice of divergence, and (3) the optimization of the variational objective. We show that even when the true variational family is used, high-dimensional posteriors can be very poorly approximated using common stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizers. Motivated by recent theory, we propose a simple and parallel way to improve SGD estimates for variational inference. The approach is theoretically motivated and comes with a diagnostic for convergence and a novel stopping rule, which is robust to noisy objective  functions evaluations. We show empirically, the new workflow works well on a diverse set of models and datasets, or warns if the stochastic optimization fails or if the used variational distribution is not good.},

Bijectors provide composable volume-tracking transformations with automatic caching.

The answer is yes: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution can lead to a desired level of privacy and utility. For a uniform treatment, we define differential privacy over arbitrary data set metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i.i.d or non-tabular data sets. We then prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which delivers a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility of answers to queries and on the ability of an adversary to distinguish between data sets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam's method to obtain lower bounds on distinguishability. Our results hold for arbitrary metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric, we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions.},

We characterize the finite-time performance of this method when the gradients are sampled from Markov processes, and hence biased and dependent from time step to time step; in contrast, the analysis in existing work relies heavily on the stochastic gradients being independent and sometimes unbiased. Our main contributions show that under certain (standard) assumptions on the underlying Markov chain generating the gradients, ASGD converges at the nearly the same rate with Markovian gradient samples as with independent gradient samples. The only difference is a logarithmic factor that accounts for the mixing time of the Markov chain. One of the key motivations for this study are complicated control problems that can be modeled by a Markov decision process and solved using reinforcement learning. We apply the accelerated method to several challenging problems in the OpenAI Gym and Mujoco, and show that acceleration can significantly improve the performance of the classic temporal difference learning and REINFORCE algorithms.},

We clarify the applicability of these ideas to pure probabilistic inference, by showing the resulting Importance Weighted Variational Inference (IWVI) technique is an instance of augmented variational inference, thus identifying the looseness in previous work. Experiments confirm IWVI's practicality for probabilistic inference. As a second contribution, we investigate inference with elliptical distributions, which improves accuracy in low dimensions, and convergence in high dimensions.},

Provable convergence guarantees require structural properties of the objective. This paper shows that for location-scale family approximations, if the target is M-Lipschitz smooth, then so is the ``energy'' part of the variational objective. The key proof idea is to describe gradients in a certain inner-product space, thus permitting the use of Bessel's inequality. This result gives bounds on the location of the optimal parameters, and is a key ingredient for convergence guarantees.},

Two general forms for calculating SST matrices are presented, and the rotational signal-subspace (RSS) focusing matrices proposed by H. Hung and M. Kaveh (1988) are shown to be a special case of the SST matrices. An efficient procedure for computing a subset of the SST matrices, utilizing Householder transformations, is presented. The procedure reduces the computational load by a factor of 10, compared with that for the RSS matrices. The application of MUSIC to the coherently combined covariance matrix is also discussed, and Monte Carlo simulations comparing the performance of Householder SST matrices and RSS matrices are performed.{$<>$}},

We define a space of kernel structures which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels.

The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.}

In this paper, we revisit and complete the approximation of the ESS in the specific context of importance sampling (IS). The derivation of this approximation, that we will denote as \$\textbackslash widehat\{\textbackslash text\{ESS\}\}\$, is only partially available in Kong [1992]. This approximation has been widely used in the last 25 years due to its simplicity as a practical rule of thumb in a wide variety of importance sampling methods. However, we show that the multiple assumptions and approximations in the derivation of \$\textbackslash widehat\{\textbackslash text\{ESS\}\}\$, makes it difficult to be considered even as a reasonable approximation of the ESS. We extend the discussion of the ESS in the multiple importance sampling (MIS) setting, and we display numerical examples. This paper does not cover the use of ESS for MCMC algorithms.},

As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance of intractable expectations for the family  of Lipschitz continuous function. Our method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates.},

  abstract = {We propose a new family of second-generation wavelets constructed using a robust data-prediction lifting scheme. The support of these new wavelets is constructed based on the edge content of the image and avoids having pixels from both sides of an edge. Multi-resolution analysis, based on these new               edge-avoiding wavelets               , shows a better decorrelation of the data compared to common linear translation-invariant multi-resolution analyses. The reduced inter-scale correlation allows us to avoid halo artifacts in band-independent multi-scale processing without taking any special precautions. We thus achieve nonlinear data-dependent multi-scale edge-preserving image filtering and processing at computation times which are               linear               in the number of image pixels. The new wavelets encode, in their shape, the smoothness information of the image at every scale. We use this to derive a new edge-aware interpolation scheme that achieves results, previously computed by solving an inhomogeneous Laplace equation, through an               explicit               computation. We thus avoid the difficulties in solving large and poorly-conditioned systems of equations.                          We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new wavelet basis for various computational photography applications such as multi-scale dynamic-range compression, edge-preserving smoothing and detail enhancement, and image colorization.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of Bayesian deep learning (BDL) methods is challenging. We often seek to evaluate the methods' robustness and scalability, assessing whether new tools give `better' uncertainty estimates than old ones. These evaluations are paramount for practitioners when choosing BDL tools on-top of which they build their applications. Current popular evaluations of BDL methods, such as the UCI experiments, are lacking: Methods that excel with these experiments often fail when used in application such as medical or automotive, suggesting a pertinent need for new benchmarks in the field. We propose a new BDL benchmark with a diverse set of tasks, inspired by a real-world medical imaging application on \textbackslash emph\{diabetic retinopathy diagnosis\}. Visual inputs (512x512 RGB images of retinas) are considered, where model uncertainty is used for medical pre-screening---i.e. to refer patients to an expert when model diagnosis is uncertain. Methods are then ranked according to metrics derived from expert-domain to reflect real-world use of model uncertainty in automated diagnosis. We develop multiple tasks that fall under this application, including out-of-distribution detection and robustness to distribution shift. We then perform a systematic comparison of well-tuned BDL techniques on the various tasks. From our comparison we conclude that some current techniques which solve benchmarks such as UCI `overfit' their uncertainty to the dataset---when evaluated on our benchmark these underperform in comparison to simpler baselines. The code for the benchmark, its baselines, and a simple API for evaluating new BDL tools are made available at https://github.com/oatml/bdl-benchmarks.},

Firstly, we consider a particularly challenging class of discretely observed continuous-time point-process models. For these, we analyse and improve an existing filtering algorithm based on sequential Monte Carlo (smc) methods. To estimate the static parameters in such models, we devise novel particle Gibbs samplers. One of these exploits a sophisticated non-entred parametrisation whose benefits in a Markov chain Monte Carlo (mcmc) context have previously been limited by the lack of blockwise updates for the latent point process. We apply this algorithm to a L\'evy-driven stochastic volatility model. Secondly, we devise novel Monte Carlo methods \textendash{} based around pseudo-marginal and conditional smc approaches \textendash{} for performing optimisation in latent-variable models and more generally. To ease the explanation of the wide range of techniques employed in this work, we describe a generic importance-sampling framework which admits virtually all Monte Carlo methods, including smc and mcmc methods, as special cases. Indeed, hierarchical combinations of different Monte Carlo schemes such as smc within mcmc or smc within smc can be justified as repeated applications of this framework.},

We propose a general method to construct a convolutional layer that is equivariant to transformations from any specified Lie group with a surjective exponential map. Incorporating equivariance to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps, enabling rapid prototyping. Showcasing the simplicity and generality of our method, we apply the same model architecture to images, ball-and-stick molecular data, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems. For Hamiltonian systems, the equivariance of our models is especially impactful, leading to exact conservation of linear and angular momentum.},

While this one posterior sample (OPS) approach elegantly provides privacy "for free," it is data inefficient in the sense of asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE). We show that a simple alternative based on the Laplace mechanism, the workhorse of differential privacy, is as asymptotically efficient as non-private posterior inference, under general assumptions. This technique also has practical advantages including efficient use of the privacy budget for MCMC. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach on a time-series analysis of sensitive military records from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars disclosed by the Wikileaks organization.}

Although previous work has typically focused on its normalization component, BatchNorm also adds two per-feature trainable parameters: a coefficient and a bias. However, the role and expressive power of these parameters remains unclear. To study this question, we investigate the performance achieved when training only these parameters and freezing all others at their random initializations. We find that doing so leads to surprisingly high performance. For example, a sufficiently deep ResNet reaches 83\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 in this configuration. Interestingly, BatchNorm achieves this performance in part by naturally learning to disable around a third of the random features without any changes to the training objective. Not only do these results highlight the under-appreciated role of the affine parameters in BatchNorm, but - in a broader sense - they characterize the expressive power of neural networks constructed simply by shifting and rescaling random features.},

Our framework is built on reparameterized gradient estimators and ``recycles'' parameters obtained from past update history in optimization. In addition, our framework provides a new optimization algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that adaptively estimates the sample size used for gradient estimation according to the ratio of the gradient variance. We theoretically show that, with our method, the variance of the gradient estimator decreases as optimization proceeds and that a learning rate scheduler function helps improve the convergence. We also show that, in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, our method can improve the quality of gradient estimation by the learning rate scheduler function without increasing the initial sample size. Finally, we confirm that our method achieves faster convergence and reduces the variance of the gradient estimator compared with other methods through experimental comparisons with baseline methods using several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Significance             Monte Carlo methods, tools for sampling data from probability distributions, are widely used in the physical sciences, applied mathematics, and Bayesian statistics. Nevertheless, there are many situations in which it is computationally prohibitive to use Monte Carlo due to slow ``mixing'' between modes of a distribution unless hand-tuned algorithms are used to accelerate the scheme. Machine learning techniques based on generative models offer a compelling alternative to the challenge of designing efficient schemes for a specific system. Here, we formalize Monte Carlo augmented with normalizing flows and show that, with limited prior data and a physically inspired algorithm, we can substantially accelerate sampling with generative models.           ,              Many problems in the physical sciences, machine learning, and statistical inference necessitate sampling from a high-dimensional, multimodal probability distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, the ubiquitous tool for this task, typically rely on random local updates to propagate configurations of a given system in a way that ensures that generated configurations will be distributed according to a target probability distribution asymptotically. In high-dimensional settings with multiple relevant metastable basins, local approaches require either immense computational effort or intricately designed importance sampling strategies to capture information about, for example, the relative populations of such basins. Here, we analyze an adaptive MCMC, which augments MCMC sampling with nonlocal transition kernels parameterized with generative models known as normalizing flows. We focus on a setting where there are no preexisting data, as is commonly the case for problems in which MCMC is used. Our method uses 1) an MCMC strategy that blends local moves obtained from any standard transition kernel with those from a generative model to accelerate the sampling and 2) the data generated this way to adapt the generative model and improve its efficacy in the MCMC algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of this algorithm and investigate numerically its efficiency, in particular in terms of its propensity to equilibrate fast between metastable modes whose rough location is known a priori but respective probability weight is not. We show that our algorithm can sample effectively across large free energy barriers, providing dramatic accelerations relative to traditional MCMC algorithms.},

  abstract = {The core principle of Variational Inference (VI) is to convert the statistical inference problem of computing complex posterior probability densities into a tractable optimization problem. This property enables VI to be faster than several sampling-based techniques. However, the traditional VI algorithm is not scalable to large data sets and is unable to readily infer out-of-bounds data points without re-running the optimization process. Recent developments in the field, like stochastic-, black box- and amortized-VI, have helped address these issues. Generative modeling tasks nowadays widely make use of amortized VI for its efficiency and scalability, as it utilizes a parameterized function to learn the approximate posterior density parameters. With this paper, we review the mathematical foundations of various VI techniques to form the basis for understanding amortized VI. Additionally, we provide an overview of the recent trends that address several issues of amortized VI, such as the amortization gap, generalization issues, inconsistent representation learning, and posterior collapse. Finally, we analyze alternate divergence measures that improve VI optimization.},

We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from O(n\^3) to O(n\^2). Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

  abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of modern machine learning. Sometimes, there are many different potential gradient estimators that can be used. When so, choosing the one with the best tradeoff between cost and variance is important. This paper analyzes the convergence rates of SGD as a function of time, rather than iterations. This results in a simple rule to select the estimator that leads to the best optimization convergence guarantee. This choice is the same for different variants of SGD, and with different assumptions about the objective (e.g. convexity or smoothness). Inspired by this principle, we propose a technique to automatically select an estimator when a finite pool of estimators is given. Then, we extend to infinite pools of estimators, where each one is indexed by control variate weights. Empirically, automatically choosing an estimator performs comparably to the best estimator chosen with hindsight.},

  abstract = {Variational inference is increasingly being addressed with stochastic optimization. In this setting, the gradient's variance plays a crucial role in the optimization procedure, since high variance gradients lead to poor convergence. A popular approach used to reduce gradient's variance involves the use of control variates. Despite the good results obtained, control variates developed for variational inference are typically looked at in isolation. In this paper we clarify the large number of control variates that are available by giving a systematic view of how they are derived. We also present a Bayesian risk minimization framework in which the quality of a procedure for combining control variates is quantified by its effect on optimization convergence rates, which leads to a very simple combination rule. Results show that combining a large number of control variates this way significantly improves the convergence of inference over using the typical gradient estimators or a reduced number of control variates.},

In this perspective we seek to distil how many of deep learning's problem can be seen as different symptoms of the same underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in Comparative Psychology, Education and Linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the lab to real-world applications.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to \$\textbackslash infty\$. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

Different variants of momentum, including heavy-ball momentum, Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG), and quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM), have demonstrated success on various tasks. Despite these empirical successes, there is a lack of clear understanding of how the momentum parameters affect convergence and various performance measures of different algorithms. In this paper, we use the general formulation of QHM to give a unified analysis of several popular algorithms, covering their asymptotic convergence conditions, stability regions, and properties of their stationary distributions. In addition, by combining the results on convergence rates and stationary distributions, we obtain sometimes counter-intuitive practical guidelines for setting the learning rate and momentum parameters.},

We show that our framework includes methods with and without the following tricks, and their combinations: variance reduction, importance sampling, mini-batch sampling, quantization, and coordinate sub-sampling.  As a by-product, we obtain the first unified theory of SGD and randomized coordinate descent (RCD) methods,  the first unified theory of variance reduced and non-variance-reduced SGD methods, and the first unified theory of quantized and non-quantized methods. A key to our approach is a parametric assumption on the iterates and stochastic gradients. In a single theorem we establish a linear convergence result under this assumption and strong-quasi convexity of the loss function. Whenever we recover an existing method as a special case, our theorem gives the best known complexity result. Our approach can be  used to motivate the development of new useful methods, and offers pre-proved convergence guarantees. To illustrate the strength of our approach, we develop five new variants of SGD, and through numerical experiments demonstrate some of their properties.},

The reasoning is sound: a reduction in variance due to more rapid sampling can outweigh the bias introduced.  However, the inexactness creates new challenges for sampler and parameter selection, since standard measures of sample quality like effective sample size do not account for asymptotic bias.  To address these challenges, we introduce a new computable quality measure based on Stein's method that bounds the discrepancy between sample and target expectations over a large class of test functions.  We use our tool to compare exact, biased, and deterministic sample sequences and illustrate applications to hyperparameter selection, convergence rate assessment, and quantifying bias-variance tradeoffs in posterior inference.},

This is the first time such an analysis is performed, and most of our variants of SGD were never explicitly considered in the literature before. Our analysis relies on the recently introduced notion of expected smoothness and does not rely on a uniform bound on the variance of the stochastic gradients. By specializing our theorem to different mini-batching strategies, such as sampling with replacement and independent sampling, we derive exact expressions for the stepsize as a function of the mini-batch size. With this we can also determine the mini-batch size that optimizes the total complexity, and show explicitly that as the variance of the stochastic gradient evaluated at the minimum grows, so does the optimal mini-batch size. For zero variance, the optimal mini-batch size is one. Moreover, we prove insightful stepsize-switching rules which describe when one should switch from a constant to a decreasing stepsize regime.},

Yet, the standard convergence theory for SGD in the smooth non-convex setting gives a slow sublinear convergence to a stationary point. In this work, we provide several convergence theorems for SGD showing convergence to a global minimum for non-convex problems satisfying some extra structural assumptions. In particular, we focus on two large classes of structured non-convex functions: (i) Quasar (Strongly) Convex functions (a generalization of convex functions) and (ii) functions satisfying the Polyak-\L ojasiewicz condition (a generalization of strongly-convex functions). Our analysis relies on an Expected Residual condition which we show is a strictly weaker assumption than previously used growth conditions, expected smoothness or bounded variance assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of SGD for different step-size selections including constant, decreasing and the recently proposed stochastic Polyak step-size. In addition, all of our analysis holds for the arbitrary sampling paradigm, and as such, we give insights into the complexity of minibatching and determine an optimal minibatch size. Finally, we show that for models that interpolate the training data, we can dispense of our Expected Residual condition and give state-of-the-art results in this setting.},

  abstract = {We develop a new family of variance reduced stochastic gradient descent methods for minimizing the average of a very large number of smooth functions. Our method\textemdash JacSketch\textemdash is motivated by novel developments in randomized numerical linear algebra, and operates by maintaining a stochastic estimate of a Jacobian matrix composed of the gradients of individual functions. In each iteration, JacSketch efficiently updates the Jacobian matrix by first obtaining a random linear measurement of the true Jacobian through (cheap) sketching, and then projecting the previous estimate onto the solution space of a linear matrix equation whose solutions are consistent with the measurement. The Jacobian estimate is then used to compute a variance-reduced unbiased estimator of the gradient. Our strategy is analogous to the way quasi-Newton methods maintain an estimate of the Hessian, and hence our method can be seen as a stochastic quasi-gradient method. Our method can also be seen as stochastic gradient descent applied to a controlled stochastic optimization reformulation of the original problem, where the control comes from the Jacobian estimates. We prove that for smooth and strongly convex functions, JacSketch converges linearly with a meaningful rate dictated by a single convergence theorem which applies to general sketches. We also provide a refined convergence theorem which applies to a smaller class of sketches, featuring a novel proof technique based on a stochastic Lyapunov function. This enables us to obtain sharper complexity results for variants of JacSketch with importance sampling. By specializing our general approach to specific sketching strategies, JacSketch reduces to the celebrated stochastic average gradient (SAGA) method, and its several existing and many new minibatch, reduced memory, and importance sampling variants. Our rate for SAGA with importance sampling is the current best-known rate for this method, resolving a conjecture by Schmidt~et~al. (Proceedings of the eighteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, AISTATS 2015, San Diego, California, 2015). The rates we obtain for minibatch SAGA are also superior to existing rates and are sufficiently tight as to show a decrease in total complexity as the minibatch size increases. Moreover, we obtain the first minibatch SAGA method with importance sampling.},

  abstract = {Deep learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets. However, larger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede research and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers. Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192 on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using commodity hardware, our implementation achieves \textasciitilde 90\% scaling efficiency when moving from 8 to 256 GPUs. Our findings enable training visual recognition models on internet-scale data with high efficiency.},

As an alternative to careful off-line tuning of state-dependent proposals, the basic algorithm can be modified so that, on rejection, a second attempt to move is made. A different proposal can be generated from a new distribution that is allowed to depend on the previously rejected proposal. We generalise this idea of delaying the rejection and adapting the proposal distribution, due to Tierney \&amp; Mira (1999), to generate a more flexible class of methods that applies in particular to a variable-dimension setting. The approach is illustrated by two pedagogical examples and a more realistic application to a changepoints analysis for point processes.},

  abstract = {By facilitating the generation of samples from arbitrary probability distributions, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is, arguably, \textbackslash emph\{the\} tool for the evaluation of Bayesian inference problems that yield non-standard posterior distributions. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers have the potential to outperform MCMC in a number of ways. SMC samplers are better suited to highly parallel computing architectures and also feature various tuning parameters that are not available to MCMC. One such parameter - the `L-kernel' - is a user-defined probability distribution that can be used to influence the efficiency of the sampler. In the current paper, the authors explain how to derive an expression for the L-kernel that minimises the variance of the estimates realised by an SMC sampler. Various approximation methods are then proposed to aid implementation of the proposed L-kernel. The improved performance of the resulting algorithm is demonstrated in multiple scenarios. For the examples shown in the current paper, the use of an approximately optimum L-kernel has reduced the variance of the SMC estimates by up to 99 \% while also reducing the number of times that resampling was required by between 65 \% and 70 \%.

  abstract = {Modern sensor technologies, especially in biomedicine, produce increasingly detailed and informative image ensembles, many extremely complex. It will be argued that pattern theory can supply mathematical representations of subject-matter knowledge that can be used as a basis for algorithmic `understanding' of such pictures. After a brief survey of the basic principles of pattern theory we shall illustrate them by an application to a concrete situation: high magnification (greater than 15 000 \texttimes ) electron micrographs of cardiac muscle cells. The aim is to build algorithms for automatic hypothesis formation concerning the number, location, orientation and shape of mitochondria and membranes. For this we construct a pattern theoretic model in the form of a prior probability measure on the space of configurations describing these hypotheses. This measure is synthesized by solving sequentially a jump-diffusion equation of generalized Langevin form. The jumps occur for the creation-annihilation of hypotheses, corresponding to a jump from one continuum to another in configuration (hypothesis) space. These continua (subhypotheses) are expressed in terms of products of low dimensional Lie groups acting on the generators of a template. We use a modified Bayes approach to obtain the hypothesis formation, also organized by solving a generalized Langevin equation. To justify this it is shown that the resulting jump-diffusion process is ergodic so that the solution converges to the desired probability measure. To speed up the convergence we reduce the computation of the drift term in the stochastic differential equation analytically to a curvilinear integral, with the random term computed almost instantaneously. The algorithms thus obtained are implemented, both for mitochondria and membranes, on a 4000 processor parallel machine. Photographs of the graphics illustrate how automatic hypothesis formation is achieved. This approach is applied to deformable neuroanatomical atlases and tracking recognition from narrow band and high resolution sensor arrays.}

The current model suffers from the pathology that it tends to produce invalid molecular structures. By reformulating the search procedure as a constrained Bayesian optimization problem, we showcase improvements in both the validity and quality of the generated molecules. We demonstrate that the model consistently produces novel molecules ranking above the 90th percentile of the distribution over training set scores across a range of objective functions. Importantly, our method suffers no degradation in the complexity or the diversity of the generated molecules.},

There are still some mysteries about Adam that have not been unraveled. This paper provides a novel non-convex analysis of Adam and its many variants to uncover some of these mysteries. Our analysis exhibits that an increasing or large enough "momentum" parameter for the first-order moment used in practice is sufficient to ensure Adam and its many variants converge under a mild boundness condition on the adaptive scaling factor of the step size. In contrast, the original problematic analysis of Adam uses a momentum parameter that decreases to zero, which is the key reason that makes it diverge on some problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the gap between analysis and practice is bridged. Our analysis also exhibits more insights for practical implementations of Adam, e.g., increasing the momentum parameter in a stage-wise manner in accordance with stagewise decreasing step size would help improve the convergence. Our analysis of the Adam family is modular such that it can be (has been) extended to solving other optimization problems, e.g., compositional, min-max and bi-level problems. As an interesting yet non-trivial use case, we present an extension for solving non-convex min-max optimization in order to address a gap in the literature that either requires a large batch or has double loops. Our empirical studies corroborate the theory and also demonstrate the effectiveness in solving min-max problems.},

The key advantage of this approach is that it uses a suite of strategies to balance exploration and exploitation and thus can efficiently handle the optimisation of a variety of functions with small to large number of local extrema. Another advantage is that it automatically determines the batch size within a specified budget avoiding unnecessary function evaluations. Theoretical analysis shows that the regret not only reduces sub-linearly but also by an additional reduction factor determined by the batch size. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by optimising a variety of benchmark functions, performing hyperparameter tuning of support vector regression and classification, and finally heat treatment process of an Al-Sc alloy. Comparisons with recent baseline algorithms confirm the usefulness of our algorithm.}

In this article, we develop a novel specification for a general class of prior distributions, called Information Matrix (IM) priors, for high-dimensional generalized linear models. The priors are first developed for settings in which p {$<$} n, and then extended to the p {$>$} n case by defining a ridge parameter in the prior construction, leading to the Information Matrix Ridge (IMR) prior. The IM and IMR priors are based on a broad generalization of Zellner's g-prior for Gaussian linear models. Various theoretical properties of the prior and implied posterior are derived including existence of the prior and posterior moment generating functions, tail behavior, as well as connections to Gaussian priors and Jeffreys' prior. Several simulation studies and an application to a nucleosomal positioning data set demonstrate its advantages over Gaussian, as well as g-priors, in high dimensional settings.},

However, the standard SVGD requires calculating the gradient of the target density and cannot be applied when the gradient is unavailable. In this work, we develop a gradient-free variant of SVGD (GF-SVGD), which replaces the true gradient with a surrogate gradient, and corrects the introduced bias by re-weighting the gradients in a proper form. We show that our GF-SVGD can be viewed as the standard SVGD with a special choice of kernel, and hence directly inherits all the theoretical properties of SVGD. We shed insights on the empirical choice of the surrogate gradient and further, propose an annealed GF-SVGD that consistently outperforms a number of recent advanced gradient-free MCMC methods in our empirical studies.}

The new method estimates the DOA of wideband signal sources based on squared test of orthogonality of projected subspaces (Squared TOPS) which is an improved method of TOPS. TOPS and Squared TOPS use the signal and noise subspaces of multiple frequency components of wideband signal sources. Although coherent wideband method, such as coherent signal subspace method (CSSM), performs high DOA estimation accuracy, it requires the initial estimate of signal source directions. On the other hand, TOPS and Squared TOPS can provide good performance of DOA estimation without the initial value of signal sources; however, some false peaks appear in spatial spectrum based on these methods. The proposed method, called weighted Squared TOPS (WS-TOPS), uses the modified squared matrix and selective weighted averaging process to improve DOA estimation performance. The performance of WS-TOPS is compared with those of TOPS, Squared TOPS, incoherent MUSIC, and test of orthogonality of frequency spaces (TOFS) through computer simulations. The simulation results show that WS-TOPS can suppress all false peaks in spatial spectrum and improve DOA estimation accuracy and also keep the same resolution performance as Squared TOPS.},

  abstract = {The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular combination of deep latent variable model and accompanying variational learning technique. By using a neural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as "posterior collapse" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse occurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work. Empirically, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines on text and image benchmarks in terms of held-out likelihood, and is competitive with more complex techniques for avoiding collapse while being substantially faster.},

  abstract = {Black-box alpha (BB-{$\alpha$}) is a new approximate inference method based on the minimization of {$\alpha$}-divergences. BB-{$\alpha$}scales to large datasets because it can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent. BB-{$\alpha$}can be applied to complex probabilistic models with little effort since it only requires as input the likelihood function and its gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained using automatic differentiation. By changing the divergence parameter {$\alpha$}, the method is able to interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) ({$\alpha\rightarrow$}0) and an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP) ({$\alpha$}= 1). Experiments on probit regression and neural network regression and classification problems show that BB-{$\alpha$}with non-standard settings of {$\alpha$}, such as {$\alpha$}= 0.5, usually produces better predictions than with {$\alpha\rightarrow$}0 (VB) or {$\alpha$}= 1 (EP).},

This substantially decreases training time and also allows for construction of deep networks with many sorts of learners, including networks whose layers are defined by functions that are not easily differentiated, like decision trees. The main idea is that layers can be trained one at a time, and once they are trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create a new learning problem. The process is repeated, transforming the data through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new data set, which is expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve good performance. We call this forward thinking and demonstrate a proof of concept by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the MNIST dataset for convolutional neural networks. We also provide a general mathematical formulation of forward thinking that allows for other types of deep learning problems to be considered.},

A flat minimum is a large connected region in weight space where the error remains approximately constant. An MDL-based, Bayesian argument suggests that flat minima correspond to ``simple'' networks and low expected overfitting. The argument is based on a Gibbs algorithm variant and a novel way of splitting generalization error into underfitting and overfitting error. Unlike many previous approaches, ours does not require gaussian assumptions and does not depend on a ``good'' weight prior. Instead we have a prior over input output functions, thus taking into account net architecture and training set. Although our algorithm requires the computation of second-order derivatives, it has backpropagation's order of complexity. Automatically, it effectively prunes units, weights, and input lines. Various experiments with feedforward and recurrent nets are described. In an application to stock market prediction, flat minimum search outperforms conventional backprop, weight decay, and ``optimal brain surgeon/optimal brain damage.''},

In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think. In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow. This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to the Markov chain not having burned in) may track that of VI (due to the optimizer not having converged), up to differences due to VI's asymptotic bias and parameterization. Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and their momentum-accelerated counterparts) do evolve similarly. This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it's far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become a go-to family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, in part because we have good procedures for automatically tuning its parameters. Much less attention has been paid to automatic tuning of generalized HMC (GHMC), in which the auxiliary momentum vector is partially updated frequently instead of being completely resampled infrequently. Since GHMC spreads progress over many iterations, it is not straightforward to tune GHMC based on quantities typically used to tune HMC such as average acceptance rate and squared jumped distance. In this work, we propose an ensemble-chain adaptation (ECA) algorithm for GHMC that automatically selects values for all of GHMC's tunable parameters each iteration based on statistics collected from a population of many chains. This algorithm is designed to make good use of SIMD hardware accelerators such as GPUs, allowing most chains to be updated in parallel each iteration. Unlike typical adaptive-MCMC algorithms, our ECA algorithm does not perturb the chain's stationary distribution, and therefore does not need to be ``frozen'' after warmup. Empirically, we find that the proposed algorithm quickly converges to its stationary distribution, producing accurate estimates of posterior expectations with relatively few gradient evaluations per chain.},

Our first method (StoPS) is based on the classical Polyak step size (Polyak, 1987) and is an extension of the recent development of this method for the stochastic optimization-SPS (Loizou et al., 2021), and our second method, denoted GraDS, rescales step size by "diversity of stochastic gradients". We provide a theoretical analysis of these methods for strongly convex smooth functions and show they enjoy deterministic-like rates despite stochastic gradients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the theoretical superiority of our adaptive methods on quadratic objectives. Unfortunately, both StoPS and GraDS depend on unknown quantities, which are only practical for the overparametrized models. To remedy this, we drop this undesired dependence and redefine StoPS and GraDS to StoP and GraD, respectively. We show that these new methods converge linearly to the neighbourhood of the optimal solution under the same assumptions. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical claims by experimental validation, which reveals that GraD is particularly useful for deep learning optimization.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the Variational Inference (VI) used for training Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) in the overparameterized regime, i.e., when the number of neurons tends to infinity. More specifically, we consider overparameterized two-layer BNN and point out a critical issue in the mean-field VI training. This problem arises from the decomposition of the lower bound on the evidence (ELBO) into two terms: one corresponding to the likelihood function of the model and the second to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the prior distribution and the variational posterior. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that there is a trade-off between these two terms in the overparameterized regime only when the KL is appropriately re-scaled with respect to the ratio between the the number of observations and neurons. We also illustrate our theoretical results with numerical experiments that highlight the critical choice of this ratio.},

In this paper, we present two truncation-free variational algorithms, one for mix-membership inference called TFVB (truncation-free variational Bayes), and the other for hard clustering inference called TFME (truncation-free maximization expectation). With these algorithms, we further developed a streaming learning framework for the popular Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models. Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our framework in both synthetic and real-world data.},

However, scaling Bayesian inference techniques to deep neural networks is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space. In this paper, we construct low-dimensional subspaces of parameter space, such as the first principal components of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectory, which contain diverse sets of high performing models. In these subspaces, we are able to apply elliptical slice sampling and variational inference, which struggle in the full parameter space. We show that Bayesian model averaging over the induced posterior in these subspaces produces accurate predictions and well calibrated predictive uncertainty for both regression and image classification.},

  abstract = {The posterior over Bayesian neural network (BNN) parameters is extremely high-dimensional and non-convex. For computational reasons, researchers approximate this posterior using inexpensive mini-batch methods such as mean-field variational inference or stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC). To investigate foundational questions in Bayesian deep learning, we instead use full batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on modern architectures. We show that (1) BNNs can achieve significant performance gains over standard training and deep ensembles; (2) a single long HMC chain can provide a comparable representation of the posterior to multiple shorter chains; (3) in contrast to recent studies, we find posterior tempering is not needed for near-optimal performance, with little evidence for a ``cold posterior'' effect, which we show is largely an artifact of data augmentation; (4) BMA performance is robust to the choice of prior scale, and relatively similar for diagonal Gaussian, mixture of Gaussian, and logistic priors; (5) Bayesian neural networks show surprisingly poor generalization under domain shift; (6) while cheaper alternatives such as deep ensembles and SGMCMC can provide good generalization, their predictive distributions are distinct from HMC. Notably, deep ensemble predictive distributions are similarly close to HMC as standard SGLD, and closer than standard variational inference.},

  abstract = {Many machine learning applications are based on data collected from people, such as their tastes and behaviour as well as biological traits and genetic data. Regardless of how important the application might be, one has to make sure individuals' identities or the privacy of the data are not compromised in the analysis. Differential privacy constitutes a powerful framework that prevents breaching of data subject privacy from the output of a computation. Differentially private versions of many important Bayesian inference methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of an efficient unified approach applicable to arbitrary models. In this contribution, we propose a differentially private variational inference method with a very wide applicability. It is built on top of doubly stochastic variational inference, a recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of models. We add differential privacy into doubly stochastic variational inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the method can reach an accuracy close to non-private level under reasonably strong privacy guarantees, clearly improving over previous sampling-based alternatives especially in the strong privacy regime.},

Rosenthal, showed the derivation of a simple MCMC confidence interval using only Chebyshev's inequality, not CLT. That result required certain assumptions about how the estimator bias and variance grow with the number of iterations \$n\$. In particular, the bias is \$o(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$. This assumption seemed mild. It is generally believed that the estimator bias will be \$O(1/n)\$ and hence \$o(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$. However, questions were raised by researchers about how to verify this assumption. Indeed, we show that this assumption might not always hold. In this paper, we seek to simplify and weaken the assumptions in the previously mentioned paper, to make MCMC confidence intervals without CLTs more widely applicable.},

However, recent works have established pessimistic worst-case complexities for this class functions, which is in stark contrast with their superior performance in real-world applications (e.g. training deep neural networks). On the other hand, it is found that many popular non-convex optimization problems enjoy certain structured properties which bear some similarities to convexity. In this paper, we study the class of \textbackslash textit\{quasar-convex functions\} to close the gap between theory and practice. We study the convergence of first order methods in a variety of different settings and under different optimality criterions. We prove complexity upper bounds that are similar to standard results established for convex functions and much better that state-of-the-art convergence rates of non-convex functions. Overall, this paper suggests that \textbackslash textit\{quasar-convexity\} allows efficient optimization procedures, and we are looking forward to seeing more problems that demonstrate similar properties in practice.},

This has motivated the search for MCMC variants that scale well to large datasets. One general approach has been to look at only a subsample of the data at every step. In this note, we point out that well-known MCMC convergence results often imply that these "subsampling" MCMC algorithms cannot greatly improve performance. We apply these generic results to realistic statistical problems and proposed algorithms, and also discuss some design principles suggested by the results.},

It is common to control computation time by making approximations to the Markov transition kernel. Comparatively little attention has been paid to computational optimality in these approximating Markov Chains, or when such approximations are justified relative to obtaining shorter paths from the exact kernel. We give simple, sharp bounds for uniform approximations of uniformly mixing Markov chains. We then suggest a notion of optimality that incorporates computation time and approximation error, and use our bounds to make generalizations about properties of good approximations in the uniformly mixing setting. The relevance of these properties is demonstrated in applications to a minibatching-based approximate MCMC algorithm for large \$n\$ logistic regression and low-rank approximations for Gaussian processes.},

  abstract = {Emerging workloads, such as graph processing and machine learning are approximate because of the scale of data involved and the stochastic nature of the underlying algorithms. These algorithms are often distributed over multiple machines using bulk-synchronous processing (BSP) or other synchronous processing paradigms such as map-reduce. However, data parallel processing primitives such as repeated barrier and reduce operations introduce high synchronization overheads. Hence, many existing data-processing platforms use asynchrony and staleness to improve data-parallel job performance. Often, these systems simply change the synchronous communication to asynchronous between the worker nodes in the cluster. This improves the throughput of data processing but results in poor accuracy of the final output since different workers may progress at different speeds and process inconsistent intermediate outputs. In this paper, we present ASAP, a model that provides asynchronous and approximate processing semantics for data-parallel computation. ASAP provides fine-grained worker synchronization using NOTIFY-ACK semantics that allows independent workers to run asynchronously. ASAP also provides stochastic reduce that provides approximate but guaranteed convergence to the same result as an aggregated all-reduce. In our results, we show that ASAP can reduce synchronization costs and provides 2-10X speedups in convergence and up to 10X savings in network costs for distributed machine learning applications and provides strong convergence guarantees.},

  abstract = {Simulating the dynamics of ions near polarizable nanoparticles (NPs) using coarse-grained models is extremely challenging due to the need to solve the Poisson equation at every simulation timestep. Recently, a molecular dynamics (MD) method based on a dynamical optimization framework bypassed this obstacle by representing the polarization charge density as virtual dynamic variables and evolving them in parallel with the physical dynamics of ions. We highlight the computational gains accessible with the integration of machine learning (ML) methods for parameter prediction in MD simulations by demonstrating how they were realized in MD simulations of ions near polarizable NPs. An artificial neural network\textendash based regression model was integrated with MD simulation and predicted the optimal simulation timestep and optimization parameters characterizing the virtual system with 94.3\% success. The ML-enabled auto-tuning of parameters generated accurate dynamics of ions for {$\approx$} 10 million steps while improving the stability of the simulation by over an order of magnitude. The integration of ML-enhanced framework with hybrid Open Multi-Processing / Message Passing Interface (OpenMP/MPI) parallelization techniques reduced the computational time of simulating systems with thousands of ions and induced charges from thousands of hours to tens of hours, yielding a maximum speedup of {$\approx$} 3 from ML-only acceleration and a maximum speedup of {$\approx$} 600 from the combination of ML and parallel computing methods. Extraction of ionic structure in concentrated electrolytes near oil\textendash water emulsions demonstrates the success of the method. The approach can be generalized to select optimal parameters in other MD applications and energy minimization problems.},

Specifically, these models separate a given image into its structure and texture layers by utilizing non-gradient based definitions for edges or special measures that distinguish edges from oscillations. In this study, we propose an alternative yet simple image smoothing approach which depends on covariance matrices of simple image features, aka the region covariances. The use of second order statistics as a patch descriptor allows us to implicitly capture local structure and texture information and makes our approach particularly effective for structure extraction from texture. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed approach leads to better image decompositions as compared to the state-of-the-art methods and preserves prominent edges and shading well. Moreover, we also demonstrate the applicability of our approach on some image editing and manipulation tasks such as image abstraction, texture and detail enhancement, image composition, inverse halftoning and seam carving.},

In this work, we show that this much-older Polyak-\L ojasiewicz (PL) inequality is actually weaker than the main conditions that have been explored to show linear convergence rates without strong convexity over the last 25 years. We also use the PL inequality to give new analyses of coordinate descent and stochastic gradient for many non-strongly-convex (and some non-convex) functions. We further propose a generalization that applies to proximal-gradient methods for non-smooth optimization, leading to simple proofs of linear convergence for support vector machines and L1-regularized least squares without additional assumptions.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: \textbullet{} From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. \textbullet{} Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. \textbullet{} Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. \textbullet{} In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. \textbullet{} The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. \textbullet{} When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. \textbullet{} Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. \textbullet{} It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say \$32\$-\$512\$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

We revisit the analysis of SGD in the nonconvex setting and propose a new variant of the recently introduced expected smoothness assumption which governs the behaviour of the second moment of the stochastic gradient. We show that our assumption is both more general and more reasonable than assumptions made in all prior work. Moreover, our results yield the optimal \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash varepsilon\^\{-4\})\$ rate for finding a stationary point of nonconvex smooth functions, and recover the optimal \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash varepsilon\^\{-1\})\$ rate for finding a global solution if the Polyak-\{\textbackslash L\}ojasiewicz condition is satisfied. We compare against convergence rates under convexity and prove a theorem on the convergence of SGD under Quadratic Functional Growth and convexity, which might be of independent interest. Moreover, we perform our analysis in a framework which allows for a detailed study of the effects of a wide array of sampling strategies and minibatch sizes for finite-sum optimization problems. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments on real and synthetic data.},

Moreover, deep beamformers are versatile in that image post-processing algorithms can be combined with the beamforming. Unfortunately, in the current technology, a separate beamformer should be trained and stored for each application, demanding significant scanner resources. To address this problem, here we propose a \{\textbackslash em switchable\} deep beamformer that can produce various types of output such as DAS, speckle removal, deconvolution, etc., using a single network with a simple switch. In particular, the switch is implemented through Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layers, so that various output can be generated by merely changing the AdaIN code. Experimental results using B-mode focused ultrasound confirm the flexibility and efficacy of the proposed methods for various applications.},

However, manually parallelizing all loops may result in degrading parallel performance, as some of them cannot scale desirably to a large number of threads. In addition, the overheads of manually tuning loop parameters might prevent an application from reaching its maximum parallel performance. We illustrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to address these challenges. In this research, we develop a framework that is able to automatically capture the static and dynamic information of a loop. Moreover, we advocate a novel method by introducing HPX smart executors for determining the execution policy, chunk size, and prefetching distance of an HPX loop to achieve higher possible performance by feeding static information captured during compilation and runtime-based dynamic information to our learning model. Our evaluated execution results show that using these smart executors can speed up the HPX execution process by around 12\%-35\% for the Matrix Multiplication, Stream and \$2D\$ Stencil benchmarks compared to setting their HPX loop's execution policy/parameters manually or using HPX auto-parallelization techniques.},

Methods               The modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence was used to acquire multiple inversion time (TI) images for pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping. The T1 map calculation involved pixel-wise curve fitting based on the T1 relaxation model. A variety of methods were evaluated using data from 30 subjects for computational efficiency: MRmap, python Levenberg\textendash Marquardt (LM), python reduced-dimension (RD) non-linear least square, C++ single- and multi-core LM, and C++ single- and multi-core RD.                                         Results               Median (interquartile range) computation time was 126~s (98\textendash 141) for the publicly available software MRmap, 261~s (249\textendash 282) for python LM, 77~s (74\textendash 80) for python RD, 3.4~s (3.1\textendash 3.6) for C++ multi-core LM, and 1.9~s (1.9\textendash 2.0) for C++ multi-core RD. The fastest C++ multi-core RD and the publicly available MRmap showed good agreement of myocardial T1 values, resulting in 95\% Bland\textendash Altman limits of agreement of (-\,0.83 to 0.58~ms) and (-\,6.57 to 7.36~ms) with mean differences of -\,0.13~ms and 0.39~ms, for the pre- and post-contrast, respectively.                                         Conclusion               The C++ multi-core RD was the fastest method on a regular eight-core personal computer for pre- or post-contrast T1 map calculation. The presented software tool (fT1fit) facilitated rapid T1 map and extracellular volume fraction map calculations.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Our inspiration is the representation of Bayes' rule as infinite-dimensional optimization (Csiszar, 1975; Donsker and Varadhan, 1975; Zellner, 1988). Equipped with this perspective, we study Bayesian inference when one does not have access to (1) well-specified priors, (2) well-specified likelihoods, (3) infinite computing power. While these three assumptions underlie the standard Bayesian paradigm, they are typically inappropriate for modern Machine Learning applications. We propose addressing this through an optimization-centric generalization of Bayesian posteriors that we call the Rule of Three (RoT). The RoT can be justified axiomatically and recovers Bayesian, PAC-Bayesian and VI posteriors as special cases. While the RoT is primarily a conceptual and theoretical device, it also encompasses a novel sub-class of tractable posteriors which we call Generalized Variational Inference (GVI) posteriors. Just as the RoT, GVI posteriors are specified by three arguments: a loss, a divergence and a variational family. They also possess a number of desirable properties, including modularity, Frequentist consistency and an interpretation as approximate ELBO. We explore applications of GVI posteriors, and show that they can be used to improve robustness and posterior marginals on Bayesian Neural Networks and Deep Gaussian Processes.},

  abstract = {Computational design is aimed at supporting automating design processes using computational techniques. However, some classes of design tasks involve criteria that are difficult to handle only with computers. For example, visual design tasks seeking to fulfil aesthetic goals are difficult to handle purely with computers. One promising approach is to leverage human computation; that is, to incorporate human input into the computation process. Crowdsourcing platforms provide a convenient way to integrate such human computation into a working system. In this chapter, we discuss such computational design with crowds in the domain of parameter tweaking tasks in visual design. Parameter tweaking is often performed to maximize the aesthetic quality of designed objects. Computational design powered by crowds can solve this maximization problem by leveraging human computation.

An extended model of the spectral density matrix of the sensor array output for coherent sources (multipath propagation) is introduced. The authors derive an expectation maximization (EM) iteration scheme for distributions belonging to the exponential family and investigate the so-called dual maximum likelihood estimate. The EM procedure is used to compute approximate maximum likelihood and approximate dual maximum likelihood estimates for source locations, signal, and noise spectral parameters.{$<>$}},

The proposed preprocessing consists of adjusting the spatial sampling rate, or spatially resampling the array outputs as a function of temporal frequency so that broadband sources are aligned in the spatial frequency domain. Spatial resampling has the advantage that it can reduce each wideband source in multigroup multiple-source scenarios to essentially a rank-one representation without preliminary estimates or a priori knowledge of the spatial distribution of the sources. Preliminary simulations performed using a well-known digital interpolation method to implement spatial resampling with the MUSIC spectral estimator have yielded promising results.{$<>$}},

The technique performs coherent signal subspace transformation by a set of judiciously constructed beamforming matrices. The beamformers are chosen to transform each of the narrowband array manifold vectors into the one corresponding to the reference frequency, regardless of the actual spatial distribution of the sources. The focused data correlation matrix can thus be obtained without any preliminary DOA estimation or iteration. A simplified version of the beamspace Root-MUSIC algorithm is developed and used in conjunction with the proposed method to efficiently localize multiple wideband sources with a linear, equally spaced array. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the new scheme.{$<>$}},

Unlike the parametrizations classically used in Machine Learning, the parametrizations introduced here are all bijective and are even diffeomorphisms, thus allowing to keep the important properties from a statistical inference point of view, first of all identifiability. This cookbook presents a set of recipes to use to transform a constrained problem into a unconstrained one. For an easy use of parametrizations, this paper is at the same time a cookbook, and a Python package allowing the use of parametrizations with numpy, but also JAX and PyTorch, as well as a high level and expressive interface allowing to easily describe a parametrization to transform a difficult problem of statistical inference into an easier problem addressable with modern optimization tools.},

However, they require grid search to tune parameters (step size and the number of iterations per inner loop) for optimal performance. This work introduces `almost tune-free' SVRG and SARAH schemes equipped with i) Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step sizes; ii) averaging; and, iii) the inner loop length adjusted to the BB step sizes. In particular, SVRG, SARAH, and their BB variants are first reexamined through an `estimate sequence' lens to enable new averaging methods that tighten their convergence rates theoretically, and improve their performance empirically when the step size or the inner loop length is chosen large. Then a simple yet effective means to adjust the number of iterations per inner loop is developed to enhance the merits of the proposed averaging schemes and BB step sizes. Numerical tests corroborate the proposed methods.},

The idea is to initialise MCMC using samples from an approximation network, apply the MCMC operator to improve these samples, and finally use the samples to update the approximation network thereby improving its quality. This provides a new generic framework for approximate inference, allowing us to deploy highly complex, or implicitly defined approximation families with intractable densities, including approximations produced by warping a source of randomness through a deep neural network. Experiments consider image modelling with deep generative models as a challenging test for the method. Deep models trained using amortised MCMC are shown to generate realistic looking samples as well as producing diverse imputations for images with regions of missing pixels.},

Differential privacy provides a principled and rigorous privacy guarantee for machine learning models.

We show that stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) \textendash{} a class of scalable Bayesian posterior sampling algorithms \textendash{} satisfies strong differential privacy, when carefully chosen stepsizes are employed. We develop theory on the performance of the proposed differentially-private SG-MCMC method.

As a direct application, we recover expected and almost sure convergence results of the stochastic gradient method (SGD) and random reshuffling (RR) under more general settings. Moreover, we establish new expected and almost sure convergence results for the stochastic proximal gradient method (prox-SGD) and stochastic model-based methods for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. These applications reveal that our unified theorem provides a plugin-type convergence analysis and strong convergence guarantees for a wide class of stochastic optimization methods.},

However, in practice, such as underwater acoustic ambient noise in shallow water, the ambient noise can be spatially colored, which may severely degrade the performance of DOA estimation. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a DOA estimation method based on sparse Bayesian learning with the modified noise model using acoustic vector hydrophone arrays. Firstly, an applicable linear noise model is established by using the prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) to characterize spatially colored noise and exploiting the excellent performance of the PSWFs in extrapolating band-limited signals to the space domain. Then, using the proposed noise model, an iterative method for sparse spectrum reconstruction is developed under a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework to fit the actual noise field received by the acoustic vector hydrophone array. Finally, a DOA estimation algorithm under the modified noise model is also presented, which has a superior performance under spatially colored noise. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Drastic increases in the mini-batch sizes have lead to key efficiency and scalability gains in recent years. However, progress faces a major roadblock, as models trained with large batches often do not generalize well. Local SGD can offer the same communication vs. computation pattern as mini-batch SGD---thus is as efficient as mini-batch SGD from a systems perspective---but instead of performing a single large-batch update in each round, it performs several local parameter updates sequentially. We extensively study the communication efficiency vs. performance trade-offs associated with local SGD and provide a new variant, called \textbackslash emph\{post-local SGD\}. We show that it significantly improves the generalization performance compared to large-batch training and converges to flatter minima.},

Here we provide a unified almost sure convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), stochastic heavy-ball (SHB), and stochastic Nesterov's accelerated gradient (SNAG) methods.  We show, for the first time, that the almost sure convergence rates obtained for these stochastic gradient methods on strongly convex functions, are arbitrarily close to their optimal convergence rates possible. For non-convex objective functions, we not only show that a weighted average of the squared gradient norms converges to zero almost surely, but also the last iterates of the algorithms. We further provide last-iterate almost sure convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient methods on weakly convex smooth functions, in contrast with most existing results in the literature that only provide convergence in expectation for a weighted average of the iterates.},

  abstract = {Existing analysis of AdaGrad and other adaptive methods for smooth convex optimization is typically for functions with bounded domain diameter. In unconstrained problems, previous works guarantee an asymptotic convergence rate without an explicit constant factor that holds true for the entire function class. Furthermore, in the stochastic setting, only a modified version of AdaGrad, different from the one commonly used in practice, in which the latest gradient is not used to update the stepsize, has been analyzed. Our paper aims at bridging these gaps and developing a deeper understanding of AdaGrad and its variants in the standard setting of smooth convex functions as well as the more general setting of quasar convex functions. First, we demonstrate new techniques to explicitly bound the convergence rate of the vanilla AdaGrad for unconstrained problems in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Second, we propose a variant of AdaGrad for which we can show the convergence of the last iterate, instead of the average iterate. Finally, we give new accelerated adaptive algorithms and their convergence guarantee in the deterministic setting with explicit dependency on the problem parameters, improving upon the asymptotic rate shown in previous works.},

Instead of designing them separately, we unify them into a single computation graph, and evolve its structure starting from low-level primitives. Our layer search algorithm leads to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new normalization-activation layers that go beyond existing design patterns. Several of these layers enjoy the property of being independent from the batch statistics. Our experiments show that EvoNorms not only excel on a variety of image classification models including ResNets, MobileNets and EfficientNets, but also transfer well to Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation and BigGAN for image synthesis, outperforming BatchNorm and GroupNorm based layers by a significant margin in many cases.},

Despite of its empirical advantage over SGD, the role of momentum is still unclear in general since previous analyses on SGDM either provide worse convergence bounds than those of SGD, or assume Lipschitz or quadratic objectives, which fail to hold in practice. Furthermore, the role of dynamic parameters has not been addressed. In this work, we show that SGDM converges as fast as SGD for smooth objectives under both strongly convex and nonconvex settings. We also prove that multistage strategy is beneficial for SGDM compared to using fixed parameters. Finally, we verify these theoretical claims by numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Many machine learning problems optimize an objective that must be measured with noise. The primary method is a first order stochastic gradient descent using one or more Monte Carlo (MC) samples at each step. There are settings where ill-conditioning makes second order methods such as limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) more effective. We study the use of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling for such problems. When MC sampling has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of  O( n -1/2 ) O(n-1/2)  then RQMC has an RMSE of  o( n -1/2 ) o(n-1/2)  that can be close to  O( n -3/2 ) O(n-3/2)  in favorable settings. We prove that improved sampling accuracy translates directly to improved optimization. In our empirical investigations for variational Bayes, using RQMC with stochastic quasi-Newton method greatly speeds up the optimization, and sometimes finds a better parameter value than MC does.},

We explore ParVIs from the perspective of Wasserstein gradient flows, and make both theoretical and practical contributions. We unify various finite-particle approximations that existing ParVIs use, and recognize that the approximation is essentially a compulsory smoothing treatment, in either of two equivalent forms. This novel understanding reveals the assumptions and relations of existing ParVIs, and also inspires new ParVIs. We propose an acceleration framework and a principled bandwidth-selection method for general ParVIs; these are based on the developed theory and leverage the geometry of the Wasserstein space. Experimental results show the improved convergence by the acceleration framework and enhanced sample accuracy by the bandwidth-selection method.}

  abstract = {The application of Bayesian inference for the purpose of model selection is very popular nowadays. In this framework, models are compared through their marginal likelihoods, or their quotients, called Bayes factors. However, marginal likelihoods depends on the prior choice. For model selection, even diffuse priors can be actually very informative, unlike for the parameter estimation problem. Furthermore, when the prior is improper, the marginal likelihood of the corresponding model is undetermined. In this work, we discuss the issue of prior sensitivity of the marginal likelihood and its role in model selection. We also comment on the use of uninformative priors, which are very common choices in practice. Several practical suggestions are discussed and many possible solutions, proposed in the literature, to design objective priors for model selection are described. Some of them also allow the use of improper priors. The connection between the marginal likelihood approach and the well-known information criteria is also presented. We describe the main issues and possible solutions by illustrative numerical examples, providing also some related code. One of them involving a real-world application on exoplanet detection.},

Although computing the Polyak step-size requires knowledge of the optimal function values, this information is readily available for typical modern machine learning applications. Consequently, the proposed stochastic Polyak step-size (SPS) is an attractive choice for setting the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for SGD equipped with SPS in different settings, including strongly convex, convex and non-convex functions. Furthermore, our analysis results in novel convergence guarantees for SGD with a constant step-size. We show that SPS is particularly effective when training over-parameterized models capable of interpolating the training data. In this setting, we prove that SPS enables SGD to converge to the true solution at a fast rate without requiring the knowledge of any problem-dependent constants or additional computational overhead. We experimentally validate our theoretical results via extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. We demonstrate the strong performance of SGD with SPS compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods when training over-parameterized models.},

Most of these approaches were performed on radio frequency (RF) signals. However, inphase/quadrature (I/Q) digital beamformers (IQBF) are now widely used as low-cost strategies. In this work, we leveraged complex convolutional neural networks (CCNNs) for reconstructing ultrasound images from I/Q signals. We recently described a CNN architecture called ID-Net, which exploited an inception layer devoted to the reconstruction of RF diverging-wave (DW) ultrasound images. We derived in this work the complex equivalent of this network, i.e., the complex inception for DW network (CID-Net), operating on I/Q data. We provided experimental evidence that the CID-Net yields the same image quality as that obtained from the RF-trained CNNs; i.e., by using only three I/Q images, the CID-Net produced high-quality images competing with those obtained by coherently compounding 31 RF images. Moreover, we showed that the CID-Net outperforms the straightforward architecture consisting in processing separately the real and imaginary parts of the I/Q signal, indicating thereby the importance of consistently processing the I/Q signals using a network that exploits the complex nature of such signal.},

We explore the respective limitations of two popular DOA methods to solve this problem-the stepwise-concentrated maximum-likelihood (SC-ML) and approximately concentrated maximum-likelihood (AC-ML) algorithms-and design a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In addition, we provide the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the computational-complexity analyses for the aforementioned DOA estimation schemes.

  abstract = {Whitened Neural Network (WNN) is a recent advanced deep architecture, which improves convergence and generalization of canonical neural networks by whitening their internal hidden representation. However, the whitening transformation increases computation time. Unlike WNN that reduced runtime by performing whitening every thousand iterations, which degenerates convergence due to the ill conditioning, we present generalized WNN (GWNN), which has three appealing properties. First, GWNN is able to learn compact representation to reduce computations. Second, it enables whitening transformation to be performed in a short period, preserving good conditioning. Third, we propose a data-independent estimation of the covariance matrix to further improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the benefits of GWNN.}

  abstract = {In this paper we aim to formally explain the phenomenon of fast convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) observed in modern machine learning. The key observation is that most modern learning architectures are over-parametrized and are trained to interpolate the data by driving the empirical loss (classification and regression) close to zero. While it is still unclear why these interpolated solutions perform well on test data, we show that these regimes allow for fast convergence of SGD, comparable in number of iterations to full gradient descent. For convex loss functions we obtain an exponential convergence bound for mini-batch SGD parallel to that for full gradient descent. We show that there is a critical batch size m{${_\ast}$}m{${_\ast}$}m\^* such that: (a) SGD iteration with mini-batch size m{$\leq$}m{${_\ast}$}m{$\leq$}m{${_\ast}$}m\textbackslash leq m\^* is nearly equivalent to mmm iterations of mini-batch size 111 (linear scaling regime). (b) SGD iteration with mini-batch m{$>$}m{${_\ast}$}m{$>$}m{${_\ast}$}m{$>$} m\^* is nearly equivalent to a full gradient descent iteration (saturation regime). Moreover, for the quadratic loss, we derive explicit expressions for the optimal mini-batch and step size and explicitly characterize the two regimes above. The critical mini-batch size can be viewed as the limit for effective mini-batch parallelization. It is also nearly independent of the data size, implying O(n)O(n)O(n) acceleration over GD per unit of computation. We give experimental evidence on real data which closely follows our theoretical analyses. Finally, we show how our results fit in the recent developments in training deep neural networks and discuss connections to adaptive rates for SGD and variance reduction.},

Even though solving non-convex functions is NP-hard in the worst case, the optimization quality in practice is often not an issue -- optimizers are largely believed to find approximate global minima. Researchers hypothesize a unified explanation for this intriguing phenomenon: most of the local minima of the practically-used objectives are approximately global minima.

Indeed, neural networks often have many more parameters than there are data points, yet still provide good generalization performance. Moreover, when we measure generalization as a function of parameters, we see double descent behaviour, where the test error decreases, increases, and then again decreases. We show that many of these properties become understandable when viewed through the lens of effective dimensionality, which measures the dimensionality of the parameter space determined by the data. We relate effective dimensionality to posterior contraction in Bayesian deep learning, model selection, double descent, and functional diversity in loss surfaces, leading to a richer understanding of the interplay between parameters and functions in deep models.},

With SWAG, we fit a Gaussian using the SWA solution as the first moment and a low rank plus diagonal covariance also derived from the SGD iterates, forming an approximate posterior distribution over neural network weights; we then sample from this Gaussian distribution to perform Bayesian model averaging. We empirically find that SWAG approximates the shape of the true posterior, in accordance with results describing the stationary distribution of SGD iterates. Moreover, we demonstrate that SWAG performs well on a wide variety of tasks, including out of sample detection, calibration, and transfer learning, in comparison to many popular alternatives including MC dropout, KFAC Laplace, SGLD, and temperature scaling.},

This paper establishes the convergence rate of a stochastic subgradient method with a momentum term of Polyak type for a broad class of non-smooth, non-convex, and constrained optimization problems. Our key innovation is the construction of a special Lyapunov function for which the proven complexity can be achieved without any tuning of the momentum parameter. For smooth problems, we extend the known complexity bound to the constrained case and demonstrate how the unconstrained case can be analyzed under weaker assumptions than the state-of-the-art. Numerical results confirm our theoretical developments.},

The resulting algorithm, Informed Sub-Sampling MCMC, is a generic and flexible approach which, contrary to existing scalable methodologies, preserves the simplicity of the Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm. Even though exactness is lost, i.e~ the chain distribution approximates the posterior, we study and quantify theoretically this bias and show on a diverse set of examples that it yields excellent performances when the computational budget is limited. If available and cheap to compute, we show that setting the summary statistics as the maximum likelihood estimator is supported by theoretical arguments.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a very popular and generic collection of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. One explanation for the popularity of HMC algorithms is their excellent performance as the dimension \$d\$ of the target becomes large: under conditions that are satisfied for many common statistical models, optimally-tuned HMC algorithms have a running time that scales like \$d\^\{0.25\}\$. In stark contrast, the running time of the usual Random-Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm, optimally tuned, scales like \$d\$. This superior scaling of the HMC algorithm with dimension is attributed to the fact that it, unlike RWM, incorporates the gradient information in the proposal distribution. In this paper, we investigate a different scaling question: does HMC beat RWM for highly \$\textbackslash textit\{multimodal\}\$ targets? We find that the answer is often \$\textbackslash textit\{no\}\$. We compute the spectral gaps for both the algorithms for a specific class of multimodal target densities, and show that they are identical. The key reason is that, within one mode, the gradient is effectively ignorant about other modes, thus negating the advantage the HMC algorithm enjoys in unimodal targets. We also give heuristic arguments suggesting that the above observation may hold quite generally. Our main tool for answering this question is a novel simple formula for the conductance of HMC using Liouville's theorem. This result allows us to compute the spectral gap of HMC algorithms, for both the classical HMC with isotropic momentum and the recent Riemannian HMC, for multimodal targets.},

  abstract = {Inference in the presence of outliers is an important field of research as outliers are ubiquitous and may arise across a variety of problems and domains. Bayesian optimization is method that heavily relies on probabilistic inference. This allows outstanding sample efficiency because the probabilistic machinery provides a memory of the whole optimization process. However, that virtue becomes a disadvantage when the memory is populated with outliers, inducing bias in the estimation. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bayesian optimization methods in the presence of outliers. The empirical evidence shows that Bayesian optimization with robust regression often produces suboptimal results. We then propose a new algorithm which combines robust regression (a Gaussian process with Student-t likelihood) with outlier diagnostics to classify data points as outliers or inliers. By using an scheduler for the classification of outliers, our method is more efficient and has better convergence over the standard robust regression. Furthermore, we show that even in controlled situations with no expected outliers, our method is able to produce better results.},

We provide a computationally efficient gradient estimator for the TVO that applies to continuous, discrete, and non-reparameterizable distributions and show that the objective functions used in variational inference, variational autoencoders, wake sleep, and inference compilation are all special cases of the TVO. We use the TVO to learn both discrete and continuous deep generative models and empirically demonstrate state of the art model and inference network learning.},

In the independence case (in Rk) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of {$\pi$}; in the symmetric case (in R only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if {$\pi$} has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective.}

We seek to build models that `know what they do not know' by introducing inductive biases in the function space. We show that periodic activation functions in Bayesian neural networks establish a connection between the prior on the network weights and translation-invariant, stationary Gaussian process priors. Furthermore, we show that this link goes beyond sinusoidal (Fourier) activations by also covering triangular wave and periodic ReLU activation functions. In a series of experiments, we show that periodic activation functions obtain comparable performance for in-domain data and capture sensitivity to perturbed inputs in deep neural networks for out-of-domain detection.},

  abstract = {While MCMC methods have become a main work-horse for Bayesian inference, scaling them to large distributed datasets is still a challenge. Embarrassingly parallel MCMC strategies take a divide-and-conquer stance to achieve this by writing the target posterior as a product of subposteriors, running MCMC for each of them in parallel and subsequently combining the results. The challenge then lies in devising efficient aggregation strategies. Current strategies trade-off between approximation quality, and costs of communication and computation. In this work, we introduce a novel method that addresses these issues simultaneously. Our key insight is to introduce a deep invertible transformation to approximate each of the subposteriors. These approximations can be made accurate even for complex distributions and serve as intermediate representations, keeping the total communication cost limited. Moreover, they enable us to sample from the product of the subposteriors using an efficient and stable importance sampling scheme. We demonstrate the approach outperforms available state-of-the-art methods in a range of challenging scenarios, including high-dimensional and heterogeneous subposteriors.},

Prior elicitation transforms domain knowledge of various kinds into well-defined prior distributions, and offers a solution to the prior specification problem, in principle. In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We lack elicitation methods that integrate well into the Bayesian workflow and perform elicitation efficiently in terms of costs of time and effort. We even lack a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding different facets of the prior elicitation problem. Why are we not widely using prior elicitation? We analyze the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation, from properties of the modelling task and the nature of the priors to the form of interaction with the expert. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.},

In this view, the difference between mean-field methods and belief propagation is not the amount of structure they model, but only the measure of loss they minimize (`exclusive' versus `inclusive' Kullback-Leibler divergence). In each case, message-passing arises by minimizing a localized version of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking, for example) and their suitability for different tasks. Furthermore, by considering a wider variety of divergence measures (such as alpha-divergences), we can achieve different complexity and performance goals.}

We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.}

  abstract = {A Monte Carlo algorithm typically simulates some prescribed number of samples, taking some random real time to complete the computations necessary. This work considers the converse: to impose a real-time budget on the computation, so that the number of samples simulated is random. To complicate matters, the real time taken for each simulation may depend on the sample produced, so that the samples themselves are not independent of their number, and a length bias with respect to compute time is apparent. This is especially problematic when a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used and the final state of the Markov chain---rather than an average over all states---is required. The length bias does not diminish with the compute budget in this case. It occurs, for example, in sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. We propose an anytime framework to address the concern, using a continuous-time Markov jump process to study the progress of the computation in real time. We show that the length bias can be eliminated for any MCMC algorithm by using a multiple chain construction. The utility of this construction is demonstrated on a large-scale SMC-squared implementation, using four billion particles distributed across a cluster of 128 graphics processing units on the Amazon EC2 service. The anytime framework imposes a real-time budget on the MCMC move steps within SMC-squared, ensuring that all processors are simultaneously ready for the resampling step, demonstrably reducing wait times and providing substantial control over the total compute budget.},

  abstract = {Many probabilistic models introduce strong dependencies between variables using a latent multivariate Gaussian distribution or a Gaussian process. We present a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for performing inference in models with multivariate Gaussian priors. Its key properties are: 1) it has simple, generic code applicable to many models, 2) it has no free parameters, 3) it works well for a variety of Gaussian process based models. These properties make our method ideal for use while model building, removing the need to spend time deriving and tuning updates for more complex algorithms.}

From this point of view, the problem of constructing a sampler can be reduced to the question - how to choose a proposal for the MH algorithm? To address this question, we propose to learn an independent sampler that maximizes the acceptance rate of the MH algorithm, which, as we demonstrate, is highly related to the conventional variational inference. For Bayesian inference, the proposed method compares favorably against alternatives to sample from the posterior distribution. Under the same approach, we step beyond the scope of classical MCMC methods and deduce the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework from scratch, treating the generator as the proposal and the discriminator as the acceptance test. On real-world datasets, we improve Frechet Inception Distance and Inception Score, using different GANs as a proposal distribution for the MH algorithm. In particular, we demonstrate improvements of recently proposed BigGAN model on ImageNet.},

  abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the optimization algorithm of choice in many machine learning applications such as regularized empirical risk minimization and training deep neural networks. The classical convergence analysis of SGD is carried out under the assumption that the norm of the stochastic gradient is uniformly bounded. While this might hold for some loss functions, it is always violated for cases where the objective function is strongly convex. In (Bottou et al.,2016), a new analysis of convergence of SGD is performed under the assumption that stochastic gradients are bounded with respect to the true gradient norm. Here we show that for stochastic problems arising in machine learning such bound always holds; and we also propose an alternative convergence analysis of SGD with diminishing learning rate regime, which results in more relaxed conditions than those in (Bottou et al.,2016). We then move on the asynchronous parallel setting, and prove convergence of Hogwild! algorithm in the same regime, obtaining the first convergence results for this method in the case of diminished learning rate.},

Several researchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called HOGWILD! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then HOGWILD! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that HOGWILD! outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {A novel direction-of-arrival estimation algorithm is proposed that applies to wideband emitter signals. A sensor array with a translation invariance structure is assumed, and an extension of the ESPRIT algorithm for narrowband emitter signals is obtained. The emitter signals are modeled as the stationary output of a finite-dimensional linear system driven by white noise. The array response to a unit impulse from a given direction is represented as the impulse response of a linear system. The measured data from the sensor array can then be seen as the output of a multidimensional linear system driven by white noise sources and corrupted by additive noise. The emitter signals and the array output are characterized by the modes of the linear system. The ESPRIT algorithm is applied at the poles of the system, the power of the signals sharing the pole is captured, and the effect of noise is reduced. The algorithm requires no knowledge, storage, or search of the array manifold, as opposed to wideband extensions of the MUSIC algorithm. This results in a computationally efficient algorithm that is insensitive to array perturbations. Simulations are presented comparing the wideband and ESPRIT algorithm to the modal signal subspace method and the coherent signal subspace method.{$<>$}},

Often the proposal distributions are standard probability distributions whose parameters are adapted based on the mismatch between the current proposal and a target distribution. In this work, we present an implicit adaptive importance sampling method that applies to complicated distributions which are not available in closed form. The method iteratively matches the moments of a set of Monte Carlo draws to weighted moments based on importance weights. We apply the method to Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation and show that it performs better than many existing parametric adaptive importance sampling methods while being computationally inexpensive.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and neural networks are instrumental in tackling inferential and prediction problems. However, Bayesian inference based on joint use of MCMC methods and of neural networks is limited. This paper reviews the main challenges posed by neural networks to MCMC developments, including lack of parameter identifiability due to weight symmetries, prior specification effects, and consequently high computational cost and convergence failure. Population and manifold MCMC algorithms are combined to demonstrate these challenges via multilayer perceptron (MLP) examples and to develop case studies for assessing the capacity of approximate inference methods to uncover the posterior covariance of neural network parameters. Some of these challenges, such as high computational cost arising from the application of neural networks to big data and parameter identifiability arising from weight symmetries, stimulate research towards more scalable approximate MCMC methods or towards MCMC methods in reduced parameter spaces.},

  abstract = {We propose a scalable algorithmic framework for exact Bayesian variable selection and model averaging in linear models under the assumption that the Gram matrix is block-diagonal, and as a heuristic for exploring the model space for general designs. In block-diagonal designs our approach returns the most probable model of any given size without resorting to numerical integration. The algorithm also provides a novel and efficient solution to the frequentist best subset selection problem for block-diagonal designs. Posterior probabilities for any number of models are obtained by evaluating a single one-dimensional integral, and other quantities of interest such as variable inclusion probabilities and model-averaged regression estimates are obtained by an adaptive, deterministic one-dimensional numerical integration. The overall computational cost scales linearly with the number of blocks, which can be processed in parallel, and exponentially with the block size, rendering it most adequate in situations where predictors are organized in many moderately-sized blocks. For general designs, we approximate the Gram matrix by a block-diagonal matrix using spectral clustering and propose an iterative algorithm that capitalizes on the block-diagonal algorithms to explore efficiently the model space. All methods proposed in this paper are implemented in the R library mombf.},

Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) methods have proven to be very successful in supervised learning. However, their adaptation to policy gradient is not straightforward and needs to account for I) a non-concave objective function; II) approximations in the full gradient computation; and III) a non-stationary sampling process. The result is SVRPG, a stochastic variance-reduced policy gradient algorithm that leverages on importance weights to preserve the unbiasedness of the gradient estimate. Under standard assumptions on the MDP, we provide convergence guarantees for SVRPG with a convergence rate that is linear under increasing batch sizes. Finally, we suggest practical variants of SVRPG, and we empirically evaluate them on continuous MDPs.},

However, in practice, its convergence is bottlenecked by slow communication rounds between worker nodes. A natural solution to reduce communication is to use the \textbackslash emph\{`local-SGD'\} model in which the workers train their model independently and synchronize every once in a while. This algorithm improves the computation-communication trade-off but its convergence is not understood very well. We propose a non-asymptotic error analysis, which enables comparison to \textbackslash emph\{one-shot averaging\} i.e., a single communication round among independent workers, and \textbackslash emph\{mini-batch averaging\} i.e., communicating at every step. We also provide adaptive lower bounds on the communication frequency for large step-sizes (\$ t\^\{-\textbackslash alpha\} \$, \$ \textbackslash alpha\textbackslash in (1/2 , 1 ) \$) and show that \textbackslash emph\{Local-SGD\} reduces communication by a factor of \$O\textbackslash Big(\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash sqrt\{T\}\}\{P\^\{3/2\}\}\textbackslash Big)\$, with \$T\$ the total number of gradients and \$P\$ machines.},

  abstract = {In machine learning, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely deployed to train models using highly non-convex objectives with equally complex noise models. Unfortunately, SGD theory often makes restrictive assumptions that fail to capture the non-convexity of real problems, and almost entirely ignore the complex noise models that exist in practice. In this work, we demonstrate the restrictiveness of these assumptions using three canonical models in machine learning, then we develop novel theoretical tools to address this shortcoming in two ways. First, we establish that SGD's iterates will either globally converge to a stationary point or diverge under nearly arbitrary nonconvexity and noise models. Under a slightly more restrictive assumption on the joint behavior of the non-convexity and noise model that generalizes current assumptions in the literature, we show that the objective function cannot diverge, even if the iterates diverge. As a consequence of our results, SGD can be applied to a greater range of stochastic optimization problems with confidence about its global convergence behavior and stability.},

  abstract = {Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a widely deployed optimization procedure throughout data-driven and simulation-driven disciplines, which has drawn a substantial interest in understanding its global behavior across a broad class of nonconvex problems and noise models. Recent analyses of SGD have made noteworthy progress in this direction, and these analyses have innovated important and insightful new strategies for understanding SGD. However, these analyses often have imposed certain restrictions (e.g., convexity, global Lipschitz continuity, uniform Holder continuity, expected smoothness, etc.) that leave room for innovation. In this work, we address this gap by proving that, for a rather general class of nonconvex functions and noise models, SGD's iterates either diverge to infinity or converge to a stationary point with probability one. By further restricting to globally Holder continuous functions and the expected smoothness noise model, we prove that -- regardless of whether the iterates diverge or remain finite -- the norm of the gradient function evaluated at SGD's iterates converges to zero with probability one and in expectation. As a result of our work, we broaden the scope of nonconvex problems and noise models to which SGD can be applied with rigorous guarantees of its global behavior.},

This paper presents a new hybrid design with improved sensitivity, in which the axicon focusing is achieved by two conical mirrors and a PZT 5A disk cut into 8 sectors. We have investigated two methods of processing the signals from the 8 sectors. In the first, phase insensitive sector addition (PISA), the B-scan is formed from the sum of the 8 demodulated signals. In the second, multiplicative processing (MP), the 8 rf waveforms are multiplied and the resultant is demodulated to form the image. Both techniques result in smoothed speckle but degraded lateral resolution. As well, MP decreases the off-axis sensitivity of the system and artifacts characteristic of axicon focusing. Quantitative assessment of the effects of PISA and MP was performed using a new approach called contrast-to-speckle ratio (CSR). The CSR data, which is a measure of the image contrast of cylindrical voids in a random scattering medium relative to contrast fluctuations due to speckle, shows the superiority of PISA and MP. This conclusion is supported by images of in vitro human breast tissue.},

Conversely, the weight priors within these architectures are typically left vague, e.g.\textasciitilde independent Gaussian distributions, which has led to debate over the utility of Bayesian deep learning. This paper explores the benefits of adding structure to weight priors. It initially considers first-layer filters of a convolutional NN, designing a prior based on random Gabor filters. Second, it considers adding structure to the prior of final-layer weights by estimating how each hidden feature relates to each class. Empirical results suggest that these structured weight priors lead to more meaningful functional priors for image data. This contributes to the ongoing discussion on the importance of weight priors.},

The Bayesian framework provides a principled approach to this, however applying it to NNs is challenging due to large numbers of parameters and data. Ensembling NNs provides an easily implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends to have an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However, two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially present in NNs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.},

However, scaling Bayesian inference techniques to deep neural networks is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space. In this paper, we construct low-dimensional subspaces of parameter space, such as the first principal components of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectory, which contain diverse sets of high performing models. In these subspaces, we are able to apply elliptical slice sampling and variational inference, which struggle in the full parameter space. We show that Bayesian model averaging over the induced posterior in these subspaces produces accurate predictions and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty for both regression and image classification.},

However, they generally struggle with underfitting at scale and parameter efficiency. On the other hand, deep ensembles have emerged as alternatives for uncertainty quantification that, while outperforming BNNs on certain problems, also suffer from efficiency issues. It remains unclear how to combine the strengths of these two approaches and remediate their common issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a rank-1 parameterization of BNNs, where each weight matrix involves only a distribution on a rank-1 subspace. We also revisit the use of mixture approximate posteriors to capture multiple modes, where unlike typical mixtures, this approach admits a significantly smaller memory increase (e.g., only a 0.4\% increase for a ResNet-50 mixture of size 10). We perform a systematic empirical study on the choices of prior, variational posterior, and methods to improve training. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, Wide ResNet 28-10 on CIFAR-10/100, and an RNN on MIMIC-III, rank-1 BNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance across log-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration on the test sets and out-of-distribution variants.},

In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think. In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow. This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to the Markov chain not having burned in) may track that of VI (due to the optimizer not having converged), up to differences due to VI's asymptotic bias and parameterization. Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and their momentum-accelerated counterparts) do evolve similarly. This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it's far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).},

By following these rules, you get a method adaptive to the local geometry, with convergence guarantees depending only on the smoothness in a neighborhood of a solution.

As an illustration, it can minimize arbitrary continuously twice-differentiable convex function.

The central assumption is that the underlying objective function cannot be evaluated directly, but instead a minimizer along a projection can be queried, which we call a projective preferential query. The form of the query allows for feedback that is natural for a human to give, and which enables interaction. This is demonstrated in a user experiment in which the user feedback comes in the form of optimal position and orientation of a molecule adsorbing to a surface. We demonstrate that our framework is able to find a global minimum of a high-dimensional black-box function, which is an infeasible task for existing preferential Bayesian optimization frameworks that are based on pairwise comparisons.},

In this paper, we show that the annoying difficulty of obtaining reliable stochastic gradients for the inference model and the drawback of indirectly optimizing the target log-likelihood can be gracefully addressed in a new method based on stochastic approximation (SA) theory of the Robbins-Monro type. Specifically, we propose to directly maximize the target log-likelihood and simultaneously minimize the inclusive divergence between the posterior and the inference model. The resulting learning algorithm is called joint SA (JSA). To the best of our knowledge, JSA represents the first method that couples an SA version of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm (SAEM) with an adaptive MCMC procedure. Experiments on several benchmark generative modeling and structured prediction tasks show that JSA consistently outperforms recent competitive algorithms, with faster convergence, better final likelihoods, and lower variance of gradient estimates.},

Consequently, the proposed stochastic Polyak step-size (SPS) is an attractive choice for setting the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for SGD equipped with SPS in different settings, including strongly convex, convex and non-convex functions. Furthermore, our analysis results in novel convergence guarantees for SGD with a constant step-size. We show that SPS is particularly effective when training over-parameterized models capable of interpolating the training data. In this setting, we prove that SPS enables SGD to converge to the true solution at a fast rate without requiring the knowledge of any problem-dependent constants or additional computational overhead. We experimentally validate our theoretical results via extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. We demonstrate the strong performance of SGD with SPS compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods when training over-parameterized models.},

Instead, we propose to optimize an objective that quantifies directly the speed of convergence to the target distribution. Our objective can be easily optimized using stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate our proposed method and compare to baselines on a variety of problems including sampling from synthetic 2D distributions, reconstructing sparse signals, learning deep latent variable models and sampling molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution of a 22 atom molecule.

In this work we study unbiased methods for alpha-divergence minimization through the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the gradient estimator. We study several representative scenarios where strong analytical results are possible, such as fully-factorized or Gaussian distributions. We find that when alpha is not zero, the SNR worsens exponentially in the dimensionality of the problem. This casts doubt on the practicality of these methods.

In this work we extend the convergence theory of adaptive MCMC methods to a new class of methods built on a powerful class of parametric density estimators known as normalizing flows. In particular, we consider an independent Metropolis-Hastings sampler where the proposal distribution is represented by a normalizing flow whose parameters are updated using stochastic gradient descent.

Its main workhorse is optimization over a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the tail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy. Importance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and de-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality of IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally, the proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely achievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of optimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by constructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational approximation.

In principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have these problems. However, existing Bayesian techniques lack scalability to large dataset and network sizes. In this work we present a novel scalable method for learning Bayesian neural networks, called probabilistic backpropagation (PBP). Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward computation of gradients. A series of experiments on ten real-world datasets show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights.},

In this paper, we identify two key challenges in this endeavour. We tackle these challenges by assuming an additive structure for the function. This setting is substantially more expressive and contains a richer class of functions than previous work. We prove that, for additive functions the regret has only linear dependence on D even though the function depends on all D dimensions. We also demonstrate several other statistical and computational benefits in our framework.

We describe a general way to clamp and update the random numbers used in a pseudo-marginal method's unbiased estimator. In this framework we can use slice sampling and other adaptive methods. We obtain more robust Markov chains, which often mix more quickly.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization has proven invaluable for black-box optimization of expensive functions. Its main limitation is its exponential complexity with respect to the dimensionality of the search space using typical kernels. Luckily, many objective functions can be decomposed into additive subproblems, which can be optimized independently. We investigate how to automatically discover such (typically unknown) additive structure while simultaneously exploiting it through Bayesian optimization. We propose an efficient algorithm based on Metropolis-Hastings sampling and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on synthetic and real-world data sets. Throughout all our experiments we reliably discover hidden additive structure whenever it exists and exploit it to yield significantly faster convergence.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during the last few years as an effective approach to optimize black-box functions where direct queries of the objective are expensive. We consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible, but information about user preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems where human preferences are modeled, such as A/B tests or recommender systems. We present a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) and that allows to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise comparisons, so-called duels. PBO extend the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling the probability of the the winner of each duel by means of Gaussian process model with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We illustrate the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments in which we show how the way correlations are modeled is the key ingredient to drastically reduce the number of comparisons to find the optimum of the latent function of interest.},

We find that our MCMC-based approach has several advantages: it yields higher held-out likelihoods, produces sharper images, and does not suffer from the variational overpruning effect. MCMC's additional computational overhead proves to be significant, but not prohibitive.},

Yet, its performance is greatly variable and heavily depends on the choice of the stepsizes. This has motivated a large body of research on adaptive stepsizes. However, there is currently a gap in our theoretical understanding of these methods, especially in the non-convex setting. In this paper, we start closing this gap: we theoretically analyze in the convex and non-convex settings a generalized version of the AdaGrad stepsizes. We show sufficient conditions for these stepsizes to achieve almost sure asymptotic convergence of the gradients to zero, proving the first guarantee for generalized AdaGrad stepsizes in the non-convex setting. Moreover, we show that these stepsizes allow to automatically adapt to the level of noise of the stochastic gradients in both the convex and non-convex settings, interpolating between O(1/T) and O(1/sqrt(T)), up to logarithmic terms.},

We propose the Scalable Metropolis-Hastings (SMH) kernel that only requires processing on average O(1) or even O(1/n) data points per step. This scheme is based on a combination of factorized acceptance probabilities, procedures for fast simulation of Bernoulli processes, and control variate ideas. Contrary to many MCMC subsampling schemes such as fixed step-size Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, our approach is exact insofar as the invariant distribution is the true posterior and not an approximation to it. We characterise the performance of our algorithm theoretically, and give realistic and verifiable conditions under which it is geometrically ergodic. This theory is borne out by empirical results that demonstrate overall performance benefits over standard Metropolis-Hastings and various subsampling algorithms.},

The VCD captures a notion of discrepancy between the initial variational distribution and its improved version (obtained after running the MCMC steps), and it converges asymptotically to the symmetrized KL divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior of interest. The VCD objective can be optimized efficiently with respect to the variational parameters via stochastic optimization. We show experimentally that optimizing the VCD leads to better predictive performance on two latent variable models: logistic matrix factorization and variational autoencoders (VAEs).},

These restrictions are all essentially relaxed in this work. In particular, we analyze a general SA scheme to minimize a non-convex, smooth objective function. We consider update procedure whose drift term depends on a state-dependent Markov chain and the mean field is not necessarily of gradient type, covering approximate second-order method and allowing asymptotic bias for the one-step updates.

We show that channel-based normalizations (e.g. Layer Normalization and Group Normalization) are unable to guarantee a far distance from elimination singularities, in contrast with Batch Normalization which by design avoids models from getting too close to them. To address this issue, we propose BatchChannel Normalization (BCN), which uses batch knowledge to avoid the elimination singularities in the training of channel-normalized models. Unlike Batch Normalization, BCN is able to run in both large-batch and micro-batch training settings. The effectiveness of BCN is verified on many tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

The micro-batch training setting is hard because small batch sizes are not enough for training networks with Batch Normalization (BN), while other normalization methods that do not rely on batch knowledge still have difficulty matching the performances of BN in large-batch training. Our WS ends this problem because when used with Group Normalization and trained with 1 image/GPU, WS is able to match or outperform the performances of BN trained with large batch sizes with only 2 more lines of code. In micro-batch training, WS significantly outperforms other normalization methods. WS achieves these superior results by standardizing the weights in the convolutional layers, which we show is able to smooth the loss landscape by reducing the Lipschitz constants of the loss and the gradients.

  abstract = {Speeding up Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for datasets with many observations by data subsampling has recently received considerable attention. A pseudo-marginal MCMC method is proposed that estimates the likelihood by data subsampling using a block-Poisson estimator. The estimator is a product of Poisson estimators, allowing us to update a single block of subsample indicators in each MCMC iteration so that a desired correlation is achieved between the logs of successive likelihood estimates. This is important since pseudo-marginal MCMC with positively correlated likelihood estimates can use substantially smaller subsamples without adversely affecting the sampling efficiency. The block-Poisson estimator is unbiased but not necessarily positive, so the algorithm runs the MCMC on the absolute value of the likelihood estimator and uses an importance sampling correction to obtain consistent estimates of the posterior mean of any function of the parameters. Our article derives guidelines to select the optimal tuning parameters for our method and shows that it compares very favorably to regular MCMC without subsampling, and to two other recently proposed exact subsampling approaches in the literature. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We introduce a highly efficient unbiased estimator of the log-likelihood based on control variates, such that the computing cost is much smaller than that of the full log-likelihood in standard MCMC. The likelihood estimate is bias-corrected and used in two dependent pseudo-marginal algorithms to sample from a perturbed posterior, for which we derive the asymptotic error with respect to n and m, respectively. We propose a practical estimator of the error and show that the error is negligible even for a very small m in our applications. We demonstrate that subsampling MCMC is substantially more efficient than standard MCMC in terms of sampling efficiency for a given computational budget, and that it outperforms other subsampling methods for MCMC proposed in the literature.

Our results call into question common implicit assumptions that tighter ELBOs are better variational objectives for simultaneous model learning and inference amortization schemes. Based on our insights, we introduce three new algorithms: the partially importance weighted auto-encoder (PIWAE), the multiply importance weighted auto-encoder (MIWAE), and the combination importance weighted autoencoder (CIWAE), each of which includes the standard importance weighted auto-encoder (IWAE) as a special case. We show that each can deliver improvements over IWAE, even when performance is measured by the IWAE target itself. Furthermore, our results suggest that PIWAE may be able to deliver simultaneous improvements in the training of both the inference and generative networks.},

  abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a simple and popular method to solve stochastic optimization problems which arise in machine learning. For strongly convex problems, its convergence rate was known to be O(\textbackslash log(T)/T), by running SGD for T iterations and returning the average point. However, recent results showed that using a different algorithm, one can get an optimal O(1/T) rate. This might lead one to believe that standard SGD is suboptimal, and maybe should even be replaced as a method of choice. In this paper, we investigate the optimality of SGD in a stochastic setting. We show that for smooth problems, the algorithm attains the optimal O(1/T) rate. However, for non-smooth problems, the convergence rate with averaging might really be \textbackslash Omega(\textbackslash log(T)/T), and this is not just an artifact of the analysis. On the flip side, we show that a simple modification of the averaging step suffices to recover the O(1/T) rate, and no other change of the algorithm is necessary. We also present experimental results which support our findings, and point out open problems.},

However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis. These efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a ``black box'' variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

This work is motivated by the fact that the existing model order estimation (number of sources) techniques for wideband source scenario are either inaccurate or computationally expensive. Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is realized using a beamformer framework which imposes nulls in the spatial spectrum along the source directions. The null width along the frequency axis is widened by introducing a new data dependent term into the optimization problem, thus achieving wideband capability. Furthermore, the temporal processing of the data snapshots drastically reduces the number of snapshots required for wideband DOA estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation is studied with simulated experiments.},

We implemented TrustVI in the Stan framework and compared it to two alternatives: Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) and Hessian-free Stochastic Gradient Variational Inference (HFSGVI). The former is based on stochastic first-order optimization. The latter uses second-order information, but lacks convergence guarantees. TrustVI typically converged at least one order of magnitude faster than ADVI, demonstrating the value of stochastic second-order information. TrustVI often found substantially better variational distributions than HFSGVI, demonstrating that our convergence theory can matter in practice.},

This new objective encompasses most variational objectives that use the Kullback-Leibler, the R\{\textbackslash 'e\}nyi or the gamma divergences. It also gives access to objective functions never exploited before in the context of variational inference. This is achieved via two easy to interpret control parameters, which allow for a smooth interpolation over the divergence space while trading-off properties such as mass-covering of a target distribution and robustness to outliers in the data. Furthermore, the sAB variational objective can be optimized directly by repurposing existing methods for Monte Carlo computation of complex variational objectives, leading to estimates of the divergence instead of variational lower bounds. We show the advantages of this objective on Bayesian models for regression problems.},

Randomizing the length of Hamiltonian trajectories (RHMC) has been suggested to smooth the Auto-Correlation Functions (ACF), ensuring robustness of tuning. We present the Langevin diffusion as an alternative to control these ACFs by inducing randomness in Hamiltonian trajectories through a continuous refreshment of the velocities. We connect and compare the two processes in terms of quantitative mixing rates for the 2-Wasserstein and \$\textbackslash mathbb\{L\}\_2\$ distances. The Langevin diffusion is presented as a limit of RHMC achieving the fastest mixing rate for strongly log-concave targets. We introduce a robust alternative to HMC built upon these dynamics, named Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Trajectories (MALT). Studying the scaling limit of MALT, we obtain optimal tuning guidelines similar to HMC, and recover the same scaling with respect to the dimension without additional assumptions. We illustrate numerically the efficiency of MALT compared to HMC and RHMC.},

We propose an asymptotic diffusion limit theorem and show that the relative efficiency of the algorithm can be characterized by its overall acceptance rate, independently of the target distribution. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.574. We show that, as a function of dimension n, the complexity of the algorithm is O(n\textsuperscript{1/3}), which compares favourably with the O(n) complexity of random walk Metropolis algorithms. We illustrate this comparison with some example simulations.},

However, current information-theoretic approaches require many approximations in implementation, introduce often-prohibitive computational overhead and limit the choice of kernels available to model the objective. We develop a fast information-theoretic Bayesian Optimisation method, FITBO, that avoids the need for sampling the global minimiser, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, in comparison with existing approaches, our method faces fewer constraints on kernel choice and enjoys the merits of dealing with the output space. We demonstrate empirically that FITBO inherits the performance associated with information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation, while being even faster than simpler Bayesian optimisation approaches, such as Expected Improvement.}

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

For SGD, in the convex and smooth setting, we provide the first \textbackslash emph\{almost sure\} asymptotic convergence \textbackslash emph\{rates\} for a weighted average of the iterates . More precisely, we show that the convergence rate of the function values is arbitrarily close to o(1/k--{$\surd$})o(1/k)o(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{k\}), and is exactly o(1/k)o(1/k)o(1/k) in the so-called overparametrized case. We show that these results still hold when using a decreasing step size version of stochastic line search and stochastic Polyak stepsizes, thereby giving the first proof of convergence of these methods in the non-overparametrized regime.  Using a substantially different analysis, we show that these rates hold for SHB as well, but at the last iterate. This distinction is important because it is the last iterate of SGD and SHB which is used in practice. We also show that the last iterate of SHB converges to a minimizer \textbackslash emph\{almost surely\}. Additionally, we prove that the function values of the deterministic HB converge at a o(1/k)o(1/k)o(1/k) rate, which is faster than the previously known O(1/k)O(1/k)O(1/k).  Finally, in the nonconvex setting, we prove similar rates on the lowest gradient norm along the trajectory of SGD.},

  abstract = {Scaling of proposals for Metropolis algorithms is an important practical problem in MCMC implementation. Criteria for scaling based on empirical acceptance rates of algorithms have been found to work consistently well across a broad range of problems. Essentially, proposal jump sizes are increased when acceptance rates are high and decreased when rates are low. In recent years, considerable theoretical support has been given for rules of this type which work on the basis that acceptance rates around 0.234 should be preferred. This has been based on asymptotic results that approximate high dimensional algorithm trajectories by diffusions. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to understanding 0.234 which avoids the need for diffusion limits. We derive explicit formulae for algorithm efficiency and acceptance rates as functions of the scaling parameter. We apply these to the family of elliptically symmetric target densities, where further illuminating explicit results are possible. Under suitable conditions, we verify the 0.234 rule for a new class of target densities. Moreover, we can characterise cases where 0.234 fails to hold, either because the target density is too diffuse in a sense we make precise, or because the eccentricity of the target density is too severe, again in a sense we make precise. We provide numerical verifications of our results.}

  abstract = {Signal processing, communications, and control have traditionally relied on classical statistical modeling techniques. Such model-based methods utilize mathematical formulations that represent the underlying physics, prior information and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical models are useful but sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real systems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely data-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly popular as datasets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning pipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures which learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance, especially for supervised problems. However, DNNs typically require massive amounts of data and immense computational resources, limiting their applicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid techniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep learning methods exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical structures designed for specific problems, as well as learning from limited data. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and designing model-based deep learning systems. We divide hybrid model-based/data-driven systems into categories based on their inference mechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for combining model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner, along with concrete guidelines and detailed signal processing oriented examples from recent literature. Our aim is to facilitate the design and study of future systems on the intersection of signal processing and machine learning that incorporate the advantages of both domains.},

  abstract = {The development of prior distributions for Bayesian regression has traditionally been driven by the goal of achieving sensible model selection and parameter estimation. The formalization of properties that characterize good performance has led to the development and popularization of thick tailed mixtures of g priors such as the Zellner--Siow and hyper-g priors. The properties of a particular prior are typically illuminated under limits on the likelihood or the prior. In this paper we introduce a new, conditional information asymptotic that is motivated by the common data analysis setting where at least one regression coefficient is much larger than others. We analyze existing mixtures of g priors under this limit and reveal two new behaviors, Essentially Least Squares (ELS) estimation and the Conditional Lindley's Paradox (CLP), and argue that these behaviors are, in general, undesirable. As the driver behind both of these behaviors is the use of a single, latent scale parameter that is common to all coefficients, we propose a block hyper-g prior, defined by first partitioning the covariates into groups and then placing independent hyper-g priors on the corresponding blocks of coefficients. We provide conditions under which ELS and the CLP are avoided by the new class of priors, and provide consistency results under traditional sample size asymptotics.},

Hermes accelerates hyper-parameter optimization by time-sharing between DL jobs and prioritizing jobs with more promising hyper-parameter combinations. Hermes's scheduling policy is grounded on the observation that good hyper-parameter combinations converge quickly in the early phases of training. By giving higher priority to fast-converging containers, Hermes's GPU preemption mechanism can accelerate training. This enables users to find optimal hyper-parameters faster without losing the progress of a container. We have implemented Hermes over Kubernetes and compared its performance against existing scheduling frameworks. Experiments show that Hermes reduces the time for hyper-parameter optimization up to 4.04 times against previously proposed scheduling policies such as FIFO, round-robin (RR), and SLAQ, with minimal time-sharing overhead.},

Our results show that standard SGD experiences high variability due to differential privacy, but a moderate increase in the batch size can improve performance significantly.},

  abstract = {While Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a very popular method for optimizing expensive black-box functions, it fails to leverage the experience of domain experts. This causes BO to waste function evaluations on commonly known bad regions of design choices, e.g., hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm. To address this issue, we introduce Prior-guided Bayesian Optimization (PrBO). PrBO allows users to inject their knowledge into the optimization process in the form of priors about which parts of the input space will yield the best performance, rather than BO's standard priors over functions which are much less intuitive for users. PrBO then combines these priors with BO's standard probabilistic model to yield a posterior. We show that PrBO is more sample efficient than state-of-the-art methods without user priors and 10,000\$\textbackslash times\$ faster than random search, on a common suite of benchmarks and a real-world hardware design application. We also show that PrBO converges faster even if the user priors are not entirely accurate and that it robustly recovers from misleading priors.},

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The scheme can reach a linear speedup with respect to the number of workers, but this is rarely seen in practice as the scheme often suffers from large network delays and bandwidth limits. To overcome this communication bottleneck recent works propose to reduce the communication frequency. An algorithm of this type is local SGD that runs SGD independently in parallel on different workers and averages the sequences only once in a while. This scheme shows promising results in practice, but eluded thorough theoretical analysis. We prove concise convergence rates for local SGD on convex problems and show that it converges at the same rate as mini-batch SGD in terms of number of evaluated gradients, that is, the scheme achieves linear speedup in the number of workers and mini-batch size. The number of communication rounds can be reduced up to a factor of T\^\{1/2\}---where T denotes the number of total steps---compared to mini-batch SGD. This also holds for asynchronous implementations. Local SGD can also be used for large scale training of deep learning models. The results shown here aim serving as a guideline to further explore the theoretical and practical aspects of local SGD in these applications.},

Inspired by techniques in empirical data analysis and morphological image analysis, we use the local extrema of the input image to extract information about oscillations: We define detail as oscillations between local minima and maxima. Building on the key observation that the spatial scale of oscillations are characterized by the density of local extrema, we develop an algorithm for decomposing images into multiple scales of superposed oscillations.                          Current edge-preserving image decompositions assume image detail to be low contrast variation. Consequently they apply filters that extract features with increasing contrast as successive layers of detail. As a result, they are unable to distinguish between high-contrast, fine-scale features and edges of similar contrast that are to be preserved. We compare our results with existing edge-preserving image decomposition algorithms and demonstrate exciting applications that are made possible by our new notion of detail.},

The Gaussian process prior is characterized by so-called hyperparameters, which often have a large influence on the posterior model and can be difficult to tune. This work provides a method for numerical marginalization of the hyperparameters, relying on the rigorous framework of sequential Monte Carlo. Our method is well suited for online problems, and we demonstrate its ability to handle real-world problems with several dimensions and compare it to other marginalization methods. We also conclude that our proposed method is a competitive alternative to the commonly used point estimates maximizing the likelihood, both in terms of computational load and its ability to handle multimodal posteriors.},

Our method uses the partial information gained during the training of a machine learning model in order to decide whether to pause training and start a new model, or resume the training of a previously-considered model. We specifically tailor our method to machine learning problems by developing a novel positive-definite covariance kernel to capture a variety of training curves. Furthermore, we develop a Gaussian process prior that scales gracefully with additional temporal observations. Finally, we provide an information-theoretic framework to automate the decision process. Experiments on several common machine learning models show that our approach is extremely effective in practice.},

Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice; existing inference algorithms either are not applicable to streaming applications or are not extensible to nonparametric models.  For the special case of Dirichlet processes, streaming inference has been considered.  However, there is growing interest in more flexible BNP models, in particular building on the class of normalized random measures (NRMs).  We work within this general framework and present a streaming variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models based on assumed density filtering.  Extensions to expectation propagation algorithms are possible in the batch data setting.  We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on clustering documents in large, streaming text corpora.},

  abstract = {Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method often used in Bayesian learning. MCMC methods can be difficult to deploy on parallel and distributed systems due to their inherently sequential nature. We study asynchronous Gibbs sampling, which achieves parallelism by simply ignoring sequential requirements. This method has been shown to produce good empirical results for some hierarchical models, and is popular in the topic modeling community, but was also shown to diverge for other targets. We introduce a theoretical framework for analyzing asynchronous Gibbs sampling and other extensions of MCMC that do not possess the Markov property. We prove that asynchronous Gibbs can be modified so that it converges under appropriate regularity conditions -- we call this the exact asynchronous Gibbs algorithm. We study asynchronous Gibbs on a set of examples by comparing the exact and approximate algorithms, including two where it works well, and one where it fails dramatically. We conclude with a set of heuristics to describe settings where the algorithm can be effectively used.},

  abstract = {Variational auto-encoders (VAE) are popular deep latent variable models which are trained by maximizing an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). To obtain tighter ELBO and hence better variational approximations, it has been proposed to use importance sampling to get a lower variance estimate of the evidence. However, importance sampling is known to perform poorly in high dimensions. While it has been suggested many times in the literature to use more sophisticated algorithms such as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and its Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) extensions, the potential benefits brought by these advanced techniques have never been realized for VAE: the AIS estimate cannot be easily differentiated, while SIS requires the specification of carefully chosen backward Markov kernels. In this paper, we address both issues and demonstrate the performance of the resulting Monte Carlo VAEs on a variety of applications.},

Inspired by the common practice of type-II maximum likelihood optimization and its equivalence to Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization, we propose to optimize the distributional sliced-Wasserstein distance (DSWD) between the output of the autoencoder and the empirical data distribution. The advantages of this formulation are that we can estimate the DSWD based on samples and handle high-dimensional problems. We carry out posterior estimation of the BAE parameters via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and turn our BAE into a generative model by fitting a flexible Dirichlet mixture model in the latent space. Consequently, we obtain a powerful alternative to variational autoencoders, which are the preferred choice in modern applications of autoencoders for representation learning with uncertainty. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively using a vast experimental campaign on a number of unsupervised learning tasks and show that, in small-data regimes where priors matter, our approach provides state-of-the-art results, outperforming multiple competitive baselines.},

This method uses a new adaptive stepsize rule that decreases the stepsize whenever sufficient progress is not made. We show that if the gradients of the functions are bounded and Lipschitz continuous over a certain level set, then every cluster point of the iterates generated by the method is a stationary point. In addition, if the gradient of the functions have a certain growth property, then the method is either linearly convergent in some sense or the stepsizes are bounded away from zero. The new stepsize rule is much in the spirit of heuristic learning rules used in practice for training neural networks via backpropagation. As such, the new stepsize rule may suggest improvements on existing learning rules. Finally, extension of the method and the convergence results to constrained minimization is discussed, as are some implementation issues and numerical experience.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal convergence rate for distributed convex optimization problems in networks. We model the communication restrictions imposed by the network as a set of affine constraints and provide optimal complexity bounds for four different setups, namely: the function \$F(\textbackslash xb) \textbackslash triangleq \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^\{m\}f\_i(\textbackslash xb)\$ is strongly convex and smooth, either strongly convex or smooth or just convex. Our results show that Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent on the dual problem can be executed in a distributed manner and obtains the same optimal rates as in the centralized version of the problem (up to constant or logarithmic factors) with an additional cost related to the spectral gap of the interaction matrix. Finally, we discuss some extensions to the proposed setup such as proximal friendly functions, time-varying graphs, improvement of the condition numbers.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is an inherently serial algorithm. Although likelihood calculations for individual steps can sometimes be parallelized, the serial evolution of the process is widely viewed as incompatible with parallelization, offering no speedup for samplers which require large numbers of iterations to converge to equilibrium. We provide a methodology for parallelizing Markov chain Monte Carlo across large numbers of independent, asynchronous processors. Our approach uses a partitioning and weight estimation scheme to combine independent simulations run on separate processors into rigorous Monte Carlo estimates. The method is originally motivated by sampling multimodal target distributions, where we see an exponential speedup in running time. However we show that the approach is general-purpose and applicable to all Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, and demonstrate speedups proportional to the number of available processors on slowly mixing chains with unimodal target distributions. The approach is simple and easy to implement, and suggests additional directions for further research.},

  abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a well-established family of algorithms which are primarily used in Bayesian statistics to sample from a target distribution when direct sampling is challenging. Single instances of MCMC methods are widely considered hard to parallelise in a problem-agnostic fashion and hence, unsuitable to meet both constraints of high accuracy and high throughput. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) Samplers can address the same problem, but are parallelisable: they share with Particle Filters the same key tasks and bottleneck. Although a rich literature already exists on MCMC methods, SMC Samplers are relatively underexplored, such that no parallel implementation is currently available. In this paper, we first propose a parallel MPI version of the SMC Sampler, including an optimised implementation of the bottleneck, and then compare it with single-core Metropolis-Hastings. The goal is to show that SMC Samplers may be a promising alternative to MCMC methods with high potential for future improvements. We demonstrate that a basic SMC Sampler with 512 cores is up to 85 times faster or up to 8 times more accurate than Metropolis-Hastings.},

When minimizing smooth, strongly-convex functions with condition number {$\kappa\kappa\backslash$}kappa, we prove that TTT iterations of SGD with exponentially decreasing step-sizes and knowledge of the smoothness can achieve an O\textasciitilde (exp(\textbackslash nicefrac-T{$\kappa$})+\textbackslash nicefrac{$\sigma$}2T)O\textasciitilde (exp⁡(\textbackslash nicefrac-T{$\kappa$})+\textbackslash nicefrac{$\sigma$}2T)\textbackslash tilde\{O\} \textbackslash left(\textbackslash exp \textbackslash left( \textbackslash nicefrac\{-T\}\{\textbackslash kappa\} \textbackslash right) + \textbackslash nicefrac\{\textbackslash sigma\^2\}\{T\} \textbackslash right) rate, without knowing {$\sigma$}2{$\sigma$}2\textbackslash sigma\^2. In order to be adaptive to the smoothness, we use a stochastic line-search (SLS) and show (via upper and lower-bounds) that SGD with SLS converges at the desired rate, but only to a neighbourhood of the solution. On the other hand, we prove that SGD with an offline estimate of the smoothness converges to the minimizer. However, its rate is slowed down proportional to the estimation error. Next, we prove that SGD with Nesterov acceleration and exponential step-sizes (referred to as ASGD) can achieve the near-optimal O\textasciitilde (exp(\textbackslash nicefrac-T{$\kappa--\surd$})+\textbackslash nicefrac{$\sigma$}2T)O\textasciitilde (exp⁡(\textbackslash nicefrac-T{$\kappa$})+\textbackslash nicefrac{$\sigma$}2T)\textbackslash tilde\{O\} \textbackslash left(\textbackslash exp \textbackslash left( \textbackslash nicefrac\{-T\}\{\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash kappa\}\} \textbackslash right) + \textbackslash nicefrac\{\textbackslash sigma\^2\}\{T\} \textbackslash right) rate, without knowledge of {$\sigma$}2{$\sigma$}2\textbackslash sigma\^2. When used with offline estimates of the smoothness and strong-convexity, ASGD still converges to the solution, albeit at a slower rate. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of exponential step-sizes coupled with a novel variant of SLS.},

We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios.

This work considers a distributed training framework where each worker node is allowed to perform local model updates and the resulting models are averaged periodically. We analyze the true speed of error convergence with respect to wall-clock time (instead of the number of iterations), and analyze how it is affected by the frequency of averaging. The main contribution is the design of AdaComm, an adaptive communication strategy that starts with infrequent averaging to save communication delay and improve convergence speed, and then increases the communication frequency in order to achieve a low error floor. Rigorous experiments on training deep neural networks show that AdaComm can take \$3 \textbackslash times\$ less time than fully synchronous SGD, and still reach the same final training loss.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an effective approach for black-box function optimization problems when function evaluations are expensive and the optimum can be achieved within a relatively small number of queries. However, many cases, such as the ones with high-dimensional inputs, may require a much larger number of observations for optimization. Despite an abundance of observations thanks to parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1) large-scale observations; (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide and conquer. We show unprecedented, previously impossible results of scaling up BO to tens of thousands of observations within minutes of computation.},

  abstract = {Causal inference from observational data often assumes "ignorability," that all confounders are observed. This assumption is standard yet untestable. However, many scientific studies involve multiple causes, different variables whose effects are simultaneously of interest. We propose the deconfounder, an algorithm that combines unsupervised machine learning and predictive model checking to perform causal inference in multiple-cause settings. The deconfounder infers a latent variable as a substitute for unobserved confounders and then uses that substitute to perform causal inference. We develop theory for the deconfounder, and show that it requires weaker assumptions than classical causal inference. We analyze its performance in three types of studies: semi-simulated data around smoking and lung cancer, semi-simulated data around genome-wide association studies, and a real dataset about actors and movie revenue. The deconfounder provides a checkable approach to estimating closer-to-truth causal effects.},

In this paper, we develop a scalable approach for exact GPs that leverages multi-GPU parallelization and methods like linear conjugate gradients, accessing the kernel matrix only through matrix multiplication. By partitioning and distributing kernel matrix multiplies, we demonstrate that an exact GP can be trained on over a million points in 3 days using 8 GPUs and can compute predictive means and variances in under a second using 1 GPU at test time. Moreover, we perform the first-ever comparison of exact GPs against state-of-the-art scalable approximations on large-scale regression datasets with \$10\^4-10\^6\$ data points, showing dramatic performance improvements.},

We derive the exact convergence rate and prove that the IMH algorithm's different deterministic initializations have the same convergence rate.

Similarly but separately, we show that a recent line of work that use stochastic gradient for Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling also preserve differentially privacy with minor or no modifications of the algorithmic procedure at all, these observations lead to an ``anytime'' algorithm for Bayesian learning under privacy constraint. We demonstrate that it performs much better than the state-of-the-art differential private methods on synthetic and real datasets.},

However, stochastic optimization methods for BBVI remain unreliable and require substantial expertise and hand-tuning to apply effectively. In this paper, we propose Robust, Automated, and Accurate BBVI (RAABBVI), a framework for reliable BBVI optimization. RAABBVI is based on rigorously justified automation techniques, includes just a small number of intuitive tuning parameters, and detects inaccurate estimates of the optimal variational approximation. RAABBVI adaptively decreases the learning rate by detecting convergence of the fixed--learning-rate iterates, then estimates the symmetrized Kullback--Leiber (KL) divergence between the current variational approximation and the optimal one. It also employs a novel optimization termination criterion that enables the user to balance desired accuracy against computational cost by comparing (i) the predicted relative decrease in the symmetrized KL divergence if a smaller learning were used and (ii) the predicted computation required to converge with the smaller learning rate. We validate the robustness and accuracy of RAABBVI through carefully designed simulation studies and on a diverse set of real-world model and data examples.},

However, despite this algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions compared to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the use of a "cold posterior" that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments. Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding the origin of the improved performance of cold posteriors.},

  abstract = {The use of Bayesian inference for the analysis of complex statistical models has increased dramatically in recent years, in part due to the increasing availability of computing power. There are a range of techniques available for carrying out Bayesian inference, but the lack of analytic tractability for the vast majority of models of interest means that most of the techniques are numeric, and many are computationally demanding. Indeed, for high-dimensional nonlinear models, the only practical methods for analysis are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, and these are notoriously computation intensive, with some analyses requiring weeks of CPU time on powerful computers. It is clear therefore that the use of parallel computing technology in the context of Bayesian computation is of great interest to many who analyze complex models using Bayesian techniques. Of particular interest in the context of Bayesian inference are techniques for parallelization of a computation utilizing the conditional independence structure of the underlying model, as well as strategies for parallelization of Monte Carlo and MCMC algorithms. There are two obvious approaches to parallelization of an MCMC algorithm: one is based on the idea of running different chains in parallel, and the other is based on parallelization of a single chain. It is a subtle and problem-dependent question as to which of these strategies (or combination of the two) is likely to be most appropriate and there are also important issues relating to parallel random number generation which need to be addressed.}

Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without significant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to fit images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. Finally, we provide a Bayesian perspective on tempering for calibrating predictive distributions.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are the gold standard for many real-world modeling problems, especially in cases where a model's success hinges upon its ability to faithfully represent predictive uncertainty. These problems typically exist as parts of larger frameworks, wherein quantities of interest are ultimately defined by integrating over posterior distributions. These quantities are frequently intractable, motivating the use of Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from their posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We identify a decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to scalable sampling by separating out the prior from the data. Building off of this factorization, we propose an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling, which seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to afford scalability both during training and at test time. In a series of experiments designed to test competing sampling schemes' statistical properties and practical ramifications, we demonstrate how decoupled sample paths accurately represent Gaussian process posteriors at a fraction of the usual cost.},

This paper provides the first such convergence analysis for two fundamental RL algorithms of policy gradient (PG) and temporal difference (TD) learning that incorporate AMSGrad updates (a standard alternative of Adam in theoretical analysis), referred to as PG-AMSGrad and TD-AMSGrad, respectively. Moreover, our analysis focuses on Markovian sampling for both algorithms. We show that under general nonlinear function approximation, PG-AMSGrad with a constant stepsize converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point at the rate of O(1/T) (where T denotes the number of iterations), and with a diminishing stepsize converges exactly to a stationary point at the rate of O(log{$^2$} T/{$\surd$}T). Furthermore, under linear function approximation, TD-AMSGrad with a constant stepsize converges to a neighborhood of the global optimum at the rate of O(1/T), and with a diminishing stepsize converges exactly to the global optimum at the rate of O(log T/{$\surd$}T). Our study develops new techniques for analyzing the Adam-type RL algorithms under Markovian sampling.}

Although there is overwhelming empirical evidence in the literature showing its success, there is relatively little research exploring why the reparameterization trick is so effective. We explore this under the idealized assumptions that the variational approximation is a mean-field Gaussian density and that the log of the joint density of the model parameters and the data is a quadratic function that depends on the variational mean. From this, we show that the marginal variances of the reparameterization gradient estimator are smaller than those of the score function gradient estimator. We apply the result of our idealized analysis to real-world examples.},

  abstract = {Stochastic momentum methods have been widely adopted in training deep neural networks. However, their theoretical analysis of convergence of the training objective and the generalization error for prediction is still under-explored. This paper aims to bridge the gap between practice and theory by analyzing the stochastic gradient (SG) method, and the stochastic momentum methods including two famous variants, i.e., the stochastic heavy-ball (SHB) method and the stochastic variant of Nesterov?s accelerated gradient (SNAG) method. We propose a framework that unifies the three variants. We then derive the convergence rates of the norm of gradient for the non-convex optimization problem, and analyze the generalization performance through the uniform stability approach. Particularly, the convergence analysis of the training objective exhibits that SHB and SNAG have no advantage over SG. However, the stability analysis shows that the momentum term can improve the stability of the learned model and hence improve the generalization performance. These theoretical insights verify the common wisdom and are also corroborated by our empirical analysis on deep learning.},

Specifically, we studied differential privacy of the penalty algorithm and advocate its use for data privacy. The algorithm can be made differentially private while remaining exact in the sense that its target distribution is the true posterior distribution conditioned on the private data. We also show that in a model with independent observations the algorithm has desirable convergence and privacy properties that scale with data size. Two special cases are also investigated and privacy-preserving schemes are proposed for those cases: (i) Data are distributed among several users who are interested in the inference of a common parameter while preserving their data privacy. (ii) The data likelihood belongs to an exponential family. The results of our numerical experiments on the Beta-Bernoulli and the logistic regression models agree with the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Structured non-convex learning problems, for which critical points have favorable statistical properties, arise frequently in statistical machine learning. Algorithmic convergence and statistical estimation rates are well-understood for such problems. However, quantifying the uncertainty associated with the underlying training algorithm is not well-studied in the non-convex setting. In order to address this shortcoming, in this work, we establish an asymptotic normality result for the constant step size stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  algorithm---a widely used algorithm in practice. Specifically, based on the relationship between SGD and Markov Chains  [DDB19], we show that the average of SGD iterates is asymptotically normally distributed around the expected value of their unique invariant distribution, as long as the non-convex and non-smooth objective function satisfies a dissipativity property. We also characterize the bias between this expected value and the critical points of the objective function under various local regularity conditions. Together, the above two results could be leveraged to construct confidence intervals for non-convex problems that are trained using the SGD algorithm.},

  abstract = {The key to the recent success of coordinate descent (CD) in many applications is to maintain a set of auxiliary variables to facilitate efficient single variable updates. For example, the vector of residual/primal variables has to be maintained when CD is applied for Lasso/linear SVM, respectively. An implementation without maintenance is \$O(n)\$ times slower than the one with maintenance, where n is the number of variables. In serial implementations, maintaining auxiliary variables is only a computing trick without changing the behavior of coordinate descent. However, maintenance of auxiliary variables is non-trivial when there are multiple threads/workers which read/write the auxiliary variables concurrently. Thus, most existing theoretical analysis of parallel CD either assumes vanilla CD without auxiliary variables (which ends up being extremely slow in practice) or limits to a small class of problems. In this paper, we consider a rich family of objective functions where AUX-PCD can be applied. We also establish global linear convergence for AUX-PCD with atomic operations for a general family of functions and perform a complete backward error analysis of AUX-PCD with wild updates, where some updates are not just delayed but lost because of memory conflicts. Our results enable us to provide theoretical guarantees for many practical parallel coordinate descent implementations, which currently lack guarantees (such as the implementation of Shotgun by Bradley et al. 2011, which uses auxiliary variables)}

Our variational Bayesian SGPR (VBSGPR) models jointly treat both the distributions of the inducing variables and hyperparameters as variational parameters, which enables the decomposability of the variational lower bound that in turn can be exploited for stochastic optimization. Such a stochastic optimization involves iteratively following the stochastic gradient of the variational lower bound to improve its estimates of the optimal variational distributions of the inducing variables and hyperparameters (and hence the predictive distribution) of our VBSGPR models and is guaranteed to achieve asymptotic convergence to them. We show that the stochastic gradient is an unbiased estimator of the exact gradient and can be computed in constant time per iteration, hence achieving scalability to big data. We empirically evaluate the performance of our proposed framework on two real-world, massive datasets.},

  abstract = {Vessel diseases are often accompanied by abnormalities related to vascular shape and size. Therefore, a clear visualization of vasculature is of high clinical significance. Ultrasound color flow imaging (CFI) is one of the prominent techniques for flow visualization. However, clutter signals originating from slow-moving tissue are one of the main obstacles to obtain a clear view of the vascular network. Enhancement of the vasculature by suppressing the clutters is a significant and irreplaceable step for many applications of ultrasound CFI. Currently, this task is often performed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix. This approach exhibits two well-known limitations. First, the performance of SVD is sensitive to the proper manual selection of the ranks corresponding to clutter and blood subspaces. Second, SVD is prone to failure in the presence of large random noise in the dataset. A potential solution to these issues is using decomposition into low-rank and sparse matrices (DLSM) framework. SVD is one of the algorithms for solving the minimization problem under the DLSM framework. Many other algorithms under DLSM avoid full SVD and use approximated SVD or SVD-free ideas which may have better performance with higher robustness and less computing time. In practice, these models separate blood from clutter based on the assumption that steady clutter represents a low-rank structure and that the moving blood component is sparse. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of ultrasound clutter suppression techniques and exploit the feasibility of low-rank and sparse decomposition schemes in ultrasound clutter suppression. We conduct this review study by adapting 106 DLSM algorithms and validating them against simulation, phantom, and in vivo rat datasets. Two conventional quality metrics, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), are used for performance evaluation. In addition, computation times required by different algorithms for generating clutter suppressed images are reported. Our extensive analysis shows that the DLSM framework can be successfully applied to ultrasound clutter suppression.}

We also utilise a recently introduced posterior sampling mechanism, for which we prove bounds for the specific but general case of discrete Bayesian networks; and we introduce a maximum-a-posteriori private mechanism. Our analysis includes utility and privacy bounds, with a novel focus on the influence of graph structure on privacy. Worked examples and experiments with Bayesian naive Bayes and Bayesian linear regression illustrate the application of our mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Mixture of exponential family models are among the most fundamental and widely used statistical models. Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for parameter estimation in such models is inherently serial. Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor; this poses serious limitations on scalability when the number of parameters is in billions. In this paper, we present extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), a distributed, asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations of SVI by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. Our empirical study demonstrates that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also achieves a better quality solution. To further speed up computation and save memory when fitting large number of topics, we propose a variant ESVI-TOPK which maintains only the top-k important topics. Empirically, we found that using top 25\% topics suffices to achieve the same accuracy as storing all the topics.}

Recent work studies the "forward" KL KL(p||q), which unlike reverse KL does not lead to variational approximations that underestimate uncertainty. This paper introduces Transport Score Climbing (TSC), a method that optimizes KL(p||q) by using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and a novel adaptive transport map. The transport map improves the trajectory of HMC by acting as a change of variable between the latent variable space and a warped space. TSC uses HMC samples to dynamically train the transport map while optimizing KL(p||q). TSC leverages synergies, where better transport maps lead to better HMC sampling, which then leads to better transport maps. We demonstrate TSC on synthetic and real data. We find that TSC achieves competitive performance when training variational autoencoders on large-scale data.},

In this paper, computationally efficient wide-band DOA estimation is considered within a sparse Bayesian framework. In particular, two computationally efficient wide-band DOA estimation methods are proposed, i.e., single and multiple observations sparse Bayesian multitask learning methods, denoted as SO-SBMTL and MO-SBMTL. The proposed methods can independently and jointly process the signals to obtain the DOA estimates, respectively, with significantly reduced computational complexity. In addition, the off-the-grid problem in wide-band DOA estimation is also considered within this framework. The remarkable feature of our proposed methods is that the off-the-grid parameter can be desirably obtained with a closed-form solution, so that numerical searching procedure is appropriately avoided and the computational complexity is substantially reduced. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms can achieve desirable performance with substantially reduced computational complexities. The MO-SBMTL achieves better performance than the SO-SBMTL in the scenarios of static or slow time-varying moving sources, and the off-the-grid algorithm can also efficiently estimate the true DOAs of the sources.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The explosive growth in data volume and the availability of cheap computing resources have sparked increasing interest in Big learning, an emerging subfield that studies scalable machine learning algorithms, systems and applications with Big Data. Bayesian methods represent one important class of statistical methods for machine learning, with substantial recent developments on adaptive, flexible and scalable Bayesian learning. This article provides a survey of the recent advances in Big learning with Bayesian methods, termed Big Bayesian Learning, including non-parametric Bayesian methods for adaptively inferring model complexity, regularized Bayesian inference for improving the flexibility via posterior regularization, and scalable algorithms and systems based on stochastic subsampling and distributed computing for dealing with large-scale applications. We also provide various new perspectives on the large-scale Bayesian modeling and inference.},

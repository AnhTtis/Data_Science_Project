    "abstract": "Clinical decision making requires counterfactual reasoning based on a factual medical image and thus necessitates causal image synthesis. To this end, we present a novel method for modeling the causality between demographic variables, clinical indices and brain MR images for Alzheimer's Diseases. Specifically, we leverage a structural causal model to depict the causality and a styled generator to synthesize the image. Furthermore, as a crucial step to reduce modeling complexity and make learning tractable, we propose the use of low dimensional latent feature representation of a high-dimensional 3D image, together with exogenous noise, to build causal relationship between the image and non image variables. We experiment the proposed method based on 1586 subjects and 3683 3D images and synthesize counterfactual brain MR images intervened on certain attributes, such as age, brain volume and cognitive test score. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluation of counterfactual images demonstrates the superiority of our generated images.",

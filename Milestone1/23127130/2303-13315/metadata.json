    "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing agents able to compute optimal decisions by composing data from multiple sources to tackle tasks involving: (i) tracking a desired behavior while minimizing an agent-specific cost; (ii) satisfying safety constraints. After formulating the control problem, we show that this is convex under a suitable assumption and find the optimal solution. The effectiveness of the results, which are turned in an algorithm, is illustrated on a connected cars application via in-silico and in-vivo experiments with real vehicles and drivers. All the experiments confirm our theoretical predictions and the deployment of the algorithm on a real vehicle shows its suitability for in-car operation.",

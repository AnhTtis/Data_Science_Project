abstract = {Control design for stochastic systems is traditionally based on optimization of the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. Despite the theoretical attractiveness of such a design methodology, its applicability is very limited owing to its computational overhead. Thus it is worthwhile to seek an alternative formulation resulting in a more tractable design. In this paper, an alternative is presented that leads to a simpler form of design equations. The proposed controller minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the actual probabilistic descriptions of the closed-loop behaviour and the desired one. Its explicit randomized form depends on the solution of a functional equation with a simpler structure than that of the general dynamic programming equations. A basic paradigm is proposed, and the resulting algorithm is discussed. For illustration purposes, it is applied to linear Gaussian systems, and the desired result is obtained: The optimal controller is determined by a discrete-time Riccati equation.}

author = {Davide Gagliardi and Giovanni Russo},
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the design of control policies from example datasets. The case considered is when just a black box description of the system to be controlled is available and the system is affected by actuation constraints. These constraints are not necessarily fulfilled by the (possibly, noisy) example data and the system under control is not necessarily the same as the one from which these data are collected. In this context, we introduce a number of methodological results to compute a control policy from example datasets that: (i) makes the behavior of the closed-loop system similar to the one illustrated in the data; (ii) guarantees compliance with the constraints. We recast the control problem as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and give an explicit expression for its optimal solution. Moreover, we turn our findings into an algorithmic procedure. The procedure gives a systematic tool to compute the policy. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated via a numerical example, where we use real data collected from test drives to synthesize a control policy for the merging of a car on a highway.}

@article{Mountcastle97,
	abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

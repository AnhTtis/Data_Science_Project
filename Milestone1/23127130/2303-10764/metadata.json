    "abstract": "We find new examples of complex surfaces with countably many non-isomorphic algebraic structures. Here is one such example: take an elliptic curve $E$ in $\\mathbb P^2$ and blow up nine general points on $E$. Then the complement $M$ of the strict transform of $E$ in the blow-up has countably many algebraic structures. Moreover, each algebraic structure comes from an embedding of $M$ into a blow-up of $\\mathbb P^2$ in nine points lying on an elliptic curve $F\\not\\simeq E$. We classify algebraic structures on $M$ using a Hopf transform: a way of constructing a new surface by cutting out an elliptic curve and pasting a different one. Next, we introduce the notion of an analytic K-theory of varieties. Manipulations with the example above lead us to prove that classes of all elliptic curves in this K-theory coincide. To put in another way, all motivic measures on complex algebraic varieties that take equal values on biholomorphic varieties do not distinguish elliptic curves.",

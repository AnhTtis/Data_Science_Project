    "abstract": "The recent introduction of the smart radio environments (SREs) paradigm, enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), has put in evidence the need for physically-consistent models and design tools for communication systems integrating electromagnetic (EM) and signal processing theories. In this perspective, starting from rigorous EM arguments, in this paper we propose a general framework for the characterization and design of programmable EM environments. We first show that any linear EM environment in the presence of boundary conditions can be interpreted as a space-variant linear feedback filter. Then we provide a methodology to characterize programmable EM systems as a linear graph described by matrix operators thus leading to the determination of the transfer function of the EM system. Finally, some examples are given related to the characterization and design of RISs, also showing that some previous results in the literature are just particular cases of our general framework.",

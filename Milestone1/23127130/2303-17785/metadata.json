    "abstract": "From flocks of birds to biomolecular assemblies, systems in which many individual components independently consume energy to perform mechanical work exhibit a wide array of striking behaviors. Methods to quantify the dynamics of these so called active systems generally aim to extract important length or time scales from experimental fields. Because such methods focus on extracting scalar values, they do not wring maximal information from experimental data. We introduce a method to overcome these limitations. We extend the framework of correlation functions by taking into account the internal headings of displacement fields. The functions we construct represent the material response to specific types of active perturbation within the system. Utilizing these response functions we query the material response of disparate active systems composed of actin filaments and myosin motors, from model fluids to living cells. We show we can extract critical length scales from the turbulent flows of an active nematic, anticipate contractility in an active gel, distinguish viscous from viscoelastic dissipation, and even differentiate modes of contractility in living cells. These examples underscore the vast utility of this method which measures response functions from experimental observations of complex active systems.",

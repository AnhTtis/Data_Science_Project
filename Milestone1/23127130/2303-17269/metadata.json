    "abstract": "Exomoons have so far eluded ongoing searches. Several studies have exploited transit and transit timing variations and high-resolution spectroscopy to identify potential exomoon candidates. One method of detecting and confirming these exomoons is to search for signals of planet-moon interactions. In this work, we present the first radio observations of the exomoon candidate system WASP 69b. Based on the detection of alkali metals in the transmission spectra of WASP-69b, it was deduced that the system might be hosting an exomoon. WASP 69b is also one of the exoplanet systems that will be observed as part of JWST cycle-1 GTO. This makes the system an excellent target to observe and follow up. We observed the system for 32 hrs at 150 MHz and 218 MHz using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Though we do not detect radio emission from the systems, we place strong $3σ$ upper limits of 3.3 mJy at 150 MHz and 0.9 mJy at 218 MHz. We then use these upper limits to estimate the maximum mass loss from the exomoon candidate.",

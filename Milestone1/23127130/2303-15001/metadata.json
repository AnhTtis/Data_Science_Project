    "abstract": "The quantum orthogonal arrays define remarkable classes of multipartite entangled states called $k$-uniform states whose every reductions to $k$ parties are maximally mixed. We present constructions of quantum orthogonal arrays of strength 2 with levels of prime power, as well as some constructions of strength 3. As a consequence, we give infinite classes of 2-uniform states of $N$ systems with dimension of prime power $d\\geq 2$ for arbitrary $N\\geq 5$; 3-uniform states of $N$-qubit systems for arbitrary $N\\geq 6$ and $N\\neq 7,8,9,11$; 3-uniform states of $N$ systems with dimension of prime power $d\\geq 7$ for arbitrary $N\\geq 7$.",

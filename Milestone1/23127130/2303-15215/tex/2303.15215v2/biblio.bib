  abstract   = {It is shown that, with a simple two-pendulum device, one can experimentally simulate the behaviour of a one-half spin. After a quick overﬂight of the two-degree-of-freedom harmonic oscillator’s properties, we show that, in the quasi-degeneracy limit, this system is formally equivalent to a one-half spin: its physical states can be described by state vectors belonging to a twodimensional Hilbert space; its free motion obeys a Schro¨dinger equation. An R3-isomorphous representation space is used to illustrate this movement in terms of Larmor precession.},

  abstract   = {It has already been shown that, with the simplest classical device, namely two coupled pendula, one can simulate the movement of a free quantum two-level system, as for instance a one-half spin in a static magnetic ﬁeld. We now show that, with a hardly more sophisticated device, one can simulate the latter system undergoing outer perturbation. In the case of sinusoidal excitation, we present an experimental mechanical illustration of the transition of the system between its two eigenstates, known as the Rabi precession. Abstract theoretical concepts of absorption and stimulated emission of energy are thus provided with intuitive support.},

  abstract = {Beginning students of quantum mechanics frequently have difficulty separating essential underlying principles from the specific examples to which these principles have historically been applied. This book is especially designed to eliminate that difficulty. Fourteen chapters, augmented by 14 "complementary sections," provide a clarity of organization, careful attention to pedagogical details, and a wealth of topics and examples that allow physics professors to tailor courses to meet students' specific needs. Each chapter starts with a clear exposition of the problem to be treated and then logically develops the physical and mathematical concept. These chapters emphasize the underlying principles of the material, undiluted by extensive references to applications and practical examples. (Such applications and practical examples are contained in the complementary sections.) The book begins with a qualitative introduction to quantum mechanical ideas using simple optical analogies and continues with a systematic presentation of the mathematical tools and postulates of quantum mechanics as well as a discussion of their physical content. Applications follow, starting with the simplest ones (two-level systems, the harmonic oscillator, etc.), and becoming gradually more complicated (the hydrogen atom, approximation methods, etc.). The complementary sections each expand this basic knowledge, supplying a wide range of applications and related topics which make use of the essential skills. Here the authors include carefully written, detailed expositions of a large number of special problems and more advanced topics-integrated as an essential portion of the text. These topics, however, are not interdependent; this allows professors to direct their quantum mechanics courses toward both physics and chemistry students.},

It is a textbook on the principles of the theory, its mathematical framework and its first applications. It consistently refers to modern and practical developments, such as tunneling microscopy, quantum information, Bell inequalities, quantum cryptography, Bose-Einstein condensation and quantum astrophysics. The book contains 92 exercises with their solutions.Supplementary material on extras.springer.com contains outstanding and "easy access" Java-based simulations, which illustratively help the user to better understand how the theory actually operates. It also contains a variety of links where one can discover updated applications and further readings. A complementary book The Quantum Mechanics Solver guides students to applying the theory developed here to research problems in atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter and laser physics.},

  abstract  = {"This nicely organized and pedagogically excellent book not only covers material that students of physics and engineering are conventionally assumed to need at an advanced undergraduate and graduate level but goes beyond that by including some important modern mathematics not usually included in such texts--such as Lebesgue integration, theory of distributions, probability theory, and differential geometry. It treats the material in a rigorous yet friendly manner from a physicist's perspective, and even includes interesting historical asides that convey to a student the idea that mathematics is not a dead subject. It is an excellent choice as a course textbook or as an addition to a physicist's bookshelf."--Elliott Lieb, Princeton University"As happens to many of us who teach a mathematics for physicists course to physics students, Appel--who for years taught such a course at the école Normale Supérieure de Lyon--faced the problem of finding a textbook that is neither too soft or imprecise nor too specialized mathematically. This book is Appel's own elegant way out of this dilemma. Physics students at the graduate level will benefit handsomely."--Michael Kiessling, Rutgers University"Mathematics for Physics and Physicists gives a charming exposition of many important concepts, including topics not covered in standard textbooks. Appel finds an excellent balance between mathematical rigor and physical applications, and the book is interspersed with short biographies of mathematicians and sets of illustrative problems. I wish that kind of book had been available when I was a student."--Andreas Brandhuber, Queen Mary, University of London},

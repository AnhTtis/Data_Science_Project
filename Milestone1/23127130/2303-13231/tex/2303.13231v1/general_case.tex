In this section, we explain the extension of our scheme for the general case of $\nhonest\geq 1$. In this case, we also exploit the fact that there are $\nhonest$ honest workers that are guaranteed to agree in their responses. Therefore, the \master can eliminate all responses that are supported by only less than $\nhonest$ workers. Furthermore, a response must be a correct response if it is supported by more than $\nmalicious$ workers. Therefore, the \master does only need to consider sets $\workerset \in \range{\nworker}$ of workers that agree on their responses, and which satisfies $\nhonest \leq \card{\workerset} \leq \nmalicious$. For the clarity of presentation, we thus, only consider those sets as inputs to \cref{alg:elimination_tournament}.

Additionally, we leverage a little more communication to reduce the number of local gradient computations to at most $\compbound$. The intuition here is that the \master can pick a representative from every set $\workerset$ and run matches between the representatives. Note however, that even if the \master identifies a representative of $\workerset$ as malicious by a local computation, this does not imply that every worker in $\workerset$ is malicious. For example, a malicious worker could return the same initial response as the honest workers, but when being picked as representative, intentionally send wrong node labels. We overcome this by asking all workers in a set $\workerset$ to either commit or not commit to the representative's leaf label, which has been identified in a match. In order to force the \master to run a local computation, there must be at least $\nhonest$ workers in $\workerset$ that commit to the representative's leaf label. If not, we can mark all the workers that committed to the label as malicious immediately. If there are at least $\nhonest$ commitments to a malicious leaf label, the \master can mark all those workers (at least $\nhonest$) as malicious by running a local computation. This procedure is reflected by the elimination tournament in \cref{alg:elimination_tournament}.

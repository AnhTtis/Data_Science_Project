    "abstract": "Exceptional point degeneracies (EPD) of linear non-Hermitian systems have been recently utilized for hypersensitive sensing. This proposal exploits the sublinear response that the degenerate frequencies experience once the system is externally perturbed. The enhanced sensitivity, however, might be offset by excess (fundamental and/or technical) noise. Here, we developed a self-oscillating nonlinear platform that supports transitions between two distinct neuromorphic functionalities -- one having a spatially symmetric steady-state, and the other with an asymmetric steady-state -- and displays nonlinear EPDs (NLEPDs) that can be employed for noise-resilient sensing. The experimental setup incorporates a nonlinear electronic dimer with voltage-sensitive coupling and demonstrates two-orders signal-to-noise enhancement of voltage variation measurements near NLEPDs. Our results resolve a long-standing debate on the efficacy of EPD-sensing in active systems above self-oscillating threshold.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the non-trivial 3-momentum effects on the masses of heavy quarkonium states that are moving in a hot medium using QCD sum rules. For all charmonium states, we observe a negative mass shift near $T_c$ that is less than 3$\\%$ at a momentum of 1$\\rm{GeV}$. Specifically, we first investigate the difference between the longitudinal and transverse modes of both $J/ψ$ and $χ_{c1}$. We find that the transverse mode of the $J/ψ$ experiences larger modification than the longitudinal mode, while the $χ_{c1}$ has the opposite behavior. By comparing the $η_c$ and $χ_{c0}$, and also the unpolarized $J/ψ$ and $χ_{c1}$, we recognize that the P-wave particles have stronger momentum dependencies on their masses than the S-wave ones. We also find $Υ$(1S) has negligible 3-momentum dependence compared to the charmonium states, e.g. less than 0.01$\\%$ even at 1.4$T_c$ and at a momentum of 4$\\rm{GeV}$.",

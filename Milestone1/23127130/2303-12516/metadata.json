    "abstract": "Huisken's problem asks whether there is an elastic flow of closed planar curves that is initially contained in the upper half-plane but `migrates' to the lower half-plane at a positive time. Here we consider variants of Huisken's problem for open curves under the natural boundary condition, and construct various migrating elastic flows both analytically and numerically.",

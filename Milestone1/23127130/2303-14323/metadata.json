    "abstract": "Charge redistribution across heterojunctions has long been utilized to induce functional response in materials systems. Here we examine how the composition of the terminating surface affects charge transfer across a heterojunction consisting of Si and the crystalline complex oxide SrTiO3. Itinerant electrons in Si migrate across the interface toward the surface of SrTiO3 due to surface depletion. The electron transfer in turn creates an electric field across the interface that modifies the interfacial dipole associated with bonding between SrTiO3 and Si, leading to a change in the band alignment from type-II to type-III. By capping the SrTiO3 surface with ultra-thin layers of BaO, SrO or TiO2, charge transfer across the interface can be weakened or inhibited. Ab initio modeling implicates the adsorption of oxygen as driving surface depletion in SrTiO3. The electronic coupling between the surface and buried interface expands the functionality of semiconductor-crystalline oxide heterojunctions.",

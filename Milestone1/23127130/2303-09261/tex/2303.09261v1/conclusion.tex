\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose \algo\ a novel infeasible method for optimization on an immersed manifold $\cM$.  An attractive property of \algo\ is that it avoids retractions and only projections on a vector space need to be computed. \algo\ achieve near-optimal  oracle complexities $\cO(1/\varepsilon^2)$ and $\cO(1/\varepsilon^4)$ in the deterministic and stochastic cases, respectively. Various extensions of \algo\ are presented. First, we introduce \redalgo, a computationally friendly version of \algo. Here we only need to compute one projection onto a hyperplane, but at the price of a slightly worse complexity bound. Second, we introduce \geomalgo\, a geometry-based version of \algo, where the projections account for the local Riemannian metric. When specialized to the Stieffel manifold, \geomalgo\ generalizes the \texttt{landing} algorithm \citep{ablin2022fast}. We show that \geomalgo\ enjoys the same oracle complexity as \algo\:  as a result, for Stieffel manifold, we establish  oracle complexity bounds for \texttt{landing}. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of \algo\ and its variants.

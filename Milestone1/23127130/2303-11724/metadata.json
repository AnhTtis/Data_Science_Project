    "abstract": "We present a method for selecting valuable projections in computed tomography (CT) scans to enhance image reconstruction and diagnosis. The approach integrates two important factors, projection-based detectability and data completeness, into a single feed-forward neural network. The network evaluates the value of projections, processes them through a differentiable ranking function and makes the final selection using a straight-through estimator. Data completeness is ensured through the label provided during training. The approach eliminates the need for heuristically enforcing data completeness, which may exclude valuable projections. The method is evaluated on simulated data in a non-destructive testing scenario, where the aim is to maximize the reconstruction quality within a specified region of interest. We achieve comparable results to previous methods, laying the foundation for using reconstruction-based loss functions to learn the selection of projections.",

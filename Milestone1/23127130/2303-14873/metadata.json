    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the long-time behavior of solutions to the nonclassical diffusion equation with fading memory when the nonlinear term $f$ fulfills the polynomial growth of arbitrary order and the external force $ g(x)\\in L^{2}(Ω)$. In the framework of time-dependent spaces, we verify the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions by the Galerkin method, then we obtain the existence of the time-dependent global attractor $\\mathscr{A}=\\{A_t\\}_{t\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ in $\\mathcal{M}_t^1$.",

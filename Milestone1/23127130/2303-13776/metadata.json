    "abstract": "This work discusses the rheology of several vitreous humour (VH) substitutes used in eye surgery (perfluorocarbons and silicone oils) and their flow behaviour when subjected to saccadic eye movements. Shear rheology experiments revealed that all fluids tested exhibit a constant shear viscosity, while extensional rheological experiments showed that Siluron 2000 is the only fluid tested that exhibits a measurable elasticity. To characterise the dynamics during saccadic eye movements, numerical simulations of all the VH substitutes under study were performed with the open source software OpenFOAM and compared with Vitreous Humour flow dynamics to assess their potential mechanical performance. Minor differences were found between the numerical results of a viscoelastic fluid reproducing the rheology of Siluron 2000 and a Newtonian model. Perfluorocarbon (PFLC) shows a distinct flow behaviour relative to Silicone Oils (SiO). None of the pharmacological fluids tested can adequately mimic the rheological and consequently the flow behaviour of VH gel phase (Silva et al., 2020).",

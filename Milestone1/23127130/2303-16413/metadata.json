    "abstract": "Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a language that can be decided in linear space and let $ε>0$ be any constant. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be the exponential hardness assumption that for every $n$, membership in $\\mathcal{L}$ for inputs of length~$n$ cannot be decided by circuits of size smaller than $2^{εn}$. We prove that for every function $f :\\{0,1\\}^* \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, computable by a randomized logspace algorithm $R$, there exists a deterministic logspace algorithm $D$ (attempting to compute $f$), such that on every input $x$ of length $n$, the algorithm $D$ outputs one of the following:\n  1: The correct value $f(x)$.\n  2: The string: ``I am unable to compute $f(x)$ because the hardness assumption $\\mathcal{A}$ is false'', followed by a (provenly correct) circuit of size smaller than $2^{εn'}$ for membership in $\\mathcal{L}$ for inputs of length~$n'$, for some $n' = Θ(\\log n)$; that is, a circuit that refutes $\\mathcal{A}$.\n  Our next result is a universal derandomizer for $BPL$: We give a deterministic algorithm $U$ that takes as an input a randomized logspace algorithm $R$ and an input $x$ and simulates the computation of $R$ on $x$, deteriministically. Under the widely believed assumption $BPL=L$, the space used by $U$ is at most $C_R \\cdot \\log n$ (where $C_R$ is a constant depending on~$R$). Moreover, for every constant $c \\geq 1$, if $BPL\\subseteq SPACE[(\\log(n))^{c}]$ then the space used by $U$ is at most $C_R \\cdot (\\log(n))^{c}$.\n  Finally, we prove that if optimal hitting sets for ordered branching programs exist then there is a deterministic logspace algorithm that, given a black-box access to an ordered branching program $B$ of size $n$, estimates the probability that $B$ accepts on a uniformly random input. This extends the result of (Cheng and Hoza CCC 2020), who proved that an optimal hitting set implies a white-box two-sided derandomization.",

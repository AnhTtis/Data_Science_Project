    "abstract": "Quantum error correction is an essential component for practical quantum computing on noisy quantum hardware. However, logical operations on error-corrected qubits require a significant resource overhead, especially for high-precision and high-fidelity non-Clifford rotation gates. To address this issue, we propose a postselection-based algorithm to efficiently prepare resource states for gate teleportation. Our algorithm achieves fault tolerance, demonstrating the exponential suppression of logical errors with code distance, and it applies to any stabilizer codes. We provide analytical derivations and numerical simulations of the fidelity and success probability of the algorithm. We benchmark the method on surface code and show a factor of 100 to 10,000 reduction in space-time overhead compared to existing methods. Overall, our approach presents a promising path to reducing the resource requirement for quantum algorithms on error-corrected and noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.",

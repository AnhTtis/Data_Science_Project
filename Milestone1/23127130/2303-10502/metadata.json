    "abstract": "Technological advancements have resulted in an exponential increase in the use of online social networks (OSNs) worldwide. While online social networks provide a great communication medium, they also increase the user's exposure to life-threatening situations such as suicide, eating disorder, cybercrime, compulsive behavior, anxiety, and depression. To tackle the issue of cyberbullying, most existing literature focuses on developing approaches to identifying factors and understanding the textual factors associated with cyberbullying. While most of these approaches have brought great success in cyberbullying research, data availability needed to develop model detection remains a challenge in the research space. This paper conducts a comprehensive literature review to provide an understanding of cyberbullying detection.",

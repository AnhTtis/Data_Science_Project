\section{Conclusions}
While most existing FL studies consider little about the heterogeneous devices with various scales in practice, in this paper, we introduce our released system \oursys, which is featured by its high usability and strong robustness for handling real-world cross-device FL tasks with a massive amount of heterogeneous client devices.
This is achieved by the key components of the system, including the optimized device executor for efficient and diverse mobile runtimes, and the enhanced FL server for scalable message transmission and transaction execution.
In addition, our system provides flexible programming interfaces for several advanced FL topics, including personalization, compression and asynchronous aggregation.
We further implement a high-fidelity heterogeneous device simulation platform to give researchers and developers an easy-to-run option for cost-efficiently prototyping FL solutions. 
All the above contributions are demonstrated via our extensive experiments, in which we also investigate the impact of device heterogeneity and device scales for real-world FL tasks.
We hope that our system can facilitate further real-world FL studies and applications, and our observations and discussions can contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of device heterogeneity and device scales in the FL community.

    "abstract": "A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\\gtrsim 7$ have been recently detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form at such early time within the standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work, we propose that this puzzle can be explained by the presence of some primordial black holes (PBHs) with mass of $\\sim 1000 M_\\odot$. These PBHs act as seeds for early galaxies formation with masses of $\\sim 10^{8}-10^{10}~M_\\odot$ at high redshift, hence accounting for the JWST observations. We use a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, and find that the Lognormal model with the $M_{\\rm c}\\sim 750M_\\odot$ is preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to have strong radiation and may appear as the high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST.",

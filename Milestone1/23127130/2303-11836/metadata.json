    "abstract": "We theoretically and computationally study the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics of a linear active microswimmer surfing on a compressible thin fluid layer characterized by an odd viscosity. In the limit of small odd viscosity compared to the even viscosities of the fluid layer, we obtain analytical expressions for the self-induced flow field, which includes non-reciprocal components due to the odd viscosity. On this basis, we fully analyze the behavior of a single linear swimmer, finding that it follows a circular path, the radius of which is, to leading order, inversely proportional to the magnitude of the odd viscosity. In addition, we show that a pair of swimmers exhibits a wealth of two-body dynamics that depends on the initial relative orientation angles as well as on the propulsion mechanism adopted by each swimmer. In particular, the pusher-pusher and pusher-puller-type swimmer pairs exhibit a generic spiral motion, while the puller-puller pair is found to either co-rotate in the steady state along a circular trajectory or exhibit a more complex chaotic behavior resulting from the interplay between hydrodynamic and steric interactions. Our theoretical predictions may pave the way toward a better understanding of active transport in active chiral fluids with odd viscosity, and may find potential applications in the quantitative microrheological characterization of odd-viscous fluids.",

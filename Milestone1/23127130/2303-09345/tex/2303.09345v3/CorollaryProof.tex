\section{Proof of Corollary \ref{Corollary}}
Let $A=\GenA{p,q}$ where $p$ is a $\mon{\al,\bt}$-axis and $q$ is a $\jor{\al}$-axis. 

Suppose that $q$ is fixed by $\tu{p}$. Both $p,q\in A_{\{0,1,\al\}}(p)$ and by the properties of $\mon{\al,\bt}$, we cannot produce a non-zero element in $A_\bt(p)$. Hence $p$ is a $\jor{\al}$-axis and so $A$ is an axial algebra of $\jor{\al}$-type. 

Now suppose $q$ is not fixed by $p$ and say $q^{\tu{p}}=r$ where $r$ is another axis. By $\tu{p}$ being an automorphism, $r$ is a $\jor{\al}$-axis and $\GenG{p,q}=\{p,q,r\}\cong X'(1+2)$. Therefore $A$ has skew axet of $X'(1+2)$ and is listed in Theorem \ref{Theorem}.

\section{Larger Skew Axets}
For the majority of this paper, we have set the axet of $(A,X)$ to be $X'(1+2)$. In this section, we will look at larger skew axets and see if our work can simplify their classification.

To remind the reader, let $k\in \N$ and $k>1$. We have the axet of $X'(k+2k)$ to be the axet $X(4k)$ with the extra condition: for $i\in \Z$, $a_{2i}=a_{2(i+k)}$. We do not relabel the vertices when it becomes skew. Therefore,
\[ X(4k):=\{ a_i \; | \; i \in \Z \;\text{ and } \; a_i=a_{i+4k}\}\]
and 
\[ X'(k+2k):=\{ a_i \in X(4k) \; | \; a_{2j}=a_{2(j+k)} \; \forall j \in \Z\}.\]
Looking at the Miyamoto involution of either $X(4k)$ and $X'(k+2k)$, we have that for $i,j\in \Z$, 
\[ a_i^{\tu{j}}= a_{2j-i}.\]
\subsection{The Odd Case}
We will now present a result that M\textsuperscript{c}Inroy suggested.
\begin{prop}\label{odd k}
Let $k$ be odd. For axet $X'(k+2k)$, there exists a subaxet which is isomorphic $X'(1+2)$. 
\proof As $k$ is odd, $a_k$ is in the odd orbit and  $ a_0^{\tu{k}}= a_{2k-0}=a_0$. Therefore $a_0$ is fixed by $\tu{k}$. We have that  $a_k^{\tu{0}}= a_{0-k}=a_{-k}$. Therefore the set $Y=\{a_0,a_k,a_{-k}\}=\GenG{a_0,a_k}$ is a skew axet and is isomorphic to $X'(1+2)$. \qed
\end{prop}
\begin{cor}\label{odd cor}
    Let $k>1$ be odd and $(A,X)$ be a $2$-generated $\mon{\al,\bt}$-axial algebra with skew axet $X'(k+2k)$. Then $\al+\bt=1$. Further, either $A$ has a subalgebra isomorphic to either $\TC(\al,1-\al)$, $Q_2(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})$ or $Q_2(\frac{1}{3})^\times \oplus \GenG{\id}$.

\proof  By Proposition \ref{odd k}, $X$ must contain a subaxet, $Y=\GenA{a_0,a_k}$, isomorphic to $X'(1+2)$. Let $B=\GenA{a_0,a_k}$ be the $2$-generated axial algebra of Monster type with axet $Y$. As $B$ is generated by two axes in $A$, then $A$ shares the same fusion law in $B$. By Theorem \ref{Theorem}, the rest follows. \qed
\end{cor}

Let $k>1$ and be odd. By Proposition \ref{odd k} and Corollary \ref{odd cor}, we have a possibly strategy to classify all $2$-generated axial algebras of Monster type with skew axet $X'(k+2k)$. Suppose $(A,X)$ has our desired conditions. Notice that $L=\GenA{a_1,a_{-1}}$ is a $2$-generated axial algebra of Monster type. Further, $\tu{0}$ acts as the flip automorphism of $L$ thus $L$ is symmetric. By the classification of $2$-generated symmetric axial algebras of Monster type in \cite{yabe2023classification}, \cite{franchi2022classifying} and \cite{franchi2022quotients} together with the conditions from Corollary \ref{odd cor}, we will have a short list for possible options of $L$. 

We will complete this case in a second paper, going into much more detail. Moreover, we will look at when $k$ is even and progress to completely classifying skew axial algebras of Monster type.

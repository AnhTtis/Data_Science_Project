\section{Proof of the Corollary}

\proof Suppose that $q$ is fixed by $\tu{p}$. Both $p,q\in A_{\{0,1,\al\}}(p)$ and by the properties of $\mon{\al,\bt}$, we cannot produce a non-zero element in $A_\bt(p)$. Hence $p$ is a $\jor{\al}$-axis and so $A$ is an axial algebra of $\jor{\al}$-type. 

Now suppose $q$ is not fixed by $p$ and say $q^{\tu{p}}=r$ where $r$ is another axis. By $\tu{p}$ being an automorphism, $r$ is a $\jor{\al}$-axis and $\GenG{p,q}=\{p,q,r\}\cong X'(1+2)$. Therefore $A$ has skew axet of $X'(1+2)$ and so $A$ is isomorphic to $3C(\al,1-\al)$ or $Q_2(\frac{1}{3})$ by the Theorem. \qed

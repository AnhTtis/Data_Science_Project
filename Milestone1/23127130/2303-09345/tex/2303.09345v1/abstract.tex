Skew axets were first defined in \cite{mcinroy2021forbidden} where McInroy and Shpectorov used the term of axets to classify shapes of an algebra. When they first submitted their paper, it was not known if these skew axial algebras exist and now we will present such examples of axet $X'(1+2)$. Looking at $2$-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type, we will be able to state and prove the classification of such algebras that have axet $X'(1+2)$. We will then conclude by looking at larger $k$ and give a suggestion on how one could extend the classification to odd $k$.

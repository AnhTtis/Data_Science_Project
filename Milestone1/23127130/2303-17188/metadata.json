    "abstract": "We propose a high-performance yet low-complexity hierarchical frequency synchronization scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) aided distributed massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, where multi-ple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) have to be estimated in the uplink. To solve this multi-CFO estimation problem efficiently, we classify the active antenna units (AAUs) as the master and the slaves. Then, we split the scheme into two stages. During the first stage the distributed slave AAUs are synchronized with the master AAU, while the user equipment (UE) is synchronized with the closest slave AAU during the second stage. The mean square error (MSE) performance of our scheme is better than that of the representative state-of-the-art baseline schemes, while its computational complexity is substantially lower.",

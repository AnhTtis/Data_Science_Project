In this work we proposed the HiLo framework to tackle the long-tail problem with relational semantic overlap in Panoptic Scene Graph generation.
The HiLo framework simultaneously learns the high and low frequency relations in different network branches and unifies their strengths by aligning their predictions.
We also constructed a HiLo baseline to allow high-quality panoptic segmentation to improve PSG performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PSG dataset, confirming its effectiveness.
In future work, we will investigate how knowledge distillation \cite{hinton2015distilling, gou2021knowledge} can be used to fuse the high and low branches in our method, as well as its application to downstream tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning.

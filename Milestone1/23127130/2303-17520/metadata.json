    "abstract": "With increases in population, there is a noticeable change across the world in pollution levels. Recently there has been growing demand for renewable energy operated devices boomed. Numerous reasons have led to such growth including lower operating costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In order to obtain the optimised output, it is required to consider all the major parameters constraining the decision-making. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is one of the most reliable and effective tools for decision making with many objectives. The technique focuses to prioritise the available alternatives in the decision space by considering the influential factors (or parameters) and their relative importance in the overall decision making. Because analysis conducted using MCDM approaches utilises an algorithm to obtain the desired output, this paper focuses on the application of an MCDM approach to identify those criteria that are essential in renewable energy technology systems.",

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission {$<$}italic{$>$}Planck{$<$}/italic{$>$} measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5 {$<$}italic{$>\sigma<$}/italic{$>$} level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\textohm} \textsubscript{c} {$<$}italic{$>$}h{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsuperscript{2} \;=\;0.120\>{\textpm}\>0.001, baryon density {\textohm} \textsubscript{b} {$<$}italic{$>$}h{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsuperscript{2} \;=\;0.0224\>{\textpm}\>0.0001, scalar spectral index {$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{s} \;=\;0.965\>{\textpm}\>0.004, and optical depth {$<$}italic{$>\tau<$}/italic{$>$} \;=\;0.054\>{\textpm}\>0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100 {$<$}italic{$>\theta<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{*} \;=\;1.0411\>{\textpm}\>0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant {$<$}italic{$>$}H{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{0} \;=\;(67.4\>{\textpm}\>0.5)\hspace{0.166em}\hspace{0.166em}km\hspace{0.166em}s \textsuperscript{-1} \hspace{0.166em}Mpc \textsuperscript{-1} ; matter density parameter {\textohm} \textsubscript{m} \;=\;0.315\>{\textpm}\>0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude {$<$}italic{$>\sigma<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{8} \;=\;0.811\>{\textpm}\>0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be {$<$}italic{$>$}N{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{eff} \;=\;2.99\>{\textpm}\>0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction {$<$}italic{$>$}N{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{eff} \;=\;3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$} {$<$}italic{$>$}m{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{ {$<$}italic{$>\nu<$}/italic{$>$} } \;\&lt; \;0.12\hspace{0.166em}\hspace{0.166em}eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2 {$<$}italic{$>\sigma<$}/italic{$>$} , which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {\textohm} \textsubscript{ {$<$}italic{$>$}K{$<$}/italic{$>$} } \;=\;0.001\>{\textpm}\>0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be {$<$}italic{$>$}w{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{0} \;=\;-1.03\>{\textpm}\>0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio {$<$}italic{$>$}r{$<$}/italic{$>$} \textsubscript{0.002} \;\&lt; \;0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The {$<$}italic{$>$}Planck{$<$}/italic{$>$} base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6 {$<$}italic{$>\sigma<$}/italic{$>$} , tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the {$<$}italic{$>$}Planck{$<$}/italic{$>$} data. {$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {We use deep Chandra X-ray imaging to measure the distribution of specific black hole accretion rates (LX relative to the stellar mass of the galaxy) and thus trace AGN activity within star-forming and quiescent galaxies, as a function of stellar mass (from 108.5--1011.5M{$\odot$}) and redshift (to z {$\sim$} 4). We adopt near-infrared selected samples of galaxies from the CANDELS and UltraVISTA surveys, extract X-ray data for every galaxy, and use a flexible Bayesian method to combine these data and to measure the probability distribution function of specific black hole accretion rates, {$\lambda$}sBHAR. We identify a broad distribution of {$\lambda$}sBHAR in both starforming and quiescent galaxies---likely reflecting the stochastic nature of AGN fuelling---with a roughly power-law shape that rises toward lower {$\lambda$}sBHAR, a steep cutoff at {$\lambda$}sBHAR 0.1-1 (in Eddington equivalent units), and a turnover or flattening at {$\lambda$}sBHAR 10-3 - 10-2. We find that the probability of a star-forming galaxy hosting a moderate {$\lambda$}sBHAR AGN depends on stellar mass and evolves with redshift, shifting toward higher {$\lambda$}sBHAR at higher redshifts. This evolution is truncated at a point corresponding to the Eddington limit, indicating black holes may self-regulate their growth at high redshifts when copious gas is available. The probability of a quiescent galaxy hosting an AGN is generally lower than that of a star-forming galaxy, shows signs of suppression at the highest stellar masses, and evolves strongly with redshift. The AGN duty cycle in high-redshift (z 2) quiescent galaxies thus reaches {$\sim$}20 per cent, comparable to the duty cycle in star-forming galaxies of equivalent stellar mass and redshift.},

  abstract = {JWST has now revealed a population of broad-line AGN at \$z{$>$}4\$ characterized by a distinctive SED shape, with very red rest-frame optical and very blue rest-frame UV continuum. While the optical continuum is thought to originate from the accretion disk, the origin of the UV continuum has been largely unclear. We report the detection of the strong rest-frame UV emission lines of CIII]\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda\$1907,1909 and CIV\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda\$1549,1551 in a "little red dot" AGN, COS-66964. Spectroscopically confirmed at \$z=7.0371\$, COS-66964 exhibits broad H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission (FWHM \${\textbackslash}sim 2000\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), and weak broad H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, implying significant dust attenuation to the BLR (\$A\_V = 3.9{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}\_\{-0.9\}\$). The H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line width implies a central SMBH mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} = {\textbackslash}left(1.9{\textasciicircum}\{+1.6\}\_\{-0.7\}{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and an Eddington ratio \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}sim0.3\$-\$0.5\$. While marginal HeII\${\textbackslash}lambda4687\$ and [FeX]\${\textbackslash}lambda6376\$ detections further indicate that the AGN dominates in the rest-frame optical, the non-detection of HeII\${\textbackslash}lambda1640\$ in the UV despite high EW CIII] and CIV (\${\textbackslash}sim 35\$ {\AA}) is more consistent with photoionization by massive stars. The non-detection of MgII\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda\$2800 is similarly inconsistent with an AGN scattered light interpretation. Assuming the rest-frame UV is dominated by stellar light, we derive a stellar mass of \${\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}star/M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}sim8.5\$, implying an elevated \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}/M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ ratio \${\textbackslash}sim2\$ orders of magnitude above the local relation, but consistent with other high-\$z\$ AGN discovered by JWST. The source is unresolved in all bands, implying a very compact size \${\textbackslash}lesssim200\$ pc in the UV. This suggests that the simultaneous buildup of compact stellar populations (i.e., galaxy bulges) and the central SMBH is ongoing even at \$z{$>$}7\$.},

  abstract = {Cosmic dust is an essential component shaping both the evolution of galaxies and their observational signatures. How quickly dust builds up in the early Universe remains an open question that requires deep observations at (sub-)millimetre wavelengths to resolve. Here, we use Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations of 45 galaxies from the Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) and its pilot programs, designed to target [C II] and dust emission in UV-selected galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 7, to investigate the dust content of high-redshift galaxies through a stacking analysis. We find that the typical fraction of obscured star formation fobs = SFRIR/SFRUV+IR depends on stellar mass, similar to what is observed at lower redshift, and ranges from fobs {$\approx$} 0.3 - 0.6 for galaxies with log10(M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$}) = 9.4-10.4. We further adopt the z {\textasciitilde} 7 stellar mass function from the literature to extract the obscured cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) from the REBELS survey. Our results suggest only a modest decrease in the SFRD between 3 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 7, with dust-obscured star formation still contributing \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}30\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ at z {\textasciitilde} 7. While we extensively discuss potential caveats, our analysis highlights the continued importance of dust-obscured star formation even well into the epoch of reionization.},

  abstract = {With the Hubble Frontier Fields program, gravitational lensing has provided a powerful way to extend the study of the ultraviolet luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at \$z\$ {$\sim$} 6 down to unprecedented magnitude limits. At the same time, significant discrepancies between different studies were found at the very faint end of the LF. In an attempt to understand such disagreements, we present a comprehensive assessment of the uncertainties associated with the lensing models and the size distribution of galaxies. We use end-to-end simulations from the source plane to the final LF that account for all lensing effects and systematic uncertainties by comparing several mass models. In addition to the size distribution, the choice of lens model leads to large differences at magnitudes fainter than MUV = -15 AB mag, where the magnification factor becomes highly uncertain. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations that include all these uncertainties at the individual galaxy level to compute the final LF, allowing, in particular, a crossover between magnitude bins. The best LF fit, using a modified Schechter function that allows for a turnover at faint magnitudes, gives a faint-end slope of \${\textbackslash}alpha=-2.01\_\{-0.14\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$, a curvature parameter of \${\textbackslash}beta=0.48\_\{-0.25\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.49\}\$, and a turnover magnitude of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{T\}\}=-14.93\_\{-0.52\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.61\}\$. Most importantly, our procedure shows that robust constraints on the LF at magnitudes fainter than MUV = -15 AB remain unrealistic, as the 95\,per\,cent confidence interval accommodates both a turnover and a steep faint-end slope. More accurate lens modeling and future observations of lensing clusters with the James Webb Space Telescope can reliably extend the ultraviolet (UV) LF to fainter magnitudes.},

  abstract = {We determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) using an area of 143 deg{\textasciicircum}2 from the first three years of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r {$<$} 19.4 mag over two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H\_0 = 70, the GSMF is well described between 10{\textasciicircum}8 and 10{\textasciicircum}11.5 Msun using a double Schechter function with mass{\textasciicircum}* = 10{\textasciicircum}10.66 Msun, phi\_1{\textasciicircum}* = 3.96 x 10{\textasciicircum}-3 Mpc{\textasciicircum}-3, alpha\_1 = -0.35, phi\_2{\textasciicircum}* = 0.79 x 10{\textasciicircum}-3 Mpc{\textasciicircum}-3 and alpha\_2 = -1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r {$<$} 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.},

In this work, we use a novel algorithm that identifies smooth trends in complex data sets and apply it to a sample of 2000 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectra. We detect a sequence in emission line shapes and strengths which reveals a correlation between the narrow L([O III])/L(H {$\beta$}) line ratio and the width of the broad H {$\alpha$}. This scaling relation ties the kinematics of the gas clouds in the broad line region to the ionization state of the narrow line region, connecting the properties of gas clouds kiloparsecs away from the black hole to material gravitationally bound to it on sub-parsec scales. This relation can be used to estimate black hole masses from narrow emission lines only. It therefore enables black hole mass estimation for obscured type 2 AGNs and allows us to explore the connection between black holes and host galaxy properties for thousands of objects, well beyond the local Universe. Using this technique, we present the MBH-{$\sigma$} and MBH-M* scaling relations for a sample of about 10 000 type 2 AGNs from Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These relations are remarkably consistent with those observed for type 1 AGNs, suggesting that this new method may perform as reliably as the classical estimate used in non-obscured type 1 AGNs. These findings open a new window for studies of black hole-host galaxy co-evolution throughout cosmic time.},

  abstract = {We present a method to flexibly and self-consistently determine individual galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) from their host haloes' potential well depths, assembly histories, and redshifts. The method is constrained by galaxies' observed stellar mass functions, SFRs (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions, UV--stellar mass relations, IRX--UV relations, auto- and cross-correlation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0 \&lt; z \&lt; 10. Key findings include the following: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z \&lt; 0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching time-scales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar -- halo mass ratios at early times; and, none the less, stellar mass--halo mass ratios rise at z \&gt; 5. Also presented are revised stellar mass -- halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching time-scale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities. The public data release (DR1) includes the massively parallel (\&gt;105 cores) implementation (the UniverseMachine), the newly compiled and remeasured observational data, derived galaxy formation constraints, and mock catalogues including lightcones.},

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z{\textasciitilde}1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z{\textasciitilde}1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a {$\Lambda$}-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z{\textasciitilde}1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

We find clear correlations for all of these scaling relationships, and the best-fit correlations are generally in good agreement with the sample of early-type galaxies with M BH from dynamical modeling and the sample of megamasers. We also find good agreement with the expectations from the Illustris simulations, although the agreement with other simulations is less clear because of the different black hole mass ranges that are probed. \{M\}BH\vphantom\{\}\{--\}\{L\}bulge\vphantom\{\} is found to have the least scatter, and is therefore the best predictor of M BH among the relationships examined here. Large photometric surveys that rely on automated analysis and forego bulge-to-disk decompositions will achieve more accurate M BH predictions if they rely on \{M\}BH\vphantom\{\}\{--\}\{M\}stars\vphantom\{\} rather than \{M\}BH\vphantom\{\}\{--\}\{L\}galaxy\vphantom\{\}. Finally, we have examined M BH/M stars and find a clear trend with black hole mass but not galaxy mass. This trend is also exhibited by galaxies with M BH from dynamical modeling and megamaser galaxies, as well as simulated galaxies from Illustris, rising from {$\sim$}0.01\% at 106 M {$\odot$} to {$\sim$}1.0\% at 1010 M {$\odot$}. This scaling should be taken into account when comparing galaxy samples that are not matched in M BH.},

  abstract = {A sample of 18 286 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) is presented, constructed by combining the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with the NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory) VLA (Very Large Array) Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimetres (FIRST) survey. Using this sample, the differences between radio galaxies of 'high-excitation' ('quasar-mode'; hereafer HERG) and 'low-excitation' ('radio-mode'; LERG) are investigated. A primary difference between the two radio source classes is the distinct nature of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate on to their central black holes: HERGs typically have accretion rates between one per cent and 10 per cent of their Eddington rate, whereas LERGs predominately accrete at a rate below one per cent Eddington. This is consistent with models whereby the population dichotomy is caused by a switch between radiatively efficient and radiatively inefficient accretion modes at low accretion rates. Local radio luminosity functions are derived separately for the two populations, for the first time, showing that although LERGs dominate at low radio luminosity and HERGs begin to take over at L1.4 GHz{$\sim$} 1026 W Hz-1, examples of both classes are found at all radio luminosities. Using the V/Vmax test it is shown that the two populations show differential cosmic evolution at fixed radio luminosity: HERGs evolve strongly at all radio luminosities, while LERGs show weak or no evolution. This suggests that the luminosity dependence of the evolution previously seen in the radio luminosity function is driven, at least in part, by the changing relative contributions of these two populations with luminosity. The host galaxies of the radio sources are also distinct: HERGs are typically of lower stellar mass, with lower black hole masses, bluer colours, lower concentration indices and less pronounced 4000 {\AA} breaks indicating younger stellar populations. Even if samples are matched in radio luminosity and stellar and black hole masses, significant differences still remain between the accretion rates, stellar populations and structural properties of the host galaxies of the two radio source classes. These results offer strong support to the developing picture of radio-loud AGN in which HERGs are fuelled at high rates through radiatively efficient standard accretion discs by cold gas, perhaps brought in through mergers and interactions, while LERGs are fuelled via radiatively inefficient flows at low accretion rates. In this picture, the gas supplying the LERGs is frequently associated with the hot X-ray haloes surrounding massive galaxies, groups and clusters, as part of a radio-AGN feedback loop.},

To obtain these results, we derive the stellar masses of our sample by fitting synthetic stellar population models to their observed spectral energy distribution with the inclusion of nebular emission lines. This is the deepest and farthest in distance mass function measured to date and probes down to a level of M\$\_\{*\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{6.8\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The main result of this study is that the low-mass end of our GSMF to these limits and redshifts appears to become steeper from \$-1.98\_\{-0.07\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\$ at \$z=6\$ to \$-2.38\_\{-0.88\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.72\}\$ at \$z=9\$, steeper than previously observed mass functions at slightly lower redshifts, and we find no evidence of turnover in the mass range probed. We furthermore demonstrate that the UV LF for these system also appears to show a steepening at the highest redshifts, without any evidence of turnover in the luminosity range probed. Our \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{UV\}\}-M\_\{*\}\$ relation exhibit shallower slopes than previously observed and are in accordance with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Integrating our GSMF, we find that the stellar mass density increases by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim15\_\{-6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+21\}\$ from \$z=9\$ to \$z=6\$. We estimate the dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) to calculate the specific star formation rates (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{sSFR\}={\textbackslash}mathrm\{SFR/M\_\{*\}\}\$) of our sample, and find that for a fixed stellar mass of \$5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, sSFR \${\textbackslash}propto(1+z){\textasciicircum}\{2.01{\textbackslash}pm0.16\}\$. Finally, from our new measurements, we estimate the UV luminosity density (\${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{UV\}\}\$) and find that our results support a smooth decline of \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{UV\}\}\$ towards high redshifts.},

The deep near-infrared imaging available in the two independent fields, in addition to deep optical (including z'-band) data, enables the sample of z {$\simeq$} 6 star-forming galaxies to be securely detected longward of the break (in contrast to several previous studies). We show that the expected contamination rate of our initial sample by cool Galactic brown dwarfs is {$\lessequivlnt$}3 per cent and demonstrate that they can be effectively removed by fitting brown dwarf spectral templates to the photometry. At z {$\simeq$} 6, the galaxy surface density in the UltraVISTA field exceeds that in the UDS by a factor of {$\simeq$} 1.8, indicating strong cosmic variance even between degree-scale fields at z {$>$} 5. We calculate the bright end of the rest-frame Ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at z {$\simeq$} 6. The galaxy number counts are a factor of {$\sim$}1.7 lower than predicted by the recent LF determination by Bouwens et al. In comparison to other smaller area studies, we find an evolution in the characteristic magnitude between z {$\simeq$} 5 and z {$\simeq$} 7 of {$\Delta$}M* {$\sim$} 0.4, and show that a double power law or a Schechter function can equally well describe the LF at z = 6. Furthermore, the bright end of the LF appears to steepen from z {$\simeq$} 7 to z {$\simeq$} 5, which could indicate the onset of mass quenching or the rise of dust obscuration, a conclusion supported by comparing the observed LFs to a range of theoretical model predictions.},

The sample was initially selected from 1.65 deg2 of ground-based imaging in the UltraVISTA/COSMOS and UDS/SXDS fields, and includes the extreme Lyman {$\alpha$} emitters, 'Himiko' and 'CR7'. A deconfusion analysis of the deep Spitzer photometry available suggests that these galaxies exhibit strong rest-frame optical nebular emission lines (EW0(H{$\beta$} + [O III]) {$>$} 600 {\AA}). We find that irregular, multiple-component morphologies suggestive of clumpy or merging systems are common (fmulti {$>$} 0.4) in bright z {$\simeq$} 7 galaxies, and ubiquitous at the very bright end (MUV {$<$} -22.5). The galaxies have half-light radii in the range r1/2 {$\sim$} 0.5-3 kpc. The size measurements provide the first determination of the size-luminosity relation at z {$\simeq$} 7 that extends to MUV {$\sim$} -23. We find the relation to be steep with r1/2 {$\propto$} L1/2. Excluding clumpy, multicomponent galaxies however, we find a shallower relation that implies an increased star formation rate surface density in bright LBGs. Using the new, independent, HST/WFC3 data we confirm that the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z {$\simeq$} 7 favours a power-law decline at the bright end, compared to an exponential Schechter function drop-off. Finally, these results have important implications for the Euclid mission, which we predict will detect {$>$}1000 similarly bright galaxies at z {$\simeq$} 7. Our new HST imaging suggests that the vast majority of these galaxies will be spatially resolved by Euclid, mitigating concerns over dwarf star contamination.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of {$\sim$} 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z \&amp;lt; 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 M{$\odot$} yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010--1011 M{$\odot$}), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* \&amp;gt; 1010 M{$\odot$}. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}{$\quad$}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

All earlier studies have derived this relation from integrated properties of galaxies. We recover the same relation from an analysis of spatially-resolved properties, with integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of 306 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We consider the SFR surface density in units of log(M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) and the stellar mass surface density in units of log(M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ Kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) in individual spaxels which probe spatial scales of 0.5-1.5 Kpc. This local relation exhibits a high degree of correlation with small scatter (\${\textbackslash}sigma = 0.23\$ dex), irrespective of the dominant ionisation source of the host galaxy or its integrated stellar mass. We highlight: \$(i)\$ the integrated star formation main sequence formed by galaxies whose dominant ionisation process is related to star formation, for which we find a slope of 0.81 \${\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$; (ii) the spatially-resolved relation obtained with the spaxel analysis, we find a slope of 0.72 \${\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$; (iii) for the integrated main sequence we identified also a sequence formed by galaxies that are dominated by an old stellar population, which we have called the retired galaxies sequence.},

COSMOS-Web is a contiguous 0.54 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ NIRCam imaging survey in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W) that will reach 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ point source depths ranging \${\textbackslash}sim\$27.5-28.2 magnitudes. In parallel, we will obtain 0.19 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ of MIRI imaging in one filter (F770W). COSMOS-Web will build on the rich heritage of multiwavelength observations and data products available in the COSMOS field. The design of COSMOS-Web is motivated by three primary science goals: (1) to discover thousands of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (\$64\$ and place constraints on the formation of the Universe's most massive galaxies (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star{$>$}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\${\textbackslash},M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), and (3) directly measure the evolution of the stellar mass to halo mass relation using weak gravitational lensing out to \$z{\textbackslash}sim2.5\$ and measure its variance with galaxies' star formation histories and morphologies. In addition, we anticipate COSMOS-Web's legacy value to reach far beyond these scientific goals, touching many other areas of astrophysics, such as the identification of the first direct collapse black hole candidates, ultracool sub-dwarf stars in the Galactic halo, and possibly the identification of \$z{$>$}10\$ pair-instability supernovae. In this paper we provide an overview of the survey's key measurements, specifications, goals, and prospects for new discovery.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{$>$}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}{\textasciitilde}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2 Msolar and {$\sigma$}{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {$>$}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability. The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

The 393 objects observed cover a 26.2 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} area and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B {\textasciitilde} 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a "fundamental plane" in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L\_*\_ at z {$>$} 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z {$<$} 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxy anomalies, such as their abundance and cusp-core problems, remain a prime challenge in our understanding of galaxy formation. The inclusion of baryonic physics could potentially solve these issues, but the efficiency of stellar feedback is still controversial. We analytically explore the possibility of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies and compare AGN and supernova (SN) feedback. We assume the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole within low-mass galaxies and standard scaling relations between the relevant physical quantities. We model the propagation and properties of the outflow and explore the critical condition for global gas ejection. Performing the same calculation for SNe, we compare the ability of AGNs and SNe to drive gas out of galaxies. We find that a critical halo mass exists below which AGN feedback can remove gas from the host halo and that the critical halo mass for an AGN is greater than the equivalent for SNe in a significant part of the parameter space, suggesting that an AGN could provide an alternative and more successful source of negative feedback than SNe, even in the most massive dwarf galaxies.},

At \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>>$} 2.5 we use new precise photometric redshifts with error \emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{z{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} = 0.03(1 + \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$}) and an outlier fraction of 12\%, estimated by means of the unique spectroscopic sample of COSMOS ({\textasciitilde}100 000 spectroscopic measurements in total, more than one thousand having robust \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{spec{$<$}sub/{$>>$} 2.5). The increased exposure time in the DR2, along with our panchromatic detection strategy, allow us to improve the completeness at high \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} with respect to previous UltraVISTA catalogues (e.g. our sample is {$>$}75\% complete at 10\textsuperscript{10{$<$}sup/{$>$} {$M$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 5). We also identify passive galaxies through a robust colour--colour selection, extending their SMF estimate up to \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 4. Our work provides a comprehensive view of galaxy-stellar-mass assembly between \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.1 and 6, for the first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We fit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington bias. We compare the SMF fit with the halo mass function predicted from {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations, finding that at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>>$} 3 both functions decline with a similar slope in thehigh-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming that mechanisms quenching star formation in massive haloes become less effective at high redshifts; however further work needs to be done to confirm this scenario. Concerning the SMF low-mass end, it shows a progressive steepening as it moves towards higher redshifts, with \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} decreasing from -1.47\textsuperscript{+0.02{$<$}sup/{$>$}\textsubscript{-0.02{$<$}sub/{$>$} at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\simeq$} 0.1 to -2.11\textsuperscript{+0.30{$<$}sup/{$>$}\textsubscript{-0.13{$<$}sub/{$>$} at \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\simeq$} 5. This slope depends on the characterisation of the observational uncertainties, which is crucial to properly remove the Eddington bias. We show that there is currently no consensus on the method to quantify such errors: different error models result in different best-fit Schechter parameters.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We have conducted an image analysis of the (current) full sample of 44 spiral galaxies with directly measured supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, MBH, to determine each galaxy's logarithmic spiral arm pitch angle, {$\phi$}. For predicting black hole masses, we have derived the relation: log (MBH/M{$\odot$}) = (7.01 {\textpm} 0.07) - (0.171 {\textpm} 0.017)[{\textbar}{$\phi\vert$} - 15{$^\circ$}]. The total root mean square scatter associated with this relation is 0.43 dex in the log MBH direction, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.30 {\textpm} 0.08 dex. The MBH-{$\phi$} relation is therefore at least as accurate at predicting SMBH masses in spiral galaxies as the other known relations. By definition, the existence of an MBH-{$\phi$} relation demands that the SMBH mass must correlate with the galaxy discs in some manner. Moreover, with the majority of our sample (37 of 44) classified in the literature as having a pseudobulge morphology, we additionally reveal that the SMBH mass correlates with the large-scale spiral pattern and thus the discs of galaxies hosting pseudobulges. Furthermore, given that the MBH-{$\phi$} relation is capable of estimating black hole masses in bulge-less spiral galaxies, it therefore has great promise for predicting which galaxies may harbour intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, MBH {$<$} 105 M{$\odot$}). Extrapolating from the current relation, we predict that galaxies with {\textbar}{$\phi\vert$} {$\geq$} 26.7{$^\circ$} should possess IMBHs.},

The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the "cold" dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s-1. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).},

This yields a new estimate of the evolution of UV luminosity density (\${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\}\$), and hence cosmic star-formation rate density (\${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$) out to within \${$<$} 300\${\textbackslash}, Myr of the Big Bang. Our results confirm that the high-redshift LF is best described by a double power-law (rather than a Schechter) function up to \$z{\textbackslash}sim10\$, and that the LF and the resulting derived \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\}\$ (and thus \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$), continues to decline gradually and steadily up to \$z{\textbackslash}sim15\$ (as anticipated from previous studies which analysed the pre-existing data in a consistent manner to this study). We provide details of the 61 high-redshift galaxy candidates, 47 of which are new, that have enabled this new analysis. Our sample contains 6 galaxies at \$z {\textbackslash}ge 12\$, one of which appears to set a new redshift record as an apparently robust galaxy candidate at \$z {\textbackslash}simeq 16.4\$, the properties of which we therefore consider in detail. The advances presented here emphasize the importance of achieving high dynamic range in studies of early galaxy evolution, and re-affirm the enormous potential of forthcoming larger JWST programmes to transform our understanding of the young Universe.},

The deep near-infrared observations allow us to construct the stellar mass function at \$z {\textbackslash}geq 6\$ directly for the first time. We estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular line and continuum emission. The observed UV luminosity functions for the samples are consistent with previous observations, however we find that the observed \$M\_\{UV\}\$ - M\$\_\{*\}\$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constant mass to light ratio and a normalisation which evolves with redshift. Our stellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes (\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}approx -1.9\$), steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of the UV luminosity function. Integrating our new mass functions, we find the observed stellar mass density evolves from \${\textbackslash}log\_\{10\} {\textbackslash}rho\_\{*\} = 6.64{\textasciicircum}\{+0.58\}\_\{-0.89\}\$ at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 7\$ to \$7.36{\textbackslash}pm0.06\$ \${\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}text\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 4\$. Finally, combining the measured UV continuum slopes (\${\textbackslash}beta\$) with their rest-frame UV luminosities, we calculate dust corrected star-formation rates (SFR) for our sample. We find the specific star-formation rate for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst the global SFR density falls rapidly over this period. Our new SFR density estimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.},

All three images are very compact, i.e., unresolved, with a delensed size upper limit of r e {$\lessequivlnt$} 35 pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of m F444W {$\sim$} 25-26 AB, and the magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of the source is M UV,1450 = -16.81 {\textpm} 0.09. From the sum of observed fluxes and from a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, we obtain estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the source of L bol {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1043 erg s-1 and L bol {$\sim$} 1044--1046 erg s-1, respectively. Based on its compact, point-like appearance, its position in color--color space, and the SED analysis, we tentatively conclude that this object is a UV-faint dust-obscured quasar-like object, i.e., an active galactic nucleus at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for the object's emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being magnified---and thus intrinsically even more compact---and that it occupies notably distinct regions in both size--luminosity and color--color space. Planned UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more detailed analysis of this object.},

  abstract = {A semi-empirical model is presented that describes the distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the cosmic web. It populates dark-matter halos in N-body simulations (MultiDark) with galaxy stellar masses using empirical relations based on abundance matching techniques, and then paints accretion events on these galaxies using stateof-the-art measurements of the AGN occupation of galaxies. The explicit assumption is that the large-scale distribution of AGN is independent of the physics of blackhole fueling. The model is shown to be consistent with current measurements of the two-point correlation function of AGN samples. It is then used to make inferences on the halo occupation of the AGN population. Mock AGN are found in halos with a broad distribution of masses with a mode of {$\approx$} 1012 h-1 M and a tail extending to cluster-size halos. The clustering properties of the model AGN depend only weakly on accretion luminosity and redshift. The fraction of satellite AGN in the model increases steeply toward more massive halos, in contrast with some recent observational results. This discrepancy, if confirmed, could point to a dependence of the halo occupation of AGN on the physics of black-hole fueling.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed and self-consistent modeling of the cosmic X-ray background (XRB) based on the most up-to-date X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The large body of observational results collected by soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) X-ray surveys are used to constrain at best the properties of the Compton-thin AGN population and its contribution to the XRB emission. The number ratio R between moderately obscured (Compton-thin) AGN and unobscured AGN is fixed by the comparison between the soft and hard XLFs, which suggests that R decreases from 4 at low luminosities to 1 at high luminosities. From the same comparison there is no clear evidence of an evolution of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift. The distribution of the absorbing column densities in obscured AGN is determined by matching the soft and hard source counts. A distribution rising towards larger column densities is able to reproduce the soft and hard AGN counts over about 6 dex in flux. The model also reproduces with excellent accuracy the fraction of obscured objects in AGN samples selected at different X-ray fluxes. The integrated emission of the Compton-thin AGN population is found to underestimate the XRB flux at about 30 keV, calling for an additional population of extremely obscured (Compton-thick) AGN. Since the number of Compton-thick sources required to fit the 30 keV XRB emission strongly depends on the spectral templates assumed for unobscured and moderately obscured AGN, we explored the effects of varying the spectral templates. In particular, in addition to the column density distribution, we also considered a distribution in the intrinsic powerlaw spectral indices of variable width. In our baseline model a Gaussian distribution of photon indices with mean \&lt; {$\Gamma$} \&gt;=1.9 and dispersion {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{{$\Gamma$}}=0.2 is assumed. This increases the contribution of the Compton-thin AGN population to the 30 keV XRB intensity by {\textasciitilde}30\% with respect to the case of null dispersion (i.e. a single primary AGN powerlaw with {$\Gamma$}=1.9) but is not sufficient to match the 30 keV XRB emission. Therefore a population of heavily obscured -Compton-thick- AGN, as large as that of moderately obscured AGN, is required to fit the residual background emission. Remarkably, the fractions of Compton-thick AGN observed in the Chandra Deep Field South and in the first INTEGRAL and Swift catalogs of AGN selected above 10 keV are in excellent agreement with the model predictions.},

  abstract = {Aims. Understanding the link between the galaxy properties and the dark matter halos they reside in and their coevolution is a powerful tool for constraining the processes related to galaxy formation. In particular, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe provides insights on galaxy formation models and allows us to assign galaxy masses to halos in N-body dark matter simulations. To address these questions, we determine the SHMR throughout the entire cosmic history from z {$\sim$} 4 to the present. Methods. We used a statistical approach to link the observed galaxy stellar mass functions on the COSMOS field to dark matter halo mass functions up to z {$\sim$} 4 from the {$\Lambda$}CDM DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulation, which is complete for M h {$>$} 10 12.5 M , and extended this to lower masses with a theoretical parameterization. We propose an empirical model to describe the evolution of the SHMR as a function of redshift (either in the presence or absence of a scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass), and compare the results with several literature works and semianalytic models of galaxy formation. We also tested the reliability of our results by comparing them to observed galaxy stellar mass functions and to clustering measurements. Results. We derive the SHMR from z = 0 to z = 4, and model its empirical evolution with redshift. We find that M * /M h is always lower than {$\sim$} 0.05 and depends both on redshift and halo mass, with a bell shape that peaks at M h {$\sim$} 10 12 M. Assuming a constant cosmic baryon fraction, we calculate the star-formation efficiency of galaxies and find that it is generally low; its peak increases with cosmic time from {$\sim$} 30\% at z {$\sim$} 4 to {$\sim$} 35\% at z {$\sim$} 0. Moreover, the star formation efficiency increases for increasing redshifts at masses higher than the peak of the SHMR, while the trend is reversed for masses lower than the peak. This indicates that massive galaxies (i.e., galaxies hosted at halo masses higher than the SHMR peak) formed with a higher efficiency at higher redshifts (i.e., downsizing effect) and vice versa for low-mass halos. We find a large scatter in results from semianalytic models, with a difference of up to a factor {$\sim$} 8 compared to our results, and an opposite evolutionary trend at high halo masses. By comparing our results with those in the literature, we find that while at z {$\sim$} 0 all results agree well (within a factor of {$\sim$} 3), at z {$>$} 0 many differences emerge. This suggests that observational and theoretical work still needs to be done. Our results agree well (within {$\sim$} 10\%) with observed stellar mass functions (out to z = 4) and observed clustering of massive galaxies (M * {$>$} 10 11 M from z {$\sim$} 0.5 to z {$\sim$} 1.1) in the two-halo regime.},

Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or an AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60\% show definitive evidence for broad-line H{$\alpha$} with a FWHM {$>$} 2000 km s -1, 20\% of the current data are inconclusive, and 20\% are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z {$>$} 5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield {$>$}80\% AGN. Remarkably, among all z phot {$>$} 5 galaxies with F277W -- F444W {$>$} 1 in UNCOVER at least 33\% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80\% AGN for sources with F277W -- F444W {$>$} 1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 107--109 M {$\odot$}. While their UV luminosities (-16 {$>$} M UV {$>$} -20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 107--109 M {$\odot$} black holes radiating at {$\sim$}10\%--40\% the Eddington limit. The number densities are surprisingly high at {$\sim$}10-5 Mpc-3 mag-1, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for {$\sim$}1\% of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV faintness suggests they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.},

Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range Mh {$\sim$} 1010--1012 M{$\odot$}, and we focus on z~= 0.25 and z~= 2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only {$\sim$}L{$\star$} haloes retain a baryon mass \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textbackslash}! 50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by haloes, with a retention fraction \${\textbackslash}gtrsim{\textbackslash}! 50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$. Across all masses and redshifts analysed \${\textbackslash}gtrsim {\textbackslash}!60{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ of the CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with infalling haloes). Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in {$\sim$}L{$\star$} haloes. Gas can persist in the CGM for billions of years, resulting in well mixed-halo gas. Sightlines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift {$\sim$}L{$\star$} haloes, cool gas (T \&amp;lt; 104.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 dex), although CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational efforts to develop a cohesive picture.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

JWST and Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution images reveal that the majority of them show extended morphologies indicating significant contribution to the total lights from their host galaxies, except for three compact objects two of which show red spectral energy distributions, probably in a transition phase from faint AGNs to low luminosity quasars. Careful AGN-host decomposition analyses show that their host's stellar masses are systematically lower than the local relation between the black hole mass and the stellar mass, implying a fast black hole growth consistent with predictions from theoretical simulations. A high fraction of the broad-line AGNs ({$\sim$}5\%), higher than z {$\sim$} 0, indicates that the number density of such faint AGNs is higher than an extrapolation of the quasar luminosity function, implying a large population of AGNs in the early universe.

In conjunction with nine galaxies at redshifts up to z spec = 13.20 in the literature, we make a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in total and carefully derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions. These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift evolution toward z {\textasciitilde} 12, showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at z {\textasciitilde} 12 beyond the constant star formation efficiency models, which supports earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating the {$\Lambda$}CDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm star-forming galaxies at z spec = 11-13 with stellar masses much higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high star formation efficiency ({$>$}5\%), a hidden active galactic nucleus, a top-heavy initial mass function (possibly with Population III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for efficiently removing low-redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.},

For the first time we are able to derive reliable space densities for low-luminosity (Seyfert-type) X-ray sources at cosmological redshifts. The evolutionary behaviour of AGN shows a strong dependence on X-ray luminosity: while the space density of high-luminosity AGN reaches a peak around z{$\sim$} 2, similar to that of optically selected QSO, the space density of low-luminosity AGNs peaks at redshifts below z=1. This confirms previous ROSAT findings of a luminosity-dependent density evolution. Using a rigorous treatment of the optical identification completeness we are able to show that the space density of AGN with X-ray luminosities L\textsubscript{x} \&lt; 10\textsuperscript{45} erg s\textsuperscript{-1} declines significantly towards high redshifts.},

  abstract = {This paper is the second part of a work investigating the properties of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (AGN) by means of multicomponent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. It focuses on low-luminosity, low-redshift (z{$\leq$} 0.25) AGN selected among emission line galaxies in the overlapping regions between Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 as well as X-ray, radio and mid-infrared selected type 2 AGN samples from the literature. The available multiband photometry covers the spectral range from the u band up to 160 {$\mu$}m. Using a standard {$\chi$}2 minimization, the observed SED of each object is fit to a set of multicomponent models comprising a stellar component, a high optical depth ({$\tau$}9.7{$\geq$} 1.0) torus and cold emission from a starburst (SB). The torus components assigned to the majority of the objects were those of the highest optical depth of our grid of models ({$\tau$}9.7= 10.0). The contribution of the various components (stars, torus, SB) is reflected in the position of the objects on the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) colour diagram, with star-, torus- and SB-dominated objects occupying specific areas of the diagrams and composite objects lying in between. The comparison of type 1 (as derived from Hatziminaoglou et al.) and type 2 AGN properties is broadly consistent with the unified scheme. The estimated ratio between type 2 and 1 objects is about 2--2.5:1. The AGN accretion-to-infrared luminosity ratio is an indicator of the obscuration of the AGN since it scales down with the covering factor. We find evidence supporting the receding torus paradigm, with the estimated fraction of obscured AGN, derived from the distribution of the covering factor, decreasing with increasing optical luminosity ({$\lambda$}L5100) over four orders of magnitude. The average star formation rates (SFRs) are of {$\sim$}10 M{$\odot$} yr-1 for the low-z sample, {$\sim$}40 M{$\odot$} yr-1 for the other type 2 AGN and {$\sim$}115 M{$\odot$} yr-1 for the quasars; this result however, might simply reflect observational biases, as the quasars under study were one to two orders of magnitude more luminous than the various type 2 AGN. For the large majority of objects with 70 and/or 160 {$\mu$}m detections, an SB component was needed in order to reproduce the data points, implying that the far-infrared emission in AGN arises mostly from star formation; moreover, the SB-to-AGN luminosity ratio shows a slight trend with increasing luminosity.},

We use the stellar velocity dispersions of the early-type galaxies and AGN hosts to estimate their black hole masses, and we use the AGN [O III] {$\lambda$}5007 emission line luminosities to estimate black hole accretion rates. We find that most present-day accretion occurs onto black holes with masses less than 108 Msolar that reside in moderately massive galaxies (M*{\textasciitilde}1010-1011.5 Msolar) with high stellar surface mass densities ({$\mu$}*{\textasciitilde}108.5-109.5 Msolar kpc-2) and young stellar populations. The volume-averaged accretion rates of low-mass black holes ({$<$}3{\texttimes}107 Msolar) imply that this population is growing on a timescale that is comparable to the age of the universe. Around half this growth takes place in AGNs that are radiating within a factor of 5 of the Eddington luminosity. Such systems are rare, making up only 0.2\% of the low-mass black hole population at the present day. The rest of the growth occurs in lower luminosity AGNs. The growth timescale is more than 2 orders of magnitude longer for the population of the most massive black holes in our sample. The volume-averaged ratio of star formation to black hole accretion in bulge-dominated galaxies is {\textasciitilde}1000, in remarkable agreement with the observed ratio of stellar mass to black hole mass in nearby galaxy bulges. We conclude that (1) bulge formation and black hole formation are tightly coupled, even in present-day galaxies, and (2) the evolution of the AGN luminosity function documented in recent optical and X-ray surveys is driven by a decrease in the characteristic mass scale of actively accreting black holes.},

  abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of {$\sim$}1\% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in {$\sim$}10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

(2015) version of the Munich galaxy formation model (L-GALAXIES) to investigate why the halo and stellar mass scales above which galaxies are quenched are constant with redshift and coincide with the scale where baryons are most efficiently converted into stars. This model assumes that central galaxies are quenched by AGN feedback when hot halo gas accretes onto a supermassive black hole. Nevertheless, we find that supernova (SN) feedback sets both mass scales. As haloes grow above a threshold mass, SNe can no longer eject material so their hot gas content increases, enhancing the cooling rate onto the central galaxy, its cold gas content, its star formation rate and the growth rate of its central black hole. Strong AGN feedback terminates this short-lived phase by suppressing the fuel supply for star formation. Despite strong evolution of the halo mass - temperature relation, quenching occurs at a redshift-independent halo and stellar mass which coincides with the mass where baryons have been converted into stars with maximal efficiency. These regularities and coincidences are a result of the specific parameters selected by MCMC tuning of the model to fit the observed abundance and passive fraction of galaxies over the redshift range 0},

Importantly, it explores different radiative feedback models that cover the physically plausible parameter space, ranging from a weak and delayed to a strong and immediate reduction of gas mass available for star formation. From our simulation suite that covers the different radiative feedback prescriptions and ionization topologies, we find that radiative feedback continuously reduces star formation in galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ h\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ upon local reionization; larger mass haloes are unaffected even for the strongest and immediate radiative feedback cases during reionization. For this reason, the ionization topologies of different radiative feedback scenarios differ only on scales smaller than 1--2~comoving Mpc, and significant deviations are found only when physical parameters (e.g. the escape fraction of ionizing photons) are altered based on galactic properties. Finally, we find that observables (the ultraviolet luminosity function, stellar mass function, reionization histories and ionization topologies) are hardly affected by the choice of the used stellar population synthesis models that model either single stars or binaries.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The channels of formation and growth of these early, massive black holes are not clear, with scenarios ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate. Here we present the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Halpha emission in a galaxy at z=6.68, which traces a black hole with mass of {\textasciitilde} 4 * 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The host galaxy has low star formation rate ({\textasciitilde} 1 Msun/yr, a factor of 3 below the star forming main sequence). The black hole to stellar mass ratio is {\textasciitilde} 0.4, i.e. about 1,000 times above the local relation, while the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionisation. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.},

We find that the SDSS becomes significantly incomplete at M BH {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 3 {\texttimes} 108 M {$\odot$} or L/L Edd {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 0.07, and that the number densities of Type 1 quasars continue to increase down to these limits.

We estimate the maximum Eddington ratio of Type 1 quasars in the observable universe to be L/L Edd {\textasciitilde} 3. Consistent with our results in Shen \& Kelly, we do not find statistical evidence for a so-called sub-Eddington boundary in the mass-luminosity plane of broad-line quasars, and demonstrate that such an apparent boundary in the observed distribution can be caused by selection effect and errors in virial BH mass estimates. Based on the typical Eddington ratio in a given mass bin, we estimate growth times for the BHs in Type 1 quasars and find that they are comparable to or longer than the age of the universe, implying an earlier phase of accelerated (i.e., with higher Eddington ratios) and possibly obscured growth. The large masses probed by our sample imply that most of our BHs reside in what are locally early-type galaxies, and we interpret our results within the context of models of self-regulated BH growth.},

I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities LEdd. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order LEdd, for stellar-mass accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity {$\gg$}LEdd. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed (v \&gt; 0.2c) outflows from the accretion disc. I show that in similarly beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.},

The second source, CEERS 746 at z = 5.624, is inferred to be a heavily obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured starburst and an unobscured quasar. We estimate its BH mass to be in the range of M BH {$\simeq$} (0.9--4.7) {\texttimes} 107 M {$\odot$}, depending on the level of dust obscuration assumed. We perform SED fitting to derive host stellar masses, M {$\star$}, allowing us to place constraints on the BH--galaxy mass relationship in the lowest mass range yet probed in the early Universe. The M BH/M {$\star$} ratio for CEERS 2782, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical relationship seen in massive galaxies at z = 0. We examine the narrow emission line ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO diagrams is consistent with model predictions for moderately low metallicity AGNs with Z/Z {$\odot$} {$\simeq$} 0.2--0.4. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity, broad-line AGNs at z {$>$} 5 with M BH {$\simeq$} 107 M {$\odot$} demonstrates the capability of JWST to push BH masses closer to the range predicted for the BH seed population and provides a unique opportunity to study the early stages of BH--galaxy assembly.},

  abstract = {Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered numerous faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z {$\sim$} 5 and beyond. These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their co-evolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling {$\sim$} 640 arcmin2. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at 4 {$<$} zphot {$<$} 9, dominated by a point-source like central component ({$\langle$}reff {$\rangle$} {$<$} 130 pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes). Quasar model fitting reveals our objects to be moderately dust extincted (AV {$\sim$} 1.6), which is reflected in their inferred bolometric luminosities of Lbol = 1044-47 erg/s, and fainter UV magnitudes MUV {$\simeq$} -17 to -22. Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, estimating their number densities to be {\texttimes}100 higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to {$\sim$}10\% for MUV {$\sim$} -22 at z {$\sim$} 7. Finally, assuming a conservative case of accretion at the Eddington rate, we place a lower limit on the SMBH mass function at z {$\sim$} 5, finding it to be consistent with both theory and previous JWST observations.},

  abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion {$\sigma$} of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 10\textsuperscript{5}-10\textsuperscript{6}M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract = {The systematic analysis of optical large-scale surveys has revealed a population of dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), which have been confirmed by X-ray follow-up observations. Recently, the MaNGA survey identified six dwarf galaxies that appear to have an AGN that is preventing on-going star formation. It is therefore timely to study the physical properties of dwarf galaxies, in particular whether the presence of an AGN can affect their evolution. Using the moving mesh code AREPO, we have investigated different models of AGN activity, ranging from simple energy-driven spherical winds to collimated, mass-loaded, bipolar outflows in high-resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies hosting an active black hole. Our simulations also include a novel implementation of star formation and mechanical supernova (SN) feedback. We find that AGN outflows have a small but systematic effect on the central star formation rates (SFRs) for all set-ups explored, while substantial effects on the global SFR are only obtained with strong SNe and a sustained high-luminosity AGN with an isotropic wind. This suggests that AGN feedback in dwarf galaxies is unlikely to directly regulate their global SFRs. There is, however, a significant effect on outflow properties, which are notably enhanced by the AGN to much higher outflow temperatures and velocities, in agreement with kinematic signatures from the MaNGA survey. This indicates that AGN may play an indirect role in regulating the baryon cycle in dwarf galaxies by hindering cosmic gas inflows.},

  abstract = {Contrary to the standard lore, there is mounting observational evidence that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) may also play a role at the low-mass end of the galaxy population. We investigate this using the cosmological simulation suite FABLE, with a particular focus on the dwarf regime (Mstellar {$<$} 109.5 M{$\odot$}). We find that overmassive black holes (BHs), with respect to the mean scaling relations with their host galaxies, drive hotter and faster outflows and lead to significantly reduced gas mass fractions. They are also more likely to display a kinematically misaligned ionized gas component in our mock MaNGA velocity maps, although we caution that cosmic inflows and mergers contribute to misalignments as well. While in the local Universe the majority of AGN in dwarfs are much dimmer than the stellar component, for z {$\geq$} 2 there is a significant population that outshines their hosts. These high-redshift overmassive BHs contribute to the quenching of dwarfs, whereas at late cosmic times supernova (SN) feedback is more efficient. While our results are overall in good agreement with X-ray observations of AGN in dwarfs, the lack of high-luminosity X-ray AGN in FABLE at low redshifts highlights an interesting possibility that SN feedback could be too strong in FABLE's dwarfs, curtailing AGN growth and feedback. We predict that future observations may uncover many more AGN in dwarfs with lower luminosities and at higher redshifts.},

  abstract = {There is growing observational evidence for dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), including hints of AGN-driven outflows in dwarfs. However, in the common theoretical model of galaxy formation, efficient supernova (SN) feedback is the tool of choice for regulating star formation in the low-mass regime. In this paper, we present a suite of high-resolution cosmological dwarf zoom-in simulations relaxing the assumption of strong SN feedback, with the goal to determine whether more moderate SN feedback in combination with an efficient AGN could be a suitable alternative. Importantly, we find that there are sufficient amounts of gas to power brief Eddington-limited accretion episodes in dwarfs. This leads to a variety of outcomes depending on the AGN accretion model: from no additional suppression to moderate regulation of star formation to catastrophic quenching. Efficient AGN can drive powerful outflows, depleting the gas reservoir of their hosts via ejective feedback and then maintaining a quiescent state through heating the circumgalactic medium. Moderate AGN outflows can be as efficient as the strong SN feedback commonly employed, leading to star formation regulation and H I gas masses in agreement with observations of field dwarfs. All efficient AGN set-ups are associated with overmassive black holes (BHs) compared to the (heavily extrapolated) observed BH mass-stellar mass scaling relations, with future direct observational constraints in this mass regime being crucially needed. Efficient AGN activity is mostly restricted to high redshifts, with hot, accelerated outflows and high X-ray luminosities being the clearest tell-tale signs for future observational campaigns.},

  abstract = {While supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant Universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the seed of the first SMBHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of 10--100 M {$\odot$}, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of 104--5 M {$\odot$} seeds from direct collapse. The detection of SMBHs at redshifts z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at z {$\approx$} 10 that is lensed by the foreground cluster, A2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN), which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The SMBH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of , which corresponds to a black hole (BH) mass of assuming Eddington-limited accretion. This extreme mass at such an early cosmic epoch suggests the heavy seed origin for this BH candidate. Based on the Chandra and JWST discoveries of extremely high-redshift quasars, we have constructed the first simple AGN luminosity function extending to z {$\approx$} 10. Comparison of this luminosity function with theoretical models indicates an overabundant z {$\approx$} 10 SMBH population, consistent with a higher-than-expected seed formation efficiency.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, M, has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for M{$<$}{\textasciitilde}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law s{$>$}{\textasciitilde}M{$\beta$} with {$\beta$}{\textasciitilde}1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to {\textasciitilde}100 h-1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z{$>$}{\textasciitilde}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

We aim to investigate the merger-AGN connection using state-of-the-art observations and novel methods for detecting mergers and AGNs. Methods. We selected stellar mass-limited samples at redshift z {$<$} 1 from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), focussing on the KiDS-N-W2 field with a wide range of multi-wavelength data. We analysed three AGN types, selected in the mid-infrared (MIR), X-ray, and via spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling. To identify mergers, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on two cosmological simulations. We created mass- and redshift-matched control samples of non-mergers and non-AGNs. Results. We first investigated the merger-AGN connection using a binary AGN/non-AGN classification. We observed a clear AGN excess (of a factor of 2--3) in mergers with respect to non-mergers for the MIR AGNs, along with a mild excess for the X-ray and SED AGNs. This result indicates that mergers could trigger all three types, but are more connected to the MIR AGNs. About half of the MIR AGNs are in mergers but it is unclear whether mergers are the main trigger. For the X-ray and SED AGNs, mergers are unlikely to be the dominant triggering mechanism. We also explored the connection using the continuous AGN fraction fAGN parameter. Mergers exhibit a clear excess of high fAGN values relative to non-mergers, for all AGN types. We unveil the first merger fraction fmerger - fAGN relation with two distinct regimes. When the AGN is not very dominant, the relation is only mildly increasing or even flat, with the MIR AGNs showing the highest fmerger. In the regime of very dominant AGNs (fAGN {$\geq$} 0.8), fmerger shows the same steeply rising trend with increasing fAGN for all AGN types. These trends are also seen when plotted against AGN bolometric luminosity. We conclude that mergers are most closely connected to dust-obscured AGNs, generally linked to a fast-growing phase of the supermassive black hole. Such mergers therefore stand as the main (or even the sole) fuelling mechanism of the most powerful AGNs.},

Latest results claim supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these systems to be significantly more massive than expected from the local BH mass - stellar mass (\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} - {\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star\$) relation and that this is not due to sample selection effects. Through detailed statistical modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and requirements on detecting broad lines) and measurement uncertainties in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star\$ can in fact largely account for the reported offset and flattening in the observed \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} - {\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star\$ relation toward the upper envelope of the local relation, even for those at \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We further investigate the possible evolution of the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} - {\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star\$ relation at \$zrsim 4\$ with careful treatment of observational biases and consideration of the degeneracy between intrinsic evolution and dispersion in this relation.

We also investigate the systematic uncertainty due to the lens modeling by using every available lens model individually and comparing the results; this systematic fractional uncertainty on {$\alpha$} is at all redshifts. We now directly observe galaxies in the luminosity regime where some simulations predict a change in the faint-end slope of the luminosity function, yet our results provide statistically very strong evidence against any turnover in the luminosity range probed, more consistent with simulations in which stars form in lower-mass halos. Thus, we find strong support for the extension of the steep luminosity function to at , consistent with the number of faint galaxies needed to reionize the universe under standard assumptions.},

In some cases, these objects might even reach half the stellar mass inferred for the galaxy. Understanding how such objects formed and grew to this masses has then become a big challenge for theoretical models, with different ideas ranging from heavy seed to super-Eddington accretion phases. Here, we take a different approach, and try to infer how accurate these MBH mass estimates are and whether we really need to revise our physical models. By considering how the emerging spectrum (both the continuum and the broad lines) of an accreting MBH changes close to and above the Eddington limit, we infer a much larger uncertainty in the MBH mass estimates relative to that of local counterparts, up to an order of magnitude, and a potential preference for lower masses and higher accretion rates, which i) move them closer to the local correlations, and ii) might indicate that we are witnessing for the first time a widespread phase of very rapid accretion.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z{\textasciitilde}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {\textasciitilde}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope has opened the possibility of identifying moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe, at and beyond the epoch of re-ionisation, complementing previous surveys of much more luminous (and much rarer) quasars. We present 12 new AGNs at 4 {$<$} z {$<$} 7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z = 10.6) revealed through the detection of a broad-line region (BLR) seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower-mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases, we find evidence for two broad components of H{$\alpha$}, which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs), although a complex BLR geometry cannot be excluded. The inferred BH masses range from 8 {\texttimes} 107 M{$\odot$} down to 4 {\texttimes} 105 M{$\odot$}, interestingly probing the regime expected for direct collapse BHs. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities ({$\sim$}1044 - 1045 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are {$<$} 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with MBH {$\sim$} 106 M{$\odot$}, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BHs at z {$\sim$} 4--11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies' stellar masses when compared to the local MBH - Mstar relation, even approaching MBH {$\sim$} Mstar, as was expected from heavy BH seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between MBH and velocity dispersion, as well as between MBH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the classical, optical narrow-line excitation-diagnostic diagrams, these AGNs are located in the region that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what is expected for AGNs hosted in metal-poor galaxies (Z {$\sim$} 0.1 - 0.2 Z{$\odot$}). The fraction of broad-line AGNs with LAGN {$>$} 1044 erg/s among galaxies in the redshift range of 4 {$<$} z {$<$} 6 is about 10\%, suggesting that the contribution of AGNs and their hosts to the re-ionisation of the Universe is {$>$} 10\%.},

Based on a near-IR-selected galaxy sample selected over a raw survey area of 3 deg2 and spanning {$\geq$}4 dex in stellar mass, we fit the GSMF with both single and double Schechter functions, carefully accounting for Eddington bias to derive both observed and intrinsic parameter values. We find that a double Schechter function is a better fit to the GSMF at all redshifts, although the single and double Schechter function fits are statistically indistinguishable by z = 3.25. We find no evidence for significant evolution in M*, with the intrinsic value consistent with log10(M*/M{$\Sun$}) = 10.55 {\textpm} 0.1 over the full redshift range. Overall, our determination of the GSMF is in good agreement with recent simulation results, although differences persist at the highest stellar masses. Splitting our sample according to location on the UVJ plane, we find that the star-forming GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over the full redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since z {$\simeq$} 2.5. In contrast, both the normalization and the functional form of the passive GSMF evolve dramatically with redshift, switching from a single to a double Schechter function at z {$\leq$} 1.5. As a result, we find that while passive galaxies dominate the integrated stellar-mass density at z {$\leq$} 0.75, they only contribute {$\lessequivlnt$}10 per cent by z {$\simeq$} 3. Finally, we provide a simple parametrization that provides an accurate estimate of the GSMF, both observed and intrinsic, at any redshift within the range 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive synthesis model for the active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Universe. We assume that black holes accrete in just three distinct physical states, or `modes': at low Eddington ratio, only a radiatively inefficient, kinetically dominated mode is allowed [low kinetic (LK)] at high Eddington ratio, instead, AGN may display both a purely radiative [radio quiet, high radiative (HR)] and a kinetic [radio loud, high kinetic (HK)] mode. We solve the continuity equation for the black hole mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous semi-analytic and numerical models for black hole growth, we do not assume any specific distribution of Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass and luminosity functions and a set of fundamental relations between observables in the three accretion modes. SMBH always show a very broad accretion rate distribution, and we discuss the profound consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed AGN fractions in galaxies, as well as for the empirical determination of SMBH mass functions with large surveys. We confirm previous results and clearly demonstrate that, at least for z {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 1.5, SMBH mass function evolves antihierarchically, i.e. the most massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z {\textasciitilde} 2). We also derive tight constraints on the (mass-weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN: under the simplifying assumption that the mass density of both high redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 5) and `wandering' black holes ejected from galactic nuclei after merger events are negligible compared to the local mass density, we find that 0.065 {$<$} {$\xi$}0{$<\varepsilon$}rad{$>$} {$<$} 0.07, where {$\xi$}0 is the local SMBH mass density in units of 4.3 {\texttimes} 105MsolarMpc-3. We trace the cosmological evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power, {$\varepsilon$}kin, ranges between {$\varepsilon$}kin {\textasciitilde}= (3-5) {\texttimes} 10-3, depending on the choice of the radio core luminosity function. Such a `kinetic efficiency' varies however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being maximal for very massive holes at late times, as required for the AGN feedback by many galaxy formation models in cosmological contexts.},

We assign a star formation rate to each dark matter halo based on its growth rate, which specifies how much baryonic material becomes available, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines how efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the baryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid model, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant fraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out to high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model complexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model selection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can have very different star formation histories. Galaxies that are quenched at z = 0 typically have a higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts. EMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and introduces scatter self-consistently. We find that at fixed halo mass, passive galaxies have a higher stellar mass on average. The intracluster mass in massive haloes can be up to eight times larger than the mass of the central galaxy. Clustering for star-forming and quenched galaxies is in good agreement with observational constraints, indicating a realistic assignment of galaxies to haloes.},

We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a {\textasciitilde}30\% increase in the number density of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun galaxies since z{\textasciitilde}0.6, and a {$<$}10\% change in the number density of all {$>$}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun galaxies since z{\textasciitilde}1.

These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10.8 Msun. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z{$<$}1, even among massive ({$>$}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun) quiescent galaxies.},

We find that the average SMBH growth rate follows remarkably similar trends with M * and redshift as the average star formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies (i.e., {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_BH vprop M * 0.86 {\textpm} 0.39 for the z {\textasciitilde} 1 sample and {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_BH vprop M * 1.05 {\textpm} 0.36 for the z {\textasciitilde} 2 sample). It follows that the ratio of SMBH growth rate to SFR is (1) flat with respect to M *, (2) not evolving with redshift, and (3) close to the ratio required to maintain/establish an SMBH to stellar mass ratio of {$\approx$}10-3 as also inferred from today's M BH-M Bulge relationship. We interpret this as evidence that SMBHs have, on average, grown in step with their host galaxies since at least z {\textasciitilde} 2, irrespective of host galaxy mass and active galactic nucleus triggering mechanism. As such, we suggest that the same secular processes that drive the bulk of star formation are also responsible for the majority of SMBH growth. From this, we speculate that it is the availability of gas reservoirs that regulate both cosmological SMBH growth and star formation.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95 675 galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. Sources have been selected from the DR1 UltraVISTA K\_\{s\}-band imaging which covers a unique combination of a wide area (1.62 deg{\textasciicircum}2), to a significant depth (K\_\{s,tot\} = 23.4). The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\% and 1\% of its current value at z {\textasciitilde} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing by 2.71{\textasciicircum}\{+0.93\}\_\{-0.22\} dex since z = 3.5. At z {$>$} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a nonzero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the K\_\{s\}-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs to UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggests UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {$>$} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with Log(M\_\{*\}/M\_\{sun\}) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0(3.5), whereas those with Log(M\_\{*\}/M\_\{sun\}) = 10.5 have grown by {$>$} 1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {$<$} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties on the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, SPS modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well-defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies because observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circumgalactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic ``feedback'' from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes---generally unresolved in cosmological simulations---plays a major role in driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible subresolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e., outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review, we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsec scales of large-scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, and an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the nonthermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {\$JWST\$'s first glimpse of the \$z{$>$}10\$ Universe has yielded a surprising abundance of luminous galaxy candidates. Here we present the most extreme of these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on \$0.6-5{\textbackslash}mu\$m photometry, this strikingly luminous (\${\textbackslash}approx\$26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at \$z{\textbackslash}approx17\$. This would make it an \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{UV\}\}{\textbackslash}approx-22\$, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}{\textbackslash}approx5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ system that formed a mere \${\textbackslash}sim220\$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of \$z{\textbackslash}approx5\$: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at \${$<$}2.5\$" have photometric redshifts of \$z{\textbackslash}approx5\$. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a \$z{\textbackslash}approx5\$ protocluster that is \$rsim5{\textbackslash}times\$ overdense compared to the field. Intense line emission at \$z{\textbackslash}approx5\$ from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at \$z{\textbackslash}approx5\$ conspire to boost the \${$>$}2{\textbackslash}mu\$m photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow redshift window (\${\textbackslash}Delta z{\textbackslash}lesssim0.1\$), implying that the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major concern for \$z{$>$}10\$ searches, particularly when medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at \$z{\textbackslash}approx5\$, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source critical.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We present the new TNG50 cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation -- the third and final volume of the IllustrisTNG project. This simulation occupies a unique combination of large volume and high resolution, with a 50 Mpc box sampled by 21603 gas cells (baryon mass of 8~{\texttimes}~104\,M{$\odot$}). The median spatial resolution of star-forming interstellar medium gas is {$\sim$}100-140\,pc. This resolution approaches or exceeds that of modern `zoom' simulations of individual massive galaxies, while the volume contains {$\sim$}20\,000 resolved galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}7\$\,M{$\odot$}. Herein we show first results from TNG50, focusing on galactic outflows driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 1010.5\,M{$\odot$} due to the action of the central black hole (BH). The outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed mass it is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high-velocity, multiphase outflows that include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000~km\,s-1 out to 20~kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behaviour at galactic and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the star-forming main sequence drive faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low-luminosity, slowly accreting, massive BHs drive the strongest outflows.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {We present UV luminosity functions (LFs) at 1500 {\AA} derived from the Hubble Space Telescope Early Release Science WFC3/UVIS data acquired over {$\sim$}50 arcmin2 of the GOODS-South field. The LFs are determined over the entire redshift range z = 0.75--2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs): (1) 13 band UV+optical+NIR photometric redshifts to study galaxies in the range z = 0.5--2 in three bins of dz = 0.5 and (2) dropout samples in three redshift windows centered at z {$\sim$} 1.5, z {$\sim$} 1.9, and z {$\sim$} 2.5. The characteristic luminosity dims by 1.5 mag from z = 2.5 to z = 0.75, consistent with earlier work. However, the other Schechter function parameters, the faint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constant over the range z = 0.75--2.5. Using these LF determinations, we find the UV luminosity density to increase by {$\sim$}1.4 dex according to (1 + z)2.58{\textpm}0.15 from z {$\sim$} 0 to its peak at z {$\sim$} 2.5. Strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our LFs are all steeper than {$\alpha$} = -1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift LBG studies. Since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatter with {$\alpha$} {$\simeq$} -1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expected flattening occurs. Despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggest {$\alpha$} {$\simeq$} -1.7 at least down to z {$\sim$} 1. These new results from such a shallow early data set demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of WFC3/UVIS for the thorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift range z {$\sim$} 0.5 to z {$\sim$} 3.},

With a detailed statistical analysis, our findings conclusively reveal a high-z M {$\bullet$}-M {$\star$} relation that deviates at {$>$}3{$\sigma$} confidence level from the local relation. The high-z relation is \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}bullet \}/{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \})=-\{2.43\}\_\{-0.83\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.83\}+\{1.06\}\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}/{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \})\$ . Black holes are overmassive by {\textasciitilde}10-100{\texttimes} compared to their low-z counterparts in galactic hosts of the same stellar mass. This fact is not due to a selection effect in surveys. Moreover, our analysis predicts the possibility of detecting in high-z JWST surveys 5-15{\texttimes} more black holes with M {$\bullet$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 106.5 M {$\odot$}, and 10-30{\texttimes} more with M {$\bullet$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 108.5 M {$\odot$}, compared to local relation's predictions. The lighter black holes preferentially occupy galaxies with a stellar mass of {\textasciitilde}107.5-108 M {$\odot$}. We have yet to detect these sources because (i) they may be inactive (duty cycles 1\%-10\%), (ii) the host overshines the active galactic nucleus (AGN), or (iii) the AGN is obscured and not immediately recognizable by line diagnostics. A search of low-mass black holes in existing JWST surveys will further test the M {$\bullet$}-M {$\star$} relation.

Our results are based on the high dynamic range provided by combining the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), CANDELS/GOODS-South, and UltraVISTA/COSMOS surveys. We utilize the unparalleled multifrequency photometry available in this survey `wedding cake' to compile complete galaxy samples at z {$\simeq$} 2, 3, 4 via photometric redshifts (calibrated against the latest spectroscopy) rather than colour-colour selection, and to determine accurate rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes (M1500) from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Our new determinations of the UV LF extend from M1500 {$\simeq$} -22 (AB mag) down to M1500 = -14.5, -15.5 and -16 at z {$\simeq$} 2, 3 and 4, respectively (thus, reaching {$\simeq$} 3-4 mag fainter than previous blank-field studies at z {$\simeq$} 2,3). At z {$\simeq$} 2, 3, we find a much shallower faint-end slope ({$\alpha$} = -1.32 {\textpm} 0.03) than reported in some previous studies ({$\alpha$} {$\simeq$} -1.7), and demonstrate that this new measurement is robust. By z {$\simeq$} 4, the faint-end slope has steepened slightly, to {$\alpha$} = -1.43 {\textpm} 0.04, and we show that these measurements are consistent with the overall evolutionary trend from z = 0 to 8. Finally, we find that while characteristic number density ({$\varphi$}*) drops from z {$\simeq$} 2 to z {$\simeq$} 4, characteristic luminosity (M*) brightens by {$\simeq$} 1 mag. This, combined with the new flatter faint-end slopes, has the consequence that UV luminosity density (and hence unobscured star formation density) peaks at z {$\simeq$} 2.5-3, when the Universe was {$\simeq$} 2.5 Gyr old.},

Our sample includes {$>$}2000 spectroscopic redshifts and {$\approx$}31000 LBGs in 31 spatially independent fields over a total area of 3261 arcmin2. These data allow us to select galaxies to 0.07L* and 0.10L* at z {$\sim$} 2 and z {$\sim$} 3, respectively. A maximum-likelihood analysis indicates steep values of {$\alpha$}(z = 2) = -1.73 {\textpm} 0.07 and {$\alpha$}(z = 3) = -1.73 {\textpm} 0.13. This result is robust to luminosity-dependent systematics in the Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent width and reddening distributions, and is similar to the steep values advocated at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4, and implies that {$\approx$}93\% of the unobscured UV luminosity density at z {$\sim$} 2--3 arises from sub-L* galaxies. With a realistic luminosity-dependent reddening distribution, faint to moderately luminous galaxies account for {$\greaterequivlnt$}70\% and {$\greaterequivlnt$}25\% of the bolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density, respectively, when integrated over 1.9 {$\leq$} z {$<$} 3.4. We find a factor of 8--9 increase in the star-formation rate density between z {$\sim$} 6 and z {$\sim$} 2, due to both a brightening of L* and an increasing dust correction proceeding to lower redshifts. Combining the UV LF with stellar mass estimates suggests a relatively steep low-mass slope of the stellar mass function at high redshift. The previously observed discrepancy between the integral of the star-formation history and stellar mass density measurements at z {$\sim$} 2 may be reconciled by invoking a luminosity-dependent reddening correction to the star-formation history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributed by UV-faint galaxies. The steep and relatively constant faint-end slope of the UV LF at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 contrasts with the shallower slope inferred locally, suggesting that the evolution in the faint-end slope may be dictated simply by the availability of low-mass halos capable of supporting star formation at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 2.},

However, Earth's atmosphere and surface environment have evolved substantially in the last 4.5 billion years. A combination of in situ geological and biogeochemical modeling studies of our planet have provided glimpses of environments that, while technically belonging to our Earth, are seemingly alien worlds. For modern Earth, observations from ground-based facilities, satellites, and spacecraft have yielded a rich collection of data that can be used to effectively view our planet within the context of exoplanet characterization. Application of planetary and exoplanetary remote sensing techniques to these datasets then enables the development of approaches for detecting signatures of habitability and life on other worlds. In addition, an array of models have been used to simulate exoplanet-like datasets for the distant Earth, thereby providing insights that are often complementary to those from existing observations. Understanding the myriad ways Earth has been habitable and inhabited, coupled with remote sensing approaches honed on the distant Earth, provides a key guide to recognizing potentially life-bearing environments in other planetary systems.},

  abstract = {We examine unresolved nuclear X-ray sources in 57 brightest cluster galaxies to study the relationship between nuclear X-ray emission and accretion on to supermassive black holes. The majority of the clusters in our sample have prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres, which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate on to the supermassive black holes over the past several hundred Myr. We find that roughly half of the sample have detectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated with average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing accretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts, in the last {$\sim$}107 yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear X-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as the mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet power when the mean accretion rate rises above a few per cent of the Eddington rate, or a power output of \{{$\sim$} \}10{\textasciicircum}\{45\} \{erg s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on time-scales of 6 months to 10 years. If variability at this level is a common phenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship between mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity. We find no significant change in the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable objects. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is consistent with emission from either a jet, an advection-dominated accretion flow, or a combination of the two, although other origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gas or nearly spherical inflows of hot keV gas. For a subset of 13 nearby systems in our sample, we re-examine the relationship between the jet power and the Bondi accretion rate. The results indicate weaker evidence for a trend between Bondi accretion and jet power, due to uncertainties in the cavity volumes and gas densities at the Bondi radius. We suggest that cold gas fuelling could be a likely source of accretion power in these objects; however, we cannot rule out Bondi accretion, which could play a significant role in low-power jets.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We introduce a simple analytic model of galaxy formation that links the growth of dark matter haloes in a cosmological background to the build-up of stellar mass within them. The model aims to identify the physical processes that drive the galaxy-halo co-evolution through cosmic time. The model restricts the role of baryonic astrophysics to setting the relation between galaxies and their haloes. Using this approach, galaxy properties can be directly predicted from the growth of their host dark matter haloes. We explore models in which the effective star formation efficiency within haloes is a function of mass (or virial temperature) and independent of time. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces self-consistently the shape and evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density, the specific star formation rate of galaxies, and the galaxy stellar mass function, both at the present time and at high redshifts. By systematically varying the effective star formation efficiency in the model, we explore the emergence of the characteristic shape of the galaxy stellar mass function. The origin of the observed double Schechter function at low redshifts is naturally explained by two efficiency regimes in the stellar to halo mass relation, namely, a stellar feedback regulated stage, and a supermassive black hole regulated stage. By providing a set of analytic differential equations, the model can be easily extended and inverted, allowing the roles and impact of astrophysics and cosmology to be explored and understood.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Gravitational lensing combined with deep HST observations allows us to extend the analysis of the MS down to \{log\} M/\{M\}{$\odot$} {$\sim$} 7.5 at z{$\lessequivlnt$} 4 and \{log\} M/\{M\}{$\odot$} {$\sim$} 8 at higher redshifts, a factor of {$\sim$}10 below most previous results. We perform an accurate simulation to take into account the effect of observational uncertainties and correct for the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in particular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit an unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses the results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and by making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of the dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter decreases with increasing mass, suggesting a larger variety of star formation histories in low-mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical predictions and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of progenitors of low-mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the efficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low-mass halos. Finally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift milder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete understanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.},

  abstract = {We present the fifth edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Catalog, which is based upon the SDSS Seventh Data Release. The catalog, which contains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, represents the conclusion of the SDSS-I and SDSS-II quasar survey. The catalog consists of the SDSS objects that have luminosities larger than Mi = -22.0 (in a cosmology with H 0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, {\textohm} M = 0.3, and {\textohm}{$\Lambda$} = 0.7), have at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km s-1 or have interesting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i {$\approx$} 15.0, and have highly reliable redshifts. The catalog covers an area of {$\approx$}9380 deg2. The quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to 5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars at redshifts greater than 4, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than 5. The catalog contains 9210 quasars with i {$<$} 18; slightly over half of the entries have i {$<$} 19. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to better than 0farcs1 rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200 {\AA} at a spectral resolution of {\textasciitilde}= 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the SDSS public database using the information provided in the catalog. Over 96\% of the objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS. We also include a supplemental list of an additional 207 quasars with SDSS spectra whose archive photometric information is incomplete.},

  abstract = {We estimated black hole masses and Eddington ratios (L/L\textsubscript{Edd}) for a well defined sample of local (z \&lt; 0.3) broad line AGN from the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), based on the H{$\beta$} line and standard recipes assuming virial equilibrium for the broad line region. The sample represents the low-redshift AGN population over a wide range of luminosities, from Seyfert 1 galaxies to luminous quasars. From the distribution of black hole masses we derived the active black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) in the local universe, exploiting the fact that the HES has a well-defined selection function. While the directly determined ERDF turns over around L/L\textsubscript{Edd} {\textasciitilde} 0.1, similar to what has been seen in previous analyses, we argue that this is an artefact of the sample selection. We employed a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the intrinsic distribution functions of black hole masses and Eddington ratios simultaneously in an unbiased way, taking the sample selection function fully into account. The resulting ERDF is well described by a Schechter function, with evidence for a steady increase towards lower Eddington ratios, qualitatively similar to what has been found for type 2 AGN from the SDSS. Comparing our best-fit active BHMF with the mass function of inactive black holes we obtained an estimate of the fraction of active black holes, i.e. an estimate of the AGN duty cycle. The active fraction decreases strongly with increasing black hole mass. A comparison with the BHMF at higher redshifts also indicates that, at the high mass end, black holes are now in a less active stage than at earlier cosmic epochs. Our results support the notion of anti-hierarchical growth of black holes, and are consistent with a picture where the most massive black holes grew at early cosmic times, whereas at present mainly smaller mass black holes accrete at a significant rate. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (Proposal 145.B-0009).},

  abstract = {We present a census of the active black hole population at 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 2, by constructing the bivariate distribution function of black hole mass and Eddington ratio, employing a maximum likelihood fitting technique. The study of the active black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) allows us to clearly disentangle the active galactic nuclei (AGN) downsizing phenomenon, present in the AGN luminosity function, into its physical processes of black hole mass downsizing and accretion rate evolution. We are utilizing type-1 AGN samples from three optical surveys (VVDS, zCOSMOS and SDSS), that cover a wide range of 3 dex in luminosity over our redshift interval of interest. We investigate the cosmic evolution of the AGN population as a function of AGN luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate. Compared to z = 0, we find a distinct change in the shape of the BHMF and the ERDF, consistent with downsizing in black hole mass. The active fraction or duty cycle of type-1 AGN at z {$\sim$} 1.5 is almost flat as a function of black hole mass, while it shows a strong decrease with increasing mass at z = 0. We are witnessing a phase of intense black hole growth, which is largely driven by the onset of AGN activity in massive SMBHs (supermassive black holes) towards z = 2. We finally compare our results to numerical simulations and semi-empirical models and while we find reasonable agreement over certain parameter ranges, we highlight the need to refine these models in order to match our observations.},

Approximate analytic expressions are given. In the galaxy halo mass range 3{\texttimes}1010 Msolar{$<$}=Mh{$<$}=3{\texttimes}1013 Msolar the Mh-Lr, Mstar-Mh, and MBH-Mh relations are well represented by a double power law, with a break at Mh,break{\textasciitilde}3{\texttimes}1011 Msolar, corresponding to a mass in stars Mstar{\textasciitilde}1.2{\texttimes}1010 Msolar, to an r*-band luminosity Lr{\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes}109 Lsolar, to a stellar velocity dispersion {$\sigma$}{\textasciitilde}=88 km s-1, and to a black hole mass MBH{\textasciitilde}9{\texttimes}106 Msolar. The {$\sigma$}-Mh relation can be approximated by a single power law, although a double power law is a better representation. Although there are significant systematic errors associated with our method, the derived relationships are in good agreement with the available observational data and have comparable uncertainties. We interpret these relations in terms of the effect of feedback from supernovae and from the active nucleus on the interstellar medium. We argue that the break of the power laws occurs at a mass that marks the transition between the dominance of the stellar and the AGN feedback.},

Their masses are found to be tightly linked with the masses and velocity dispersions of their host galaxies. On the other hand, BHs are widely held to constitute the central engines of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general. It is however still unclear how BHs have grown, and whether they have co-evolved with their hosts. In this Review I discuss how, in ways independent of specific models, constraints on the growth history of BHs and their host galaxies have been set by matching the statistics of local BHs to the emissivity, number density, and clustering properties of AGNs at different cosmological epochs. I also present some new results obtained through a novel numerical code which evolves the BH mass function and clustering adopting broad distributions of Eddington ratios. I finally review BH evolution in a wider cosmological context, connecting BH growth to galaxy evolution.},

We assume further that a supermassive BH forms concurrently with the stars, and within {\textpm}1 Gyr of the formation of the potential well of the spheroid, and that the relation between the mass of the BH and host velocity dispersion maintains the form M BH vprop {$\sigma\beta$} with {$\beta$} {$\approx$} 4, but with the normalization allowed to evolve with redshift as vprop(1 + z){$\alpha$}. We compute the BH mass function associated with the VDF at each redshift, and compare the accumulated total BH mass density with that inferred from the integrated quasar luminosity function (LF; the so-called So{\l}tan argument). This comparison is insensitive to the assumed duty cycle or Eddington ratio of quasar activity, and we find that the match between the two BH mass densities favors a relatively mild redshift evolution, with {$\alpha$} {\textasciitilde} 0.33, with a positive evolution as strong as {$\alpha$} gsim 1.3 excluded at more than 99\% confidence level. A direct match between the characteristic BH mass in the VDF-based and quasar LF-based BH mass functions also yields a mean Eddington ratio of {$\lambda$} {\textasciitilde} 0.5-1 that is roughly constant within 0 lsim z lsim 3. A strong positive evolution in the M BH-{$\sigma$} relation is still allowed by the data if galaxies increase, on average, their velocity dispersions since the moment of formation due to dissipative processes. If we assume that the mean velocity dispersion of the host galaxies evolves as {$\sigma$}(z) = {$\sigma$}(0) {\texttimes} (1 + z)-{$\gamma$}, we find a lower limit of {$\gamma$} gsim 0.23 for {$\alpha$} gsim 1.5. The latter estimate represents an interesting constraint for galaxy evolution models and can be tested through hydro simulations. This dissipative model, however, also implies a decreasing {$\lambda$} at higher z, at variance with several independent studies.},

  abstract = {We compare the set of local galaxies having dynamically measured black holes with a large, unbiased sample of galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We confirm earlier work showing that the majority of black hole hosts have significantly higher velocity dispersions {$\sigma$} than local galaxies of similar stellar mass. We use Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the effect on black hole scaling relations if this bias arises from the requirement that the black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole masses with spatially resolved kinematics. We find that this selection effect artificially increases the normalization of the Mbh-{$\sigma$} relation by a factor of at least {$\sim$}3; the bias for the Mbh-Mstar relation is even larger. Our Monte Carlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both indicate that {$\sigma$} is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In particular, the Mbh-Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-{$\sigma$} and {$\sigma$}-Mstar relations, and is heavily biased by up to a factor of 50 at small masses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between dynamically based black hole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies. Our simulations also disfavour broad distributions of black hole masses at fixed {$\sigma$}. Correcting for this bias suggests that the calibration factor used to estimate black hole masses in active galaxies should be reduced to values of fvir {$\sim$} 1. Black hole mass densities should also be proportionally smaller, perhaps implying significantly higher radiative efficiencies/black hole spins. Reducing black hole masses also reduces the gravitational wave signal expected from black hole mergers.},

  abstract = {Local samples of quiescent galaxies with dynamically measured black hole masses (Mbh) may suffer from an angular resolution-related selection effect, which could bias the observed scaling relations between Mbh and host galaxy properties away from the intrinsic relations. In particular, previous work has shown that the observed Mbh-Mstar relation is more strongly biased than the Mbh-{$\sigma$} relation. Local samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) do not suffer from this selection effect, as in these samples Mbh is estimated from megamasers and/or reverberation mapping-based techniques. With the exception of megamasers, Mbh estimates in these AGN samples are proportional to a virial coefficient fvir. Direct modelling of the broad-line region suggests that fvir {$\sim$} 3.5. However, this results in an Mbh-Mstar relation for AGN, which lies below and is steeper than the one observed for quiescent black hole samples. A similar though milder trend is seen for the Mbh-{$\sigma$} relation. Matching the high-mass end of the Mbh-Mstar and Mbh-{$\sigma$} relations observed in quiescent samples requires fvir {$\greaterequivlnt$} 15 and fvir {$\greaterequivlnt$} 7, respectively. On the other hand, fvir {$\sim$} 3.5 yields Mbh-{$\sigma$} and Mbh-Mstar relations for AGN, which are remarkably consistent with the expected `intrinsic' correlations for quiescent samples (i.e. once account has been made of the angular resolution-related selection effect), providing additional evidence that the sample of local quiescent black holes is biased. We also show that, as is the case for quiescent black holes, the Mbh-Mstar scaling relation of AGN is driven by {$\sigma$}, thus providing additional key constraints to black hole-galaxy co-evolution models.},

Such a balance is secularly stable provided that the star formation rate increases with the pressure in the star forming gas. The I{$\kappa\varepsilon\alpha$} model has four parameters that together control the feedback from star formation and the cosmological accretion rate onto a halo. I{$\kappa\varepsilon\alpha$} reproduces accurately the star formation rate as a function of halo mass and redshift in the eagle hydrodynamical simulation, even when all four parameters are held constant. It predicts the emergence of a star forming main sequence along which the specific star formation rate depends weakly on stellar mass with an amplitude that increases rapidly with redshift. We briefly discuss the emerging mass-metallicity relation, the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, and an extension of the model that includes feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). These self-regulation results are independent of the star formation law and the galaxy's gas content. Instead, star forming galaxies are shaped by the balance between stellar feedback and cosmological accretion, with accurately accounting for energy losses associated with feedback a crucial ingredient.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

We find that the local MBH-Mstar relation exhibits a high degree of scatter below Mstar {$<$} 1010M{$\odot$}, which we use to classify BHs as overmassive or undermassive relative to their host Mstar. Within isolated dwarf galaxies, only 8\% of undermassive BHs ever undergo a BH merger, while 95\% of overmassive BHs grow through a mixture of BH mergers and accretion. We find that isolated dwarf galaxies that host overmassive BHs also follow different evolutionary tracks relative to their undermassive BH counterparts, building up their stars and dark matter earlier and experiencing star formation suppression starting around z = 2. By z = 0.05, overmassive BH hosts above Mstar {$>$} 109M{$\odot$} are more likely to exhibit lower central stellar mass density, lower H I gas content, and lower star formation rates than their undermassive BH counterparts. Our results suggest that overmassive BHs in isolated galaxies above Mstar {$>$} 109M{$\odot$} are capable of driving feedback, in many cases suppressing and even quenching star formation by late times.},

The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame IR, B band, UV, soft, and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows Hopkins et al. with an updated quasar SED model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fitting bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the old Hopkins model at high redshift. Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2. Due to the paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5 is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow faint-end slope at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5. Further multiband observations of the faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH mass density, and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 3. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH mass density, and SMBH mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.},

Our large sample allows for a novel approach to investigating the galaxy main sequence that has not been accessible to previous studies. We measure the main sequence in small mass bins in the SFR--M{$\star$} plane without assuming a functional form for the main sequence. With a large sample of galaxies in each mass bin, we isolate star-forming galaxies by locating the transition between the star-forming and green valley populations in the SFR--M{$\star$} plane. This approach eliminates the need for arbitrarily defined fixed cutoffs when isolating the star-forming galaxy population, which often biases measurements of the scatter around the star-forming galaxy main sequence. We find that the main sequence for all galaxies becomes increasingly flat towards present day at the high-mass end, while the star-forming galaxy main sequence does not. We attribute this difference to the increasing fraction of the collective green valley and quiescent galaxy population from z~= 3.0 to z~= 1.5. Additionally, we measure the total scatter around the star-forming galaxy main sequence and find that it is {$\sim$}0.5--1.0\,dex with little evolution as a function of mass or redshift.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z {$\sim$} 2--3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Reionization is thought to have occurred in the redshift range of 6 {$<$} z {$<$} 9, which is now being probed by both deep galaxy surveys and CMB observations. Using halo abundance matching over the redshift range 5 {$<$} z {$<$} 8 and assuming smooth, continuous gas accretion, we develop a model for the star formation efficiency f* of dark matter haloes at z {$>$} 6 that matches the measured galaxy luminosity functions at these redshifts. We find that f* peaks at {\textasciitilde}30 per cent at halo massesM{\textasciitilde} 1011-1012 M{$\odot$}, in qualitative agreement with its behaviour at lower redshifts. We then investigate the cosmic star formation histories and the corresponding models of reionization for a range of extrapolations to small halo masses. We use a variety of observations to further constrain the characteristics of the galaxy populations, including the escape fraction of UV photons. Our approach provides an empirically calibrated, physically motivated model for the properties of star-forming galaxies sourcing the epoch of reionization. In the case where star formation in low-mass haloes is maximally efficient, an average escape fraction {\textasciitilde}0.1 can reproduce the optical depth reported by Planck, whereas inefficient star formation in these haloes requires either about twice as many UV photons to escape, or an escape fraction that increases towards higher redshifts. Our models also predict how future observations with JamesWebb Space Telescope can improve our understanding of these galaxy populations.},

  abstract = {While low-mass, star-forming galaxies are often considered as the primary driver of reionization, their actual contribution to the cosmic ultraviolet background is still uncertain, mostly because the escape fraction of ionizing photons is only poorly constrained. Theoretical studies have shown that efficient supernova feedback is a necessary condition to create paths through which ionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. We investigate the possibility that accreting supermassive black holes in early dwarf galaxies may provide additional feedback and enhance the leakage of ionizing radiation. We use a series of high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations where we isolate the different sources of feedback. We find that supernova feedback prevents the growth of the black hole, thus quenching its associated feedback. Even in cases where the black hole can grow, the structure of the interstellar medium is strongly dominated by supernova feedback. We conclude that, in the dwarf galaxy regime, supermassive black holes do not appear to play a significant role in enhancing the escape fraction and in contributing to the early ultraviolet background.},

  abstract = {Galaxy mergers provide a mechanism for galaxies to effectively funnel gas and materials toward their nuclei and fuel the central starbursts and accretion of supermassive black holes. In turn, the active nuclei drive galactic-scale outflows that subsequently impact the evolution of the host galaxies. The details of this transformative process as they pertain to the supermassive black holes remain ambiguous, partially due to the central obscuration commonly found in the dust-reddened merger hosts, and also because there are relatively few laboratories in the nearby universe where the process can be studied in depth. This review highlights the current state of the literature on the role of accreting supermassive black holes in local luminous infrared galaxies as seen from various windows within the electromagnetic spectrum. Specifically, we discuss the multiwavelength signatures of the active nucleus, its associated feeding and feedback processes, and the implications of multiple supermassive black holes found in nearby interacting galaxy systems for galaxy evolution from the observational perspective. We conclude with a future outlook on how the topic of active nuclei in low- and high-redshift galaxy mergers will benefit from the advent of next-generation observing facilities with unparalleled resolving power and sensitivity in the coming decade.},

The combined sample, including that of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey, consists of 4039 detections in the soft (0.5-2 keV) and/or hard ({$>$}2 keV) band. We utilize a maximum likelihood method to reproduce the count rate versus redshift distribution for each survey, by taking into account the evolution of the absorbed fraction, the contribution from Compton-thick (CTK) AGNs, and broadband spectra of AGNs, including reflection components from tori based on the luminosity- and redshift-dependent unified scheme. We find that the shape of the XLF at z {\textasciitilde} 1-3 is significantly different from that in the local universe, for which the luminosity-dependent density evolution model gives much better description than the luminosity and density evolution model. These results establish the standard population synthesis model of the X-ray background (XRB), which well reproduces the source counts, the observed fractions of CTK AGNs, and the spectrum of the hard XRB. The number ratio of CTK AGNs to the absorbed Compton-thin (CTN) AGNs is constrained to be {$\approx$}0.5-1.6 to produce the 20-50 keV XRB intensity within present uncertainties, by assuming that they follow the same evolution as CTN AGNs. The growth history of supermassive black holes is discussed based on the new AGN bolometric luminosity function.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new, essentially empirical, model for the relation between the mass of a dark matter halo/subhalo and the luminosity of a galaxy hosted in it. To estimate this, we replace the assumption of linearity between light and mass fluctuations with the assumption of monotonicity between galaxy light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high-resolution dark matter simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity functions. We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity is fairly well fitted by a double power law. The relation between halo mass and group luminosity has a shallower slope for an intermediate-mass region and is fairly well fitted by a two-branch function, with both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to L{\textasciitilde}M4 at low M, while at high mass the former follows L{\textasciitilde}M0.28 and the latter L{\textasciitilde}M0.9. In addition to the mass-luminosity relation, we also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then, using a prescription for the mass function of haloes in under/overdense regions and some further assumptions on the form of the mass density distribution function, we further derive results for biasing between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, the light distribution function and the void probability distribution. Our results for the most part seem to match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a potentially powerful way of modelling the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, because the main inputs are readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys, and the outputs are free from the uncertainties of physically modelling galaxy formation.},

It will be the primary legacy dataset from Webb for the extragalactic community by providing quick public releases of multi-band, high-resolution near-IR imaging of half a million galaxies (and an unprecedented 32,000 in the mid-IR) thus enabling innumerable legacy science projects. Conducting this next level ambitious survey now is crucial given the finite lifetime of Webb and the need to plan swift follow-up of its unique discoveries.},

  abstract = {We present four improved empirical relationships useful for estimating the central black hole mass in nearby AGNs and distant luminous quasars alike using either optical or UV single-epoch spectroscopy. These mass scaling relationships between line widths and luminosity are based on recently improved empirical relationships between the broad-line region size and luminosities in various energy bands and are calibrated to the improved mass measurements of nearby AGNs based on emission-line reverberation mapping. The mass scaling relationship based on the H{$\beta$} line luminosity allows mass estimates for low-redshift sources with strong contamination of the optical continuum luminosity by stellar or nonthermal emission, while that based on the C IV {$\lambda$}1549 line dispersion allows mass estimates in cases where only the line dispersion (as opposed to the FWHM) can be reliably determined. We estimate that the absolute uncertainties in masses given by these mass scaling relationships are typically around a factor of 4. We include in an appendix mass estimates for all of the Bright Quasar Survey (PG) quasars for which direct reverberation-based mass measurements are not available. Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

This simulation statistically models how much gas is accreted on to BHs, traces the energy deposited into their environment and, consequently, the back-reaction of the ambient medium on BH growth. The synthetic BHs reproduce a variety of observational constraints such as the redshift evolution of the BH mass density and the mass function. Strong self-regulation via AGN feedback, weak supernova feedback, and unresolved internal processes result in a tight BH--galaxy mass correlation. Starting at z {$\sim$} 2, tidal stripping creates a small population of BHs over-massive with respect to the halo. The fraction of galaxies hosting a central BH or an AGN increases with stellar mass. The AGN fraction agrees better with multi-wavelength studies, than single-wavelength ones, unless obscuration is taken into account. The most massive haloes present BH multiplicity, with additional BHs gained by ongoing or past mergers. In some cases, both a central and an off-centre AGN shine concurrently, producing a dual AGN. This dual AGN population dwindles with decreasing redshift, as found in observations. Specific accretion rate and Eddington ratio distributions are in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH population is dominated in turn by fast, slow, and very slow accretors, with transitions occurring at z = 3 and z = 2, respectively.},

  abstract = {The first billion years of the Universe has been a pivotal time: stars, black holes (BHs), and galaxies formed and assembled, sowing the seeds of galaxies as we know them today. Detecting, identifying, and understanding the first galaxies and BHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy formation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at galaxies, BHs, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model builds a population based on empirical relations. The spectral energy distribution of galaxies is determined by age and metallicity, and that of AGNs by BH mass and accretion rate. We validate the model against observations, and predict properties of galaxies and AGN in other wavelength and/or luminosity ranges, estimating the contamination of stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass X-ray binaries) for AGN searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice versa for galaxy searches. For high-redshift galaxies with stellar ages {$<$} 1 \{Gyr\}, we find that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at restframe UV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become more important sources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a color-color selection in the James Webb Space Telescope bands to separate AGN versus star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations. We also estimate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot, and metal-poor stars, at driving high-ionization lines, such as C IV and He II. Finally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupation fraction of BHs in low-mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and X-ray AGN luminosity function.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy--halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy--halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy--halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10 \textsuperscript{12} M \textsubscript{{$\odot$}} , less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering. {$<$}/p{$>$}}

We combine the classical 1/Vmax approach with STY, a parametricmaximum likelihood method and step-wise maximum likelihood, a non-parametric maximum likelihood technique. In the parametric approach, we are assuming that the stellar mass function can be modelled by either a single or a double Schechter function and we use a likelihood ratio test to determine which model provides a better fit to the data. We discuss how the stellar mass completeness as a function of z biases the three estimators and how it can affect, especially the low-mass end of the stellar mass function. We apply our method to Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 data in the redshift range from 0.02 to 0.06. We find that the entire galaxy sample is best described by a double Schechter function with the following parameters: log(M*/M{$\odot$}) = 10.79 {\textpm} 0.01, log({$\Phi$}1*/h3 Mpc-3) = -3.31 {\textpm} 0.20, {$\alpha$}1 =-1.69 {\textpm} 0.10, log({$\Phi$}2*/h3 Mpc-3) = -2.01 {\textpm} 0.28 and {$\alpha$}2 =-0.79 {\textpm} 0.04.

We assume that black holes can be divided into two independent groups: those with radiatively efficient accretion, primarily hosted by optically blue and green galaxies, and those with radiatively inefficient accretion, which are mainly found in red galaxies. With observed galaxy stellar mass functions as input, we show that the observed AGN luminosity functions can be reproduced by using mass independent, broken power law shaped ERDFs. We use the observed hard X-ray and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions to constrain the ERDF for radiatively efficient and inefficient AGN, respectively. We also test alternative ERDF shapes and mass dependent models. Our results are consistent with a mass independent AGN fraction and AGN hosts being randomly drawn from the galaxy population. We argue that the ERDF is not shaped by galaxy-scale effects, but by how efficiently material can be transported from the inner few parsecs to the accretion disc. Our results are incompatible with the simplest form of mass quenching where massive galaxies host higher accretion rate AGN. Furthermore, if reaching a certain Eddington ratio is a sufficient condition for maintenance mode, it can occur in all red galaxies, not just the most massive ones.},

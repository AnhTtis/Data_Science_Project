    "abstract": "Edge burst is a novel phenomenon in non-Hermitian quantum dynamics discovered by a very recent numerical study [W.-T. Xue, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett 2, 128.120401(2022)]. It finds that a large proportion of particle loss occurs at the system boundary in a class of non-Hermitian quantum walk. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of real-space wavefunction for this lattice system. We find the wavefunction of the edge site is distinct from the bulk sites. By introducing the time-dependent perturbation theory, we evaluate the analytical expression of the real-space wavefunctions and find the different evolution behavior between the edge site and bulk sites originates from their different nearby sites configuration. The main contribution of the edge wavefunction originates from the transition of the two adjacent non-decay sites. Besides, the numerical diagonalization shows the edge wavefunction is mainly propagated by a group of eigen-modes with a relatively large imaginary part. Our work provides an analytical method for studying non-Hermitian quantum dynamical problems in real space.",

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion} %

We presented a hybrid ANN-SNN architecture that delivers fast and precise inference with reduced computational costs.
Our work identified that the slow convergence of SNNs is due to the initialization of spiking neuron membrane states.
Our solution to this problem involves initializing both SNN states and the output state with an ANN.
This approach enables SNNs to immediately produce accurate predictions without requiring a warm-up phase, thereby reducing latency.
Our experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid architecture can reduce energy consumption up to 88\%, with only a 4\% decrease in performance on human pose estimation with respect to a standard ANN. When compared to SNNs, our method achieves a 74\% lower error.
We anticipate that this research will inspire further investigations at the intersection of neuromorphic engineering and conventional deep learning.

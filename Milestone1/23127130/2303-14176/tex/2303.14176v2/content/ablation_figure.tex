  \caption[.]{\textbf{Overview of the ablation experiments.} Schematic of (A) pure SNN without state initialization and output initialization, (B) hybrid model without output initialization, (C) hybrid model without state initialization, and (D) our proposed hybrid model with state and output initialization. Plots of accuracy over time of our approach against (E) only output initialization and only state initialization ablated and (F) both ablated. All plots show 2D MPJPE scores on the entire test set for camera view \#2, with initializations performed at $t=0$.}

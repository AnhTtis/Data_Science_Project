    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider using simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to recharge the sensor in the LQG control, which provides a new approach to prolonging the network lifetime. We analyze the stability of the proposed system model and show that there exist two critical values for the power splitting ratio α. Then, we propose an optimization problem to derive the optimal value of α. This problem is non-convex but its numerical solution can be derived by our proposed algorithm efficiently. Moreover, we provide the feasible condition of the proposed optimization problem. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the main theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Polarization singularities including bound states in the continuum (BICs) and circularly polarized states have provided promising opportunities in the manipulation of light waves. Previous studies show that BICs in photonic crystal slabs are protected by $C_{2}T$ symmetry and hence normally exist on the high-symmetry lines of momentum space. Here, we propose an approach based on graph theory to study these polarization singularities in momentum space, especially in the region off the high-symmetry lines. With a polarization graph, it is demonstrated for the first time that BICs can stably exist off the high-symmetry lines of momentum space for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. Furthermore, two kinds of interesting processes, including the merging involved with this newly found BICs both on and off the high-symmetry lines, are observed by merely changing the thickness of photonic crystal slab. Our findings provide a new perspective to explore polarization singularities in momentum space and render their further applications in light-matter interaction and light manipulation.",

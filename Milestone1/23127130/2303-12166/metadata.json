    "abstract": "Binary star systems are of particular interest to astronomers because they can be used as astrophysical laboratories to study the properties and processes of stars. Between 70% to 90% of the stars in our galaxy are part of a binary star system. Among the many types of binary systems observed, the dynamics of semi-detached and contact systems are the most interesting because they exhibit mass transfer, which changes the composition and life cycle of both stars. The time scales of the mass transfer process are extremely large which makes the process impossible to capture through physical observation. Computer simulations have proved invaluable in refining our understanding of the mass transfer processes. Here we introduce an intuitive, computationally efficient, gravity centered model that simulates the filling of the Roche lobe of an expanding star and its transfer of mass through the first Lagrangian point.",

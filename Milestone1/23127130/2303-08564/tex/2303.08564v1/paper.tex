Coherent light-matter interactions mediated by opto-magnetic phenomena like the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) are expected to provide a non-thermal pathway for ultrafast manipulation of magnetism on timescales as short as the excitation pulse itself. 
As the IFE scales with the spin-orbit coupling strength of the involved electronic states, photo-exciting the strongly spin-orbit coupled core-level electrons in magnetic materials appears as an appealing method to transiently generate large opto-magnetic moments. 
Here, we investigate this scenario in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy by using intense and circularly polarized pulses of extreme ultraviolet radiation. 
Our results reveal ultrafast and strong helicity-dependent magnetic effects which are in line with the characteristic fingerprints of an IFE, corroborated by \textit{ab initio} opto-magnetic IFE theory and atomistic spin dynamics simulations.

%\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Light-driven ultrafast magnetic phenomena occurring on ever faster and smaller time and length scales are at the core of the modern magnetism research \cite{RevModPhys.82.2731,CARVA2017291}. 
A long sought-after and yet to be realized phenomenon is the coherent and deterministic control of a macroscopically ordered spin ensemble on the sub-cycle timescales of the photo-exciting laser field \cite{Siegrist2019,Lloyd_Hughes_2021}. 
In this context, one of the most prominent effects that could lead to large, ultrafast changes of magnetization is the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). 
Discovered originally in paramagnetic solids \cite{vanderZiel1965}, the IFE was shown to generate an effective magnetic field or, equivalently, an induced magnetic moment in a medium upon photo-excitation with circularly polarized light pulses.
According to classical IFE theory \cite{vanderZiel1965}, the orientation and the magnitude of the light-induced magnetic moment are respectively determined by the helicity of circularly polarized light (or its angular momentum) and the combined effect of the magneto-optical susceptibility of the photo-excited medium and the incident light intensity.    
In case of \textit{metallic} ferro- or antiferromagnetic materials, a fully \textit{ab initio} quantum-mechanical treatment of the IFE has revealed that its action on these materials is significantly different compared to the originally discovered effect, predicting a complex dependence of the IFE-induced magnetization on both helicity and wavelength, which is not covered anymore by the conventional theory \cite{PhysRevLett.117.137203,PhysRevB.85.045117,PhysRevB.89.014413}. 
However, the high absorption of the optical excitation in these materials typically leads to strong heat-induced demagnetization which hinders the observation of any potential non-thermally induced magnetization \cite{PhysRevLett.98.207401}.
Thus, the actual influence of an IFE on the sub-picosecond spin dynamics observed in such systems as, for example, all-optical switching phenomena in ferrimagnetic rare-earth transition-metal alloys like GdFeCo \cite{PhysRevLett.99.047601,Radu2011,Ostler2012,PhysRevB.85.104402}, remains highly debated and elusive so far \cite{Scheid2022}.

The magnitude of the IFE depends on the light intensity and its polarization, as well as on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the involved electronic states via the wavelength- and helicity-dependent opto-magnetic constant
$\mathcal{K}^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_{\pm}}(\omega)$ \cite{PhysRevLett.117.137203,PhysRevB.89.014413}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:IFEformula}
\vec{M}_{\rm ind} (\omega ) = i\,\mathcal{K}^{\rm IFE}_{\sigma_{\pm}} (\omega) \left[\vec{E}(\omega) \times \vec{E}^{*}(\omega)\right], 
\end{equation}
where $\vec{E}(\omega)$ denotes the light electric field, $\sigma_{\pm}$ its helicity, and $\vec{M}_{\text{ind}}$ the induced magnetization along the $\vec{k}$ vector of the incident circularly polarized light beam.
The IFE, which is an electronic Raman process, has thus far been investigated theoretically \cite{PhysRevLett.117.137203,PhysRevB.89.014413,PhysRevB.84.214421,Freimuth2016,Freimuth2021,Scheid2021}, but a direct comparison with measurements is lacking.
A potential way of generating strong opto-magnetic interactions in metallic magnets is the excitation of core-level electrons, involving states with much higher SOC compared to the valence band (e.g., \SI{1.1}{eV} vs.\ \SI{65}{meV} in case of Fe 3p and 3d electrons, respectively \cite{Vijayakumar1996}) that can be accessed by short wavelength radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) or soft x-ray range.
The availability of free-electron lasers (FEL) providing femtosecond pulses of very high brilliance with control over the light polarization has enabled studies of x-ray induced magnetization dynamics, extending the capabilities from element-specific probing, employing, e.g., the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), towards element-specific excitation of highly non-equilibrium states \cite{Lutman2016,Higley2019,PhysRevLett.125.127201,Serkez2020,Liu21}.
However, besides first theoretical predictions, there is no experimental evidence available so far on the existence of opto-magnetic effects like the IFE at these XUV wavelengths.

In this Letter, we study the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy induced by photo-excitation with intense femtosecond circularly polarized pulses in the XUV spectral range generated by the free-electron laser FERMI.
Comparing the helicity-dependent dynamics upon \textit{on}- and \textit{off}-resonant excitation with respect to the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance, we find strong dynamic helicity- and wavelength-dependent effects that resemble the expected characteristics of an IFE. 
Analyzing the magnitude and wavelength-dependence of the observed effect, we can rule out a thermal origin caused by dichroic absorption due to the XMCD, this finding being corroborated by atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations.
Instead, we find qualitative agreement with \textit{ab initio} calculations of the IFE in the XUV spectral range.
Our results thus identify the existence of an IFE in the so far unexplored XUV spectral range.

%\section{Experimental setup, sample and static spectroscopy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The time-resolved studies were performed at the DiProI end-station of the FERMI FEL \cite{Capotondi:ig5025}, using a pump-probe geometry as schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{1_Figure}a.
The sample was excited at normal incidence using \SI{\approx 90}{fs} (FWHM) XUV pulses of variable polarization [circular right/left ($\sigma_{\pm}$) and linear horizontal (lin.~hor.)], tuned to photon energies around the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance. 
The XUV-induced dynamics were probed under \SI{45}{\degree} by linearly polarized \SI{\approx 90}{fs} (FWHM) optical pulses at \SI{400}{nm} wavelength, generated by a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire laser system. 
A polarization-sensitive balanced photodetection scheme was employed to measure both the magneto-optical Faraday rotation in transmission and the Kerr rotation in reflection.
The magnetic contrast was obtained upon flipping an out-of-plane magnetic field of \SI{\pm 8}{mT} that was magnetically saturating the sample. 
The experimental time resolution was evaluated to be \SI{\approx 280}{fs}, using the method described in Ref.~\onlinecite{ZIOLEK2001467}. 
Both pumped and unpumped states of the sample were recorded in an interleaved measurement. 
Sorting the data after FEL pulse energy allows retrieving a fluence-dependence (for more details about the experimental methods, see Supplemental Material (SM) \cite{[{See Supplemental Material }][{ for more details about the experimental methods, Faraday vs.\ Kerr measurements, \textit{ab initio} IFE theory, and ASD simulations.}]supp}).

\begin{figure}

	\caption{a) Schematic of the time-resolved pump-probe experiment implemented at FERMI. 
	b) Static absorption (red, black for opposite magnetic fields) and XMCD asymmetry (blue) spectra of the GdFeCo sample measured across the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance.
	The yellow dashed lines indicate the photon energies used for XUV pumping (51.0, 54.1, 56.1 and \SI{64.0}{eV}). 
	The static spectroscopy was carried out with an energy resolution of \SI{\leq 0.01}{eV} using the ALICE reflectometer \cite{alice} at the PM3 beamline of BESSY II \cite{Kachel:ie5135}. \label{1_Figure}}
\end{figure}

The studied sample was a \SI{20}{nm} thin amorphous film of a ferrimagnetic $\textrm{Gd}_{24}\textrm{Fe}_{67}\textrm{Co}_{9}$ alloy with an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy. 
For static absorption spectroscopy, it was deposited on a \SI{30}{nm} $\textrm{Si}_{3}\textrm{N}_{4}$ membrane, allowing transmission of the XUV radiation. 
For the time-resolved measurements, a \SI{1}{mm} thick glass substrate was used in order to allow simultaneous detection of the Faraday and Kerr signals. 
In both cases, the magnetic sample was sandwiched between Ta seed and capping layers to protect it from oxidation. 
The exact sample compositions are $\rm Ta(\SI{2}{nm})/GdFeCo(\SI{20}{nm})/Ta(\SI{5}{nm})/Si_{3}N_{4}(\SI{30}{nm})$ and $\rm Ta(\SI{2}{nm})/GdFeCo(\SI{20}{nm})/Ta(\SI{5}{nm})/Glass(\SI{1}{mm})$, respectively.

Fig.~\ref{1_Figure}b shows the XUV absorption spectra (XAS) measured on the GdFeCo sample across the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance for opposite magnetic fields and the resulting XMCD spectrum. 
The absorption peak at around \SI{56.1}{eV} corresponds to the resonant excitation of 3p electrons of Fe into 3d states; the second and less pronounced peak around \SI{62.0}{eV} arises due to resonant excitation of the small fraction of Co atoms. 
Note that the vanishing XMCD at this photon energy results from the superposition of bipolar XMCD features of the Fe and Co $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonances weighted by their different concentrations in the alloy (see SM \cite{supp}).
To study the wavelength-dependence of the XUV excitation across the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance, the photon energy of the FEL pulses was tuned to fixed positions in the spectrum at \SI{51.0}{eV} (below resonance), \SI{54.1}{eV} (largest XMCD), \SI{56.1}{eV} (highest absorption) and \SI{64.0}{eV} (above resonance).

Fig.~\ref{2_Figure} shows the temporal evolution of magnetization after resonant excitation by linearly and circularly polarized XUV pulses at a photon energy of \SI{54.1}{eV}, as measured by the Faraday signal; for the Kerr measurements leading to similar results, see SM \cite{supp}. 
The data was fitted using a double-exponential fit function convoluted with a Gaussian (solid lines in Fig.~\ref{2_Figure}), taking into account the ultrafast demagnetization, the subsequent relaxation process and the experimental time resolution. 
For clarity, the pump-probe scans are displayed only for two incident XUV fluences, showing the dynamics upon low and high fluence excitation. 
The data reveals a clear influence of the XUV polarization on the demagnetization amplitudes, emerging upon excitation with increasing incident fluence (compare 1.3 and \SI{6.7}{mJ/cm^2}). 
Above \SI{1.3}{mJ/cm^2}, the XUV pump helicity drives either an enhancement or a decrease of the demagnetization effect that takes place within the first hundreds of femtoseconds; this helicity-dependent difference in demagnetization magnitudes lasts for tens of picoseconds, i.e., also during the magnetization relaxation process, emphasizing the strength and robustness of the transient XUV-induced magnetization. Such a helicity-dependent behavior is at variance with the case of linearly polarized XUV excitation that generates demagnetization based on purely thermal effects, i.e., demagnetization driven by ultrafast electronic heating.

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{3_Figure}
	\caption{Demagnetization amplitudes ($D$) measured upon pumping with circularly polarized XUV pulses with opposite helicities ($\sigma_{\pm}$, upper panels) and their difference $\Delta M$ (lower panels) as a function of incident fluence and XUV photon energy.

	The solid lines in the upper panels correspond to sigmoid functions fitted as guide to the eye; the shaded areas denote the experimental uncertainty by a \SI{90}{\percent} confidence interval.
	The dashed lines in the lower panels indicate linear trends fitted to the different fluence regimes (white and grey shaded background).
	For clarity, only the fluence-dependence of the $\sigma_{\pm}$-polarized excitation is shown (for linear polarization, see SM \cite{supp}). 
	\label{3_Figure}}
\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{3_Figure}, the demagnetization amplitudes obtained from the double-exponential fits are shown as a function of XUV photon energy, polarization and incident excitation fluence, evaluated for the full range of used XUV fluences. 
The data reveals a strong helicity-dependent effect that is present over the whole range of photon energies used for excitation, be it \textit{on-} (54.1 and \SI{56.1}{eV}) or \textit{off-}resonant (51.0 and \SI{64.0}{eV}) with respect to the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance. 
The splitting between either enhanced or attenuated demagnetization amplitudes upon $\sigma_{\pm}$-polarized excitation ($D = 1 - \text{min}[M/M_0]$, upper panels) and accordingly the magnitude and sign of the difference ($\Delta M = D[\sigma_-] - D[\sigma_+]$, lower panels) show that the effect is wavelength-dependent, clearly changing its polarity along the resonance.
The data further reveals that the effect is strongly fluence-dependent; within the experimental uncertainty, two fluence regimes become apparent (illustrated by the white/grey shaded background in the lower panels of Fig.~\ref{3_Figure}) where the magnitude of $\Delta M$ initially increases with XUV fluence and then either reaches a saturated state at a constant $\Delta M$ value or decreases again as the fluence is further elevated.
In case of below- and above-resonant excitation (51.0 and \SI{64.0}{eV}), $\Delta M$ scales linearly with the fluence until the saturated state is achieved.
It thereby reaches up to \SI{32.2\pm0.7}{\percent} difference in pump-induced change with respect to the equilibrium magnetization (largest $\Delta M$ observed for \SI{5.3}{mJ/cm^2} at \SI{64.0}{eV}). 
In case of resonant excitation (54.1 and \SI{56.1}{eV}), the data reveals a more complex fluence-dependence, indicating either a threshold-like behavior (\SI{54.1}{eV}) or even a fluence-dependent sign change of $\Delta M$ (\SI{56.1}{eV}).
For excitation between 54.1 and \SI{64.0}{eV}, the demagnetization reaches amplitudes of up to \SI{\approx 100}{\percent} at high fluences (depending on the helicity), corresponding to full demagnetization of the magnetic layer.
This leads to the observed saturation of $\Delta M$ in the high fluence regime, as the increasing thermal load and demagnetization starts to mitigate the helicity-dependence.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The most striking observation is the presence of strong helicity-dependent differences even for the \textit{off-}resonant excitation at photon energies where the XUV spectroscopy shows very small or even zero XMCD (compare Fig.~\ref{1_Figure}b for 51.0 and \SI{64.0}{eV}).
Based on this finding, a purely thermal mechanism due to dichroic absorption can already be ruled out as the driving force behind the observed helicity-dependence at these two photon energies, which strongly indicates the existence of an opto-magnetic effect such as the IFE.
This interpretation is further corroborated by the linear scaling with the fluence (XUV intensity) observed at 51.0 and \SI{64.0}{eV}, resembling a typical IFE feature, since the magnetization induced by the IFE depends linearly on the incident light intensity via the opto-magnetic, wavelength-dependent constant (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:IFEformula}) and Ref.~\onlinecite{PhysRevB.89.014413}). 
A possible explanation for the more complex fluence-dependence and the deviation from a purely linear scaling observed at 54.1 and \SI{56.1}{eV} can be given by the steep slope of the XAS and XMCD spectra (see Fig.~\ref{1_Figure}b) at these photon energies, significantly changing the response of the system when the spectrum is slightly reshaped while the system is driven out of equilibrium, depending on the strength of the excitation \cite{PhysRevB.102.100405,Hennes2021}.

The generation of helicity-dependent effects that are longer-lived compared to the duration of the driving pump pulse (see Fig.~\ref{2_Figure}) have been previously reported in various experimental studies of the IFE on different materials \cite{Kimel2005, PhysRevB.73.014421,PhysRevLett.98.207401,PhysRevB.84.214421,PhysRevB.85.104402,John2017}.
Although the IFE is active only during the pump pulse duration, the subsequent magnetization evolution is affected on much longer time scales, especially, when the impulsively IFE-induced magnetization is large (here we reach a maximum of $\approx$30$\%$ of the ground-state $M_0$ values) and, consequently, the system needs longer times to accomodate such large magnetic changes.

In order to compare our experimental results to theoretical predictions of an opto-magnetic effect in the XUV spectral range, we carried out first \textit{ab initio} calculations of the IFE \cite{PhysRevB.89.014413,PhysRevLett.117.137203} in vicinity of the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance.
To reduce the computational complexity, the system was modeled as a stoichiometric $\text{GdFe}_2\text{Co}$ unit cell, focusing on the $\textit{static}$ opto-magnetic response for left ($\sigma_-$) and right ($\sigma_+$) circularly polarized excitation (for more details, see SM \cite{supp}).
The difference $\Delta_{\text{IFE}} = \mathcal{K}^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_{-}}(\omega) - \mathcal{K}^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_{+}}(\omega)$ between the calculated opto-magnetic constants is shown in Fig.~\ref{4_Figure} in comparison to the largest helicity-dependent effects that were experimentally observed for the studied excitation photon energies (see lower panels of Fig.~\ref{3_Figure}).
Note that this comparison is purely \textit{qualitative}, as the constants $\mathcal{K}^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_{\pm}}(\omega)$ are obtained from stationary IFE calculations, so far not taking into account the fluence-dependent, non-equilibrium state present upon femtosecond excitation.
In order to obtain a qualitative agreement with the experimental data, the calculated spectrum of the IFE response had to be shifted by \SI{+2.5}{eV}, which can be attributed to the effect of the core holes that is not included in the calculations (see SM~\cite{supp} and Ref.~\onlinecite{Turgut2016}).
The calculations support our experimental findings regarding the existence of an opto-magnetic effect at these wavelengths by predicting a highly wavelength-dependent IFE in vicinity of the $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance. 
The calculated $\Delta_{\text{IFE}}$ reverses its sign going through the resonance, which is again in qualitative agreement to the different polarity of $\Delta M$ observed in the experiment for below- and above-resonant excitation.
This sign reversal occurs because the IFE spectra $\mathcal{K} 
^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_-} (\omega)$ and $\mathcal{K}^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_+} (\omega )$ display an energy shift with respect to each other at the $\text{3p} \to \text{3d}$ resonance, generated by the exchange splitting of the 3d states (see SM \cite{supp}). 
Furthermore, it has to be emphasized that the calculations show a finite response at the photon energies 51.0 and \SI{64.0}{eV}, corroborating the existence of a helicity-dependent interaction at photon energies where a thermal mechanism due to the XMCD effect could already be ruled out.
However, the calculations are so far not in quantitative agreement with the experiment regarding the magnitude of the observed helicity-dependence.
Although the XAS show only a minor contribution due to the small amount of Co in the alloy (compare Fig.~\ref{1_Figure}b at \SI{\approx 62.0}{eV}), the IFE calculations show a finite extension of the opto-magnetic response up to the Co $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance, which can qualitatively explain the observation of helicity-dependent effects at \SI{64.0}{eV}, but not yet quantitatively the magnitude of the effect compared to the Fe response. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{4_Figure}
	\caption{Comparison of the experimentally observed $\Delta M_{\text{exp}}$ (yellow diamonds, left scale) to the difference $\Delta_{\text{IFE}}$ (turquoise line, right scale) between the calculated opto-magnetic constants $\mathcal{K}^{\text{IFE}}_{\sigma_{\pm}}(\omega)$ obtained from \textit{ab initio} IFE theory.
	The red circles (left scale) correspond to the output of ASD simulations, simulating the expected demagnetization difference $\Delta M_{\text{sim}}$ induced by dichroic absorption due to the XMCD effect.
	At \SI{56.1}{eV}, two values are shown for $\Delta M_{\text{exp}}$, reflecting its opposite polarity in the low vs.\ high fluence regime.
	\label{4_Figure}}
\end{figure}

To quantify the effect of the finite XMCD present in case of fully resonant excitation at 54.1 and \SI{56.1}{eV} on the helicity-dependent dynamics, atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations were carried out \cite{Radu2011,Evans2014,vampire-url,Iacocca2019}, simulating the influence of the dichroic absorption on the helicity-dependent demagnetization amplitudes (see Fig.~\ref{4_Figure} and SM~\cite{supp}). 
For best comparability, the excitation fluence was calibrated between experiment and simulation by matching the demagnetization amplitudes obtained upon linearly polarized excitation. 
While the absence of any helicity-dependence in the XMCD-driven ASD simulations is obvious for photon energies without XMCD (51.0 and \SI{64.0}{eV}), the simulation shows that even in the fully resonant case (54.1 and \SI{56.1}{eV}), the expected dichroic demagnetization effects would be smaller by at least a factor of six.
Thus, a significant contribution of a purely thermal mechanism (via dichroic absorption) on the observed helicity-dependent dynamics can be ruled out, strengthening our conclusions regarding the existence of an opto-magnetic effect like the IFE for both on- and off-resonant excitation in vicinity of the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance. 

In conclusion, we studied the impact of femtosecond XUV photo-excitation of a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo layer using circularly polarized FEL pulses at the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance.
The systematic investigation of time-resolved magneto-optical Faraday rotation data obtained as a function of XUV excitation fluence, photon energy and polarization reveals a strong and long-lived helicity-dependent effect on the ultrafast demagnetization dynamics.
The analysis of its wavelength- and fluence-dependence in comparison to static XMCD spectroscopy and time-resolved ASD simulations shows that the observed effect cannot be thermally induced by dichroic absorption.
Instead, it has the characteristic fingerprints of an opto-magnetic effect, which is further corroborated by first \textit{ab initio} theory on the IFE at the Fe $\text{M}_{3,2}$ resonance, showing qualitative agreement between the calculated IFE spectrum and the experimental data.
Further experimental studies and theoretical efforts are needed for obtaining a \textit{quantitative} understanding of the experimental results, especially with respect to the non-trivial fluence-dependence observed for excitation on the XUV resonance.
This requires to consider the IFE also in the highly non-equilibrium state upon femtosecond pulsed excitation, which is currently not included in the \textit{ab initio} opto-magnetic theory.
Complementary measurements upon resonant excitation of the Fe $\text{L}$ edges, exciting 2p core-level electrons with even larger SOC compared to the 3p states, would provide further insights into the actual scaling of the IFE with the SOC and photon energy.
Modern x-ray free-electron lasers are able to provide the required highly intense, circularly polarized femtosecond pulses of soft x-rays \cite{Lutman2016,Abela:yi5074,10.1117/12.2264689}.
The observation of large opto-magnetic effects in the XUV spectral range also implies a significant, yet to be explored impact on ultrafast magnetization switching phenomena in addition to the MCD-induced helicity-dependence known from the visible-light regime \cite{PhysRevLett.108.127205}.
Moreover, the different nature of the Gd 4f and Fe 3d magnetic moments with respect to their SOC and predominantly localized vs.\ itinerant character suggests that comparing element-specific excitation of the rare-earth and transition metal sublattices will contribute to fully revealing the microscopic mechanisms behind the XUV and soft x-ray IFE.

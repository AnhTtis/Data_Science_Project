volume={144},
number={3},
pages={597},
abstract={In this review, we describe applications of the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with resampling, to various problems in polymer physics. PERM produces samples according to any given prescribed weight distribution, by growing configurations step by step with controlled bias, and correcting ``bad'' configurations by ``population control''. The latter is implemented, in contrast to other population based algorithms like e.g. genetic algorithms, by depth-first recursion which avoids storing all members of the population at the same time in computer memory. The problems we discuss all concern single polymers (with one exception), but under various conditions: Homopolymers in good solvents and at the $\Theta$ point, semi-stiff polymers, polymers in confining geometries, stretched polymers undergoing a forced globule-linear transition, star polymers, bottle brushes, lattice animals as a model for randomly branched polymers, DNA melting, and finally---as the only system at low temperatures, lattice heteropolymers as simple models for protein folding. PERM is for some of these problems the method of choice, but it can also fail. We discuss how to recognize when a result is reliable, and we discuss also some types of bias that can be crucial in guiding the growth into the right directions.},

abstract={Active matter, which ranges from molecular motors to groups of animals, exists at different length scales and timescales, and various computational models have been proposed to describe and predict its behaviour. The diversity of the methods and the challenges in modelling active matter primarily originate from the out-of-equilibrium character, lack of detailed balance and of time-reversal symmetry, multiscale nature, nonlinearity and multibody interactions. Models exist for both dry active matter and active matter in fluids, and can be agent-based or continuum-level descriptions. They can be generic, emphasizing universal features, or detailed, capturing specific features. We compare various modelling approaches and numerical techniques to illuminate the innovations and challenges in understanding active matter.}

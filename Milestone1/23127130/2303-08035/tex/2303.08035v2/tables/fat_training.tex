    \caption{Accuracy for the training of the custom \titlecaseabbreviation{dnn} on FashionMNIST using \titlecaseabbreviation{fat}. The final results show that training while injecting the selected faults provide better coverage of possible \titlecaseabbreviationpl{sdc}, while reaching a similar baseline training accuracy. However, when using the faults generated with \textbf{RBRNo}, the model is similarly affected by the critical faults found using \textbf{GBINo}, making \emphasizedworkname{} more effective in selecting proper critical faults to train against with \titlecaseabbreviation{fat}.}

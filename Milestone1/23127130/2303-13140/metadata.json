    "abstract": "Framework materials and their deformations provide a compelling relation between materials science and algebraic geometry. Physical distance constraints within the material transform into polynomial constraints, making algebraic geometry and associated numerical strategies feasible for finding equilibrium configurations and deformation pathways. In this paper, we build the necessary geometric formulations and numerical strategies to explore the mechanics of two examples of 3-periodic tensegrity frameworks through non-linear optimization, eventually showing that the structures are auxetic by multiple definitions.",

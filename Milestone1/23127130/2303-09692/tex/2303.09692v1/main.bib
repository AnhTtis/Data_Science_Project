It is based on ranking supermartingales, a notion analogous to ranking functions on non-probabilistic programs. The framework is proven sound and complete for a meaningful class of programs involving randomization and bounded nondeterminism. We complement this foundational insigh by a practical proof methodology, based on sound conditions that enable compositional reasoning and are amenable to a direct implementation using modern theorem provers. This is integrated in a small dependent type system, to overcome the problem that lexicographic ranking functions fail when combined with randomization. Among others, this compositional methodology enables the verification of probabilistic programs outside the complete class that admits ranking supermartingales.},

  abstract  = {Semantics for nondeterministic probabilistic sequential programs has been well studied in the past decades. In a variety of semantic models, how nondeterministic choice interacts with probabilistic choice is the most significant difference. In He, Morgan, and McIver's relational model, probabilistic choice refines nondeterministic choice. This model is general because of its predicative-style semantics in Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, and suitable for automated reasoning because of its algebraic feature. Previously, we gave probabilistic semantics to the RoboChart notation based on this model, and also formalised the proof that the semantic embedding is a homomorphism, and revealed interesting details. In this paper, we present our mechanisation of the proof in Isabelle/UTP enabling automated reasoning for probabilistic sequential programs including a subset of the RoboChart language. With mechanisation, we even reveal more interesting questions, hidden in the original model. We demonstrate several examples, including an example to illustrate the interaction between nondeterministic choice and probabilistic choice, and a RoboChart model for randomisation based on binary probabilistic choice.},

  abstract = {The growing complexity and diversity of models used for engineering dependable systems implies that a variety of formal methods, across differing abstractions, paradigms, and presentations, must be integrated. Such an integration requires unified semantic foundations for the various notations, and co-ordination of a variety of automated verification tools. The contribution of this paper is Isabelle/UTP, an implementation of Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, a framework for unification of formal semantics. Isabelle/UTP permits the mechanisation of computational theories for diverse paradigms, and their use in constructing formalised semantics. These can be further applied in the development of verification tools, harnessing Isabelle's proof automation facilities. Several layers of mathematical foundations are developed, including lenses to model variables and state spaces as algebraic objects, alphabetised predicates and relations to model programs, algebraic and axiomatic semantics, proof tools for Hoare logic and refinement calculus, and UTP theories to encode computational paradigms.},

  abstract  = {We outline a probabilistic denotational semantics for the RoboChart language, a diagrammatic, domain-specific notation for describing robotic controllers with their hardware platforms and operating environments. We do this using a powerful (but perhaps not so well known) semantic technique: He, Morgan, and McIver's weakest completion semantics, which is based on Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming. In this approach, we do the following: (1) start with the standard semantics for a nondeterministic programming language; (2) propose a new probabilistic semantic domain; (3) propose a forgetful function from the probabilistic semantic domain to the standard semantic domain; (4) use the converse of the forgetful function to embed the standard semantic domain in the probabilistic semantic domain; (5) demonstrate that this embedding preserves program structure; (6) define the probabilistic choice operator. Weakest completion semantics guides the semantic definition of new languages by building on existing semantics and, in this case, tackling a notoriously thorny issue: the relationship between demonic and probabilistic choice. Consistency ensures that programming intuitions, development techniques, and proof methods can be carried over from the standard language to the probabilistic one. We largely follow He et al., our contribution being an explication of the technique with meticulous proofs suitable for mechanisation in Isabelle/UTP.},

  abstract = {The two models presented in this paper provide two different semantics for an extension of Dijkstra's language of guarded commands. The extended language has an additional operator, namely probabilistic choice, which makes it possible to express randomized algorithms. An earlier model by Claire Jones included probabilistic choice but not non-determinism, which meant that it could not be used for the development of algorithms from specifications. Our second model is built on top of Claire Jones' model, using a general method of extending a probabilistic cpo to one which also contains non-determinism. The first model was constructed from scratch, as it were, guided only by the desire for certain algebraic properties of the language constructs, which we found lacking in the second model. We compare and contrast the properties of the two models both by giving examples and by constructing mappings between them and the non-probabilistic model. On the basis of this comparison we argue that, in general, the first model is preferable to the second.},

Parametric Markov decision processes whose state rewards depend on the post-expectation at hand are used as the operational model. We show that the weakest pre-expectation of a pGCL-program w.r.t. a post-expectation corresponds to the expected cumulative reward to reach a terminal state in the parametric MDP associated to the program. In a similar way, we show a correspondence between weakest liberal pre-expectations and liberal expected cumulative rewards. The verification of probabilistic programs using wp-semantics and operational semantics is illustrated using a simple running example.},

We study a formalism which allows reasoning about programs which can act probabilistically. To describe probabilistic programs a basic programming language with an operator for probabilistic choice is introduced and a denotational semantics is given for this language. To specify properties of probabilistic programs, standard first order logic predicates are insufficient, so a notion of probabilistic predicates are introduced. A Hoare-style proof system to check properties of probabilistic programs is given. The proof system for a sublanguage is shown to be correct and complete; the properties that can be derived are exactly the valid properties. Finally some typical examples illustrate the use of the probabilistic predicates and the proof system.},

An important question for a probabilistic program is whether the probability mass of all its diverging runs is zero, that is that it terminates "almost surely". Proving that can be hard, and this paper presents a new method for doing so. It applies directly to the program's source code, even if the program contains demonic choice. Like others, we use variant functions (a.k.a. "super-martingales") that are real-valued and decrease randomly on each loop iteration; but our key innovation is that the amount as well as the probability of the decrease are parametric. We prove the soundness of the new rule, indicate where its applicability goes beyond existing rules, and explain its connection to classical results on denumerable (non-demonic) Markov chains.},

  abstract   = {Probabilistic programs extend classical imperative programs with real-valued random variables and random branching. The most basic liveness property for such programs is the termination property. The qualitative (aka almost-sure) termination problem asks whether a given program program terminates with probability 1. While ranking functions provide a sound and complete method for non-probabilistic programs, the extension of them to probabilistic programs is achieved via ranking supermartingales (RSMs). Although deep theoretical results have been established about RSMs, their application to probabilistic programs with nondeterminism has been limited only to programs of restricted control-flow structure. For non-probabilistic programs, lexicographic ranking functions provide a compositional and practical approach for termination analysis of real-world programs. In this work we introduce lexicographic RSMs and show that they present a sound method for almost-sure termination of probabilistic programs with nondeterminism. We show that lexicographic RSMs provide a tool for compositional reasoning about almost-sure termination, and for probabilistic programs with linear arithmetic they can be synthesized efficiently (in polynomial time). We also show that with additional restrictions even asymptotic bounds on expected termination time can be obtained through lexicographic RSMs. Finally, we present experimental results on benchmarks adapted from previous work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract  = {We present static analyses for probabilistic loops using expectation invariants. Probabilistic loops are imperative while-loops augmented with calls to random variable generators. Whereas, traditional program analysis uses Floyd-Hoare style invariants to over-approximate the set of reachable states, our approach synthesizes invariant inequalities involving the expected values of program expressions at the loop head. We first define the notion of expectation invariants, and demonstrate their usefulness in analyzing probabilistic program loops. Next, we present the set of expectation invariants for a loop as a fixed point of the pre-expectation operator over sets of program expressions. Finally, we use existing concepts from abstract interpretation theory to present an iterative analysis that synthesizes expectation invariants for probabilistic program loops. We show how the standard polyhedral abstract domain can be used to synthesize expectation invariants for probabilistic programs, and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on some examples of probabilistic program loops.},

  abstract   = {In this article, we consider the termination problem of probabilistic programs with real-valued variables. The questions concerned are: qualitative ones that ask (i) whether the program terminates with probability 1 (almost-sure termination) and (ii) whether the expected termination time is finite (finite termination); and quantitative ones that ask (i) to approximate the expected termination time (expectation problem) and (ii) to compute a bound B such that the probability not to terminate after B steps decreases exponentially (concentration problem). To solve these questions, we utilize the notion of ranking supermartingales, which is a powerful approach for proving termination of probabilistic programs. In detail, we focus on algorithmic synthesis of linear ranking-supermartingales over affine probabilistic programs (Apps) with both angelic and demonic non-determinism. An important subclass of Apps is LRApp which is defined as the class of all Apps over which a linear ranking-supermartingale exists.Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, we show that the membership problem of LRApp (i) can be decided in polynomial time for Apps with at most demonic non-determinism, and (ii) is NP-hard and in PSPACE for Apps with angelic non-determinism. Moreover, the NP-hardness result holds already for Apps without probability and demonic non-determinism. Secondly, we show that the concentration problem over LRApp can be solved in the same complexity as for the membership problem of LRApp. Finally, we show that the expectation problem over LRApp can be solved in 2EXPTIME and is PSPACE-hard even for Apps without probability and non-determinism (i.e., deterministic programs). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to answer the qualitative and quantitative questions over Apps with at most demonic non-determinism.},

Isabelle's new analysis theory unifies and generalizes these earlier efforts. The improvements are centered on two primary contributions: a generic theory of limits based on filters, and a new hierarchy of type classes that includes various topological, metric, vector, and algebraic spaces. These let us apply many results in multivariate analysis to types which are not Euclidean spaces, such as the extended real numbers, bounded continuous functions, or finite maps.},

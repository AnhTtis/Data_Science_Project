    "abstract": "We report photometry of the intranight variability of the dwarf nova RX And in two bands (B and V). The observations are carried out during three nights in November-December 2022 at the 50/70~cm Schmidt telescope of the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory. The observations indicate that the amplitude of the flickering is about 0.5 mag in B band when the star is in faint state (m_V=13.5), but it is considerably lower (less than 0.1 mag) when the star is bright (m_V=10.9). The mass accretion rate in high state is estimated to be $1.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Combining our data and GAIA distances we find for the mass donor in RX~And spectral type K6V-K7V.\n  The data are available upon request from the authors.",

	abstract = {Network data often take the form of repeated interactions between senders and receivers tabulated over time. A primary question to ask of such data is which traits and behaviours are predictive of interaction. To answer this question, a model is introduced for treating directed interactions as a multivariate point process: a Cox multiplicative intensity model using covariates that depend on the history of the process. Consistency and asymptotic normality are proved for the resulting partial-likelihood-based estimators under suitable regularity conditions, and an efﬁcient ﬁtting procedure is described. Multicast interactions—those involving a single sender but multiple receivers—are treated explicitly. The resulting inferential framework is then employed to model message sending behaviour in a corporate e-mail network. The analysis gives a precise quantiﬁcation of which static shared traits and dynamic network effects are predictive of message recipient selection.},

We experimentally determine the variability of estimated parameters as a function of the number of sampled events and controls per event, respectively. Results suggest that REMs can be reliably ﬁtted to networks with more than 12 million nodes connected by more than 360 million dyadic events by analyzing a sample of some tens of thousands of events and a small number of controls per event. Using the data that we collected on the Wikipedia editing network, we illustrate how network effects commonly included in empirical studies based on REMs need widely different sample sizes to be reliably estimated. For our analysis we use an open-source software which implements the two sampling schemes, allowing analysts to ﬁt and analyze REMs to the same or other data that may be collected in different empirical settings, varying sample parameters or model speciﬁcation.},

	abstract = {The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) receives more prior art submissions by patent applicants than its patent examiners have the capacity to process. Although applicantprior art submissions are highly likely to contain references material to prosecution, evidence suggests that overburdened examiners often fail to utilize references submitted by applicants in their examination of patent applications. The information overload suffered by patent examiners has deleteriouseffects onpatent quality, since examiners fail to identify and apply the references most relevantto the examination ofpatentapplications.The vision of patent examiners as perfect filters of patentability and of information as always benefiting the public good is both idealistic and unrealistic. Despite their expertise, patent examiners are human andfallible, vulnerable to the effects of information processing overload and the cognitive biases attendant to decision-making by a boundedly rational actor. Failingto addressthese problemswill likely result infrustrated applicants,overburdenedpatent examiners, andreducedpatent quality. This Article proposes to solve both the plague of inequitable conduct allegations in litigation and the administrativeburdens of complying with the duty of disclosure by reframing disclosure obligationsfor the information age. Reframing the duty of disclosure in this fashion would require no modifications to statutory provisions, few alterations to administrative rules and regulations, and only modest changes to existing case law.

These models can easily incorporate a wide range of mechanisms involving both endogenous and exogenous network effects. It has been typical for quantitive models to assume that endogenous network mechanisms, such as reciprocity or triadic effects, remain stable over time.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

	abstract = "{Innovation and technological change, long recognized as the main drivers of long-term economic growth, are elusive notions that are difficult to conceptualize and even harder to measure in a consistent, systematic way. This book demonstrates the usefulness of patents and citations data as a window on the process of technological change and as a powerful tool for research on the economics of innovation. Patent records contain a wealth of information, including the inventors' identity, location, and employer, as well as the technological field of the invention. Patents also contain citation references to previous patents, which allow one to trace links across inventions.The book lays out the conceptual foundations for such research and provides a range of interesting applications, such as examining the geographic pattern of knowledge spillovers and evaluating the impact of university and government patenting. It also describes statistical tools designed to handle methodological problems raised by the patent and citation processes. The book is accompanied by a set of auxiliary materials, including complete data on 3 million patents with more than 16 million citations and a range of author-devised measures of the importance, generality, and originality of patented innovations.

Knowledge spillover is an occurrence, which is imaginable but difficult to have an effective measurement of it. Patents citation is a developing concept and has gained momentum in recent past. Patents citation contains valuable data and if analyzed well, may sometimes reveal concealed mysteries of the information flow between countries, laboratories, companies, and universities. Profuse technical research has been conducted on this topic by many scientists. Through these experiments, scientists have tried to show that the innovative information hidden in patents crosses every barrier and is taken by the research labs for its further expansion. Patents citation reveals the diffusion of information and its applicability into many other technical fields which give birth to a new technology. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of patents citation analysis covering and promoting the landmark research done in the field of patents citation, informing readers to consider this important segment of patent document as a field for analysis. Also, this paper presents an innovative methodology for generating patent citation network with the help of techniques of Information Retrievals.}

Using a sample of 535 financing rounds at 173 privately held venture-backed biotechnology firms, I show that the breadth of patent protection significantly affects valuations. A one standard deviation increase in average patent scope is associated with a 21% increase in the firm's value. Broad patents are more valuable when substitutes in the same product class are plentiful, a finding consistent with theoretical suggestions.},

	abstract = {The information in patent data can be used for strategic planning purposes. A conceptual framework is developed showing the use of patent information in core areas of technology management. This paper addresses how patent information can be used for competitor monitoring, technology assessment, R&D portfolio management, the identification and assessment of potential sources for the external generation of technological knowledge, especially by means of mergers and acquisitions, and human resource management. Indicators of patenting strategies and various portfolio concepts which can be used for these purposes are described. Because of its strategic value, it is argued that the retrieval and evaluation of patent data should be institutionalized within the organization in order to ensure the continuous and systematic use of patent information in a company’s decision-making processes. How patent information becomes a core element of a firm’s knowledge management system is outlined. This type of strategic patent information is geared toward two important recipients: (1) senior management who uses this information for decision-making purposes in important areas of technology management and (2) external stakeholders of the firm, such as shareholders and analysts, who have an increasing interest in assessing a firm’s technological competence because of its strong impact on the firm’s future competitiveness.}

	abstract = { Relational event models shift the analytical focus away from network ties defined in terms of transitions between mutually exclusive states of connectivity, to bonding processes emerging from observable flows linking senders and receivers of action. In this framework, the possibility to connect social mechanisms of theoretical interest to sequences of observed relational events depends on the relative speed at which these mechanisms operate. Building on established non-parametric methods in survival analysis, in this paper we introduce a new approach to the analysis of the internal time distribution of relational mechanisms of broad theoretical interest in research on the evolutionary dynamics of social and other kinds of networks. We propose general algorithms that may be adopted to study the time structure of theoretically relevant network mechanisms. We illustrate the practical value of our proposal in an analysis of a large sample of high-frequency financial transactions observed over a period of 11 years. We show how the internal time structure of the social mechanisms that control flows of market transactions is sensitive to institutional change in transaction regimes induced by successive financial crises. The results we report invite reflection on a new notion of network “structure” incorporating change as one of its constitutive elements. The study suggests a number of conjectures that provide broad conceptual bases for the development of testable hypotheses about the forces that shape the evolutionary dynamics of network structure. }

While longitudinal network data sets are increasingly being recorded at the granularity of individual time-stamped events, most studies only focus on collapsed cross-sectional snapshots of the network. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic egocentric framework that models continuous-time network data using multivariate counting processes. For inference, an efﬁcient partial likelihood approach is used, allowing our methods to scale to large networks. We apply our techniques to various citation networks and demonstrate the predictive power and interpretability of the learned statistical models.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is to develop a systematic understanding of embeddedness and organization networks. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at 23 entrepreneurial firms, I identify the components of embedded relationships and explicate the devices by which embeddedness shapes organizational and economic outcomes. The findings suggest that embeddedness is a logic of exchange that promotes economies of time, integrative agreements, Pareto improvements in allocative efficiency, and complex adaptation. These positive effects rise up to a threshold, however, after which embeddedhess can derail economic performance by making firms vulnerable to exogenous shocks or insulating them from information that exists beyond their network. A framework is proposed that explains how these properties vary with the quality of social ties, the structure of the organization network, and an organization's structural position in the network."},

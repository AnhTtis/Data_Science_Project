\chapter{Technical Details}\label{appendix_a}

Here we provide some technical details of the implementation. The project is being developed in Python 3.6.10 environment and makes use of the Kaggle\footnote{www.kaggle.com} Kernels with GPU and the following libraries ,platforms and hardware:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Keras v2.3.1, Deep Learning Library for Theano and Tensorflow
    \item Pytorch 1.11, Machine Learning Framework build on Python
    \item cv2 v4.5, a Python wrapper for OpenCV
    \item SciPy v1.5, a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science and engineering
    \item NumPy v1.18.5, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
    \item Pandas v1.0.5, a data analysis and manipulation library for Python
    \item Matplotlib v3.2.2, a Python plotting library
    \item Seaborn v0.11.2, a statistical data visualization library for Python

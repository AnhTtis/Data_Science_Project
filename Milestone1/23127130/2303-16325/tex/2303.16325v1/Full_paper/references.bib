  abstract = {A series of laboratory tests were carried out to understand the extent of effect of roughness and Reynolds number on mean velocity in both outer and inner scaling. To this end, four different types of bed surface conditions (impermeable smooth bed, impermeable rough bed, permeable sand bed and impermeable distributed roughness) and two different Reynolds number (Reh = 47,500 and 31,000) were adopted in the study. Sand particles of median diameter of 2.46 mm were used to create the roughness. The results show that the mean velocities collapsed well for different Reynolds number and for all different bed surfaces. The maximum velocity for all flow conditions were observed below some distances from the free surface. The location of maximum velocity is seen to be dependent on both of roughness and Reynolds number. The smooth bed test data agrees well with the standard log law and collapses well in viscous sub layer and overlap region. The extent of collapses is found to be dependent on Reynolds number. Friction coefficient is noted to be dependent on both the Reynolds number and roughness.},

Snapshots of the flow field were analysed using the method of Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) in frequency domain, in order to extract the dominant coherent structures of the flow. Focus is given to twodimensional disturbances, known to be most relevant for aeroacoustics. The leading SPOD modes show coherent structures forming a wavepacket, with significant amplitudes in the trailing-edge boundary layer and in the wake. To model coherent structures in the turbulent boundary layer, the optimal harmonic forcing and the associated linear response of the flow were obtained using the singular value decomposition of the linear resolvent operator. The resolvent analysis shows that the leading SPOD modes can be associated to most amplified, linearised flow responses. Furthermore, coherent structures in the wake are modelled as the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode from linear stability theory (LST).},

This approach, although very efficient on a large range of unsymmetric matrices, does not capture the unsymmetric structure of the matrices. We introduce a new algorithm which detects and exploits the structural asymmetry of the submatrices involved during the processing of the elimination tree. We show that with the new algorithm, significant gains, both in memory and in time, to perform the factorization can be obtained.},

  abstract = {A scenario of transition to turbulence likely to occur during the development of natural disturbances in a flat-plate boundary layer is studied. The perturbations at the leading edge of the flat plate that show the highest potential for transient energy amplification consist of streamwise aligned vortices. Due to the lift-up mechanism these optimal disturbances lead to elongated streamwise streaks downstream, with significant spanwise modulation. Direct numerical simulations are used to follow the nonlinear evolution of these streaks and to verify secondary instability calculations. The theory is based on a linear Floquet expansion and focuses on the temporal, inviscid instability of these flow structures. The procedure requires integration in the complex plane, in the coordinate direction normal to the wall, to properly identify neutral modes belonging to the discrete spectrum. The streak critical amplitude, beyond which streamwise travelling waves are excited, is about 26\% of the free-stream velocity. The sinuous instability mode (either the fundamental or the subharmonic, depending on the streak amplitude) represents the most dangerous disturbance. Varicose waves are more stable, and are characterized by a critical amplitude of about 37\%. Stability calculations of streamwise streaks employing the shape assumption, carried out in a parallel investigation, are compared to the results obtained here using the nonlinearly modified mean fields; the need to consider a base flow which includes mean flow modification and harmonics of the fundamental streak is clearly demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Accurate laminar-turbulent transition prediction is needed for many practical problems. This paper presents an overview of the methods which can be used today to estimate the location of the transition onset. The applications are restricted to subsonic \#ows (incompressible and transonic) developing on swept wings of in"nite span. It is assumed that the environmental disturbances are small, so that the transition process is governed by the spatial growth of unstable eigenmodes. Therefore the main theoretical tools are stability theories, linear and nonlinear. The most popular prediction method is the e, method which is based on linear theory. This method was initially developed for two-dimensional \#ows and then extended to more complex problems. The paper describes various approaches currently available to compute the N factor; examples of application are given for wind tunnel and free \#ight experiments. More sophisticated prediction methods make use of weakly nonlinear theories, the governing equations being solved by a PSE (Parabolized Stability Equations) approach. In this case, the problem of choosing a critical value of the N factor at transition is replaced by the problems of de"ning the most interesting nonlinear scenario and of imposing adequate initial conditions. The examples of application presented in the paper illustrate the need for a better understanding of the receptivity mechanisms. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since Professor Reshotko's scientific and engineering contributions have been in the areas of hydrodynamic stability, transition to turbulence, and boundary layer flows, it is only appropriate that the articles in this volume be devoted to these and related topics. The first two sections focus on instabilities and transition in subsonic and supersonic flows, respectively. The third section deals with developing turbulence, while the final section treats related problems in engineering fluid mechanics. The diversity and scope of the articles contained herein exemplify the insight and expertise required in the study of transitional and turbulent flows today -- traits which also exemplify Eli Reshotko's contributions to these fields.},

  abstract = {Simulations for both multiphase flows and supersonic single phased flows are well known, however the combination is a less investigated area of research, as the two basic approaches of computational fluid dynamics, the pressure and the density based approach, each describe one of the phases in a better way than the other one. In this paper, we systematically investigate the solver quality of the open source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM in handling transonic flow phenomena that typically occur inside the breaking chamber of high voltage circuit breakers, during contact separation. The solver quality is then compared with that of chosen commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The main advantage of OpenFOAM is that, contrary to most of the commercial simulation tools, it is license fee free and allows access to the source code. This means that complicated multi physics phenomena inside the arcing chamber can be directly modeled into the code by users, which opens an opportunity to remove limitations of commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. Particularly, the shock capturing capability of OpenFOAM will be evaluated for the transonic internal flow which typically occurs in high voltage circuit breakers. Overall, OpenFOAM shows acceptable shock capturing capabilities in the performed verification and validation studies, with the solver quality comparable to some of the tested commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. There is still room for further solver quality improvements in OpenFOAM by implementing better shock capturing schemes such as a density-based flux-difference-splitting scheme or by writing better physical modeling of the shock/boundary layer interaction into the open architecture of OpenFOAM.},

  abstract = {We introduce a minimization formulation for the determination of a finite-dimensional, time-dependent, orthonormal basis that captures directions of the phase space associated with transient instabilities. While these instabilities have finite lifetime, they can play a crucial role either by altering the system dynamics through the activation of other instabilities or by creating sudden nonlinear energy transfers that lead to extreme responses. However, their essentially transient character makes their description a particularly challenging task. We develop a minimization framework that focuses on the optimal approximation of the system dynamics in the neighbourhood of the system state. This minimization formulation results in differential equations that evolve a time-dependent basis so that it optimally approximates the most unstable directions. We demonstrate the capability of the method for two families of problems: (i) linear systems, including the advection\textendash diffusion operator in a strongly non-normal regime as well as the Orr\textendash Sommerfeld/Squire operator, and (ii) nonlinear problems, including a low-dimensional system with transient instabilities and the vertical jet in cross-flow. We demonstrate that the time-dependent subspace captures the strongly transient non-normal energy growth (in the short-time regime), while for longer times the modes capture the expected asymptotic behaviour.},

The roughness is assumed to be of Gaussian shape and the acoustic disturbances are introduced as boundary condition at the outer field. The governing equations are solved using the 5'h-\textasciitilde rdearccurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for space discretization and using thirdorder total-variation-diminishing (TVD) RungeKutta scheme for time integration. The steady field induced by the two and three-dimensional roughness is also computed. The flow field induced by two-dimensional roughness exhibits different characteristics depending on the roughness heights. At small roughness heights the flow passes smoothly over the roughness, at moderate heights the flow separates downstream of the roughness and at larger roughness heights the flow separates upstream and downstream of the roughness. Computations also show that disturbances inside the boundary layer is due to the direct interaction of the acoustic waves and isolated roughness plays a minor role in generating instability waves.},

This allows resolvent analysis to be extended to turbulent flows with non-stationary means in addition to statistically-stationary flows. The optimal resolvent modes for this formulation correspond to the potentially time-transient structures that are most amplified by the linearized Navier-Stokes operator. We validate this methodology for turbulent channel flow and show that the wavelet-based and Fourier-based resolvent analyses are equivalent for statistically-stationary flows. We then apply the wavelet-based resolvent analysis to study the transient growth mechanism in the buffer layer of a turbulent channel flow by windowing the resolvent operator in time and frequency. The method is also applied to temporally-evolving parallel shear flows such as an oscillating boundary layer and three-dimensional channel flow, in which a lateral pressure gradient perturbs a fully-developed turbulent flow in a channel.},

In particular, the DFT can be derived as the change of basis that simultaneously diagonalizes all circulant matrices. In this way, the DFT arises naturally from a linear algebra question about a set of matrices. Rather than thinking of the DFT as a signal transform, it is more natural to think of it as a single change of basis that renders an entire set of mutually-commuting matrices into simple, diagonal forms. The DFT can then be ``discovered'' by solving the eigenvalue/eigenvector problem for a special element in that set. A brief outline is given of how this line of thinking can be generalized to families of linear operators, leading to the discovery of the other common Fourier-type transforms, as well as its connections with group representations theory.},

  year = {2017},
  month = mar,
  urldate = {2020-10-01},
  abstract = {Linear stability theory has been intensively used over the past decades for the characterization of unsteady flow behaviors. While the existing approaches are numerous, none has the ability to address any general flow. Moreover, clear validity conditions for these techniques are often missing, and this raises the question of their general reliability.In this thesis, this question is addressed by first considering the classical stability approach, which focuses on the evolution of small disturbances about a steady solution -- a base flow -- of the Navier-Stokes equations.To this end, the screech phenomenon -- a tonal noise that is sometimes generated by underexpanded jets -- is studied from alinear stability point of view. The results reveal that the nonlinear dynamics of this phenomenon is well-predicted by a linear base flow stability analysis. A confrontation with other similar analyses from the literature shows that such a satisfactory result is not always observed. However, when a self-sustained oscillating flow is driven by an acoustic feedback loop, as it is the case for the screech phenomenon, cavity flows and impinging jets for instance, then the nonlinearities have a weak impact on the frequency selection process, explaining the ability of a linear analysis to characterize the flow, even in the nonlinear regime.Another alternative approach, based on a linearization about the mean flow, is known to be successful in some cases where a base flow analysis fails. This observation from the literature is explained in this thesis by outlining the role of the resolvent operator, arising from a linearization about the mean flow, in the dynamics of a flow. The main finding is that if this operator displays a clear separation of singular values, which relates to the existence of one strong convective instability mechanism, then the Fourier modes areproportional to the first resolvent modes. This result provides mathematical and physical conditions for the use and meaning of several mean flow stability techniques, such as a parabolised stability equations analysis of a mean flow.Moreover, it leads to a predictive model for the frequency spectrum of a flow field at any arbitrary location, from the sole knowledge of the mean flow and the frequency spectrum at one or more points. All these findings are illustrated and validated in the case of a turbulent backward facing step flow. Finally, these results are exploited in an experimental context, for the reconstruction of the unsteady behavior of a transitional round jet, from the sole knowledge of the mean flow and one point-wise measurement. The study shows that, after following a few experimental precautions, detailed in the manuscript, the reconstruction is very accurate and robust.},

As such, it may be considered as an extension of the works by McKeon \& Sharma ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336\textendash 382) to non-parallel flows and by Turton et al. ( Phys. Rev. E, vol. 91 (4), 2015, 043009) to broadband flows. Considering a Reynolds decomposition of the flow field, the spectral (or temporal Fourier) mode of the fluctuation field is found to be equal to the action on a turbulent forcing term by the resolvent operator arising from linearisation about the mean flow. The main result of the article states that if, at a particular frequency, the dominant singular value of the resolvent is much larger than all others and if the turbulent forcing at this frequency does not display any preferential direction toward one of the suboptimal forcings, then the spectral mode is directly proportional to the dominant optimal response mode of the resolvent at this frequency. Such conditions are generally met in the case of weakly non-parallel open flows exhibiting a convectively unstable mean flow. The spatial structure of the singular mode may in these cases be approximated by a local spatial stability analysis based on parabolised stability equations (PSE). We have also shown that the frequency spectrum of the flow field at any arbitrary location of the domain may be predicted from the frequency evolution of the dominant optimal response mode and the knowledge of the frequency spectrum at one or more points. Results are illustrated in the case of a high Reynolds number turbulent backward facing step flow.},

  abstract = {The effect of turbulent 					wind-tunnel-wall boundary 					layers on density change measurements obtained with focused laser 					differential interferometry (FLDI) was studied using a detailed direct 					numerical simulation (DNS) of the wall from the Boeing/AFOSR Mach-6 					Quiet Tunnel run in its noisy configuration. The DNS was probed with 					an FLDI model that is capable of reading in three-dimensional 					time-varying density fields and computing the FLDI response. Simulated 					FLDI measurements smooth the boundary-layer root-mean-square (RMS) 					profile relative to true values obtained by directly extracting the 					data from the DNS. The peak of the density change RMS measured by the 					FLDI falls within 20\% of the true density change RMS. A relationship 					between local spatial density change and temporal density fluctuations 					was determined and successfully used to estimate density fluctuations 					from the FLDI measurements. FLDI measurements of the freestream 					fluctuations are found to be dominated by the off-axis tunnel-wall 					boundary layers for lower frequencies despite spatial suppression 					provided by the technique. However, low-amplitude (0.05\%\textendash 5\% of the 					mean density) target signals placed along the tunnel centerline were 					successfully measured over the noise of the boundary layers (which 					have RMS values of about 12\% of the mean). Overall, FLDI was shown to 					be a useful technique for making quantitative turbulence measurements 					and to measure finite-width sinusoidal signals through turbulent 					boundary layers, but may not provide enough off-focus suppression to 					provide accurate freestream noise measurements, particularly at lower 					frequencies.},

Specific high-order node-centered finite differences and selective filters removing grid-to-grid oscillations are first designed for the discretization of the buffer region between a Dx-grid domain and 2Dxgrid domain. The coefficients of these matching schemes are chosen so that the maximum order of accuracy is reached. Non-centered finite differences and selective filters are then developed with the aim of accurately computing boundary conditions. They are constructed by minimizing the dispersion and the dissipation errors in the wave number space for waves down to four points per wavelength. The dispersion and dissipation properties of the matching and the boundary schemes are described in detail, and their accuracy limits are determined, to show that these schemes calculate accurately waves with at least five points per wavelength. Test problems, including linear convection, wall reflection and acoustic scattering around a cylinder, are finally solved to illustrate the accuracy of the schemes.},

Computations are performed in both the low- and the high-speed regime (at free-stream Mach number Me = 2) for an isolated three-dimensional element with cubic shape and for two-dimensional roughness strips. For each configuration two values of the roughness height Reynolds number (Rek = 315, 505) are considered. In the case of 3D roughness, the main effect of the obstacle is the generation of streamwise and wall-normal vorticity, with the formation of an unstable detached shear-layer. Consistent with previous experimental observations, the unsteady release of hairpin vortices past the disturbing element is observed at sufficiently high Rek for both incompressibile and supersonic flows, which eventually results in the breakdown to turbulence. A major effect of compressibility is observed for two-dimensional roughness, in which case transition is found in the incompressible simulations for both values of Rek, but only for the higher Rek under supersonic conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a linear global stability analysis of the incompressible axisymmetric boundary layer on a circular cylinder. The base flow is parallel to the axis of the cylinder at inflow boundary. The pressure gradient is zero in the streamwise direction. The base flow velocity profile is fully non-parallel and non-similar in nature. The boundary layer grows continuously in the spatial directions. Linearized Navier\textendash Stokes (LNS) equations are derived for the disturbance flow quantities in the cylindrical polar coordinates. The LNS equations along with homogeneous boundary conditions forms a generalized eigenvalues problem. Since the base flow is axisymmetric, the disturbances are periodic in azimuthal direction. Chebyshev spectral collocation method and Arnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the solution of the general eigenvalues problem. The global temporal modes are computed for the range of Reynolds numbers and different azimuthal wave numbers. The largest imaginary part of the computed eigenmodes is negative, and hence, the flow is temporally stable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes shows that the disturbance amplitudes grow in size and magnitude while they are moving towards downstream. The global modes of axisymmetric boundary layer are more stable than that of 2D flat-plate boundary layer at low Reynolds number. However, at higher Reynolds number they approach 2D flat-plate boundary layer. Thus, the damping effect of transverse curvature is significant at low Reynolds number. The wave-like nature of the disturbance amplitudes is found in the streamwise direction for the least stable eigenmodes.},

All the methods are constructed in the same way by minimizing the dispersion and the dissipation errors in the wavenumber space up to kDx {$\frac{1}{4}$} p=2 corresponding to four points per wavelength. They are shown to be more accurate, and also more efficient numerically, than most of the standard explicit high-order methods, for uniform and slowly non-uniform grids. Two problems involving long-range sound propagation are resolved to illustrate their respective precisions.

By introducing controlled oscillations with a vibrating ribbon, it is possible to study small-amplitude waves using phase-selective filtering techniques. In the present work, the effect of TS-waves on the transition is studied at Tu = 1.5\%. It is demonstrated that TS-waves can exist and develop in a similar way as in an undisturbed boundary layer. It is also found that TS-waves with quite small amplitudes are involved in nonlinear interactions which lead to a regeneration of TS-waves in the whole unstable frequency band. This results in a significant increase in the number of turbulent spots, which promote the onset of turbulence.},

This occurs under low to moderate levels, 1\%\textendash 2\%, of free-stream turbulence. At high levels of free-stream turbulence, conventional bypass mechanisms are seen. The helical structures are clearly identifiable in visualizations of isosurfaces of streamwise perturbation velocity. A direct numerical simulation also was performed in zero pressure gradient, with a time-periodic Tollmien-Schlichting wave eigenfunction at the inlet. Again, under a moderate level of free-stream turbulence, helices were observed, and found to trigger transition. Their wave speed is on the order of 12U{$\infty$}, so helical breakdown can be viewed as a type of inner mode, secondary instability.},

  abstract = {Computational aeroacoustics often use finite difference schemes optimized to require relatively few points per wavelength; such optimized schemes are often called Dispersion Relation Preserving (DRP). Similar techniques are also used outside aeroacoustics. Here the question is posed: what is the equivalent of points per wavelength for growing or decaying waves, and how well are such waves resolved numerically? Such nonconstant-amplitude waves are common in aeroacoustics, such as the exponential decay caused by acoustic linings, the O(1/r) decay of an expanding spherical wave, and the decay of high-azimuthal-order modes in the radial direction towards the centre of a cylindrical duct. It is shown that optimized spatial derivatives perform poorly for waves that are not of constant amplitude, under performing maximal-order schemes. An equivalent criterion to points per wavelength is proposed for non-constant-amplitude oscillations, reducing to the standard definition for constant-amplitude oscillations and valid even for pure growth or decay with no oscillation. Using this definition, coherent statements about points per wavelength necessary for a given accuracy can be made for maximal-order schemes applied to non-constant-amplitude oscillations. These features are illustrated through a numerical example of a one-dimensional wave propagating through a damping region.},

The streamwise pressure distribution and elevated free stream turbulence levels mimic the conditions present on the suction side of highly-cambered airfoils. Longitudinal streamwise streaks form in the laminar boundary layer through the selective inclusion of low-frequency disturbances from the free stream turbulence. The spanwise spacing normalized by local inner variables indicates stabilization of the streaks occurs by the favourable pressure gradient and prevents the development of secondary streak instability modes until downstream of the suction peak. Two distinct processes are found to trigger transition to turbulence in the adverse pressure gradient region of the flow. One involves the development of varicose secondary instability of individual low-speed streaks that results in their breakdown and the formation and growth of discrete turbulent spots. The other involves a rapid amplification of free stream disturbances in the inflectional boundary layer in the adverse pressure gradient region that results in a largely homogeneous breakdown to turbulence across the span. The effect of high-frequency free stream disturbances on the streak secondary instability and on the nonlinear processes within the growing turbulent spot are analysed through the inviscid transport of instantaneous vorticity. The results suggest that free stream turbulence contributes to the growth of the turbulent spot by generating large strain rates that activate vortex-stretching and tilting processes within the spot.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYA discrete framework for computing the global stability and sensitivity analysis to external perturbations for any set of partial differential equations is presented. In particular, a complex-step approximation is used to achieve near analytical accuracy for the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix. Sensitivity maps for the sensitivity to base flow modifications and to a steady force are computed to identify regions of the flow field where an input could have a stabilising effect. Four test cases are presented: (1) an analytical test case to prove the theory of the discrete framework, (2) a lid-driven cavity at low Reynolds case to show the improved accuracy in the calculation of the eigenvalues when using the complex-step approximation, (3) the 2D flow past a circular cylinder at just below the critical Reynolds number used to validate the methodology, and finally, (4) the flow past an open cavity presented to give an example of the discrete method applied to a convectively unstable case. The latter three (2\textendash 4) of the aforementioned cases were solved with the 2D compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations using a Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method. Good agreement was obtained for the validation test case, (3), with appropriate results in the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that for the calculation of the direct and adjoint eigenmodes and their sensitivity maps to external perturbations, the use of complex variables is paramount for obtaining an accurate prediction.

  abstract = {The onset of unsteadiness in a boundary-layer flow past a cylindrical roughness element is investigated for three flow configurations at subcritical Reynolds numbers, both experimentally and numerically. On the one hand, a quasi-periodic shedding of hairpin vortices is observed for all configurations in the experiment. On the other hand, global stability analyses have revealed the existence of a varicose isolated mode, as well as of a sinuous one, both being linearly stable. Nonetheless, the isolated stable varicose modes are highly sensitive, as ascertained by pseudospectrum analysis. To investigate how these modes might influence the dynamics of the flow, an optimal forcing analysis is performed. The optimal response consists of a varicose perturbation closely related to the least stable varicose isolated eigenmode and induces dynamics similar to that observed experimentally. The quasi-resonance of such a global mode to external forcing might thus be responsible for the onset of unsteadiness at subcritical Reynolds numbers, hence providing a simple explanation for the experimental observations.},

  abstract = {A nonlinear ensemble-variational (EnVar) data assimilation is performed in order to estimate the unknown flow field over a slender cone at Mach-6, from isolated wall-pressure measurements. The cost functional accounts for discrepancies in wall-pressure spectra and total intensity between the experiment and the prediction using direct numerical simulations (DNS), as well as our relative confidence in the measurements and the estimated state. We demonstrate the robustness of the predicted flow by direct propagation of posterior statistics. The approach provides a unique first look at the flow beyond the sensor data, and rigorously accounts for the role of nonlinearity unlike previous efforts that adopted ad-hoc inflow syntheses. Away from the wall, two- and three-dimensional assimilated states both show rope-like structures, qualitatively similar to independent schlieren visualizations. Despite this resemblance, and even though the planar second modes are the most unstable upstream, three-dimensional (3D) waves must be included in the assimilation in order to accurately reproduce the wall-pressure measurements recorded in the Ludwieg-Tube facility. The results highlight the importance of three-dimensionality of the field and of the base-state distortion on the instability waves in this experiment, and motivate future measurements that probe the 3D nature of the flow field.},

  abstract = {High-speed boundary-layer transition is extremely sensitive to the free-stream disturbances which are often uncertain. This uncertainty compromises predictions of models and simulations. To enhance the fidelity of simulations, we directly infuse them with available observations. Our methodology is general and can be adopted with any simulation tool, and is herein demonstrated using direct numerical simulations. An ensemble variational (EnVar) optimization is performed, whereby we determine the upstream flow that optimally reproduces the observations. The cost functional accounts for our relative confidence in the model and the observations, and judicious choice of the ensemble members improves convergence and reduces the prediction uncertainty. We demonstrate our observation-infused predictions for boundary-layer transition at Mach 4.5. Without prior knowledge of the free-stream condition, and using only observations of wall pressure at isolated locations from an independent computation (true flow), all of the relevant inflow disturbances are identified. We then evaluate the entire flow field, beyond the original limited wall observations, and interpret simulations consistently with data and vice versa. Our predicted flow compares favorably to the true `unknown' state, and discrepancies are analyzed in detail. We also examine the impact of weighting of observations. Improved convergence of the inverse problem and accuracy of the inflow amplitudes and phases are demonstrated, and are explained by aid of a simple example from two-dimensional unstable, chaotic convection.},

  abstract = {Hypersonic vehicles often present curved geometries and rough surfaces, directly affecting the boundary layer topology. An important feature of the boundary layer in such conditions is a system of streaks. These streaks induce a flow distortion and lead to a new set of unstable modes. We study the effect of this boundary layer modification using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a flow at M=6.0 over a flat plate. Optimal disturbances of increasing amplitudes are used to design a set of three stationary base flows containing growing streaks. We then perform DNS and linearised DNS of these base flows subjected to white-noise forcing. The forcing leads to the emergence of an ensemble of modes, which we identify and track with a flow decomposition using SPOD and Floquet theory. The transition scenarios for the streaky flows are studied. Specifically, we observe the early dominance of low-frequency modes in contrast with the Blasius boundary layer and previous PSE studies where the second Mack mode was given as dominant. Finally, for this specific case, we highlight the importance of taking into account broadband forcing to study the streaky baseflows in order to appropriately track the evolution of relevant unstable modes.},

  abstract = {A major goal for reduced-order models of unsteady fluid flows is to uncover and exploit latent low-dimensional structure. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provides an energy-optimal linear basis to represent the flow kinematics, but converges slowly for advection-dominated flows and tends to overestimate the number of dynamically relevant variables. We show that nonlinear correlations in the temporal POD coefficients can be exploited to identify the underlying attractor, characterized by a minimal set of driving modes and a manifold equation for the remaining modes. By viewing these nonlinear correlations as an invariant manifold reduction, this least-order representation can be used to stabilize POD-Galerkin models or as a state space for data-driven model identification. In the latter case, we use sparse polynomial regression to learn a compact, interpretable dynamical system model from the time series of the active modal coefficients. We demonstrate this perspective on a quasiperiodic shear-driven cavity flow and show that the dynamics evolve on a torus generated by two independent Stuart-Landau oscillators. These results emphasize the importance of nonlinear dimensionality reduction to reveal underlying structure in complex flows.},

  abstract = {, In this work, a transition process in a hypersonic flow over a cold-wall compression ramp is studied using direct numerical simulation (DNS) and global stability analysis (GSA). The free-stream Mach number and the Reynolds number based on the flat-plate length are 7.7 and 8.6\texttimes 1058.6\texttimes 1058.6 \textbackslash times 10\^5, respectively. The shock-induced pressure rise causes the boundary layer to separate on the flat plate, forming a separation bubble around the corner. Without introducing any external disturbances, the DNS captures the transition to turbulence downstream of flow reattachment. The DNS results agree well with the experimental data as well as theoretical predictions. To uncover the intrinsic instability in the flow system, GSA is employed to investigate the three-dimensionality of the two-dimensional base flow. Several stationary and oscillatory unstable modes are revealed, which result in spanwise periodicity inside and downstream of the separation bubble. The GSA and DNS results indicate that the intrinsic instability of the flow system triggers the formation of streamwise counter-rotating vortices and boundary-layer streaks near reattachment. The downstream transition to turbulence starts from the breakdown of the streamwise vortices and streaks. Moreover, the second harmonic of the most unstable global mode and a broadband low-frequency unsteadiness occur in the saturated flow, which has a significant influence on the transition process. In summary, the present study demonstrates a transition process in a hypersonic compression-ramp flow as a result of the intrinsic instability of the flow system.},

The DNS results are validated by comparison with experimental data and theoretical predictions. It is shown that even in the absence of external disturbances, streamwise heat flux streaks form on the ramp surface downstream of reattachment, and that they are non-uniformly distributed in the spanwise direction. The surface heat flux exhibits a low-frequency unsteadiness, which propagates in the streamwise direction. Additionally, the unsteadiness of the heat flux streaks downstream of reattachment is coupled with a pulsation of the reattachment position. By conducting a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis, several oscillatory modes, characterised by streamwise low-frequency periodicity, are revealed in the separation bubble flow. The DNS results are further explained by a global stability analysis (GSA). Particularly, the flow structure of the leading DMD modes is consistent with that of the oscillatory unstable modes identified by the GSA. It is therefore concluded that the global instabilities are responsible for the unsteadiness of the considered compression ramp flow.},

Resulting Galerkin systems comprise ordinary differential equations, with a number of degrees of freedom ranging from 144 to 600, which may be integrated to large times without sign of numerical instability. The reduced-order models so obtained are also found to match statistics of direct numerical simulations at Reynolds number 500 and 1200 with reasonable accuracy, despite a truncation of orders of magnitude in the degrees of freedom of the system. The present models offer thus an interesting compromise between simplicity and accuracy in a canonical wall-bounded flow, with relatively few modes representing coherent structures in the flow and their dominant dynamics.},

  abstract = {The present work studies the non-linear dynamics of a shear layer, driven by a body force and confined between parallel walls, a simplified setting to study transitional and turbulent shear layers. It was introduced by Nogueira \textbackslash\& Cavalieri (J. Fluid Mech. 907, A32, 2021), and is here studied using a reduced-order model based on a Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes system. By considering a confined shear layer with free-slip boundary conditions on the walls, periodic boundary conditions in streamwise and spanwise directions may be used, simplifying the system and enabling the use of methods of dynamical systems theory. A basis of eight modes is used in the Galerkin projection, representing the mean flow, Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, rolls, streaks and oblique waves, structures observed in the cited work, and also present in shear layers and jets. A dynamical system is obtained, and its transition to chaos is studied. Increasing Reynolds number \$Re\$ leads to pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations, and the latter leads to a limit cycle with amplitude modulation of vortices, as in the DNS by Nogueira \textbackslash\& Cavalieri. Further increase of \$Re\$ leads to the appearance of a chaotic saddle, followed by the emergence of quasi-periodic and chaotic attractors. The chaotic attractors suffer a merging crisis for higher \$Re\$, leading to chaotic dynamics with amplitude modulation and phase jumps of vortices. This is reminiscent of observations of coherent structures in turbulent jets, suggesting that the model represents dynamics consistent with features of shear layers and jets.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) are carried out to investigate the shock induced transient flow through a planar nozzle mimicking a shock tube experimental setup at shock Mach number Ms = 1.86. A fifthorder Weighted Essentially Non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme based 3D numerical flow solver equipped with an immersed boundary method and Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity (WALE) model is used for this purpose. A comparative study is presented to show the effect of different flow initializations namely, i) without flow fluctuation, ii) with white random noise and iii) with homogeneous isotropic turbulence superimposed on the flow-field. Results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured speeds of the primary shock wave and the following secondary shock wave. It is found that an improper initialization of the flow-field may lead to erroneous predictions of the flow characteristics, particularly the location of the separation point and the unsteady shock/boundary layer interaction. Substantial improvement in the prediction of the early-stage Mach reflection, complex shock/boundary layer interaction is observed with superimposed turbulent fluctuations as an initial flow-field. This is when a homogeneous incompressible isotropic turbulence superimposed on the shocked section is assigned as initial fluctuating field. An additional test case with the latter method, having an approximately four times higher mesh resolution, is used for detailed investigation of the unsteady flow fields, turbulent statistics and boundary layer separation. Results show considerable improvements in the prediction of the secondary shock and the flow separation location compared to the previous findings which dealt with lower mesh resolution. The turbulent flow structures are depicted using the mean flow-field which is spatially averaged over the span-wise homogeneous direction. Time-averaging on the fly turns out to be inadequate, since it leads to a spatial shift of the separation bubble. The reason for this is the use of past flow information only, due to the lack of future information. This in-turn invokes the need of phase-averaging to extract suitable physically statistics of the turbulent flow-field for further deeper analysis.},

The model geometry is the same as the Hypersonic Transition Research Vehicle designed by the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center. Four distinct transitional regions are identified, i.e. windward vortex region, shoulder vortex region, windward cross-flow region and shoulder cross-flow region. Multi-dimensional linear stability analyses by solving the two-dimensional eigenvalue problem (spatial BiGlobal approach) and the plane-marching parabolized stability equations (PSE3D approach) are further carried out to uncover the dominant instabilities in the last three regions as well as the shoulder attachment-line region. The shoulder vortex is conducive to both inner and outer modes of shear-layer instability, of which the latter most likely trigger the vortex breakdown. A novel method is presented to substantially reduce the computational cost of BiGlobal and PSE3D in resolving the cross-flow instabilities in cross-flow regions. The peak frequencies of cross-flow modes lie between 15 and 45 kHz. Whereas oblique second Mack modes are marginally unstable in the windward cross-flow region, they could be strong enough to compete with the cross-flow modes in the shoulder cross-flow region. In the shoulder attachment-line region, there exists only one unstable mode of Mack instability, differing from previous studies that show a hierarchy of modes in the context of symmetrical attachment-line flows. Results of the numerical simulation and multi-dimensional stability analyses are compared when possible, showing a fair agreement between the two approaches and highlighting the necessity of considering non-parallel effects.},

The transonic flow is governed by the inviscid potential flow equation with supersonic upstream flow at the entrance, uniform subsonic downstream flow at the exit at infinity, and the slip boundary condition on the nozzle boundary. Our results indicate that, if the supersonic upstream flow at the entrance is sufficiently close to a uniform flow, there exists a solution that consists of a C1,{$\alpha$} subsonic flow in the unbounded downstream region, converging to a uniform velocity state at infinity, and a C1,{$\alpha$} multidimensional transonic shock dividing the subsonic flow from the supersonic upstream flow; the uniform velocity state at the exit at infinity in the downstream direction is uniquely determined by the supersonic upstream flow; and the shock is orthogonal to the nozzle boundary at every point of their intersection. In order to construct such a transonic flow, we reformulate the multidimensional transonic nozzle problem into a free boundary problem for the subsonic phase, in which the equation is elliptic and the free boundary is a transonic shock. The free boundary conditions are determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions along the shock. We further develop a nonlinear iteration approach and employ its advantages to deal with such a free boundary problem in the unbounded domain. We also prove that the transonic flow with a transonic shock is unique and stable with respect to the nozzle boundary and the smooth supersonic upstream flow at the entrance.},

Various approaches, including theoretical, numerical, experimental and flight test, are combined to obtain a complete perspective of the transition process as well as some fundamental issues for this kind of flow. The interaction between freestream disturbances and the front shock wave is analysed theoretically, and multiple receptivity routes are unveiled using a sub-zone analysis technique. The entire transition process is captured using high-resolution nano-tracer-based planar laser scattering technique in a quiet windtunnel as well as large-scale high-fidelity direct numerical simulations. Using dynamic mode decomposition, the relationship between the second Mach mode and the low-frequency mode in the late stage of the transition is revealed. The ``transition reversal'' phenomenon is recovered in two of our conventional windtunnels. The numerical results show that leading-edge receptivity varies significantly for different cone bluntness, which might be responsible for the ``transition reversal'' phenomenon. For the cone at angles of attack, new instabilities including the leeward centerline vortex instability and the crossflow instability, occur and can significantly promote the transition process. A newly developed C-{$\gamma$}-Re\texttheta{} transition model can give a good transition front prediction compared to the experimental data. The flight test for a cone model conducted within this project is reviewed, and the correlation between the ground experimental data and the flight data is established.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a scenario of transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a spatially developing boundary layer over a flat plate. The base flow is the Blasius non-parallel flow solution; it is perturbed by optimal disturbances yielding the largest energy growth over a short time interval. Such perturbations are computed by a nonlinear global optimization approach based on a Lagrange multiplier technique. The results show that nonlinear optimal perturbations are characterized by a localized basic building block, called the minimal seed, defined as the smallest flow structure which maximizes the energy growth over short times. It is formed by vortices inclined in the streamwise direction surrounding a region of intense streamwise disturbance velocity. Such a basic structure appears to be a robust feature of the base flow since it is practically invariant with respect to the initial energy of the perturbation, the target time, the Reynolds number and the dimensions of the computational domain. The minimal seed grows very rapidly in time while spreading, and it triggers nonlinear effects which bring the flow to turbulence in a very efficient manner, through the formation of a turbulence spot. This evolution of the initial optimal disturbance has been studied in detail by direct numerical simulations. Using a perturbative formulation of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, each linear and nonlinear convective term of the equations has been analysed. The results show the fundamental role of the streamwise inclination of the vortices in the process. The nonlinear coupling of the finite amplitude disturbances is crucial to sustain such streamwise inclination, as well as to generate dislocations within the flow structures, and local inflectional velocity distributions. The analysis provides a picture of the transition process characterized by a sequence of structures appearing successively in the flow, namely, vortices, hairpin vortices and streamwise streaks. Finally, a disturbance regeneration cycle is conceived, initiated by the fast nonlinear amplification of the minimal seed, providing a possible scenario for the continuous regeneration of the same fundamental flow structures at smaller space and time scales.},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} The objective of this review is to critically assess the different approaches developed in recent years to understand the dynamics of open flows such as mixing layers, jets, wakes, separation bubbles, boundary layers, and so on. These complex flows develop in extended domains in which fluid particles are continuously advected downstream. They behave either as noise amplifiers or as oscillators, both of which exhibit strong nonlinearities ( Huerre \& Monkewitz 1990 ). The local approach is inherently weakly nonparallel and it assumes that the basic flow varies on a long length scale compared to the wavelength of the instability waves. The dynamics of the flow is then considered as a superposition of linear or nonlinear instability waves that, at leading order, behave at each streamwise station as if the flow were homogeneous in the streamwise direction. In the fully global context, the basic flow and the instabilities do not have to be characterized by widely separated length scales, and the dynamics is then viewed as the result of the interactions between Global modes living in the entire physical domain with the streamwise direction as an eigendirection. This second approach is more and more resorted to as a result of increased computational capability. The earlier review of Huerre \& Monkewitz (1990) emphasized how local linear theory can account for the noise amplifier behavior as well as for the onset of a Global mode. The present survey first adopts the opposite point of view by demonstrating how fully global theory accounts for the noise amplifier behavior of open flows. From such a perspective, there is strong emphasis on the very peculiar nonorthogonality of linear Global modes, which in turn allows a novel interpretation of recent numerical simulations and experimental observations. The nonorthogonality of linear Global modes also imposes severe constraints on the extension of linear global theory to the fully nonlinear r\'egime. When the flow is weakly nonparallel, this limitation is so severe that the linear Global mode theory is of little help. It is then much more appropriate to develop a fully nonlinear formulation involving the presence of a front separating the base state region from the bifurcated state region.},

  abstract = {Infrared thermography has been successfully adopted in the field of flow diagnostics over the last decades. Detecting the laminar\textendash turbulent boundary layer transition through variations in the convective heat transfer is one of the primary applications due to its impact on the aerodynamic performance. Recent developments in fast\textendash response infrared cameras allow unsteady measurement of fast\textendash moving surfaces and moving transition positions, which must consider the thermal responsiveness of the surface material. Experimental results on moving boundary layer transition positions are highly valuable in the design and optimization of airfoils or rotor blades in unsteady applications, for example regarding helicopter main rotors in forward flight. This review article summarizes recent developments in steady and unsteady infrared thermography, particularly focusing on the development of differential infrared thermography (DIT). The new methods have also led to advances in the analysis of unmoving boundary layer transition for static airfoil test cases which were previously difficult to analyze using single\textendash image methods.},

For small disturbances a quantity satisfying these requirements is found. When viscosity and heat conductivity are neglected, it reduces to the familiar acoustic energy in the theory of sound. Stability in the mean of such a fluid system can thus be discussed with reference to the growth and decay of the energy in the disturbance.}

The numerical  solutions are used to evaluate the accuracy of theoretical receptivity  predictions which  are based on the parallel-flow approximation. By reformulating the receptivity  theory  to include the effect of surface curvature, it is shown that convex surface  curvature  enhances receptivity. Comparisons of the parallel-flow predictions with  Navier\textendash Stokes  solutions demonstrate that non-parallel effects strongly reduce the initial  amplitude of  stationary cross flow vortices. The curvature and non-parallel effects  tend to counteract  one another; but, for the cases considered here, the non-parallel effect  dominates  leading to significant over-prediction of receptivity by parallel-flow  receptivity theory.  We conclude from these results that receptivity theories must account for  non-parallel  effects in order to accurately predict the amplitude of stationary crossflow  instability  waves near the leading edge of a swept wing.},

We develop a new shock-kinematic boundary condition which is compatible with both the finite-volume method and input\textendash output analysis. This boundary condition enables analysis of the receptivity of blunt cones to disturbances in the free stream by careful treatment of linear interactions of small disturbances with the shock. In particular, a Mach 5.8 flow over a 7{$\smwhtcircle$} half-angle cone with a 0.15" nose radius is analyzed, showing significant amplification of disturbances along the cone frustum in a 5\textendash 15 kHz bandwidth due to the destabilization of a slow acoustic boundary layer mode, and significant amplification of entropy layer instabilities between 100 and 180 kHz due to rotation/deceleration of entropy/vorticity waves. These mechanisms are receptive to free-stream disturbances in very localized positions upstream of the bow shock.},

  abstract = {A systematic analysis of the discrete conservation properties of non-dissipative, centraldifference approximations of the compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations is reported. A generalized splitting of the nonlinear convective terms is considered, and energypreserving formulations are fully characterized by deriving a two-parameter family of split forms. Previously developed formulations reported in literature are shown to be particular members of this family; novel splittings are introduced and discussed as well. Furthermore, the conservation properties yielded by different choices for the energy equation (i.e. total and internal energy, entropy) are analyzed thoroughly. It is shown that additional preserved quantities can be obtained through a suitable adaptive selection of the split form within the derived family. Local conservation of primary invariants, which is a fundamental property to build high-fidelity shock-capturing methods, is also discussed in the paper. Numerical tests performed for the Taylor\textendash Green Vortex at zero viscosity fully confirm the theoretical findings, and show that a careful choice of both the splitting and the energy formulation can provide remarkably robust and accurate results.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of skin-friction field measurements using the global luminescent oil-film skin-friction field estimation method was evaluated for a challenging case of a supercritical airfoil model under transonic wind-tunnel conditions (freestream Mach number of 0.72) at a high Reynolds number (10 million, based on the model chord length). The oil-film thickness and skin-friction coefficient distributions were estimated over the airfoil model upper surface for a range of angles of attack (from -0.4{$\smwhtcircle$} to 2.0{$\smwhtcircle\mkern1mu$}), thus enabling the study of different boundary-layer stability situations with laminar\textendash turbulent transition, including cases with shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction. Conventional pressure measurements on the surface and in the wake of the model as well as Schlieren flow visualizations were conducted to support the oil-film based investigations. In the laminar-flow regions, the oil-film thickness could be generally kept below the critical limit of roughness that would induce premature boundary-layer transition. The skin friction in this region could be estimated with a moderate confidence level, as confirmed for portions of the chord by the reasonable agreement with numerical data obtained via laminar boundary-layer computations. Moreover, the location of transition onset was evaluated from the skin-friction estimations with relatively low uncertainty, thus enabling the examination of the transition location evolution with varying angle of attack. The estimated locations of transition onset were shown to be in general agreement with reference transition locations measured via temperature-sensitive paint. On the other hand, the oil-film thickness in the turbulent-flow regions was larger than the height of the viscous sublayer, which led to an hydraulically rough surface with increased skin friction, as compared to the clean configuration. For this reason, quantitative skin-friction estimations were not feasible in the turbulent-flow regions. The global effects of the oil-film setup on the flow around the airfoil were evaluated from the estimations of the aerodynamic coefficients. In particular, it was shown that the presence of the specific base coat used for the application of the oil film already induced a significant increase in airfoil drag, as compared to the clean configuration, whereas a thin oil film led to negligible or small additional increases in drag. Based on the present observations, considerations for the further improvement of the global luminescent oil-film skin-friction field estimation method in transonic flow experiments at high Reynolds numbers are elucidated.},

The behaviour of all three modes is largely consistent with their low-speed counterparts prior to saturation of the stationary wave. Afterward, the behaviour remains in partial agreement with the low-speed case. Neither type-II secondary instability nor transition to turbulence are observed in this study.},

The triads considered are those comprising a two-dimensional wave and two oblique waves propagating at equal and opposite angles to the flow direction and such that all three waves have the same phase velocity in the downstream direction. For such a resonant triad remarkably powerful wave interations take place, which may cause a continuous and rapid transfer of energy from the primary shear flow to the disturbance. It appears that the oblique waves can grow particularly rapidly and it is suggested that such preferential growth may be responsible for the rapid development of three-dimensionality in unstable boundary layers. The non-linear energy transfer primarily takes place in the vicinity of the critical layer where the downstream propagation velocity of the waves equals the velocity of the primary flow.             The theoretical analysis is initially carried out for a general primary velocity profile; then, in order to demonstrate the essential features of the results, precise interaction equations are derived for a particular profile consisting of a layer of constant shear bounded by a uniform flow. Some exact solutions of the general interaction equations are presented, one of which has the property that the wave amplitudes become indefinitely large at a finite time. The possible relevance of the present theoretical model to the experiments of Klebanoff, Tidstrom \& Sargent (1962) is examined.},

Tenaud, Comput. Fluids 30 (2001) 89] where third-order schemes were considered, we follow the Lax\textendash Wendroff approach to develop high order TVD combined time\textendash space schemes by correcting the successive modified equations. In the scalar case, TVD schemes accurate up to seventh order (OSTVD7) in time and space are obtained (in smooth regions and away from extrema). To avoid the clipping and the loss of accuracy that is common to the TVD schemes near extrema, we develop monotonicitypreserving (MP) conditions derived from Suresh and Huynh [A. Suresh, H.T. Huynh, J. Comput. Phys. 136 (1997) 83] to locally relax the TVD limitation for this family of one-step schemes. Numerical results for long time integration in the scalar case show that the MP one-step approach gives the best results compared to several multistage schemes, including WENO schemes. The extension to systems and to the multidimensional case is done in a simplified way which does not preserve the scalar order of accuracy. However we show that the resulting schemes have a very low level of error. For validation, the present algorithm has been checked on several classical one-dimensional and multidimensional test cases, including both viscous and inviscid flows: a moving shock wave interacting with a sine wave, the Lax shock tube problem, the 2D inviscid double Mach reflection and the 2D viscous shock wave\textendash vortex interaction. By computing these various test cases, we demonstrate that very accurate results can be obtained by using the one-step MP approach which is very competitive compared to multistage high order schemes.},

  abstract = {This work has developed an extension of an existing immersed-boundary (IB) method to compressible, turbulent flows and has investigated its use in simulating the effects of different types of flow control devices: micro vortex generators, bleed-hole arrays, aeroelastically-deforming mesoflaps, and boundary layer trips. The IB method has been used with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (Menter SST) and hybrid large-eddy simulation / Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (LES/RANS) turbulence closures. The method has been applied to oblique shock / turbulent boundary layer interactions with and without micro vortex-generator flow control (Cambridge University experiments), bleed flow control (NASA Glenn experiments), and aeroelastically-deforming mesoflap flow control (University of Illinois experiments). The results show that the IB approach can simulate the general effects of the control devices to a high degree of precision without requiring excessively fine meshes near the control element. The LES/RANS method is capable of accurately predicting mean-flow and second-moment statistics and can be used to provide insights into the effects of the control device in modulating the turbulent flow response.},

  abstract = {The metrics and Jacobian in the fluid motion governing equations under curvilinear coordinate system have a variety of equivalent differential forms, which may have different discretization errors with the same difference scheme. The discretization errors of metrics and Jacobian may cause serious computational instability and inaccuracy in numerical results, especially for high-order finite difference schemes. It has been demonstrated by many researchers that the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) is very important for high-order Finite Difference Methods (FDMs), and a proper form of metrics and Jacobian, which can satisfy the GCL, can considerably reduce discretization errors and computational instability. In order to satisfy the GCL for FDM, we have previously developed a Conservative Metric Method (CMM) to calculate the metrics [1] and the difference scheme d3 in the CMM is determined with the suggestion d3 {$\frac{1}{4}$} d2. In this paper, a Symmetrical Conservative Metric Method (SCMM) is newly proposed based on the discussions of the metrics and Jacobian in FDM from geometry viewpoint by following the concept of vectorized surface and cell volume in Finite Volume Methods (FVMs). Interestingly, the expressions of metrics and Jacobian obtained by using the SCMM with second-order central finite difference scheme are equivalent to the vectorized surfaces and cell volumes, respectively. The main advantage of SCMM is that it makes the calculations based on high-order WCNS schemes aroud complex geometry flows possible and somewhat easy. Numerical tests on linear and nonlinear problems indicate that the quality of numerical results may be largely enhanced by utilizing the SCMM, and the advantage of the SCMM over other forms of metrics and Jacobian may be more evident on highly nonuniform grids.},

  abstract = {The geometric conservation law (GCL) includes the volume conservation law (VCL) and the surface conservation law (SCL). Though the VCL is widely discussed for time-depending grids, in the cases of stationary grids the SCL also works as a very important role for high-order accurate numerical simulations. The SCL is usually not satisfied on discretized grid meshes because of discretization errors, and the violation of the SCL can lead to numerical instabilities especially when high-order schemes are applied. In order to fulfill the SCL in high-order finite difference schemes, a conservative metric method (CMM) is presented. This method is achieved by computing grid metric derivatives through a conservative form with the same scheme applied for fluxes. The CMM is proven to be a sufficient condition for the SCL, and can ensure the SCL for interior schemes as well as boundary and near boundary schemes. Though the first-level difference operators d3 have no effects on the SCL, no extra errors can be introduced as d3 = d2. The generally used high-order finite difference schemes are categorized as central schemes (CS) and upwind schemes (UPW) based on the difference operator d1 which are used to solve the governing equations. The CMM can be applied to CS and is difficult to be satisfied by UPW. Thus, it is critical to select the difference operator d1 to reduce the SCL-related errors. Numerical tests based on WCNS-E-5 show that the SCL plays a very important role in ensuring free-stream conservation, suppressing numerical oscillations, and enhancing the robustness of the high-order scheme in complex grids.},

Despite the rapid development of high-order algorithms in CFD, the applications of high-order and high accurate methods on complex configurations are still limited. One of the main reasons which hinder the widely applications of these methods is the complexity of grids. Many aspects which can be neglected for low-order schemes must be treated carefully for high-order ones when the configurations are complex. In order to implement highorder finite difference schemes on complex multi-block grids, the geometric conservation law and block-interface conditions are discussed. A conservative metric method is applied to calculate the grid derivatives, and a characteristic-based interface condition is employed to fulfil high-order multi-block computing. The fifth-order WCNS-E-5 proposed by Deng [9, 10] is applied to simulate flows with complex grids, including a double-delta wing, a transonic airplane configuration, and a hypersonic X-38 configuration. The results in this paper and the references show pleasant prospects in engineering-oriented applications of high-order schemes.},

  abstract = {The excitation of instability modes in the wake generated behind a discrete roughness element in a boundary layer at Mach 6 is analysed through numerical simulations of the compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations. Recent experimental observations show that transition to turbulence in high-speed boundary layers during re-entry flight is dominated by wall roughness effects. Therefore, understanding the roughness-induced transition to turbulence in this flow regime is of primary importance. Our results show that a discrete roughness element with a height of about half the local boundary-layer thickness generates an unstable wake able to sustain the growth of a number of modes. The most unstable of these modes are a sinuous mode (mode SL) and two varicose modes (modes VL and VC). The varicose modes grow approximately 17 \% faster than the most unstable Mack mode and their growth persists over a longer streamwise distance, thereby leading to a notable acceleration of the laminar\textendash turbulent transition process. Two main mechanisms are identified for the excitation of wake modes: the first is based on the interaction between the external disturbances and the reverse flow regions induced by the roughness element and the second is due to the interaction between the boundary-layer modes (first modes and Mack modes) and the non-parallel roughness wake. An important finding of the present study is that, while being less unstable, mode SL is the preferred instability for the first of the above excitation mechanisms, which drives the wake modes excitation in the absence of boundary-layer modes. Modes VL and VC are excited through the second mechanism and, hence, become important when first modes and Mack modes come into interaction with the roughness wake. The new mode VC presents similarities with the Mack mode instability, including the tuning between its most unstable wavelength and the local boundary-layer thickness, and it is believed to play a fundamental role in the roughness-induced transition of high-speed boundary layers. In contrast to the smooth-wall case, wall cooling is stabilising for all the roughness-wake modes.},

  abstract = {The linear instability and breakdown to turbulence induced by an isolated roughness element in a boundary layer at Mach 2.5, over an isothermal flat plate with laminar adiabatic wall temperature, have been analysed by means of direct numerical simulations, aided by spatial BiGlobal and three-dimensional parabolized (PSE-3D) stability analyses. It is important to understand transition in this flow regime since the process can be slower than in incompressible flow and is crucial to prediction of local heat loads on next-generation flight vehicles. The results show that the roughness element, with a height of the order of the boundary layer displacement thickness, generates a highly unstable wake, which is composed of a low-velocity streak surrounded by a three-dimensional high-shear layer and is able to sustain the rapid growth of a number of instability modes. The most unstable of these modes are associated with varicose or sinuous deformations of the low-velocity streak; they are a consequence of the instability developing in the three-dimensional shear layer as a whole (the varicose mode) or in the lateral shear layers (the sinuous mode). The most unstable wake mode is of the varicose type and grows on average {$\sim$}17 \% faster than the most unstable sinuous mode and {$\sim$}30 times faster than the most unstable boundary layer mode occurring in the absence of a roughness element. Due to the high growthrates registered in the presence of the roughness element, an amplification factor of N = 9 is reached within {$\sim$}50 roughness heights from the roughness trailing edge. The independently performed Navier\textendash Stokes, spatial BiGlobal and PSE-3D stability results are in excellent agreement with each other, validating the use of simplified theories for roughness-induced transition involving wake instabilities. Following the linear stages of the laminar\textendash turbulent transition process, the roll-up of the three-dimensional shear layer leads to the formation of a wedge of turbulence, which spreads laterally at a rate similar to that observed in the case of compressible turbulent spots for the same Mach number.},

  abstract = {A deeper understanding of the different factors that influence the laminar-turbulent transition in supersonic boundary layers will help the design of efficient high-speed vehicles. In this work we study the effects of surface roughness on the stability and transition to turbulence of supersonic boundary layers. The investigation is carried out by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and focuses on the modifications introduced in the transition process by localised roughness elements, for Mach numbers M? = 6.0 and M? = 2.5, and distributed slender pores at M? = 6.0. The first part of the investigation into the effects of localised roughness deals with the receptivity and initial exponential amplification of disturbances in boundary layers subjected to small external perturbations. Different transition scenarios are investigated by considering different free-stream disturbances and roughness elements with different heights. The results show that, for roughness heights approaching the local displacement thickness, transition is dominated by the growth of a number of instability modes in the roughness wake. These modes are damped by wall cooling and their receptivity is found to be more efficient in the case of free-stream disturbances dominated by sound. At M? = 6 the growth of Mack modes in the boundary layer is found to play a crucial role in the excitation of the most unstable wake modes. An investigation into the nonlinear stages of transition shows that the breakdown to turbulence starts with nonlinear interactions of the wake instability modes. This leads to the formation of a turbulent wedge behind the roughness element, which spreads laterally following mechanisms similar to those observed for the evolution of compressible turbulent spots. An oblique shock impinging on the transitional boundary layer significantly accelerates the breakdown process and leads to a wider turbulent wedge. The study ends with an analysis of porous walls as a passive method for transition control, which is carried out using a temporal DNS approach. The results show damping of both the primary, of second or Mack mode type, and secondary instabilities and indicate that, despite the high Mack number, first mode waves regain importance in this modified transition scenario.},

Two main unstable modes are found in the roughness wake, corresponding to the symmetric and antisymmetric modes already known for single roughness elements. Second, the case of a patch of (pseudo-)randomly distributed roughness is presented. A new type of roughness-induced cross-flow-like instability is observed for the blunt-capsule configuration. The rapid growth of primary and secondary instabilities in the cross-flow-type vortex is analysed and quantified in both the linear and nonlinear stages up to the laminar\textendash turbulent breakdown.

  abstract = {The aim of the present work is to investigate the spectral structure of a rapidly distorted boundary layer that develops on a flat plate in presence of a localised patch of roughness or/and grid-generated freestream turbulence. We observe that, at a certain distance downstream of the roughness patch the boundary layer exhibits a bimodal shape in the energy spectrum of the streamwise velocity fluctuations, similar to that found in a fully-turbulent boundary layer at relatively high Reynolds numbers. The physical mechanism that gives rise to the low-wavenumber peak in the spectrum, which represents long streamwise motions or ``superstructures'', is identified to be the interaction of the broadband disturbances with the region of high shear near the wall in the boundary layer. We next show that the flat-plate boundary layer combined with surface roughness and grid turbulence can serve as building-block elements towards synthesising the wall-normal structure of a canonical turbulent boundary layer, in the context of large-scale streamwise motions. The rapidly distorted (or ``synthetic'') boundary layer presents a simpler environment in which the coherent motions can evolve and therefore can enable a better characterisation of these motions. To further illustrate the utility of the present approach we compare results from our measurements with the predictions of the Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT). We show that the streamwise turbulence energy in the near-wall region of the rapidly distorted boundary layer grows linearly with time consistent with the RDT results on the effect of pure shear on an initially isotropic turbulence. Moreover close to the edge of the boundary layer the large-scale fluctuations experience an enhancement in the streamwise turbulence energy in accordance with the linear blocking model in the RDT framework. The present work thus highlights the importance of linear processes in wall turbulence and can help us identify aspects of it to which the linear theories can be meaningfully applied.},

The generation of the near-wall unstable structure is the key point of boundary layer transition behind the roughness element. At the downstream of the roughness element, the interaction between horseshoe vortices and hairpin vortices will spread in the spanwise direction. For double roughness elements, the effect of the spacing between roughness elements on the transition is studied. It is found that the case of higher spacing between roughness elements is more effective for inducing transition than the lower one. The interaction between two adjacent roughness elements can suppress the evolution of horseshoe vortices in the downstream and trigger the instability of shear layer. Thus, the transition will be suppressed accordingly.},

Other data show that the effects of roughness are similar in streams of different initial turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition Reynolds Number of the rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape of roughness element when transition occurs downstream from the roughness element. At a certain value of the height-thickness ratio dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and air-stream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased.},

  abstract = {Laminar-turbulent transition of hypersonic boundary layers can be affected significantly by the existence of surface roughness. Currently many important mechanisms of roughnessinduced transition are not well understood. In recent years, direct numerical simulation (DNS) has been extensively applied for investigating instability and transition mechanisms of hypersonic boundary layers. Most of the past DNS studies, however, have been based on body-fitted grids for smooth surfaces without roughness. Due to complex geometry of embedded roughness, the use of body-fitted grids can be very difficult for flow with arbitrary surface roughness. In this paper, we present a new high-order cut-cell method to overcome the natural complexities in grid generation around arbitrary surface of roughness. The new method combines a non-uniform-grid finite-difference method for discrete grid points near the solid boundary and a shock-fitting method for the treatment of the bow shock. The non-uniform-grid finite-difference formulas are expressed in a general explicit form so that they can be applied to different multi-dimensional problems without any modification. The computational accuracy of new algorithms of up to O(h4) are tested on several one- and two-dimensional elliptic equations in irregular domains. In addition, the new method is applied to the simulation of the receptivity process of a Mach 5.92 flow over a flat plate under the combined effect of an isolated surface roughness element and surface blow and suction. A good agreement is found between the unsteady flow results and those obtained by a Linear Stability Theory (LST).},

It has been largely evidenced in the literature that the linear response of non-normal systems (e.g. fluid flows) may exhibit a large variance amplification, even in a linearly stable regime. This linear response, however, is relevant only in the limit of vanishing forcing intensity. As the intensity increases, the frequency distribution and the variance of the response may be strongly modified due to nonlinear effects. To go beyond this limitation, we propose a theoretical approach to derive an amplitude equation governing the weakly nonlinear evolution of these systems. This approach does not rely on the presence of an eigenvalue close to the neutral axis, applying instead to any sufficiently non-normal operator, and the Fourier components of the response are allowed to be arbitrarily different from any eigenmode. The methodology is outlined for a generic nonlinear dynamical system, and the application case highlights a common non-normal mechanism in hydrodynamics: convective non-normal amplification in the flow past a backward-facing step.},

The focus is on transition in a natural, perturbed environment. Then orderly transition occurs through vortices, that develop locally on instability waves. The precursors to bypass transition are boundary layer `streaks'. Transition proceeds through inner and outer mode secondary instability, leading to patches of turbulence: in zero pressure gradient, bypass transition develops through local, undulatory, outer mode breakdown; in sufficiently adverse pressure gradient, bypass transition proceeds through inner mode instability, which may be of varicose or of helical form. Phenomenology of the creation, growth and breakdown of streaks is surveyed. Theories of shear sheltering, transient and optimal growth, and Orr-Sommerfeld continuous mode resonance are summarized. Recent developments in predictive modeling are summarized. These include laminar fluctuation, and intermittency models. Some open questions are discussed, as are needs for further research.},

Our global input-output approach generalizes the hydrodynamic stability analysis by accounting for energy amplification due to time-periodic inputs as well as initial conditions over a finite-time horizon. Our analysis of hypersonic flows over curved geometries demonstrates how the dominant response's spatial structure can be used to investigate the physical mechanisms for perturbation growth in realistic flow configurations. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we utilize it to investigate the origin of three-dimensional streaks observed in various experiments of two-dimensional laminar shock-wave boundary layer interaction. These streaks are associated with heat flux striations at the wall near flow reattachment, and they can trigger transition to turbulence. The streak wavelength predicted by our analysis compares favorably with observations from multiple hypersonic shock-wave boundary layer interaction experiments. Further investigations into the dominant structures obtained from this analysis, both with and without external disturbances, demonstrate that physical effects unique to compressible separated flows result in the emergence of experimental three-dimensionality.},

  abstract = {In recent years numerical methods have been widely used to effectively resolve complex flow features of aerodynamics flows with meshes that are reasonable for today's computers. High-order numerical methods were used mainly in direct numerical simulations and aeroacoustics. For many aeronautical applications, accurate computation of vortexdominated flows is important because the vorticity in the flow field and the wake of swept wings at an incidence and rotor blades largely determines the distribution of loading. The main deficiency of widely available, second-order accurate methods for the accurate computation of these flows is the numerical diffusion of vorticity to unacceptable levels. Application of high-order accurate, low-diffusion numerical methods can significantly alleviate this deficiency of traditional second order methods. Furthermore, higher-order space discretizations have the potential to improve detached eddy simulation predictions of separated flows with significant unsteadiness. Recently developed high-order accurate finite-difference, finite-volume, and finite-element methods are reviewed. These methods can be used as an attractive alternative of traditional low-order central and upwind computational fluid dynamics methods for improved predictions of vortical and other complex, separated, unsteady flows. The main features of these methods are summarized, from a practical user's point of view, their applicability and relative strength is indicated, and examples from recent applications are presented to illustrate their performance on selected problems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of the interaction of turbulent spots with an initially laminar separation, using schlieren visualisation and dynamic measurements of surface heat transfer and pressure. The separation is generated on a blunt cylinder-flare body, tested at Mach 9, and entropy layer effects result in a boundary layer edge Mach number of 3.43 at separation. A single roughness element is used to produce isolated spots, defined such that separation collapse and re-establishment is completed before arrival of the next spot. On average the spot axial length, at the start of the interaction, is 2.5 times the separation length, growing to 6.8 times as the spot base passes the original reattachment position. As such the spot comprises a large perturbation. The local separation responds almost immediately with passage of the spot, so that the downstream region may be unaffected while the upstream part has already collapsed. Re-establishment of separation is slow, taking up to four times the total transit time of the spot. A basic model is presented to explore the transient wave processes during spot passage.},

  abstract = {The initial phase of hypersonic boundary-layer transition comprising excitation of boundarylayer modes and their downstream evolution from receptivity regions to the unstable region (instability prehistory problem) is considered. The disturbance spectrum reveals the following features: (1) the first and second modes are synchronized with acoustic waves near the leading edge; (2) further downstream, the first mode is synchronized with entropy and vorticity waves; (3) near the lower neutral branch of the Mack second mode, the first mode is synchronized with the second mode. Disturbance behavior in Regions (2) and (3) is studied using the multiple-mode method accounting for interaction between modes due to mean-flow nonparallel effects. Analysis of the disturbance behavior in Region (3) provides the intermodal exchange rule coupling input and output amplitudes of the first and second modes. It is shown that Region (3) includes branch points at which disturbance group velocity and amplitude are singular. These singularities can cause difficulties in stability analyses. In Region (2), vorticity/entropy waves are partially swallowed by the boundary layer. They may effectively generate the Mack second mode near its lower neutral branch.},

  abstract = {We present a shock capturing method for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows. The proposed method relies on physical mechanisms to resolve and smooth sharp unresolved flow features that may otherwise lead to numerical instability, such as shock waves and under-resolved thermal and shear layers. To that end, we devise various sensors to detect when and where the shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid do not suffice to stabilize the numerical solution. In such cases, the fluid viscosities are selectively increased to ensure the cell P\'eclet number is of order 1 so that these flow features can be well represented with the grid resolution. Although the shock capturing method is devised in the context of discontinuous Galerkin methods, it can be used with other discretization schemes. The performance of the method is illustrated through numerical simulation of external and internal flows in transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic regimes. For the problems considered, the shock capturing method performs robustly, provides sharp shock profiles, and has a small impact on the resolved turbulent structures. These three features are critical to enable robust and accurate large-eddy simulations of shock flows.},

As shown in detail by different authors, such schemes tremendously decrease adverse effects of numerical dissipation. However, such schemes are prone to numerically induced symmetry breaking which renders validation for the targeted problem range problematic.},

  abstract = {The direct and adjoint operators play an undeniably important role in a vast number of theoretical and practical studies that range from linear stability to flow control and nonlinear optimization. Based on an existing nonlinear flow solver, the design of efficient and straightforward procedures to access these operators is thus highly desirable. In the case of compressible solvers, the use of high-order numerical schemes combined with complicated governing equations makes the derivation of efficient procedures a challenging and often tedious undertaking. In this work, a novel technique for the evaluation of the direct and adjoint operators directly from compressible flow solvers is presented and extended to include nonlinear differentiation schemes and turbulence models. The application to the incompressible counterpart is also discussed. The presented method requires minimal additional programming effort and automatically takes into account subsequent modifications in the governing equations and boundary conditions. The introduced methodology is demonstrated on existing numerical codes, and direct and adjoint global modes are calculated for three typical flow configurations. Implementation issues and the performance measures are also discussed. The proposed algorithm presents an easy-to-implement and efficient technique to extract valuable information for the quantitative analysis of complex flows.},

  abstract = {Compressible flow over a flat plate with two localised and wellseparated roughness elements is analysed by global frequencyresponse analysis. This analysis reveals a sustained feedback loop consisting of a convectively unstable shear-layer instability, triggered at the upstream roughness, and an upstream-propagating acoustic wave, originating at the downstream roughness and regenerating the shear-layer instability at the upstream protrusion. A typical multipeaked frequency response is recovered from the numerical simulations. In addition, the optimal forcing and response clearly extract the components of this feedback loop and isolate flow regions of pronounced sensitivity and amplification. An efficient parametricsensitivity framework is introduced and applied to the reference case which shows that first-order increases in Reynolds number and roughness height act destabilising on the flow, while changes in Mach number or roughness separation cause corresponding shifts in the peak frequencies. This information is gained with negligible effort beyond the reference case and can easily be applied to more complex flows.},

The linear and nonlinear development and eventual breakdown to turbulence are investigated using direct numerical simulation. The three different transition mechanisms compared are first mode oblique breakdown, second mode oblique breakdown and second mode fundamental resonance. The focus of the present work is to compare the nonlinear development and breakdown to turbulence for the different transition mechanisms and explain the heat transfer overshoot observed in experiments. First mode oblique breakdown leads to the shortest transition length and a clear peak in wall heat transfer in the transitional region. For all three transition mechanisms, the development of streamwise streaks precedes the breakdown to fully turbulent flow. The modal linear and nonlinear development are analysed including the breakdown of the streaks. The effect of wall cooling is investigated for second mode fundamental resonance and no qualitative differences in the nonlinear processes are observed. Finally, the development towards fully turbulent flow including mean flow, turbulent spectra, and turbulent fluctuations is shown and the first mode oblique breakdown simulation shows the furthest development towards a fully turbulent flow.},

Different tools from dynamical systems theory can be used for this purpose. In this review, we present a concise theoretical and numerical framework focusing on practical aspects of the computation and stability analyses of steady and time-periodic solutions, with emphasis on high-dimensional systems such as those arising from the spatial discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Using a matrix-free approach based on Krylov methods, we extend the capabilities of the open-source high-performance spectral element-based time-stepper Nek5000. The numerical methods discussed are implemented in nekStab, an open-source and user-friendly add-on toolbox dedicated to the study of stability properties of flows in complex three-dimensional geometries. The performance and accuracy of the methods are illustrated and examined using standard benchmarks from the fluid mechanics literature. Thanks to its flexibility and domain-agnostic nature, the methodology presented in this work can be applied to develop similar toolboxes for other solvers, most importantly outside the field of fluid mechanics.},

The modified TENO weighting strategy can be extended to arbitrarily veryhigh-order reconstruction in a straightforward manner. The proposed 10-point TENO10-A scheme is optimized to satisfy an approximate-dispersion relation while maintaining the 8th-order accuracy in smooth regions. For conventional gas dynamics at low to moderate Mach numbers, the TENO10-A scheme is robust, and shows low numerical dissipation in resolving small-scale physical fluctuations while capturing the sharp discontinuities. For high-Mach number simulations, TENO10-A is numerically stable and preserves the ENO property with the assistance of a positivity-preserving flux limiter. In terms of turbulent flows, TENO10-A faithfully predicts energy transfer, and resolves vorticity, entropy and acoustic modal fluctuations. A set of benchmark simulations is considered to assess the performance of proposed scheme.},

The FLDI beams were split such that one pair was aligned with the flow direction and the other along the Mach angle, allowing for simultaneous measurements of entropic fluctuations propagating along streamlines and acoustic disturbances along Mach lines. Transfer functions for interpreting the FLDI signal were applied to the free-jet nozzle flow: the instrument's depth of focus and sensitivity to disturbance wavenumber were estimated, as well as the influence of the nozzle shear layers in corrupting the FLDI signal. Experiments were performed at varying unit Reynolds numbers (3.2-14.4\texttimes 106 m-1{$\mkern1mu$}) and total enthalpies (0.57-0.89 MJ/kg). Streamwise convection velocities measured with the FLDI were found to be lower than theoretical freestream velocities, consistent with earlier studies detailing the noise convection velocity, though some frequency dependence was observed. Both broadband and core-flow density-based turbulence intensities exhibited a decrease with increasing Reynolds number. The relative contributions of the acoustic and entropic disturbances to the overall noise environment was also examined through a study of the correlated signal pairs. The acoustic contribution was found to be dominant in all cases, with no clear trend with Reynolds number. Finally, the disturbance intermittency at the various tunnel conditions was investigated; the intermittency was greatest at the lowest Reynolds number condition, suggesting that the nozzle boundary layer may be transitional at this condition.},

Our dataset has comparable scale to existing static time series databases; however, our systems can be re-integrated to produce additional datasets of arbitrary length and granularity. Our dataset is annotated with known mathematical properties of each system, and we perform feature analysis to broadly categorize the diverse dynamics present across the collection. Chaotic systems inherently challenge forecasting models, and across extensive benchmarks we correlate forecasting performance with the degree of chaos present. We also exploit the unique generative properties of our dataset in several proof-of-concept experiments: surrogate transfer learning to improve time series classification, importance sampling to accelerate model training, and benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms.},

  abstract = {In an air-breathing engine the flow deceleration from supersonic to subsonic conditions takes places inside the isolator through a gradual compression consisting of a series of shock waves. The wave system, referred to as a pseudo-shock wave or shock train, establishes the combustion chamber entrance conditions, and therefore influences the performance of the entire propulsion system. The characteristics of the pseudo-shock depend on a number of variables which make this flow phenomenon particularly challenging to be analysed. Difficulties in experimentally obtaining accurate flow quantities at high speeds and discrepancies of numerical approaches with measured data have been readily reported. Understanding the flow physics in the presence of the interaction of numerous shock waves with the boundary layer in internal flows is essential to developing methods and control strategies. To counteract the negative effects of shock wave/boundary layer interactions, which are responsible for the engine unstart process, multiple flow control methodologies have been proposed. Improved analytical models, advanced experimental methodologies and numerical simulations have allowed a more in-depth analysis of the flow physics. The present paper aims to bring together the main results, on the shock train structure and its associated phenomena inside isolators, studied using the aforementioned tools. Several promising flow control techniques that have more recently been applied to manipulate the shock wave/boundary layer interaction are also examined in this review.},

The spreading is not due to the lateral propagation of turbulent eddies but rather to a developing disturbance in the surrounding spanwise vorticity of the laminar boundary layer. We concentrate on the mechanisms for generating streamwise vorticity. In particular, inclined generally streamwise vortex tubes along the spot/wedge boundary tilt mean shear vortex lines either up or down. These lines subsequently tend to either lag back or lead forward. As the leading or lagging vortex lines continue to wrap around and reinforce the causative inclined tube, the lines arch up or down. The outboard portion of the resulting arch must acquire a vertical, {$\omega$}y, component of vorticity which induces the rollup of a new inclined tube now outboard of the first. Close to the wall the arching mechanism is inhibited by the no through flow boundary condition while far from the wall the process is inhibited by the lack of sufficient mean spanwise vorticity.},

  abstract = {Studying boundary layer transition and its sensitivity to free-stream turbulence, it is often advantageous to be able to continuously adjust intensity and length scales of the turbulence. In this study, we present a new adjustable static turbulence grid and characterize the turbulence it generates. The biplane grid consists of 7 vertical and 19 horizontal, 1 mm-thick baffle plates with a spacing of 12.5 mm. Four of the vertical and ten of the horizontal baffles can be rotated by 90{$\smwhtcircle$} around the longitudinal axis to change their angle of attack and effective width, while the whole grid can be shifted by 410 mm in flow direction. Adjusting the baffle plate angle and axial grid displacement allows a variation of the turbulence intensity at the exit of the turbulence generator, while other parameters, such as the integral length scale or the turbulent Reynolds number, remain constant and vice versa. The turbulence intensity at the exit can be set within the range of 1.5\textendash 8\%. Single and X-wire probes are used to measure the level of isotropy, decay of turbulent kinetic energy as well as characteristic length scales and energy spectra. The experiments are performed in a rectangular duct with a cross section of 100 mm \texttimes{} 250 mm embedded in a closed-loop wind tunnel. Reynolds numbers based on grid spacing vary from 11,000 to 32,500.},

It comprises a finite volume (FV) discretization using semi-discrete, non-staggered central schemes for colocated variables prescribed on a mesh of polyhedral cells that have an arbitrary number of faces. We describe the solver in detail, explaining the choice of variables whose face interpolation is limited, the choice of limiter, and a method for limiting the interpolation of a vector field that is independent of the coordinate system. The solution of momentum and energy transport in the Navier\textendash Stokes equations uses an operator-splitting approach: first, we solve an explicit predictor equation for the convection of conserved variables, then an implicit corrector equation for the diffusion of primitive variables. Our solver is validated against four sets of data: (1) an analytical solution of the one-dimensional shock tube case; (2) a numerical solution of two dimensional, transient, supersonic flow over a forward-facing step; (3) interferogram density measurements of a supersonic jet from a circular nozzle; and (4) pressure and heat transfer measurements in hypersonic flow over a 25{$\smwhtcircle$}\textendash 55{$\smwhtcircle$} biconic. Our results indicate that the central-upwind scheme of Kurganov, Noelle and Petrova (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2001; 23:707\textendash 740) is competitive with the best methods previously published (e.g. piecewise parabolic method, Roe solver with van Leer limiting) and that it is inherently simple and well suited to a colocated, polyhedral FV framework.

  abstract = {The hypersonic laminar to turbulent transition problem above Mach 10 is addressed experimentally in the short duration VKI Longshot gun tunnel. Reentry conditions are partially duplicated in terms of Mach and Reynolds numbers. Pure nitrogen is used as a test gas with flow enthalpies sufficiently low to avoid its dissociation, thus approaching a perfect gas behavior. The stabilizing effects of Mach number and nosetip bluntness on the development of natural boundary layer disturbances are evaluated over a 7degrees half-angle conical geometry without angle of attack. Emphasis is initially placed on the flow characterization of the Longshot wind tunnel where these experiments are performed. Free-stream static pressure diagnostics are implemented in order to complete existing stagnation point pressure and heat flux measurements on a hemispherical probe. An alternative method used to determine accurate free-stream flow conditions is then derived following a rigorous theoretical approach coupled to the VKI Mutation thermo-chemical library. Resulting sensitivities of free-stream quantities to the experimental inputs are determined and the corresponding uncertainties are quantified and discussed. The benefits of this different approach are underlined, revealing the severe weaknesses of traditional methods based on the measurement of reservoir conditions and the following assumptions of an isentropic and adiabatic flow through the nozzle. The operational map of the Longshot wind tunnel is redefined accordingly. The practical limits associated with the onset of nitrogen flow condensation under non-equilibrium conditions are also accounted for. Boundary layer transition experiments are then performed in this environment with free-stream Mach numbers ranging between 10-12. Instrumentation along the 800mm long conical model includes flush-mounted thermocouples and fast-response pressure sensors. Transition locations on sharp cones compare favorably with engineering correlations. A strong stabilizing effect of nosetip bluntness is reported and no transition reversal regime is observed for Re\_RN{$<$}120,000. Wavelet analysis of wall pressure traces denote the presence of inviscid instabilities belonging to Mack's second mode. An excellent agreement with Linear Stability Theory results is obtained from which the N-factor of the Longshot wind tunnel in these conditions is inferred. A novel Schlieren technique using a short duration laser light source is developed, allowing for high-quality flow visualization of the boundary layer disturbances. Comparisons of these measurement techniques between each other are finally reported, providing a detailed view of the transition process above Mach 10.},

Additionally, an optical shock capturing tool is deployed to measure the amplitude and frequency of the shock train oscillation. Varying the back pressure, the pre-shock Mach number is changed between Ma1 = 1.1 and 2.1. Two different modes of turbulence generation and distribution are detected. For a single normal shock and a normal shock train, the normal Reynolds stress u02 on the channel axis is only slightly increased compared to the free stream value, whereas for the cases of a lambda foot shock train and an x-type shock train, a strong intensification by forming a turbulent mixing zone can be observed.},

We carry out global linear stability analysis to identify the critical turn angle and the nature of the associated three-dimensional instability. At the critical angle, an unstable mode is present in the separation bubble and the reattached boundary layer. The mode is associated with streamwise streaks in wall temperature downstream of the corner. The existence of the unstable mode and its growth rate are confirmed with direct numerical simulations. It is found from budget analysis that streamwise deceleration of the recirculating flow plays a dominant role in the three-dimensional instability. Wave-maker analysis suggests that the instability does not have a centrifugal origin. Linear stability analysis of the steady-state flow at an angle beyond bifurcation is also carried out. The spanwise wavelength of the most unstable mode obtained at this turn angle compares well with experimental observations.},

  abstract = {The development of a small three-dimensional disturbance in plane Poiseuille flow is considered. Its kinetic energy is expressed in terms of the velocity and vorticity components normal to the wall. The normal vorticity develops according to the mechanism of vortex stretching and is described by an inhomogeneous equation, where the spanwise variation of the normal velocity acts as forcing. To study specifically the effect of the forcing, the initial normal vorticity is set to zero and the energy density in the wavenumber plane, induced by the normal velocity, is determined. In particular, the response from individual (and damped) Orr\textendash Sommerfeld modes is calculated, on the basis of a formal solution to the initial-value problem. The relevant timescale for the development of the perturbation is identified as a viscous one. Even so, the induced energy density can greatly exceed that associated with the initial normal velocity, before decay sets in. Initial conditions corresponding to the least-damped Orr\textendash Sommerfeld mode induce the largest energy density and a maximum is obtained for structures infinitely elongated in the streamwise direction. In this limit, the asymptotic solution is derived and it shows that the spanwise wavenumbers at which the largest amplification occurs are 2.60 and 1.98, for symmetric and antisymmetric normal vorticity, respectively. The asymptotic analysis also shows that the propagation speed for induced symmetric vorticity is confined to a narrower range than that for antisymmetric vorticity. From a consideration of the neglected nonlinear terms it is found that the normal velocity component cannot be nonlinearly affected by the normal vorticity growth for structures with no streamwise dependence.},

In the linear regime, the largest integrated spatial growth rates ( NN -factors) for the primary instability were obtained for a frequency of approximately  f=300~kHzf=300\textasciitilde\textbackslash text\{kHz\} . Low grid-resolution simulations were carried out in order to identify the azimuthal wavenumber that led to the strongest growth rates with respect to the secondary instability for a fundamental and subharmonic resonance scenario. It was found that for the BAM6QT conditions the fundamental resonance is much stronger compared to the subharmonic resonance. Subsequently, for the case which led to the strongest fundamental resonance onset, detailed investigations were carried out using high-resolution DNS. The simulation results exhibit streamwise streaks of very high skin friction and of high heat transfer at the cone surface. Streamwise `hot' streaks on the flared cone surface were also observed in the experiments carried out at the BAM6QT facility using temperature sensitive paint. The presented findings provide strong evidence that the fundamental breakdown is a dominant and viable path to transition for the BAM6QT conditions.},

  abstract = {A random forcing approach was implemented into a high-order accurate finitedifference code in order to investigate `natural' laminar\textendash turbulent transition in hypersonic boundary layers. In hypersonic transition wind-tunnel experiments, transition is caused `naturally', by free-stream disturbances even when so-called quiet tunnels are employed such as the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM6QT) at Purdue University. The nature and composition of the free-stream disturbance environment in high-speed transition experiments is difficult to assess and therefore largely unknown. Consequently, in the direct numerical simulations (DNS) presented here, the free-stream disturbance environment is simply modelled by random pressure (acoustic) disturbances with a broad spectrum of frequencies and a wide range of azimuthal wavenumbers. Results of a high-resolution DNS for a flared cone at Mach 6, using the random forcing approach, are presented and compared to a fundamental breakdown simulation using a `controlled' disturbance input (with a specified frequency and azimuthal wavenumber). The DNS results with random forcing clearly exhibit the `primary' and `secondary' streak pattern, which has previously been observed in our `controlled' breakdown simulations and the experiments in the BAM6QT. In particular, the spanwise spacing of the `primary' streaks for the random forcing case is identical to the spacing obtained from the `controlled' fundamental breakdown simulation. A comparison of the wall pressure disturbance signals between the random forcing DNS and experimental data shows remarkable agreement. The random forcing approach seems to be a promising strategy to investigate nonlinear breakdown in hypersonic boundary layers without introducing any bias towards a distinct nonlinear breakdown mechanism and/or the selection of specific frequencies or wavenumbers that is required in the `controlled' breakdown simulations.},

The instability is driven by a boundary condition relating the disturbance wall shears in the streamwise and normal directions. The undulations have a wavelength comparable with the boundary layer depth and the amplitude is asymptotically small compared with the depth. If the roughness parameter is large then, apart from a narrow window of vortex wavenumbers, the instability responds in a quasi-parallel manner.

Linear stability calculations were carried out employing a high-order compressible Navier-Stokes solver and using very small disturbance amplitudes in order to capture the linear (primary) instability characteristics. The results of the linear stability calculations were then used to determine which nonlinear mechanism may likely be relevant and to choose the forcing parameters (frequency and azimuthal wavenumber) for "controlled" transition simulations that may lead to the transition. In order to determine if the disturbance waves identified from the linear calculations may indeed be able to trigger nonlinear breakdown, the disturbances were introduced in the entropy layer at high amplitudes.},

First, (linear) stability calculations were carried out by employing a high-order Navier\textendash Stokes solver and using very small disturbance amplitudes in order to capture the linear disturbance development. Contrary to standard linear stability theory (LST) results, these investigations revealed a strong `linear' instability in the entropy-layer region for a very short downstream distance for oblique disturbance waves with spatial growth rates far exceeding those of second-mode disturbances. This linear instability behaviour was not captured with conventional LST and/or the parabolized stability equations (PSE). Secondly, a nonlinear breakdown simulation was performed using high-fidelity DNS. The DNS results showed that linearly unstable oblique disturbance waves, when excited with large enough amplitudes, lead to a rapid breakdown and complete laminar-turbulent transition in the entropy layer just upstream of the second-mode instability region.},

In contrast to the eigensolutions of traditional linear stability equations, PSE solutions incorporate inhomogeneous initial and boundary conditions as do numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, but they can be obtained at modest computational expense. PSE codes have developed into a convenient tool to analyze basic mechanisms in boundary-layer flows. The most important area of application, however, is the use of the PSE approach for transition analysis in aerodynamic design. Together with the adjoint linear problem, PSE methods promise improved design capabilities for laminar flow control systems.},

The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.},

The formulation is high order and contains no artificial dissipation. Numerical stability is enhanced through semi-discrete satisfaction of global conservation properties stemming from the second law of thermodynamics and the entropy equation. The numerical implementation is achieved using a conservative skew-symmetric splitting of the nonlinear terms. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by performing unresolved numerical simulations and large eddy simulations of compressible isotropic turbulence at a very high Reynolds number. Results show the scheme is capable of capturing the statistical equilibrium of low Mach number compressible turbulent fluctuations at infinite Reynolds number. Comparisons with the entropy splitting technique [J. Comput. Phys. 162 (2000) 33; J. Comput. Phys. 178 (2002) 307], staggered method [J. Comput. Phys. 191(2) (2003) 392], and skew-symmetric like schemes [J. Comput. Phys. 161 (2000) 114] confirm the superiority of the current approach. We also discuss a flaw in the skew-symmetric splitting implemented in the literature. Very good results are obtained based on the proper splitting.},

The STS-134 imagery was part of a larger effort to demonstrate an emerging and reliable non-intrusive global thermal measurement capability and to complement a series of boundary layer transition flight experiments that were flown on the Shuttle. The STS-134 observations are believed to be the first time that the development and movement of a hypersonic boundary layer transition front has been witnessed in flight over the entire vehicle surface and in particular, at unprecedented spatial resolution. Additionally, benchmark surface temperature maps of the Orbiter lower surface collected over multiple flights and spanning a Mach range of 18 to 6 are now available and represent an opportunity for collaborative comparison with computational techniques focused on hypersonic transition and turbulence modeling. The synergy of the global temperature maps with the companion in-situ thermocouple measurements serve as an example of the effective leveraging of resources to achieve a common goal of advancing our understanding of the complex nature of high Mach number transition. It is shown that quantitative imaging can open the door to a multitude of national and international opportunities for partnership associated with flight-testing and subsequent validation of numerical simulation techniques. The quantitative imaging applications highlighted in this paper offer unique and complementary flight measurement alternatives and suggest collaborative instrumentation opportunities to advance the state of the art in transition prediction and maximize the return on investment in terms of developmental flight tests for future vehicle designs.},

  abstract = {The scramjet isolator, which is used to prevent the hypersonic inlet from disturbances that arise from the pressure rise in the scramjet combustor due to the intense turbulent combustion, is one of the most critical components in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion systems. Any engineering error that is possible in the design and manufacturing procedure of the experimental model, and the intense heat release in the scramjet combustor, may cause the performance of the isolator to decrease, leading to its lack of capability in supporting the back pressure. The coupled implicit Reynolds Averaged Navier\textendash Stokes (RANS) equations and the two-equation standard k\`A e turbulent model have been employed to numerically simulate the flow fields in a three-dimensional scramjet isolator. The effects of the divergent angle and the back pressure on the shock wave transition and the location of the leading edge of the shock wave train have been estimated and discussed. The obtained results show that the present numerical results are in very good agreement with the available experimental shadow-pictures, and the numerical method is more suitable for capturing the shock wave train and predicting the location of the leading edge of the shock wave train in the scramjet isolator than the present two-dimensional numerical methods. This is due to the small width-to-height ratio of the isolator and the intense threedimensional flow structures. On increasing the divergent angle of the scramjet isolator, the static pressure along the central symmetrical line of the isolator decreases sharply. This is due to the strong expansion wave generated at the entrance of the isolator, and when the divergent angle of the isolator is sufficiently large, namely 1.51, a zone of negative pressure is formed just ahead of the leading edge of the shock wave train. At the same time, the shock wave train varies from being oblique to being normal, and then back to oblique. With an increase in the prescribed back pressure at the exit of the scramjet isolator, the leading edge of the shock wave train moves forward towards the entrance of the isolator, and when the back pressure is sufficiently large, unstart conditions in the hypersonic inlet can take place if the shock train reaches the inlet.},

  abstract = {A variational framework for the identification and analysis of general nonlinear optimal disturbances in compressible flows is derived. The formulation is based on the compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations in conserved variables for an ideal gas with temperature-dependent viscosity. A discretely consistent implementation based on generalized coordinates allows the accurate analysis of a wide range of settings. An application in the identification of the optimal disturbances which experience the highest amplification in kinetic energy in pipe flow is presented. At low Mach numbers and moderate initial amplitude, the disturbances undergo a sequence of Orr mechanism, oblique nonlinear interaction and lift-up mechanism, and the energy amplification is consistent with results reported for incompressible flow (Pringle \& Kerswell, Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 105, 2010, 154502). When the Mach number is increased, the gain in perturbation kinetic energy grows appreciably, and the initial disturbance field becomes increasingly localized. Nonlinear optimal disturbances which are rescaled to higher initial kinetic energy than prescribed in the optimization procedure are demonstrated to evolve into a chaotic state. For a constant time horizon, the initial perturbation energy to reach a high-energy state decreases monotonically with Mach number.},

According to a criterion developed in the study of plasma instabilities, a flow is convectively unstable when the branch-point singularities are in the lower half complex-frequency plane. These concepts are applied to a family of free shear layers with varying velocity ratio \$R = \textbackslash Delta U/2\textbackslash overline\{U\}\$, where {$\Delta$}U is the velocity difference between the two streams and \$\textbackslash overline\{U\}\$ their average velocity. It is demonstrated that spatially growing waves can only be observed if the mixing layer is convectively unstable, i.e. when the velocity ratio is smaller than Rt = 1.315. When the velocity ratio is larger than Rt, the instability develops temporally. Finally, the implications of these concepts are discussed also for wakes and hot jets.},

The results show that all the nozzles are of essentially equal effectiveness as far as the core flow in the exit plane is concerned. But the mean and turbulence characteristics of the exit boundary layer, the upstream influence of the contraction, and the departure from equipartition within the nozzle vary significantly with the contraction shape. The data demonstrate the inadequacy of the Batchelor-Proudman-Ribner-Tucker theory in predicting the effect of a contraction on the turbulence structure.

All of these are based on the spatial transient growth theory pioneered by the principal investigators. For the important case of nosetip transition, the resulting transition relations reproduce the trends of the Reda and PANT data and carefully account for the separate roles of roughness and surface temperature level on transition behavior. This has now also been done for flat plates in supersonic flow and the relationship with the Re\texttheta/Me transition criterion is examined. Further, this has led to a more general critique of the Re\texttheta/Me criterion.},

The equation covers the whole Reynolds number range from laminar to turbulent boundary-layer regimes and can thus be used instead of the two correlating equations defined in ISO 9300 : 2005. The deviation of the discharge coefficients of well-made CFVNs is expected to be less than 7 0.2\% throughout the Reynolds number range. Tolerances for the diffuser length, inlet curvature and inlet diameter are also proposed. It is shown that the widely-accepted theories that estimate the core flow distribution result in significant error when the inlet curvature is small and that removing the third term in Hall's equation results in very good agreement with the experimental data regardless of the magnitude of the inlet curvature. The use of CFVNs with the inlet curvature of 1.0D is discussed in order to reduce the uncertainty owing to undefined boundary-layer transition Reynolds number. A possibility is shown that such a CFVN may not have an apparent boundary-layer transition in the investigated Reynolds number range from 1.5 \^A 104 to 2.0 \^A 106.},

  abstract = {Recovery Temperature Anemometry (RTA) was used to investigate flow fields in critical flow nozzles without perturbing the flows. In RTA, the recovery temperature in the flow field is measured by using a very thin thermocouple wire, and the measured temperature is then converted into a flow velocity on the basis of the recovery factor. Because the sensitivity of the thermocouple wire is concentrated precisely at its contact point, the spatial resolution of RTA is extremely high, for example, 10\textendash 50 \textmu m in the present measurements. Results measured by RTA, using the square root of the Prandtl number as the recovery factor, agreed well with 1D and 2D theoretical predictions. RTA was also shown to be capable of detecting the boundary layer generated on the throat wall of the nozzle. The results also revealed the presence of an interaction between a moving shock wave, the location of which depended on the pressure ratio, and an oblique shock system, the position of which was fixed by the geometry of the nozzle; this interaction is considered to be related to the premature unchoking phenomenon in which a critical nozzle fails to choke at high pressure ratios.},

  abstract = {Bypass transition in an initially laminar boundary layer beneath free-stream turbulence is simulated numerically. New perspectives on this phenomenon are obtained from the numerical flow fields. Transition precursors consist of long backward jets contained in the fluctuating u-velocity field; they flow backwards relative to the local mean velocity. The jets extend into the upper portion of the boundary layer, where they interact with free-stream eddies. In some locations a free-stream perturbation to the jet shear layer develops into a patch of irregular motion \textendash{} a sort of turbulent spot. The spot spreads longitudinally and laterally, and ultimately merges into the downstream turbulent boundary layer. Merging spots maintain the upstream edge of the turbulent region. The jets, themselves, are produced by low-frequency components of the free-stream turbulence that penetrate into the laminar boundary layer. Backward jets are a component of laminar region streaks.A method to construct turbulent inflow from Orr\textendash Sommerfeld continuous modes is described. The free-stream turbulent intensity was chosen to correspond with the experiment by Roach \& Brierly (1990). Ensemble-averaged numerical data are shown to be in good agreement with laboratory measurements.},

  abstract = {Laminar-to-turbulent transition in a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer at Mach 4.5 is studied using direct numerical simulations. For a given level of total disturbance energy, the inflow spectrum was designed to correspond to the nonlinearly most dangerous condition that leads to the earliest possible transition Reynolds number. The synthesis of the inlet disturbance is formulated as a constrained optimization, where the control vector is comprised of the amplitudes and relative phases of the inlet modes; the constraints are the prescribed total energy and that the flow evolution satisfies the full nonlinear compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations; the cost function is defined in terms of the mean skin-friction coefficient and, once maximized, ensures the earliest possible transition location. An ensemble-variational (EnVar) technique is developed to solve the optimization problem. Starting from an initial guess, here a broadband disturbance, EnVar updates the estimate of the control vector at the end of each iteration using the gradient of the cost function, which is evaluated from the outcomes of an ensemble of possible solutions. Two inflow conditions are computed, each corresponding to a different level of energy, and their spectra are contrasted: the lower-energy case includes two normal acoustic waves and one oblique vorticity perturbation, whereas the higher-energy condition consists of oblique acoustic and vorticity waves. The focus is placed on the former case because it cannot be categorized as any of the classical breakdown scenarios (fundamental, subharmonic or oblique), while the higher-energy condition undergoes a second-mode oblique transition. At the lower energy level, the instability wave that initiates the rapid breakdown to turbulence is not present at the inlet plane. Instead, it appears at a downstream location after a series of nonlinear interactions that spur the fastest onset of turbulence. The results from the nonlinearly most potent inflow condition are also compared to other inlet disturbances that are selected solely based on linear theory, and which all yield relatively delayed transition onset.},

In this work, we propose a novel, entropy-consistent, and stable localized artificial-viscosity/diffusivity (LAD)-based method for capturing shock and contact discontinuities in compressible flows. Using an analogy between the Lax-Friedrichs (LF) flux and the artificial-viscosity methods, a discrete LF-type flux formulation is proposed for the LAD method. The proposed method satisfies the discrete kinetic energy-and entropy-consistency conditions presented by Jain \& Moin (2020), hence the name entropy-consistent localized artificial diffusivity (EC-LAD). We also propose new sensors that localize where the artificial viscosity is acting, and show that the proposed method is suitable for large-eddy simulation (LES) of compressible turbulent flows with shocks. The sensors are designed in a way that the resulting method does not require tuning coefficients, depending on the problem being solved, that are typical of LAD methods. At the end, the extension of the proposed method to compressible two-phase flows is also presented.},

This property is difficult to fulfill for high order conservative essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference schemes. In this paper we explore an alternative flux formulation for such finite difference schemes [5] which can preserve free-stream solutions, based on the numerical technique for the metric terms [13], which can be applied to this alternative flux formulation but is difficult to be applied to the standard finite difference formulation. Free-stream and vortex preservation properties are investigated, and comparison with standard finite difference WENO schemes is made. Theoretical derivation and numerical results show that the finite difference WENO schemes based on the alternative flux formulation can preserve free-stream and vortex on both stationary and dynamically generalized coordinate system, hence giving much better performance than the standard finite difference WENO schemes for such problems.},

  abstract = {, The beginning of laminar\textendash turbulent transition is usually associated with a wave-like disturbance, but its evolution and role in precipitating the development of other flow structures are not well understood from a structure-based view. Nonlinear parabolized stability equations (NPSE) were solved numerically to simulate the transition of K-regime, N-regime and O-regime. However, only the K-regime transition was examined experimentally using both hydrogen bubble visualization and time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomo-PIV). Based on the `NPSE visualization' and `tomographic visualization', at least four common characteristics of the generic transition process were identified: (i)~inflectional regions representing high-shear layers (HSL) that develop in vertical velocity profiles, accompanied by ejection\textendash sweep behaviours; (ii)~low-speed streak (LSS) patterns, manifested in horizontal timelines, that seem to consist of several three-dimensional (3-D) waves; (iii)~a warped wave front (WWF) pattern, displaying multiple folding processes, which develops adjacent to the LSS in the near-wall region, prior to the appearance of {$\mathsl{\Lambda}$}-vortices; (iv)~a coherent 3-D wave front, similar to a soliton, in the upper boundary layer, accompanied by regions of depression along the flanks of the wave. It was determined that the amplification and lift-up of a 3-D wave causes the development of the HSL, WWF and multiple folding behaviour of material surfaces, that all contribute to the development of a {$\mathsl{\Lambda}$}-vortex. The amplified 3-D wave is hypothesized as a soliton-like coherent structure. Based on our results, a path to transition is proposed, which hypothesizes the function of the WWF in boundary-layer transition.},

  abstract = {Flows in which shock waves and turbulence are present and interact dynamically occur in a wide range of applications, including inertial confinement fusion, supernovae explosion, and scramjet propulsion. Accurate simulations of such problems are challenging because of the contradictory requirements of numerical methods used to simulate turbulence, which must minimize any numerical dissipation that would otherwise overwhelm the small scales, and shock-capturing schemes, which introduce numerical dissipation to stabilize the solution. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the performance of several numerical methods capable of simultaneously handling turbulence and shock waves. A comprehensive range of high-resolution methods (WENO, hybrid WENO/central difference, artificial diffusivity, adaptive characteristic-based filter, and shock fitting) and suite of test cases (Taylor\textendash Green vortex, Shu\textendash Osher problem, shock-vorticity/entropy wave interaction, Noh problem, compressible isotropic turbulence) relevant to problems with shocks and turbulence are considered. The results indicate that the WENO methods provide sharp shock profiles, but overwhelm the physical dissipation. The hybrid method is minimally dissipative and leads to sharp shocks and well-resolved broadband turbulence, but relies on an appropriate shock sensor. Artificial diffusivity methods in which the artificial bulk viscosity is based on the magnitude of the strain-rate tensor resolve vortical structures well but damp dilatational modes in compressible turbulence; dilatation-based artificial bulk viscosity methods significantly improve this behavior. For well-defined shocks, the shock fitting approach yields good results. \'O 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Transient growth and resolvent analyses are routinely used to assess nonasymptotic properties of fluid flows. In particular, resolvent analysis can be interpreted as a special case of viewing flow dynamics as an open system in which free-stream turbulence, surface roughness, and other irregularities provide sources of input forcing. We offer a comprehensive summary of the tools that can be employed to probe the dynamics of fluctuations around a laminar or turbulent base flow in the presence of such stochastic or deterministic input forcing and describe how input\textendash output techniques enhance resolvent analysis. Specifically, physical insights that may remain hidden in the resolvent analysis are gained by detailed examination of input\textendash output responses between spatially localized body forces and selected linear combinations of state variables. This differentiating feature plays a key role in quantifying the importance of different mechanisms for bypass transition in wall-bounded shear flows and in explaining how turbulent jets generate noise. We highlight the utility of a stochastic framework, with white or colored inputs, in addressing a variety of open challenges including transition in complex fluids, flow control, and physics-aware data-driven turbulence modeling.

  abstract = {In the context of transition analysis, linear input-output analysis determines worst-case disturbances to a laminar base flow based on a generic right-hand-side volumetric/boundary forcing term. The worst-case forcing is not physically realizable, and, to our knowledge, a generic framework for posing physically-realizable worst-case disturbance problems is lacking. In natural receptivity analysis, disturbances are forced by matching (typically local) solutions within the boundary layer to outer solutions consisting of free-stream vortical, entropic, and acoustic disturbances. We pose a scattering formalism to restrict the input forcing to a set of realizable disturbances associated with plane-wave solutions of the outer problem. The formulation is validated by comparing with direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a Mach 4.5 flat-plate boundary layer. We show that the method provides insight into transition mechanisms by identifying those linear combinations of plane-wave disturbances that maximize energy amplification over a range of frequencies. We also discuss how the framework can be extended to accommodate scattering from shocks and in shock layers for supersonic flow.},

  abstract = {Coherent structures are found in many different turbulent flows and are known to drive self-sustaining processes in wall turbulence. Identifying the triadic interactions which generate coherent structures can provide insights beyond what is possible in the framework of linearized models. There are infinite possible interactions that may generate a given structure. Thus a method to systematically study those, ranking them in terms of their contribution to the structure of interest, is essential. We here use the resolvent-based extended spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (RESPOD) approach (Karban, U. et al. 2022 Self-similar mechanisms in wall turbulence studied using resolvent analysis. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 969, A36) to rank the triadic interactions which give rise to wall-attached structures in a minimal Couette flow at Reynolds number 400. Our analysis identifies that six triadic interactions dominate the most-energetic wall-attached structure, revealing the capability of the methodology to identify and rank nonlinear interactions responsible for a given coherent structure. The approach can be used to analyse the energy exchange in turbulent flows and may guide the construction of reduced-order models based on the interplay between different flow modes.},

  abstract = {Although boundary-layer flows over convex surfaces are exponentially stable, non-modal mechanisms may enable significant disturbance growth which can make the flow susceptible to secondary instabilities. A parametric investigation of the transient growth and secondary instabilities in flows over convex surfaces is performed. The optimal disturbance in the steady case corresponds to alternating streaks and streamwise vortices of opposite sign that reinforce one another due to lift-up and centrifugal forces, respectively. The process repeats with a constant (naturally appearing) streamwise wavelength which is proportional to the square root of the radius. Unsteady disturbances achieve a higher optimal gain, compared to the steady case, as a result of the opposing effects of the lift-up and centrifugal mechanisms. Linear analysis shows that the curvature has a negligible effect on secondary instabilities. Direct numerical simulations of transient growth with and without secondary instabilities confirm the predictions obtained by the local stability theory. It is found that the presence of a secondary instability is not sufficient, on its own, to ensure transition to turbulence. Only sufficiently long and energetic streaks trigger the breakdown to turbulence.},

The schlieren photographs reveals the supersonic flow with shock train in the nozzle. Static pressure along the barrel wall is also measured. The location of the head of pseudo-shock wave and its pressure distribution along the nozzle wall are analytically explained by using a formula of pseudo-shock wave. The analytical results show that the supersonic flow accompanying shock wave in the nozzle should be treated as pseudo-shock wave instead of normal shock wave.},

The artificial diffusivity is dynamically localized in space to capture different types of discontinuities such as a shock wave, contact surface or material discontinuity. The method is intended for use with large-eddy simulation of compressible transitional and turbulent flows. The method captures the discontinuities on curvilinear and anisotropic meshes with minimum impact on the smooth flow regions. The amplitude of wiggles near a discontinuity and the number of grid points used to capture the discontinuity do not depend on the mesh size. The comparisons between the proposed method and high-order shock-capturing schemes illustrate the advantage of the method for the simulation of flows involving shocks, turbulence and their interactions. The multi-dimensional formulation is tested on a variety of 1D and 2D, steady and unsteady, different types of discontinuity-related problems on curvilinear and anisotropic meshes. A simplification of the method which reduces the computational cost does not show any major detrimental effect on the discontinuity capturing under the conditions examined.},

  abstract = {Experiments are performed to investigate the effect of nose-tip bluntness on the instability mechanisms leading to boundary-layer transition on a 7{$\smwhtcircle$} half-angle cone in a Mach-6 free stream. The development of disturbances is characterized using a combination of high-speed calibrated schlieren images and pressure measurements, and the data are compared with results computed using the parabolized stability equations. The approximately 414 mm long cone model is equipped with an interchangeable nose tip ranging from sharp to 5.08 mm in radius. For nose tips with a radius RN {$<$} 2.54 mm, second-mode instability waves are the dominant mechanism leading to transition. Time-averaged frequency spectra computed from the calibrated schlieren visualizations and pressure measurements are used to compute the second-mode most-amplified frequencies and integrated amplification rates (N factors). Good agreement is observed between the measurements and computations in the linear-growth regime for the sharp-nose configuration at each free-stream condition. Additionally, a bispectral analysis identifies quadratic phase locking of frequency content responsible for the growth of higher harmonics. For nose tips of RN 2.54 mm, the schlieren visualization region is upstream of the entropy-layer swallowing length, and second-mode waves are no longer visible within the boundary layer; instead, elongated, steeply inclined features believed to be associated with non-modal instability mechanisms develop between the entropy-layer and boundary-layer edges. Simultaneously acquired surface pressure measurements reveal high-frequency pressure oscillations similar to second-mode instability waves associated with the trailing edge of these non-modal features.},

  abstract = {An adaptive nonlinear artificial dissipation model is presented for performing aeroacoustic computations by high-order and high-resolution numerical schemes based on central finite differences. It consists of a selective background smoothing term and a well-established nonlinear shock-capturing term, which damps out spuriousoscillations caused by the central differences in the presence of a shock wave and keeps the linear acoustic waves relatively unaffected. A conservative form of the selective background smoothing term is presented to calculate accurate propagation speed or location of the shock wave. The nonlinear shock-capturing term, which has been modeled by second-order derivative term, is combined with it to improve the resolution of discontinuity and enhance the numerical stability near the shock wave. An adaptive control constant for overall amplitude of the dissipation is automatically calculated according to given grid metrics and time-dependent flow conditions. It is shown that the improved artificial dissipation model reproduces the correct profile and speed of the shock wave, suppresses numerical oscillations near the discontinuity, and avoids unnecessary damping on the smooth linear acoustic waves. The feasibility and performance of the adaptive nonlinear artificial dissipation model for the computational aeroacoustics are investigated and validated by the applications to actual problems.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation is described in which principal emphasis is given to revealing the nature of the motions in the non-linear range of boundary-layer instability and the onset of turbulence. It has as its central purpose the evaluation of existing theoretical considerations and the provision of a sound physical model which can be taken as a basis for a theoretical approach. The experimental method consisted of introducing, in a two-dimensional boundary layer on a flat plate at `incompressible' speeds, three-dimensional disturbances under controlled conditions using the vibrating-ribbon technique, and studying their growth and evolution using hot-wire methods. It has been definitely established that longitudinal vortices are associated with the non-linear three-dimensional wave motions. Sufficient data were obtained for an evaluation of existing theoretical approaches. Those which have been considered are the generation of higher harmonics, the interaction of the mean flow and the Reynold stress, the concave streamline curvature associated with the wave motion, the vortex loop and the non-linear effect of a three-dimensional perturbation. It appears that except for the latter they do not adequately describe the observed phenomena. It is not that they are incorrect or may not play a role in some aspect of the local behaviour, but from the over-all point of view the results suggest that it is the non-linear effect of a three-dimensional perturbation which dominates the behaviour. A principal conclusion to be drawn is that a new perspective, one that takes three-dimensionality into account, is required in connexion with boundary-layer instability. It is demonstrated that the actual breakdown of the wave motion into turbulence is a consequence of a new instability which arises in the aforementioned three-dimensional wave motion. This instability involves the generation of `hairpin' eddies and is remarkably similar in behaviour to `inflexional' instability. It is also shown that the results obtained from the study of controlled disturbances are equally applicable to `natural' transition.},

  abstract = {The dynamical mechanisms underlying the redistribution of mean momentum and vorticity are explored for transitional two-dimensional boundary-layer flow at nominally zero pressure gradient. The analyses primarily employ the direct numerical simulation database of Wu \& Moin (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 630, 2009, p. 5), but are supplemented with verifications utilizing subsequent similar simulations. The transitional regime is taken to include both an instability stage, which effectively generates a finite Reynolds stress profile, -{$\rho$}uv(y), and a nonlinear development stage, which progresses until the terms in the mean momentum equation attain the magnitude ordering of the four-layer structure revealed by Wei et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 522, 2005, p. 303). Self-consistently applied criteria reveal that the third layer of this structure forms first, followed by layers IV and then II and I. For the present flows, the four-layer structure is estimated to be first realized at a momentum thickness Reynolds number R\texttheta{} = U{$\infty\theta$}/{$\nu$} {$\simeq$} 780. The first-principles-based theory of Fife et al. (J. Disc. Cont. Dyn. Syst. A, vol. 24, 2009, p. 781) is used to describe the mean dynamics in the laminar, transitional and four-layer regimes. As in channel flow, the transitional regime is marked by a non-negligible influence of all three terms in the mean momentum equation at essentially all positions in the boundary layer. During the transitional regime, the action of the Reynolds stress gradient rearranges the mean viscous force and mean advection profiles. This culminates with the segregation of forces characteristic of the four-layer regime. Empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that the formation of the four-layer structure also underlies the emergence of the mean dynamical properties characteristic of the high-Reynolds-number flow. These pertain to why and where the mean velocity profile increasingly exhibits logarithmic behaviour, and how and why the Reynolds stress distribution develops such that the inner normalized position o{$\surd$}f its peak value, ym+, exhibits a Reynolds number dependence according to ym+ {$\simeq$} 1.9 {$\delta$}+.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that one of the main sources of acoustic radiation from a supersonic jet is due to spatial instability wave packets propagating downstream within the jet. This approach has enabled us to explain and predict the principal features of sound radiated by a supersonic jet with a circular nozzle. The aim of this present work is to generalize such an approach to jets with a circular nozzle deformed into a weakly corrugated (s-lobed) shape. This leads to the presence of two additional parameters, the lobe number (an integer) characterizing the corrugation wavelength and the corrugation amplitude. Their presence can be shown to lead to a resonant coupling between different instability waves which, in turn, can both intensify and suppress the aerodynamic noise. The assumption of a small corrugation amplitude allows us to consider the problem analytically using disturbance theory methods. The structure of the eigen-oscillations is determined at leading orders, where it is shown that differing azimuthal harmonics are coupled over a wide range of frequencies. The result of such couplings on the radiated sound is significant, even for a small corrugation amplitude. The above suggests that the effect of mode coupling, due to nozzle corrugation, could be used as a tool for noise control in supersonic jets.},

The objective of this study is (i) to advance the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms relevant for the early nonlinear transition regime of oblique breakdown and (ii) to make the connection to oblique transition, the incompressible scenario for bypass transition investigated by Schmid \& Henningson (Phys. Fluids A, vol. 4, 1992, pp. 1986\textendash 1989). The dominance of the longitudinal vortex mode in oblique breakdown is shown to be a consequence of a constantly forced transient growth instability. In particular, the primary pair of oblique waves serves as an `actuator' that is permanently introducing disturbances into the longitudinal mode where these disturbances exhibit transient growth. The effect of the transient growth instability on the longitudinal mode is to raise its amplitude rather than change the growth rate of this mode.},

A Floquet ansatz is used to account for periodicity of this base flow in the azimuthal direction. The origin of multiple unstable solutions, which are known to appear in these non-circular configurations, is traced through gradual perturbations of a parametrized base-flow profile. It is shown that all unstable modes are corrugated jet continuations of the classical Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz modes of circular jets, highlighting that the same instability mechanism, modified by corrugations, leads to the growth of disturbances in such flows. It is found that under certain conditions the eigenvalues may form saddles in the complex plane and display axis switching in their eigenfunctions. A parametric study is also conducted to understand how penetration and number of corrugations impact stability. The effect of these geometric properties on growth rates and phase speeds of the multiple unstable modes is explored, and the results provide guidelines for the development of nozzle configurations that more effectively modify the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz instability.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to redefine and improve the ISO9300 norm, it is possible to see the emergence of a universal ({$\mathsl{C}\mathsl{d}$} ) curve. For this, all the influential factors must be correctly understood within their range of variation. In recent discussions, the experimental calibration point could be limited, and a low-pressure measurement could be sufficient to extrapolate the higher part of the curve with a relatively good level of confidence. For that purpose, the cylindrical shape gives more variations and needs a higher level of measurement to understand the behavior of the curve. Roughness level is a key parameter to this understanding. Experiments have been carried out to determine the impact of cylindrical nozzle throat roughness on {$\mathsl{C}\mathsl{d}$} and to demonstrate the need for precise dimensional parameters, such as diameter and roughness characterization. The results show that an increase in roughness may lead to a significant decrease in {$\mathsl{C}\mathsl{d}$} , particularly at high Reynolds numbers ({$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{d}$} ). A theorization is introduced based on Colebrook \& White's formulation which allows the thickness boundary layer to be quantified. This study highlights the need for further investigation into both cylindrical nozzles and roughness effects on the discharge coefficient in order to improve the norm.},

In the current state of the work, there are two parallel studies: an experimental and a numerical. Experiments have been carried out to determine the impact of roughness on the CD and to demonstrate the need for dimension parameters, such as diameter and roughness coefficient characterisation. Numerical simulations are used in the same CFVN geometry with a smooth surface to determine the main parameters which can influence the numerical prediction of the discharge coefficient and the flow behaviour. The results show that an increase of roughness may lead to a significant decrease of the discharge coefficient, particularly in the high Reynolds number range.},

  abstract = {Originally published in 1961, this Classics edition continues to be appealing because it describes a large number of techniques still useful today. Although the primary focus is on the analytical theory, concrete cases are cited to forge the link between theory and practice. Considerable manipulative skill in the practice of differential equations is to be developed by solving the 350 problems in the text. The problems are intended as stimulating corollaries linking theory with application and providing the reader with the foundation for tackling more difficult problems. Lanczos begins with three introductory chapters that explore some of the technical tools needed later in the book, and then goes on to discuss interpolation, harmonic analysis, matrix calculus, the concept of the function space, boundary value problems, and the numerical solution of trajectory problems, among other things. The emphasis is constantly on one question: \&quot;What are the basic and characteristic properties of linear differential operators?\&quot; In the author\&\#39;s words, this book is written for those \&quot;to whom a problem in ordinary or partial differential equations is not a problem of logical acrobatism, but a problem in the exploration of the physical universe. To get an explicit solution of a given boundary value problem is in this age of large electronic computers no longer a basic question. But of what value is the numerical answer if the scientist does not understand the peculiar analytical properties and idiosyncrasies of the given operator? The author hopes that this book will help in this task by telling something about the manifold aspects of a fascinating field.\&quot;},

This finding may have implications for the observed tendency of turbulent shear flows to develop a longitudinal streaky structure.},

Some examples are given and the evolution of the local concentration of particles is simulated. Synthetic images have been generated using the information about its motion in a two-dimensional free vortex flow. A wing-tip vortex is simulated, showing good agreement with experimental results present in the literature. Standard PIV measurements have been performed over the synthetic images, showing the effect of core depletion of particles on the incidence of erroneous measurements.},

  abstract = {Disturbances introduced in wall-bounded flows can grow and lead to transition from laminar to turbulent flow. In order to reduce losses or enhance mixing in energy systems, a fundamental understanding of the flow stability is important. In low disturbance environments, the typical path to transition is an exponential growth of modal waves. On the other hand, in large disturbance environments, such as in the presence of high levels of free-stream turbulence or surface roughness, algebraic growth of non-modal streaks can lead to transition. In the present work, the stability of wall-bounded flows is investigated by means of linear stability equations valid both for the exponential and algebraic growth scenario. An adjoint-based optimization technique is used to optimize the algebraic growth of streaks. The exponential growth of waves is maximized in the sense that the envelope of the most amplified eigenmode is calculated. Two wall-bounded flows are investigated, the Falkner\textendash Skan boundary layer subject to favorable, adverse and zero pressure gradients and the Blasius wall jet. For the Falkner\textendash Skan boundary layer, the optimization is carried out over the initial streamwise location as well as the spanwise wave number and the angular frequency. Furthermore, a unified transition-prediction method based on available experimental data is suggested. The Blasius wall jet is matched to the measured flow in an experimental wall-jet facility. Linear stability analysis with respect to the growth of two-dimensional waves and streamwise streaks are performed and compared to the experiments. The nonlinear interaction of introduced waves and streaks and the flow structures preceding the flow breakdown are investigated by means of direct numerical simulations.},

The experimental results were previously obtained utilizing the phosphor thermography technique to monitor the status of the boundary layer downstream of discrete roughness elements via global heat transfer images of the X-33windward surface. A boundary layer transition correlation was previously developed for this data set using boundary layer edge conditions calculated using an inviscidlintegral boundary layer approach. An algorithm was written in the present study to extract boundary layer edge quantities from higher fidelity viscous computational fluid dynamic solutions to develop transition correlations that account for viscous effects on vehicles of arbitrary complexity. The boundary layer transition correlation developed for the X-33 from the viscous solutions are compared to the previous boundary layer transition correlations. It is shown that the boundary layer edge conditions calculated using an inviscid/integral boundary layer approach itre significantly different than those extracted from viscous computational fluid dynamic solutions. The present results demonstrate the differences obtained in correlating transition data using different computational methods.},

The shock train increases its length in the duct with back pressure by shifting upstream the onset of interaction without changing the characteristics of the wall pressure curve and the entire shock waves structure. The effect of confinement has been examined by varying the entrance flow with boundary-layer profile momentum thickness. The results show that the shock train length remains nearly unchanged at lower back pressure, but increases with the momentum thickness at higher back pressure. In both cases, the height and the -' span of shock diamnds decrease with increased confinement. Investigation on the Mach number effect indicates that for the same back pressure, higher Mach number results in greater shockdiamond span but shorter overall shock length in the duct. A potential flow instability has been identified around the wall pressure plateaus where the shock length changes signilicantly with small changes in back pressure. The mechanism may be partially responsible for the cause of shock oscillation phenomenon in certain duct and nozzle flows. The computed shock length at different flow conditions and back pressures are compared with the Waltrup-Billig correlation in reasonably good agreement.},

  abstract = {In data-driven modeling of spatiotemporal phenomena careful consideration often needs to be made in capturing the dynamics of the high wavenumbers. This problem becomes especially challenging when the system of interest exhibits shocks or chaotic dynamics. We present a data-driven modeling method that accurately captures shocks and chaotic dynamics by proposing a novel architecture, stabilized neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). In our proposed architecture, we learn the right-hand-side (RHS) of an ODE by adding the outputs of two NN together where one learns a linear term and the other a nonlinear term. Specifically, we implement this by training a sparse linear convolutional NN to learn the linear term and a dense fully-connected nonlinear NN to learn the nonlinear term. This is in contrast with the standard neural ODE which involves training only a single NN for learning the RHS. We apply this setup to the viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits shocked behavior, and show better short-time tracking and prediction of the energy spectrum at high wavenumbers than a standard neural ODE. We also find that the stabilized neural ODE models are much more robust to noisy initial conditions than the standard neural ODE approach. We also apply this method to chaotic trajectories of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. In this case, stabilized neural ODEs keep long-time trajectories on the attractor, and are highly robust to noisy initial conditions, while standard neural ODEs fail at achieving either of these results. We conclude by demonstrating how stabilizing neural ODEs provide a natural extension for use in reduced-order modeling by projecting the dynamics onto the eigenvectors of the learned linear term.},

In this paper, NSCBC is extended to account for convection and pressure gradients in boundary planes, resulting in a 3D-NSCBC approach. The introduction of these additional transverse terms requires a specific treatment for the computational domain's edges and corners, as well as a suited set of compatibility conditions for boundaries joining regions associated to different flow properties, as inlet, outlet or wall. A systematic strategy for dealing with edges and corners is derived and compatibility conditions for inlet/outlet and wall/outlet boundaries are proposed. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) tests are carried out on simplified flow configurations at first. 3D-NSCBC brings a drastic reduction of flow distortion and numerical reflection, even in regions of strong transverse convection; the accuracy and convergence rate toward target values of flow quantities is also improved. Then, 3D-NSCBC is used for large-eddy simulation (LES) of a free jet and an impinging round-jet. Edge and corner boundary treatment, combining multidirectional characteristics and compatibility conditions, yields stable and accurate solutions even with mixed boundaries characterized by bad posedness issues (e.g. inlet/outlet). LES confirms the effectiveness of the proposed boundary treatment in reproducing mean flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations up to the computational domain limits.},

  abstract = {The linear global instability and resulting transition to turbulence induced by an isolated cylindrical roughness element of height h and diameter d immersed within an incompressible boundary layer flow along a flat plate is investigated using the joint application of direct numerical simulations and fully three-dimensional global stability analyses. For the range of parameters investigated, base flow computations show that the roughness element induces a wake composed of a central low-speed region surrounded by a three-dimensional shear layer and a pair of low- and high-speed streaks on each of its sides. Results from the global stability analyses highlight the unstable nature of the central low-speed region and its crucial importance in the laminar\textendash turbulent transition process. It is able to sustain two different global instabilities: a sinuous and a varicose one. Each of these globally unstable modes is related to a different physical mechanism. While the varicose mode has its root in the instability of the whole three-dimensional shear layer surrounding the central low-speed region, the sinuous instability turns out to be similar to the von K\'arm\'an instability in the two-dimensional cylinder wake and has its root in the lateral shear layers of the separated zone. The aspect ratio of the roughness element plays a key role on the selection of the dominant instability: whereas the flow over thin cylindrical roughness elements transitions due to a sinuous instability of the near-wake region, for larger roughness elements the varicose instability of the central low-speed region turns out to be the dominant one. Direct numerical simulations of the flow past an aspect ratio {$\eta$} = 1 (with {$\eta$} = d/h) roughness element sustaining only the sinuous instability have revealed that the bifurcation occurring in this particular case is supercritical. Finally, comparison of the transition thresholds predicted by global linear stability analyses with the von Doenhoff\textendash Braslow transition diagram provides qualitatively good agreement.},

The different scenarios stem from linear stability theory and comprise exponential instabilities, neutral modes, transient growth from non-normal operators and parametric instabilities from temporal mean flow variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading to the observed turbulence structure, are rooted in simplified physical models. Whether the flow follows any or a combination of them remains elusive. Here, we evaluate the linear mechanisms responsible for the energy transfer from the streamwise-averaged mean flow (                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{U\}\$                                               ) to the fluctuating velocities (                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{u\}'\$                                               ). To that end, we use cause-and-effect analysis based on interventions: manipulation of the causing variable leads to changes in the effect. This is achieved by direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows at low Reynolds number, in which the energy transfer from                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{U\}\$                                               to                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{u\}'\$                                               is constrained to preclude a targeted linear mechanism. We show that transient growth is sufficient for sustaining realistic wall turbulence. Self-sustaining turbulence persists when exponential instabilities, neutral modes and parametric instabilities of the mean flow are suppressed. We further show that a key component of transient growth is the Orr/push-over mechanism induced by spanwise variations of the base flow. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of simulations with various frozen-in-time                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{U\}\$                                               arranged so that only transient growth is active, can faithfully represent the energy transfer from                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{U\}\$                                               to                                                                      \$\textbackslash boldsymbol \{u\}'\$                                               as in realistic turbulence.

The chosen configuration yields a strongly multiscale dynamics of the flow as the separated region oscillates at low-frequency, and high-frequency transitional instabilities are triggered by the injection of a generic noise at the inlet of the simulation. The simulation is post-processed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to extract the large scale low-frequency dynamics of the recirculation region. The bubble dynamics from the simulation is then compared to the results of a global linear stability analysis about the mean flow. A critical interpretation of the eigenspectrum of the linearized Navier\textendash Stokes operator is presented. The recirculation region dynamics is found to be dominated by two coexisting modes, a quasi-steady one that expresses itself mainly in the reattachment region and that is caused by the interaction of two self-sustained instabilities, and an unsteady one linked with the separation shock-wave and the mixing layer. The unsteady mode is driven by a feedback loop in the recirculation region, which may also be relevant for other unsteady shock-motion already documented for shock-wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction. The impact of the large-scale dynamics on the transitional one is then assessed through the numerical filtering of those low wavenumber modes; they are found to have no impact on the transitional dynamics.},

The inlet of the computational domain is perturbed with a white noise in order to excite convective instabilities. Coherent structures are extracted using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), which gives a mathematically optimal decomposition of spatio-temporally correlated structures within the flow. The mean flow is used to perform a resolvent analysis in order to study non-normal linear amplification mechanisms. The comparison between the resolvent analysis and the SPOD results provides insight on both the linear and non-linear mechanisms at play in the flow. To carry out the analysis, the flow is separated into three main regions of interest: the attached boundary layer, the mixing layer and the reattachment region. The observed transition process is dependent on the linear amplification of oblique modes in the boundary layer over a broad range of frequencies. These modes interact nonlinearly to create elongated streamwise structures which are then amplified by a linear mechanism in the rest of the domain until they break down in the reattachment region. The early nonlinear interaction is found to be essential for the transition process.},

  abstract = {, A high-fidelity simulation of the shock/transitional boundary layer interaction caused by a 15{$\circ$}15{$\circ$}15\^\textbackslash circ axisymmetrical compression ramp is performed at a free stream Mach number of 5 and a transitional Reynolds number. The inlet of the computational domain is perturbed with a white noise in order to excite convective instabilities. Coherent structures are extracted using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), which gives a mathematically optimal decomposition of spatio-temporally correlated structures within the flow. The mean flow is used to perform a resolvent analysis in order to study non-normal linear amplification mechanisms. The comparison between the resolvent analysis and the SPOD results provides insight on both the linear and nonlinear mechanisms at play in the flow. To carry out the analysis, the flow is separated into three main regions of interest: the attached boundary layer, the mixing layer and the reattachment region. The observed transition process is dependent on the linear amplification of oblique modes in the boundary layer over a broad range of frequencies. These modes interact nonlinearly to create elongated streamwise structures which are then amplified by a linear mechanism in the rest of the domain until they break down in the reattachment region. The early nonlinear interaction is found to be essential for the transition process.},

  abstract = {The same methods used previously to study acoustic-mode instability in supersonic boundary layers are applied to free shear layers, and new calculations are made for boundary layers with cooling and suction. The objective is to obtain additional information about acousticmode instability, and to find what features of the instability are common to boundary layers and free shear flows. Acoustic modes exist whenever there is an embedded region of locally supersonic flow relative to the phase speed of the instability wave. Consequently, they can be found in boundary layers, wakes, and jets, but not in mixing layers unless the flow is confined. In this first part of a two-part paper, attention is directed principally to two-dimensional waves. The linear, inviscid stability theory is used to calculate spatial amplification rates at Mach number 3 for the sinuous and varicose modes of a single wake flow and a single jet flow, each made up of the same mixing-layer profile plus a central region of uniform flow. Along with sequences of sinuous and varicose unstable modes clearly identifiable as acoustic modes, both of these flows, unlike the boundary layer, have a lowest sinuous mode that is the most unstable. The unstable modes include both subsonic and radiating disturbances with large amplification rates. The latter phenomenon is also found for highly cooled boundary layers with suction. In these boundary layers, suction is generally stabilizing for nonradiating acoustic disturbances, but destabilizing for radiating disturbances.},

  abstract = {It is well known that openFoam has become a very popular tool for research work in different fields and particularly, in fluid dynamics. But, it is also known its lack of detailed documentation supporting solvers made using the set of libraries provided by openFoam. Therefore, it becomes necessary to establish appropriate verifications that can be useful to users going for instance, through the selection of equations discretization schemes from fvSchemes libraries and of solution solvers from fvSolutions libraries, to be later applied in the simulation of a given specific problem. With this purpose, executable solvers available in openFoam 1.7 version to solve supersonic air flow problems are tested. Two different approaches have been taken in developing numerical methods to solve problems in transport phenomena at all Mach numbers and traditionally, they have been referred to as pressure-based and density-based methods. In this work, the advantages or disadvantages in applying any one of these methods, are addressed. To accomplish the proposed tasks, 2D and axisymmetric numerical simulations of well posed problems that have either an analytical solution or available experimental data to compare with, are performed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we continue to study the mechanisms of the receptivity of the supersonic boundary layer to free-stream disturbances by using both direct numerical simulation and linear stability theory. Specifically, the receptivity of a Mach 4.5 flow over a flat plate to free-stream fast acoustic waves is studied. The receptivity to free-stream slow acoustic waves, entropy waves and vorticity waves will be studied in the future. The oblique shock wave induced by the boundary-layer displacement plays an important role in the receptivity because the free-stream disturbance waves first pass through the shock before entering the boundary layer. A high-order shock-fitting scheme is used in the numerical simulations in order to account for the effects of interactions between free-stream disturbance waves and the oblique shock wave. The results show that the receptivity of the flat-plate boundary layer to free-stream fast acoustic waves leads to the excitation of both Mack modes and a family of stable modes, i.e. mode I, mode II, etc. It is found that the forcing fast acoustic waves do not interact directly with the unstable Mack modes. Instead, the stable mode I waves play an important role in the receptivity process because they interact with both the forcing acoustic waves and the unstable Mack-mode waves. Through the interactions, the stable mode I waves transfer wave energy from the forcing fast acoustic waves to the second Mack-mode waves. The effects of incident wave angles, forcing wave frequencies, and wall temperature perturbation conditions on the receptivity are studied. The results show that the receptivity mechanisms of the second mode are very different from those of modes I and II, which leads to very different receptivity properties of these discrete wave modes to free-stream fast acoustic waves with different incident wave angles, frequencies, and different wall boundary conditions. The maximum receptivities of the second mode, mode I and mode II to planar free-stream fast acoustic waves are obtained when incident wave angles approximately equal 26\textdegree, 45\textdegree, and 18\textdegree, respectively. The results of receptivity to a beam of free-stream fast acoustic waves show that the leading edge is one of the most efficient regions for receptivity.},

  abstract = {This paper is the first part of a two-part study on the mechanisms of the receptivity to disturbances of a Mach 4.5 flow over a flat plate by using both direct numerical simulations (DNS) and linear stability theory (LST). The main objective of the current paper is to study the linear stability characteristics of the boundary-layer wave modes and their mutual resonant interactions. The numerical solutions of both steady base flow and unsteady flow induced by forcing disturbances are obtained by using a fifth-order shock-fitting method. Meanwhile, the LST results are used to study the supersonic boundary-layer stability characteristics relevant to the receptivity study. It is found that, in addition to the conventional first and second modes, there exist a family of stable wave modes in the supersonic boundary layer. These modes play a very important role in the receptivity process of excitation of the unstable Mack modes, especially the second mode. These stable modes are termed mode I, mode II, etc., in this paper. Though mode I and mode II waves are linearly stable, they can have resonant (synchronization) interactions with both acoustic waves and the Mack-mode waves. Therefore, the stable wave modes such as mode I and mode II are critical in transferring wave energy between the acoustic waves and the unstable second mode. The effects of frequencies and wall boundary conditions for the temperature perturbations on the boundary-layer stability and receptivity are also studied.},

  abstract = {Supersonic boundary-layer receptivity to different types of free-stream disturbance is studied for a Mach 4.5 boundary-layer flow over a flat plate by using the approaches of both direct numerical simulation and linear stability theory. This paper is Part 3 of a three-part study of the receptivity of supersonic boundary layers to free-stream disturbances. The present paper investigates receptivity to four types of different free-stream disturbances, i.e. slow and fast acoustic waves, entropy waves, and vorticity waves. A high-order shock-fitting scheme is used in the numerical simulation in order to accurately account for the effects of interactions between free-stream disturbance waves and the oblique shock wave. Numerical results on the generation of fast acoustic waves by free-stream entropy waves or vorticity waves are compared with those of a linear theory. Good agreement is obtained in both wave angles and amplitudes immediately behind the bow shock. It is found that the second-mode receptivity to free-stream slow acoustic waves is several times stronger than that to free-stream fast acoustic waves. This is because free-stream slow acoustic waves can directly induce and interact with the first and second Mack modes, while free-stream fast acoustic waves cannot. Instead, the free-stream fast acoustic waves can only induce and interact with stable mode I waves, which in turn induce unstable Mack modes. In the cases of receptivity to free-stream entropy waves and vorticity waves, it is found that the oblique shock wave created by the displacement of the boundary layer plays an important role because boundary-layer disturbances are mainly induced by fast acoustic waves generated behind the shock by free-stream forcing waves. As a result, mechanisms of the receptivity to free-stream entropy and vorticity waves are very similar to those of the receptivity to free-stream fast acoustic waves.},

Additionally, a modular, open-source library is coupled with the flow solver for modeling real-gas effects in variable atmospheric mixtures. Verification against literature is done for canonical flat-plate boundary layers with various choices for gas modeling, with excellent agreement observed in all cases. The implementation of an artificial-diffusivity shock-capturing numerical scheme is then verified for supersonic shockwave--boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) cases and the improved code's capabilities are demonstrated for the cases of hypersonic SBLI and a sonic jet injection in a hypersonic crossflow, at higher enthalpy levels than those previously investigated. The results show excellent agreement with previous observations in the literature. The work presented in this paper demonstrates the range of applications that can be investigated with this tool, highlights the need for accurate physicochemical modeling, and paves the way for addressing increasingly more complex configurations and flows.},

  abstract = {Successful design of aerospace missions requires accurate modelling of the physical phenomena in a hypersonic boundary layer. The behaviour of hypersonic boundary layers is strongly influenced by finite-rate thermochemical effects. These effects can be captured by including finite-rate thermochemistry models in computational tools. Such models are typically highly parametrised, introducing non-equilibrium features into the flow that generate significant uncertainty, which reflects on the output quantities of interest. The way such phenomena interact with solid boundaries and roughness is fundamentally unknown and the additional uncertainty is unquantifiable. In the present work, we propose the investigation of the linear response of n-periodic roughness arrays using an efficient mathematical framework. We extend an existing computational tool to investigate the effect of roughness, including real-gas and finite-rate chemistry effects by coupling with the Mutation++ library. The proposed framework allows to study efficiently and in parallel the linear flow response and wake synchronisation without the restricting idealised periodicity constraint. The results are extracted from reduced-order geometries using automatic linearisation tools. This framework can be potentially combined with sensitivity analysis tools to identify critical roughness configurations. In this paper, we provide the necessary background and present preliminary results for canonical flat plate hypersonic boundary layers.},

  abstract = {A numerical investigation of the disturbance amplification in a Mach 4.8 flat-plate boundary layer with a localized two-dimensional roughness element is presented. The height of the roughness is varied and reaches up to approximately 70\% of the boundary-layer thickness. Simulations are based on a time-accurate integration of the compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations, with a small disturbance of fixed frequency being triggered via blowing and suction upstream of the roughness element. The roughness element considerably alters the instability of the boundary layer, leading to increased amplification or damping of a modal wave depending on the frequency range. The roughness is also the source of an additional perturbation. Even though this additional mode is stable, the interaction with the unstable mode in the form of constructive and destructive interference behind the roughness element leads to a beating and therefore transiently increased disturbance amplitude. Far downstream of the roughness, the amplification rate of a flat-plate boundary layer is recovered. Overall, the two-dimensional roughness element behaves as disturbance amplifier with a limited bandwidth capable of filtering a range of frequencies and strongly amplifying only a selected range.},

  abstract = {Short laminar separation bubbles can develop on a flat plate due to an externally imposed pressure gradient. Here, these bubbles are computed by means of direct numerical simulations. Laminar\textendash turbulent transition occurs in the bubble, triggered by small disturbance input with fixed frequency, but varying amplitude, to keep the bubbles short. The forcing amplitudes span a range of two orders of magnitude. All resulting bubbles differ with respect to their mean flow, linear-stability characteristics and distance between transition and mean reattachment locations. Mechanisms responsible for these differences are analysed in detail. Switching off the disturbance input or reducing it below a certain, very small threshold causes the short bubble to grow continuously. Eventually, it no longer exhibits typical characteristics of a short laminar separation bubble. Instead, it is argued that bursting has occurred and the bubble displays characteristics of a long-bubble state, even though this state was not a statistically steady state. This hypothesis is backed by a comparison of numerical results with measurements. For long bubbles, the transition to turbulence is not able to reattach the flow immediately. This effect can lead to the bursting of a short bubble, which remains short only when sufficiently large disturbances are convected into the bubble. Large-scale spanwise-oriented vortices at transition are observed for short but not for long bubbles. The failure of the transition process to reattach the flow in the long-bubble case is ascribed to this difference in transitional vortical structures.},

  abstract = {The interaction between a normal shock wave and a boundary layer along a wall surface in internal compressible flows causes a very complicated flow. When the shock is strong enough to separate the boundary layer, the shock is bifurcated and one or more shocks appear downstream of the bifurcated shock. A series of shocks thus formed, called ``shock train'', is followed by an adverse pressure gradient region, if the duct is long enough. Thus the effect of the interaction extends over a great distance. The flow is decelerated from supersonic to subsonic through the whole interaction region. In this sense, the interaction region including the shock train in it is referred to as ``pseudo-shock'' in the present paper, as Crocco called it. The shock train and pseudo-shock strongly affect the performance and efficiency of various flow devices. In the present review some fundamental characteristics of the shock train and pseudo-shock are first described. Some simple predictions are made to simulate these very complicated phenomena. Pseudo-shocks appearing in various flow devices are explained. Control methods of the pseudo-shocks are also described. Finally, the current understanding of self-excited oscillation of pseudo-shock is reviewed. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A pair of oblique waves at low amplitudes is introduced in a supersonic flat-plate boundary layer at Mach 3. Its downstream development and the concomitant process of laminar to turbulent transition is then investigated numerically using linear-stability theory, parabolized stability equations and direct numerical simulations (DNS). In the present paper, the linear regime is studied first in great detail. The focus of the second part is the early and late nonlinear regimes. It is shown how the disturbance wave spectrum is filled up by nonlinear interactions and which flow structures arise and how these structures locally break down to small scales. Finally, the study answers the question whether a fully developed turbulent boundary layer can be reached by oblique breakdown. It is shown that the skin friction develops such as is typical of transitional and turbulent boundary layers. Initially, the skin friction coefficient increases in the streamwise direction in the transitional region and finally decays when the early turbulent state is reached. Downstream of the maximum in the skin friction, the flow loses its periodicity in time and possesses characteristic mean-flow and spectral properties of a turbulent boundary layer. The DNS data clearly demonstrate that oblique breakdown can lead to a fully developed turbulent boundary layer and therefore it is a relevant mechanism for transition in two-dimensional supersonic boundary layers.},

It is found that the flow passing over such surface is highly susceptible to develop centrifugal instabilities in the form of G\textasciidieresis ortler vortices. Transition is triggered by means of wall-roughness elements which also serve to preset the wavelength of the Go\textasciidieresis rtler vortices that remains constant during their streamwise development. This allows to obtain a clear spanwise characterization of the G\textasciidieresis ortler boundary layer, and its breakdown into turbulence. The different regions encountered in the transition process, i.e., linear, nonlinear, transition and fully turbulent, are identified and characterized. Parametric studies are presented showing that the transition starting point is delayed when the radius of curvature is increased, however, it occurs at the same critical G\textasciidieresis ortler number. Additionally, an increase of the height of the wall-roughness elements advances the transition onset upstream. Moreover, a linear relation between the critical G\textasciidieresis ortler number and the Reynolds number based on the wall-roughness streamwise location has been found. Furthermore, it is observed that, compared to a wall-roughness bump element, a bump-dimple geometry is more efficient for exciting the transition process.},

In this work, we analyse the main limits of two popular de-compositions, namely the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and we propose a novel decomposition which allows for superior feature detection capabilities. This novel decomposition is referred to as Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD) and combines Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) with a standard POD. Using MRA, the mPOD splits the correlation matrix into the contribution of different scales, retaining non-overlapping portions of the correlation spectra; using the standard POD, the mPOD extracts the optimal basis from each scale. After introducing a matrix factorization framework for data-driven decompositions, the MRA is formulated via 1D and 2D filter banks for the dataset and the correlation matrix respectively. The validation of the mPOD, and a comparison with Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), DMD and POD are provided in three test cases. These include a synthetic test case, a numerical simulation of a nonlinear advection-diffusion problem, and an experimental dataset provided by the Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV) of an impinging gas jet. For each of these examples, the decompositions are compared in terms of convergence, feature detection capabilities and time-frequency localization.},

Available models are reviewed, with emphasis on their compatibility with modern CFD methods. Requirements for engineering transition models suitable for industrial CFD codes are specified. A new concept for transition modeling is introduced. It is based on the combination of experimental correlations with locally formulated transport equations. The concept is termed LCTM \textendash{} Local Correlation-based Transition Model. An LCTM model, which satisfies most of the specified requirements is described, including results for a variety of different complex applications. An incremental approach was used to validate the model, first on 2D flat plates and airfoils and then on to progressively more complicated test cases such as a threeelement flap, a 3D transonic wing and a full helicopter configuration. In all cases good agreement with the available experimental data was observed. The authors believe that the current formulation is a significant step forward in engineering transition modeling, as it allows the combination of transition correlations with general purpose CFD codes. There is a strong potential that the model will allow the 1st order effects of transition to be included in everyday industrial CFD simulations.},

Numerical validations are performed, ensuring the correctness of our sensitivity gradients up to 3\%, and the flow physics, including unstable mode analysis, acoustics, impact of turbulence modeling, is analysed. In order to enhance the portability and the valuable information carried out by our method, we present several preliminary studies that were performed using our formalism. First, we revisit the transonic buffet over an airfoil, the noise amplifier dynamics of a turbulent shock-boundary layer interaction is then characterized and we conclude with an analysis of the screech phenomenon in under-expanded jets.

Koopman mode decomposition is based on the surprising fact, discovered in Mezic\textasciiacute{} (2005), that normal modes of linear oscillations have their natural analogs\textemdash Koopman modes\textemdash in the context of nonlinear dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the representation of the system from the state-space representation to the dynamics governed by the linear Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper dealt only with measure-preserving transformations, the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The analysis is based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of computation of the spectrum and the associated Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic observable, this method uncovers the full point spectrum. A computational alternative is given by Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and differences between these two methods. A number of applications are reviewed in which decompositions of this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory unifies and provides a rigorous background for a number of different concepts that have been advanced in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis, triple decomposition, and dynamic mode decomposition.},

  abstract = {,  The disturbances evolving in the wake induced by an isolated roughness element are investigated on a flat plate inside a cold Mach 6 flow. Different instability modes are characterized by means of two-dimensional local linear stability computations for a cuboid and a ramp-shaped roughness element. A single pair of sinuous and varicose disturbances dominates the wake instability in the vicinity of each roughness geometry. A temporal growth-rate decomposition, extended to base flows depending on two spatial inhomogeneous directions, reveals that the roughness-induced wake modes extract most of their potential energy from the transport of disturbance entropy across the base-flow temperature gradients and most of their kinetic energy from the work of the disturbance Reynolds stresses against the base-flow velocity gradients. The growth rate of such instabilities is found to be influenced by the presence of Mack-mode disturbances developing on the flat plate. Evidence is observed of a continuous synchronization between the wake instabilities and the Mack-mode perturbations which resembles the second mechanism hypothesized by De Tullio \& Sandham (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 763, 2015, pp. 136\textendash 145) for the excitation of wake disturbances. The evolution of the relevant production and dissipation terms of the temporal growth-rate decomposition shows that under this continuous synchronization process, the energy signature of the wake instabilities progressively shifts towards that of Mack-mode instabilities. This leads to an enhancement of the amplification rate of the wake instabilities far downstream of the roughness element, ultimately increasing the associated N-factors for some of the investigated conditions.},

  abstract = {Roads to turbulence in open-flow shear layers are interpreted as sequences of often competing instabilities. These correspond to primary and higher-order restructurings of vorticity distributions which culminate in convected spatial disorder (with some spatial coherence on the scale of the shear layer) traditionally called turbulence. Attempts are made to interpret these phenomena in terms of concepts of convective and global instabilities on one hand, and of chaos and strange attractors on the other. The first is fruitful, and together with a review of mechanisms of receptivity provides a unifying approach to understanding and estimating transition to turbulence. In contrast, current evidence indicates that concepts of chaos are unlikely to help in predicting transition in open-flow systems. Furthermore, a distinction should apparently be made between temporal chaos and the convected spatial disorder of turbulence past Reynolds numbers where boundary layers and separated shear layers are formed.},

  abstract = {For a given shear-layer geometry the high-Reynolds-numbers turbulent flows possess strong, stable in-the-large, nearly universal features associated with the large number of degrees of freedom in the flows. These features include a range of scales of dominant energetic motion, a range of operating intensity levels, and average three-dimensional phase relations which, together, somehow insure the maintenance of a self-regenerative process. In seeking a rational approach to the bewildering variety of transitional behavior (Ref. 1), the author conjectures that many instability paths to turbulence are admissible and that their effectiveness hinges on whether the given mechanism supplies the proper scales, intensity level, and 3D phase relations needed for self-regeneration. Conceptual lessons are drawn from a recently completed critical survey of the literature on transition to turbulence, and a number of unifying conjectures are advanced for subsonic speeds. In particular, the roles of linear amplification, nonlinear limiting, and secondary instability inducted by unsteady nonlinear effects are discussed. These mechanisms are illustrated for a number of transitional flows, including those in presence of roughness and streamwise vorticity. A clarification is advanced for the question of fast versus slow transition raised at the recent Institute on Transition. (Ref. 2) Finally, an overall model of the linear and nonlinear processes leading to transition is proposed},

Roughness causes the near-wall fluid to slow down and generates a strong shear layer over the roughness elements. Examination of the mean wall pressure indicates that the roughness surface exerts an upward impulse on the fluid, generating counter-rotating pairs of streamwise vortices underneath the shear layer. These vortices transport near-wall low-momentum fluid away from the wall. Along the roughness region, the vortices grow stronger, longer and closer to each other, and result in periodic shedding. The vortices rise towards the shear layer as they advect downstream, and the resulting interaction causes the shear layer to break up, followed quickly by a transition to turbulence. The mean flow in the turbulent region shows a good agreement with available data for fully developed turbulent boundary layers. Simulations under varying conditions show that, where the shear is not as strong and the streamwise vortices are not as coherent, the flow remains laminar.},

A mixed direct and large-eddy simulation of a flat plate with a super-ellipse leading edge is carried out at various conditions. Onset and completion of transition is seen to move upstream with increasing bluntness. For sharper leading edges, at lower levels of turbulence, transition usually occurs through instabilities on low-speed streaks as observed by Jacobs \& Durbin (2001) and Brandt et al. (2004) whereas increasing either the turbulence intensity or the leading-edge bluntness brings into play another mechanism. Free-stream vortices are amplified at the leading edge because of stretching. In the case of particularly strong vortices, this interaction induces a localized streamwise vortical disturbance in the boundary layer which then grows as it convects downstream and eventually breaks down to form a turbulent spot. These disturbances, which are localized and hence wavepacket-like, move at speeds in the range 0.55 U{$\infty$}\textendash 0.65 U{$\infty$} and occur in the lower portion of the boundary layer. Simulations conducted with isolated vortices confirm such a response of the boundary layer.},

The accuracy deteriorates if the departure from orthogonality is too large, and non-orthogonal coordinate systems make the application of boundary conditions more complex. In this study, the method for generating the orthogonal BFC based on the non-orthogonal BFC is suggested, and five kinds of calculation grids (one non-orthogonal and four orthogonal grids) are generated. The two-dimensional calculations were performed for the flow around a circular cylinder with these orthogonal and non-orthogonal grids. The calculated results were compared with the measurements and the analytic prediction. The validity of grid orthogonality and the method for generating the orthogonal BFC are confirmed.},

A reduction of roughness height by a factor of two, on the other hand, leads to a weak amplification of disturbances compared to the smooth wall case with little effect on the mode growth rates. Differences in amplitude functions and growth rates of the modes induced by different disturbances were identified. The results also show that wall cooling leads to a decrease in the growth rate of these modes. The nonlinear stages of transition have also been studied, with particular emphasis on the effects of an oblique shock impinging on the transitional boundary layer region. The shock interaction makes the breakdown more sudden and leads to a wider turbulent wedge.},

The stability equations obtained from three-dimensional compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations are solved simultaneously with two-dimensional mean flow equations, using an efficient shoot-search technique for adiabatic wall condition. In the analysis, a wide range of Mach numbers extending well into the hypersonic range are considered for the mean flow, whereas both two- and three-dimensional disturbances are taken into account for the perturbation flow. All fluid properties, including the Prandtl number, are taken as temperature-dependent. The results of the analysis ascertain the presence of the second mode of instability (Mack mode), in addition to the first mode related to the Tollmien\textendash Schlichting mode present in incompressible flows. The effect of reference temperature on stability characteristics is also studied. The results of the analysis reveal that the stability characteristics remain almost unchanged for the most unstable wave direction for Mach numbers above 4.0. The obtained results are compared with existing numerical and experimental data in the literature, yielding encouraging agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract = {We present experimental results on separation of supersonic flow inside a convergent\textendash divergent (CD) nozzle. The study is motivated by the occurrence of mixing enhancement outside CD nozzles operated at low pressure ratio. A novel apparatus allows investigation of many nozzle geometries with large optical access and measurement of wall and centerline pressures. The nozzle area ratio ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 and the pressure ratio ranged from 1.2 to 1.8. At the low end of these ranges, the shock is nearly straight. As the area ratio and pressure ratio increase, the shock acquires two lambda feet. Towards the high end of the ranges, one lambda foot is consistently larger than the other and flow separation occurs asymmetrically. Downstream of the shock, flow accelerates to supersonic speed and then recompresses. The shock is unsteady, however, there is no evidence of resonant tones. The separation shear layer on the side of the large lambda foot exhibits intense instability that grows into large eddies near the nozzle exit. Time-resolved wall pressure measurements indicate that the shock oscillates in a piston-like manner and most of the energy of the oscillations is at low frequency.},

  abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-0600.vidComputations are performed to investigate the boundary-layer instabilities over a sharp cone-cylinder-flare model at zero degrees angle of attack. The model geometry and the flow conditions are selected to match the experiments conducted in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM6QT) at Purdue University. The geometry consists of a nominally sharp 5-degree half-angle cone, followed by a cylindrical segment and then a 10-degree flare. An axisymmetric separation bubble is generated as a result of the laminar shock/boundary-layer interaction in the cylinder-flare region. The comparison of the laminar flow solution and the schlieren images shows a remarkable agreement between the respective locations of both the boundarylayer edge and the reattachment shock. The predicted heat flux distribution is also in agreement with the measured values downstream of the reattachment location. The analysis of convective and global instabilities is performed for flare half angles equal to 8, 10, and 12 degrees and nosetip radii equal to 0.1, 1, and 5 mm. The linear amplification of first and second Mack mode instabilities that begin to amplify in the cone region are computed with a combination of the parabolized stability equations (PSE) and the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE). The predicted frequency spectra of the surface pressure fluctuations associated with both planar and oblique instability waves are compared with the measured spectra at the various locations of the PCB and Kulite sensors. The comparison shows that the computational analysis captures the distinct lobes within the disturbance amplification spectra measured in the experiments, but some differences in amplification characteristics are noted at low frequencies. Overall, the oblique disturbances are found to be more amplified than the planar disturbances. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful comparison between convective instability analysis and measured surface pressure fluctuations for a hypersonic configuration with a separation bubble. Finally, the global instability analysis shows that the laminar flow becomes supercritical for flare half angles larger than 8 degrees. The unstable global mode for the experimental configuration of a 10 degrees flare and a sharp nosetip cone corresponds to a stationary three-dimensional disturbance that is concentrated in the recirculation region and achieves its maximum growth rate for an azimuthal wavenumber of 5.},

  abstract = {The interaction of stationary streaks undergoing non-modal growth with modally unstable instability waves in a supersonic flat-plate boundary-layer flow is studied using numerical computations. For incompressible flows, previous studies have shown that boundary-layer modulation due to streaks below a threshold amplitude level can stabilize the Tollmien\textendash Schlichting instability waves, resulting in a delay in the onset of laminar\textendash turbulent transition. In the supersonic regime, the most-amplified linear waves become three-dimensional, corresponding to oblique, first-mode waves. This change in the character of dominant instabilities leads to an important change in the transition process, which is now dominated by oblique breakdown via nonlinear interactions between pairs of first-mode waves that propagate at equal but opposite angles with respect to the free stream. Because the oblique breakdown process is characterized by a strong amplification of stationary streamwise streaks, artificial excitation of such streaks may be expected to promote transition in a supersonic boundary layer. Indeed, suppression of those streaks has been shown to delay the onset of transition in prior literature. This paper investigates the nonlinear evolution of initially linear optimal disturbances that evolve into finite-amplitude streaks in a two-dimensional, Mach 3 adiabatic flat-plate boundary-layer flow, followed by the modal instability characteristics of the perturbed, streaky boundary-layer flow. Both parts of the investigation are performed with the plane-marching parabolized stability equations. Consistent with previous findings, the present study shows that optimally growing stationary streaks can destabilize the first-mode waves, but only when the spanwise wavelength of the instability waves is equal to or smaller than twice the streak spacing. Transition in a benign disturbance environment typically involves first-mode waves with significantly longer spanwise wavelengths, and hence, these waves are stabilized by the optimal growth streaks. Thus, as long as the amplification factors for the destabilized, short wavelength instability waves remain below the threshold level for transition, a significant net stabilization is achieved, yielding a potential transition delay that may be comparable to the length of the laminar region in the uncontrolled case.},

  abstract = {The interaction of stationary streaks undergoing non-modal growth with modally unstable instability waves in a high Mach number boundary-layer flow is studied using numerical computations. The geometry and flow conditions are selected to match a relevant trajectory location from the ascent phase of the HIFiRE-1 flight experiment; namely, a 7{$\smwhtcircle$} half-angle, circular cone with 2.5 mm nose radius, free-stream Mach number equal to 5.30, unit Reynolds number equal to 13.42 m-1 and wall-to-adiabatic temperature ratio of approximately 0.35 over most of the vehicle. This paper investigates the nonlinear evolution of initially linear optimal disturbances that evolve into finite-amplitude streaks, followed by an analysis of the modal instability characteristics of the perturbed, streaky boundary-layer flow. The investigation is performed with a stationary, full Navier\textendash Stokes equations solver and the plane-marching parabolized stability equations (PSE), in conjunction with partial-differential-equation-based planar eigenvalue analysis. The overall effect of streaks is to reduce the peak amplification factors of instability waves, indicating a possible downstream shift in the onset of laminar\textendash turbulent transition. The present study confirms previous findings that the mean-flow distortion of the nonlinear streak perturbation reduces the amplification rates of the Mack-mode instability. More importantly, however, the present results demonstrate that the spanwise varying component of the streak can produce a larger effect on the Mack-mode amplification. The analysis of planar and oblique Mack-mode waves modulated by the presence of the streaks shows that the planar Mack mode still dominates the instability characteristics of the flow. The study with selected azimuthal wavenumbers for the stationary streaks reveals that a wavenumber of approximately 1.4 times larger than the optimal wavenumber is more effective in stabilizing the planar Mack-mode instabilities. In the absence of unstable first-mode waves for the present cold-wall condition, transition onset is expected to be delayed until the peak streak amplitude increases to nearly 35 \% of the free-stream velocity, when intrinsic instabilities of the boundary-layer streaks begin to dominate the transition process. For streak amplitudes below that limit a significant net stabilization is achieved, yielding a potential transition delay that can exceed 100 \% of the length of the laminar region in the uncontrolled case.},

As noted in previous works, the optimal initial disturbances correspond to steady counter-rotating streamwise vortices, which subsequently lead to the formation of streamwise-elongated structures, i.e., streaks, via a lift-up effect. To assess the effect of the finite-amplitude streaks on boundary layer instabilities, the plane-marching PSE are used to investigate the instability of the boundary layer flow modified by spanwise periodic streaks. Finite-amplitude streaks are known to stabilize Tollmien-Schlichting waves in the incompressible regime. Here, subcritical streaks are observed to destabilize first mode instabilities with two spanwise wavelengths of the streak while they stabilize those with three and four spanwise wavelengths. These results support the passive flow control strategy of using micro-vortex-generators for delaying transition due to oblique first mode instabilities in supersonic boundary layers.},

  abstract = {Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated that modal growth of planar Mack modes is responsible for laminar-turbulent transition on sharp cones at hypersonic speeds. However, the physical mechanisms that lead to transition onset upstream of the entropy-layer swallowing location over sufficiently blunt geometries are not well understood as yet. Modal amplification is too weak or nonexistent to initiate transition at moderate-to-large bluntness values. Nonmodal analysis shows that, with increasing nose bluntness, both planar and oblique traveling disturbances that peak within the entropy layer experience appreciable energy amplification. However, because of the relatively weak signature of the nonmodal traveling disturbances within the boundary-layer region, the route to transition onset subsequent to the nonmodal growth remains unclear. Thus, nonlinear parabolized stability equations (NPSE) and direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been used to investigate the potential transition mechanisms over a 7-degree blunt cone that was tested in the AFRL Mach-6 high-Reynoldsnumber facility. Computations are performed to separately follow the nonlinear development of two classes of inflow disturbances, namely, a pair of oblique traveling waves with equal but opposite angles with respect to the mean flow direction and a planar traveling wave. Results in both cases show an excellent agreement between the NPSE and DNS predictions, establishing that the NPSE is an accurate and efficient technique for predicting the nonlinear development for these particular nonmodal traveling disturbances. Computations reveal that the oblique mode interactions lead to the generation of stationary streaks inside the boundary layer that, in turn, facilitate the growth of a subharmonic sinuous disturbance. For relatively modest amplitudes of the inflow disturbance, the oblique-mode breakdown can lead to transition at the measured location of transition onset during the experiment. On the other hand, the nonlinear development of a planar traveling wave leads to the formation of inclined structures just above the boundary-layer edge and these structures are strongly reminiscent of the transitional events observed during blunt cone experiments by using schlieren flow visualizations.},

  abstract = {The effect of nonlinear optimal streaks on disturbance growth in a Mach 6 axisymmetric flow over a 7deg half-angle cone is investigated in an e ort to expand the range of available techniques for transition control. Plane-marching parabolized stability equations are used to characterize the boundary layer instability in the presence of azimuthally periodic streaks. The streaks are observed to stabilize nominally planar Mack mode instabilities, although oblique Mack mode disturbances are destabilized. Experimentally measured transition onset in the absence of any streaks correlates with an amplification factor of N = 6 for the planar Mack modes. For high enough streak amplitudes, the transition threshold of N = 6 is not reached by the Mack mode instabilities within the length of the cone, but subharmonic first mode instabilities, which are destabilized by the presence of the streaks, reach N = 6 near the end of the cone. These results suggest a passive flow control strategy of using micro vortex generators to induce streaks that would delay transition in hypersonic boundary layers.},

  abstract = {The linear stability of high-speed boundary layers can be altered by distortions to the base velocity and temperature profiles. An analytic expression for the sensitivity is derived for parallel and spatially developing boundary layers, the latter using linear parabolized stability equations and their adjoint. Both the slow mode, S, and the fast mode, F, are investigated at Mach number 4.5. The mode S is more sensitive with respect to distortion in base velocity than in base temperature. The sensitivity is largest within the boundary layer away from the wall. Near the critical layer, where the phase speed of the mode equals the base streamwise velocity, the sensitivity to the base streamwise velocity is negative. For the mode F, there is a discontinuous jump in the sensitivity when the phase speed is below unity, and a critical layer is established. The sensitivity of the two modes increases with the Reynolds number, but there is a sudden drop and a jump in the sensitivities of the modes S and F, respectively, near the synchronization point where the phase speeds of the two modes are equal. Furthermore, the maximum uncertainty bounds are obtained for the distorted base state that maximizes the destabilization or stabilization of the modes by solving the Lagrangian optimization problem for the sensitivity. The sensitivity of the flow stability to surface heating is then studied, and changes in growth rate and the  \$N\$ -factor are evaluated. The formulation provides a clear physical interpretation of these changes, and establishes uncertainty bounds for stability predictions for a given level of uncertainty in wall temperature.},

  abstract = {Extreme events in society and nature, such as pandemic spikes, rogue waves or structural failures, can have catastrophic consequences. Characterizing extremes is difficult, as they occur rarely, arise from seemingly benign conditions, and belong to complex and often unknown infinite-dimensional systems. Such challenges render attempts at characterizing them moot. We address each of these difficulties by combining output-weighted training schemes in Bayesian experimental design (BED) with an ensemble of deep neural operators. This model-agnostic framework pairs a BED scheme that actively selects data for quantifying extreme events with an ensemble of deep neural operators that approximate infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators. We show that not only does this framework outperform Gaussian processes, but that (1) shallow ensembles of just two members perform best; (2) extremes are uncovered regardless of the state of the initial data (that is, with or without extremes); (3) our method eliminates `double-descent' phenomena; (4) the use of batches of suboptimal acquisition samples compared to step-by-step global optima does not hinder BED performance; and (5) Monte Carlo acquisition outperforms standard optimizers in high dimensions. Together, these conclusions form a scalable artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted experimental infrastructure that can efficiently infer and pinpoint critical situations across many domains, from physical to societal systems.},

  abstract = {Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows. To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field. In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations. We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90\% agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response. We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one. In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies.},

The linear stability of this base flow is analyzed by means of the so-called ``biglobal'' stability approach. Three-dimensional eigenmodes are found, which are shown to be the continuation of the Tollmien\textendash Schlichting waves present in the case of an unperturbed boundary layer. Moreover, a stabilizing effect due to the roughness-induced vortices is found. A Direct Numerical Simulation of the interaction between a two-dimensional Tollmien\textendash Schlichting wave and the roughness array is also performed.

The approximations stem from application of standard central difference formulas to split forms of the convective terms in the compressible Euler equations, which guarantee strong numerical stability and (near) energy preservation in the inviscid limit. A convenient implementation of the high-order fluxes is suggested, which guarantees improved computational efficiency over existing methods. Numerical tests performed for isotropic turbulence at zero viscosity show stability of schemes with order of accuracy up to ten, and effectiveness of convective splitting of Kennedy and Gruber (2008) [2] in providing extra stability in the presence of strong density variations. Numerical simulations of compressible turbulent boundary layer flow indicate suitability of the method for non-uniform grids, and overall support superior computational efficiency of high-order schemes.},

Ideal numerical methods should be accurate and free from numerical dissipation in smooth parts of the flow, and at the same time they must robustly capture shock waves without significant Gibbs ringing, which may lead to nonlinear instability. Adapting to these conflicting goals leads to the design of strongly nonlinear numerical schemes that depend on the geometrical properties of the solution. For low-dissipation methods for smooth flows, numerical stability can be based on physical conservation principles for kinetic energy and/or entropy. Shock-capturing requires the addition of artificial dissipation, in more or less explicit form, as a surrogate for physical viscosity, to obtain nonoscillatory transitions. Methods suitable for both smooth and shocked flows are discussed, and the potential for hybridization is highlighted. Examples of the application of advanced algorithms to DNS/LES of turbulent, compressible flows are presented.},

  abstract = {We review numerical methods for DNS and LES of turbulent compressible flow in the presence of shock waves. Ideal numerical methods should be accurate and free from numerical dissipation in smooth parts of the flow, and, at the same time, they must robustly capture shock waves without significant Gibbs ringing, which may lead to nonlinear instability. Adapting to these conflicting goals leads to the design of strongly nonlinear numerical schemes that depend on the geometrical properties of the solution. For low-dissipation methods for smooth flows, numerical stability can be based on physical conservation principles for kinetic energy and/or entropy. Shock-capturing requires addition of artificial dissipation, in more or less explicit form, as a surrogate of physical viscosity, to obtain non-oscillatory transitions. Methods suitable for both smooth and shocked flows are discussed, and the potential for hybridization is highlighted. Examples of the application of advanced algorithms to DNS/LES of turbulent, compressible flows are presented.},

Our approach rather relies on a skew-symmetriclike splitting of the convective derivatives, that guarantees preservation of kinetic energy in the semi-discrete, low-Mach-number limit. A locally conservative formulation allows efficient implementation and easy incorporation into existing compressible flow solvers. The validity of the approach is tested for benchmark flow cases, including the propagation of a cylindrical vortex, and the head-on collision of two vortex dipoles. The tests support high accuracy and superior stability over conventional central discretization of the convective derivatives.

  abstract = {Bicoherence analysis is a well established method for identifying the quadratic nonlinearity of stationary processes. However, it is often applied without checking the basic assumptions of stationarity and convergence. The classic bicoherence, unfortunately, tends to give false positives \textendash{} high bicoherence values without actual nonlinear coupling of different frequency components \textendash{} for signals exhibiting rapidly changing amplitudes and limited length. The effect of false positive values can lead to misinterpretation of results, therefore a more prudent analysis is necessary in such cases. This paper analyses the properties of bispectrum and bicoherence in detail, generalizing these quantities to nonstationary processes. A step-by-step method is proposed to filter out false positives at a given confidence level for the case of nonstationary signals. We present a number of test cases, where the method is demonstrated on simple physics-based numerical systems. The approach and methodology introduced in the paper can be generalized to lower and higher order coherence calculations.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict boundary layer transition locations accurately on turbomachinery airfoils is critical both to evaluate aerodynamic performance and to predict local heat-transfer coefficients with accuracy. In state-of-the-art Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations used to predict flowfields on turbomachinery airfoils, boundary layers are often assumed to be turbulent over the entire airfoil surface. Consequently, losses are not accurately predicted, particularly in the case of stalled airfoils. Here we report on an effort to include empirical transition models developed in Part I of this report in a RANS solver. To validate the new models, a two-dimensional design optimization was performed to obtain a pair of Low-Pressure Turbine (LPT) airfoils with the objective of increasing airfoil loading by 25\%. Subsequent experimental testing of the resulting two new airfoils confirmed pre-test predictions of both high and low Reynolds number loss levels. In addition, the accuracy of the new transition modeling capability was benchmarked with a number of legacy cascade and LPT rig data sets. Good agreement between measured and predicted profile losses was found in both cascade and rig environments. However, use of the transition modeling capability has elucidated deficiencies in typical RANS simulations that are conducted to predict component performance. Efficiency-versus-span comparisons between rig data and multi-stage steady and time-accurate LPT simulation results indicate that loss levels in the endwall regions are significantly under-predicted. Possible causes for the under-predicted endwall losses are discussed as well as suggestions for future improvements that would make RANSbased transitional simulations more accurate.},

  abstract = {Global stability modes of flows provide significant insight into their dynamics. Direct methods to obtain these modes are restricted by the daunting sizes and complexity of Jacobians encountered in general three-dimensional flows. Jacobian-free approaches have greatly alleviated the required computational burden. Particularly, the most common Arnoldi-based methods obtain the desired subset of the eigenmodes by considering Jacobian-vector products to create a smaller iterative subspace, instead of working with the Jacobian itself. However, operations such as orthonormalization and shift-and-invert transformation of matrices with appropriate shift guesses can introduce computational and parameter-dependent costs that inhibit their routine application to general three-dimensional flowfields. Further, in time-stepper type approaches, where the linearized perturbation snapshots directly obtained from an aerodynamic code are treated as Jacobian-vector products, the inversion operation necessitates use of approximate iterative linear solvers with several parameters. The present work addresses these limitations by proposing and implementing a robust, generalizable approach to extract the principal global modes, suited for curvilinear coordinates as well as the effects of compressibility. Accurate linearized perturbation snapshots are obtained using high-order schemes by leveraging the same non-linear Navier-Stokes code as used to obtain the basic state by appropriately constraining the equations using a body-force. The forcing includes not only that required to obtain the products, but also to ensure that the basic state does not drift.},

The resulting Parabolized Floquet Equations (PFE) can be conveniently advanced downstream to examine the interaction between different modes in slowly varying shear flows. We apply our framework to two canonical settings of transition in boundary layers; the H-type transition scenario that is initiated by exponential instabilities, and streamwise elongated laminar streaks that are triggered by the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the PFE capture the growth of various harmonics and provide excellent agreement with the results obtained in direct numerical simulations and in experiments.},

Stochastic forcing is used to model the effect of free-stream turbulence that enters at various wall-normal locations and the fluctuation dynamics are studied via linearized models that arise from locally parallel and global perspectives. In contrast to the widely used resolvent analysis that quantifies the amplification of deterministic disturbances at a given temporal frequency, our approach examines the steady-state response to stochastic excitation that is uncorrelated in time. In addition to stochastic forcing with identity covariance, we utilize the spatial spectrum of homogeneous isotropic turbulence to model the effect of free-stream turbulence. Even though locally parallel analysis does not account for the effect of the spatially evolving base flow, we demonstrate that it captures the essential mechanisms and the prevailing length-scales in stochastically forced boundary layer flows. On the other hand, global analysis, which accounts for the spatially evolving nature of the boundary layer flow, predicts the amplification of a cascade of streamwise scales throughout the streamwise domain. We show that the flow structures that can be extracted from a modal decomposition of the resulting velocity covariance matrix, can be closely captured by conducting locally parallel analysis at various streamwise locations and over different wall-parallel wavenumber pairs. Our approach does not rely on costly stochastic simulations and it provides insight into mechanisms for perturbation growth including the interaction of the slowly varying base flow with streaks and Tollmien-Schlichting waves.},

  abstract = {In recent work it has been shown that there can be substantial transient growth in the energy of small perturbations to plane Poiseuille and Couette flows if the Reynolds number is below the critical value predicted by linear stability analysis. This growth, which may be as large as               O               (1000), occurs in the absence of nonlinear effects and can be explained by the non-normality of the governing linear operator - that is, the non-orthogonality of the associated eigenfunctions. In this paper we study various aspects of this energy growth for two- and three-dimensional Poiseuille and Couette flows using energy methods, linear stability analysis, and a direct numerical procedure for computing the transient growth. We examine conditions for no energy growth, the dependence of the growth on the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers, the time dependence of the growth, and the effects of degenerate eigenvalues. We show that the maximum transient growth behaves like               O               (               R               2               ), where               R               is the Reynolds number. We derive conditions for no energy growth by applying the Hille\textendash Yosida theorem to the governing linear operator and show that these conditions yield the same results as those derived by energy methods, which can be applied to perturbations of arbitrary amplitude. These results emphasize the fact that subcritical transition can occur for Poiseuille and Couette flows because the governing linear operator is non-normal.},

Even though such large operator is required in the analysis, most applications of resolvent analysis extracts only a few dominant resolvent response and forcing modes. Here, we consider the use of randomized numerical linear algebra to reduce the dimension of the resolvent operator for achieving computational speed up and memory saving compared to the standard resolvent analysis. To accomplish this goal, we utilize sketching of the linear operator with random test matrices with a Gaussian distribution and with insights from the base flow incorporated to perform singular value decomposition on a low-rank matrix holding dominant characteristics of the full resolvent operator. The strength of the randomized resolvent analysis is demonstrated on a turbulent separated flow over an airfoil. This randomized approach clears the path towards tackling resolvent analysis for higher-Reynolds number bi- and tri-global base flows.},

Building on the methodology from Part 1, we leverage the ability of the projection-based formulation of the one-way Navier-Stokes equations (OWNS) to efficiently and accurately approximate the downstream response of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations to forcing for problems containing a slowly varying direction. Using an adjoint-based optimization framework, forcings that optimally excite a response in the flow are computed by marching the forward and adjoint OWNS equations in the downstream and upstream directions, respectively. This avoids the need to solve direct and adjoint globally-discretized equations, therefore bypassing the main computational bottleneck of a typical global resolvent calculation. The method is demonstrated for a supersonic turbulent jet at Mach 1.5 and a transitional zero-pressure-gradient flatplate boundary layer flow at Mach 4.5, and the optimal OWNS results are validated against corresponding global calculations.},

Forcing mechanisms that maximize the drag are calculated using a gradient-based ascent algorithm. By including nonlinearity in the analysis, the proposed frequency-domain framework identifies the worst-case disturbances for laminar-turbulent transition. We demonstrate the framework on a flat-plate boundary layer by considering three-dimensional spanwise-periodic perturbations triggered by a few optimal forcing modes of finite amplitude. Two types of volumetric forcing are considered, one corresponding to a single frequency/spanwise-wavenumber pair, and a multi-harmonic where a harmonic frequency and wavenumber are also added. Depending on the forcing strategy, we recover a range of transition scenarios associated with K-type and H-type mechanisms, including oblique and Tollmien-Schlichting waves, streaks and their breakdown. We show that nonlinearity plays a critical role in optimizing growth by combining and redistributing energy between the linear mechanisms and the higher perturbation harmonics. With a very limited range of frequencies and wavenumbers, the calculations appear to reach the early stages of the turbulent regime through the generation and breakdown of hairpin and quasi-streamwise staggered vortices.},

For this investigation the existing two-dimensional wind tunnel model, PaLASTra, which offers a quasi-uniform streamwise pressure gradient, was modified to reduce the size of the flow separation region at its trailing edge. The streamwise temperature distribution and the location of laminar\textendash turbulent transition were measured by means of temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) with a higher accuracy than attained in earlier measurements. It was found that for the modified PaLASTra model the transition Reynolds number ({$\mkern1mu$}Retr{$\mkern1mu$}) exhibits a linear dependence on the pressure gradient, characterized by H12{$\mkern1mu$}. Due to this linear relation it was possible to quantify the so-called `unit Reynolds number effect', which is an increase of Retr with Re1{$\mkern1mu$}. By a systematic variation of M, Re1 and H12 in combination with a spectral analysis of freestream disturbances, a stabilizing effect of compressibility on boundary layer transition, as predicted by linear stability theory, was detected (`Mach number effect'). Furthermore, two expressions were derived which can be used to calculate the transition Reynolds number as a function of the amplitude of total pressure fluctuations, Re1 and H12{$\mkern1mu$}. To determine critical N-factors, the measured transition locations were correlated with amplification rates, calculated by incompressible and compressible linear stability theory. By taking into account the spectral level of total pressure fluctuations at the frequency of the most amplified Tollmien\textendash Schlichting wave at transition location, the scatter in the determined critical N-factors was reduced. Furthermore, the receptivity coefficients dependence on incidence angle of acoustic waves was used to correct the determined critical N-factors. Thereby, a found dependency of the determined critical N-factors on H12 decreased, leading to an average critical N-factor of about 9.5 with a standard deviation of {$\approx$} 0.8.},

  abstract = {The stability of a hypersonic boundary layer for a 5{$\smwhtcircle$} half-angle cone at the Caltech T5 high-enthalpy flow conditions was investigated using direct numerical simulations. For the `linear' stability investigations, the boundary layer was perturbed by small axisymmetric disturbances with very small amplitudes, and for the nonlinear regime, three-dimensional pulse disturbances with larger amplitudes were introduced. The surprising result from these investigations was that the 3D wave packet undergoes strong spatial modulations, which we have not observed for other experimental conditions (e.g. the Purdue BAM6QT). This modulation was found to be directly due to the synchronization between second-mode wave components and vorticity/entropy modes. Furthermore, it was found that a synchronization with slow acoustic waves leads to a sudden and strong emission of acoustic waves deep into the free stream, which was observed for both a linear wave train and a 3D nonlinear wave packet. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is a linear mechanism that is not suppressed by nonlinear effects.},

  abstract = {To identify the mechanism triggering boundary layer transition on a spherical forebody of an Apollo type re-entry capsule direct numerical simulations of perturbed flow are analyzed. The perturbations are generated by deterministic distributed surface roughnesses that resemble model surface imperfections that are mounted on a capsule model and are experimentally investigated in Radespiel et al. [J. Spacecr. Rockets 56, 405 (2019)]. Therein, the role of distributed roughness in the transition scenario was highlighted but the mechanism remained unclear. In this manuscript, the sensitivity of the flow perturbations with respect to the roughness layout is investigated. The great span of spatial scales, i.e., capsule diameter, boundary layer thickness, and micro-size roughness, define the requirements of the numerical method. Modifications to a finite-volume unstructured Cartesian cut-cell method to meet these requirements are presented. The receptivity of the capsule boundary layer to the roughness and the subsequent disturbance growth are analyzed. The roughness properties at the most downstream position govern the flow perturbation. The impact of the streamwise character of the roughness layout is intensified by increasing the Reynolds number of the flow. The growth mechanism is identified as transient growth and the most amplified disturbances are compared to the results of optimal transient growth theory. Streamwise vortices cause growth via the lift-up effect. However, the wall normal scales of optimal and roughness induced disturbance differ significantly leading to suboptimal growth.},

It adopts an optimization-based point of view, formulating common concepts such as stability and receptivity in terms of a cost functional to be optimized subject to constraints given by the governing equations. This approach differs significantly from eigenvalue-based methods that cover the time-asymptotic limit for stability problems or the resonant limit for receptivity problems. Formal substitution of the solution operator for linear time-invariant systems results in the matrix exponential norm and the resolvent norm as measures to assess the optimal response to initial conditions or external harmonic forcing. The optimization-based approach can be extended by introducing adjoint variables that enforce governing equations and constraints. This step allows the analysis of far more general fluid systems, such as time-varying and nonlinear flows, and the investigation of wavemaker regions, structural sensitivities, and passive control strategies.},

A formulation in either time or frequency domain is sought and the resulting block-circulant global system matrix is analyzed using roots-of-unity techniques, which reduce the computational effort to only one unit while still accounting for the coupling to linked components. Modal characteristics as well as nonmodal features are treated within the same framework, as are initial-value problems and direct-adjoint looping. The simple and efficient formalism is demonstrated on selected applications, ranging from a Ginzburg-Landau equation with an n-periodic growth function to interacting wakes to incompressible flow through a linear cascade consisting of 54 blades. The techniques showcased here are readily applicable to large-scale flow configurations consisting of n-periodic arrays of identical and coupled fluid components, as can be found, for example, in turbomachinery, ring flame holders, or nozzle exit corrugations. Only minor corrections to existing solvers have to be implemented to allow this present type of analysis.},

  abstract = {Triadic interactions are the fundamental mechanism of energy transfer in fluid flows. This work introduces bispectral mode decomposition as a direct means of educing flow structures that are associated with triadic interactions from experimental or numerical data. Triadic interactions are characterized by quadratic phase coupling which can be detected by the bispectrum. The proposed method maximizes an integral measure of this third-order statistic to compute modes associated with frequency triads, as well as a mode bispectrum that identifies resonant three-wave interactions. Unlike the classical bispectrum, the decomposition establishes a causal relationship between the three frequency components of a triad. This permits the distinction of sumand difference-interactions, and the computation of interaction maps that indicate regions of nonlinear coupling. Three examples highlight different aspects of the method. Cascading triads and their regions of interaction are educed from direct numerical simulation data of laminar cylinder flow. It is further demonstrated that linear instability mechanisms that attain an appreciable amplitude are revealed indirectly by their difference-self-interactions. Applicability to turbulent flows and noise-rejection are demonstrated on particle image velocimetry data of a massively separated wake. The generation of sub- and ultraharmonics in large eddy simulation data of a transitional jet is explained by extending the method to cross-bispectral information.},

Spectral (frequency-space) proper orthogonal decomposition is used to extract energy spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked coherent structures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent analysis. Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode numbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank response characterized by Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular shear layer up to the end of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the very-near-nozzle shear layer. These modes too have been experimentally observed before and predicted by quasi-parallel stability theory and other approximations \textendash{} they comprise a considerable portion of the total turbulent energy. At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and again at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not low-rank, but consists of a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes, which are primarily active downstream of the potential core, are associated with the Orr mechanism. They occur also as subdominant modes in the range of frequencies dominated by the KH response. Our global analysis helps tie together previous observations based on local spatial stability theory, and explains why quasi-parallel predictions were successful at some frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers, but failed at others.},

The flow is harmonically forced, and global modes are extracted through a spectral decomposition. Spatial amplification in the near-corner region is observed even though the flow is shown to be subcritical in terms of spatial linear theory. This apparent discrepancy is resolved by extending the local analysis to include non-modal effects. It is demonstrated that the amplification is a result of the interaction between two coexistent spatial transient growth processes that can be associated with different parts of the linear stability spectrum. A detailed investigation of the underlying mechanisms shows that the transient amplification behaviour is caused by pseudo-resonance between the inviscid corner mode, and different sets of viscous modes. By comparison with studies of other locally inflectional flows, it is found that viscid\textendash inviscid pseudo-resonance might be a general phenomenon leading to selective noise amplification.},

  abstract = {High-speed turbulent flows are encountered in most space-related applications (including exploration, tourism and defense fields) and represent a subject of growing interest in the last decades. A major challenge in performing high-fidelity simulations of such flows resides in the stringent requirements for the numerical schemes to be used. These must be robust enough to handle strong, unsteady discontinuities, while ensuring low amounts of intrinsic dissipation in smooth flow regions. Furthermore, the wide range of temporal and spatial active scales leads to concurrent needs for numerical stabilization and accurate representation of the smallest resolved flow scales in cases of under-resolved configurations. In this paper, we present a finite-difference high-order shock-capturing technique based on Jameson's artificial diffusivity methodology. The resulting scheme is ninth-order-accurate far from discontinuities and relies on the addition of artificial dissipation close to large gradients. The shock detector is slightly revised to enhance its selectivity and avoid spurious activations of the shock-capturing term. A suite of test cases ranging from 1D to 3D configurations (namely, shock tubes, Shu-Osher problem, isentropic vortex advection, under-expanded jet, compressible TaylorGreen Vortex, supersonic and hypersonic turbulent boundary layers) is analysed in order to test the capability of the proposed numerical strategy to handle a large variety of problems, ranging from calorically-perfect air to multi-species reactive flows. Results obtained on under-resolved grids are also considered to test the applicability of the proposed strategy in the context of implicit Large-Eddy Simulations.},

  abstract = {We study and compare instability mechanisms of a Mach 5.65 laminar boundary layer tripped by an isolated diamond-shaped trip and by an array of diamond-shaped trips using direct numerical simulations. A low-Reynolds-number experiment, consisting of the trip array (Semper \& Bowersox, AIAA J., vol. 55 (3), 2017, pp.~808\textendash 817), is used to validate our simulations. Three dynamically prominent flow structures are observed in both trip configurations. These flow structures are the upstream vortex system, the shock system, and the downstream shear layers/counter-rotating streamwise vortices that originate from the top and sides of the trips. Analysis of the power spectral density of pressure reveals the source of instability to be an interaction between the shear layers and the counter-rotating streamwise vortices downstream of both trip configurations. The interaction leads to the formation of hairpin-like structures that eventually break down to turbulent flow. This finding contrasts with that of an isolated cylindrical trip (Subbareddy et~al., J. Fluid Mech., vol.~748, 2014, pp.~848\textendash 878) where the upstream vortex system is found to be the source of instability. Therefore, the shape of a trip plays an important role in the instability mechanism. Furthermore, dynamic mode decomposition (Rowley et~al., J. Fluid Mech., vol.~641, 2009, pp.~115\textendash 127; Schmid, J. Fluid Mech., vol.~656, 2010, pp.~5\textendash 28) of three-dimensional snapshots of pressure fluctuations unveil globally dominant modes consistent with the power spectral density analysis in both diamond-shaped trip configurations.},

Here, we investigate the use of DeepONets to infer flow fields around unseen airfoils with the aim of shape optimization, an important design problem in aerodynamics that typically taxes computational resources heavily. We present results which display little to no degradation in prediction accuracy, while reducing the online optimization cost by orders of magnitude. We consider NACA airfoils as a test case for our proposed approach, as their shape can be easily defined by the four-digit parametrization. We successfully optimize the constrained NACA four-digit problem with respect to maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio and validate all results by comparing them to a high-order CFD solver. We find that DeepONets have low generalization error, making them ideal for generating solutions of unseen shapes. Specifically, pressure, density, and velocity fields are accurately inferred at a fraction of a second, hence enabling the use of general objective functions beyond the maximization of the lift-to-drag ratio considered in the current work.},

GOUPDRP finite difference schemes can automatically resolve waves with much shorter wavelengths and need not consider the filter or the explicit dissipation terms, and have much smaller dispersive and dissipative errors. Recently, GOUPDRP schemes on the non-uniform Cartesian meshes have been developed and tested by authors of this paper, others optimized upwind finite schemes just only on the uniform Cartesian grids also have been investigated; nevertheless, practical problems existing in aeroacoustics are unusually restricted to the uniform or non-uniform Cartesian grids, the corresponding computational grids could be curvilinear ones owing to the different complex geometries. In contrast to other optimized upwind schemes on the uniform Cartesian grids, GOUPDRP schemes can be easily extended to the curvilinear meshes. In order to determine the optimization coefficients of GOUPDRP schemes on the curvilinear grids, a general curvilinear transformation is introduced from physical domain to computational domain. Mathematic formulations related to GOUPDRP schemes on the curvilinear meshes are also derived in detail in the paper. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GOUPDRP schemes, benchmark problems are solved using the curvilinear grids; calculated solutions are compared with their analytical counterparts. Numerical results show that GOUPDRP schemes on the curvilinear grids are highly efficient and relatively potential to solve practical problems in aeroacoustics.},

Linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) are used in the calculations to account for the non-parallel base flow. By exploiting the symmetries of the mean flow due to the regular arrangement of serrations, we obtain a series of coupled two-dimensional PSE problems from the original three-dimensional problem. This reduces the solution cost and manifests the symmetries of the stability modes. In the parallel-flow linear stability theory (LST) calculations that are performed near the nozzle to initiate the PSE, we find that the serrated nozzle reduces the growth rates of the most unstable eigenmodes of the jet, but their phase speeds are approximately similar. We obtain encouraging validation of our linear PSE instability wave results               vis-\`a-vis               near-field hydrodynamic pressure data acquired on a phased microphone array in experiments, after filtering the latter with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to extract the energetically dominant coherent part. Additionally, a large-eddy simulation database of the same serrated jet is investigated, and its POD-filtered pressure field is found to compare favourably with the corresponding PSE solution within the jet plume. We conclude that the coherent hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations of jets from both round and serrated nozzles are reasonably consistent with the linear instability modes of the turbulent mean flow.},

  abstract = {This review article addresses the dynamics and control of low-frequency unsteadiness, as observed in some aerodynamic applications. It presents a coherent and rigorous linearized approach, which enables both to describe the dynamics of commonly encountered open-flows and to design open-loop and closed-loop control strategies, in view of suppressing or delaying instabilities. The approach is global in the sense that both cross-stream and streamwise directions are discretized in the evolution operator. New light will therefore be shed on the streamwise properties of open-flows. In the case of oscillator flows, the unsteadiness is due to the existence of unstable global modes, i.e., unstable eigenfunctions of the linearized Navier\textendash Stokes operator. The influence of nonlinearities on the dynamics is studied by deriving nonlinear amplitude equations, which accurately describe the dynamics of the flow in the vicinity of the bifurcation threshold. These equations also enable us to analyze the mean flow induced by the nonlinearities as well as the stability properties of this flow. The open-loop control of unsteadiness is then studied by a sensitivity analysis of the eigenvalues with respect to base-flow modifications. With this approach, we manage to a priori identify regions of the flow where a small control cylinder suppresses unsteadiness. Then, a closed-loop control approach was implemented for the case of an unstable open-cavity flow. We have combined model reduction techniques and optimal control theory to stabilize the unstable eigenvalues. Various reduced-order-models based on global modes, proper orthogonal decomposition modes, and balanced modes were tested and evaluated according to their ability to reproduce the input-output behavior between the actuator and the sensor. Finally, we consider the case of noise-amplifiers, such as boundary-layer flows and jets, which are stable when viewed in a global framework. The importance of the singular value decomposition of the global resolvent will be highlighted in order to understand the frequency selection process in such flows.},

He observed, thanks to a global mode analysis, that the mean flow is marginally stable and that the eigenfrequencies associated with the global modes of the mean flow fit the Strouhal to Reynolds experimental function well in the range 46 {$<$}               Re               {$<$} 180. The aim of this article is to give a theoretical proof of this result near the bifurcation. For this, we do a global weakly nonlinear analysis valid in the vicinity of the critical Reynolds number                                Re                 c                              based on the small parameter {$\epsilon$} =                                Re                 c                              -1               -               Re               -1               {$\ll$} 1. We compute numerically the complex constants {$\lambda$} and {$\mu{'}$} which appear in the Stuart-Landau amplitude equation: d               A               /d               t               = {$\epsilon$} {$\lambda$}               A               - {$\epsilon\mu{'}$}               A               |               A               |               2               . Here               A               is the scalar complex amplitude of the critical global mode. By analysing carefully the nonlinear interactions yielding the term {$\mu{'}$}, we show for the cylinder flow that the mean flow is approximately marginally stable and that the linear dynamics of the mean flow yields the frequency of the saturated Stuart-Landau limit cycle. We will finally show that these results are not general, by studying the case of the bifurcation of an open cavity flow. In particular, we show that the mean flow in this case remains strongly unstable and that the frequencies associated with the eigenmodes do not exactly match those of the nonlinear unsteady periodic cavity flow. It will be demonstrated that two precise conditions must hold for a linear stability analysis of a mean flow to be relevant and useful.},

  abstract = {Compressible flow varies from ideal-gas behavior at high pressures where molecular interactions become important. Density is described through a cubic equation of state while enthalpy and sound speed are functions of both temperature and pressure, based on two parameters, A and B, related to intermolecular attraction and repulsion, respectively. Assuming small variations from ideal-gas behavior, a closed-form solution is obtained that is valid over a wide range of conditions. An expansion in these molecular-interaction parameters simplifies relations for flow variables, elucidating the role of molecular repulsion and attraction in variations from ideal-gas behavior. Real-gas modifications in density, enthalpy, and sound speed for a given pressure and temperature lead to variations in many basic compressible flow configurations. Sometimes, the variations can be substantial in quantitative or qualitative terms. The new approach is applied to choked-nozzle flow, isentropic flow, nonlinear-wave propagation, and flow across a shock wave, all for the real gas. Modifications are obtained for allowable mass-flow through a choked nozzle, nozzle thrust, sonic wave speed, Riemann invariants, Prandtl's shock relation, and the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Forced acoustic oscillations can show substantial augmentation of pressure amplitudes when real-gas effects are taken into account. Shocks at higher temperatures and pressures can have larger pressure jumps with real-gas effects. Weak shocks decay to zero strength at sonic speed. The proposed framework can rely on any cubic equation of state and be applied to multicomponent flows or to more-complex flow configurations.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) were performed to investigate the laminar\textendash turbulent transition in a boundary layer on a sharp cone with an isothermal wall at Mach 6 and at zero angle of attack. The motivation for this research is to make a contribution towards understanding the nonlinear stages of transition and the final breakdown to turbulence in hypersonic boundary layers. In particular, the role of second-mode fundamental resonance, or (K-type) breakdown, is investigated using high-resolution `controlled' transition simulations. The simulations were carried out for the laboratory conditions of the hypersonic transition experiments conducted at Purdue University. First, several low-resolution simulations were carried out to explore the parameter space for fundamental resonance in order to identify the cases that result in strong nonlinear interactions. Subsequently, based on the results from this study, a set of highly resolved simulations that proceed deep into the turbulent breakdown region have been performed. The nonlinear interactions observed during the breakdown process are discussed in detail in this paper. A detailed description of the flow structures that arise due to these nonlinear interactions is provided and an analysis of the skin friction and heat transfer development during the breakdown is presented. The controlled transition simulations clearly demonstrate that fundamental breakdown may indeed be a viable path to complete breakdown to turbulence in hypersonic cone boundary layers at Mach 6.},

  abstract = {The recently developed essentially fourth-order or higher low dissipative shock-capturing scheme of Yee, Sandham and Djomehri (1999) aimed at minimizing numerical dissipations for high speed compressible viscous ows containing shocks, shears and turbulence. To detect non smooth behavior and control the amount of numerical dissipation to be added, Yee et al. employed an arti cial compression method (ACM) of Harten (1978) but utilize it in an entirely di erent context than Harten originally intended. The ACM sensor consists of two tuning parameters and is highly physical problem dependent. To minimize the tuning of parameters and physical problem dependence, new sensors with improved detection properties are proposed. The new sensors are derived from utilizing appropriate non-orthogonal wavelet basis functions and they can be used to completely switch o the extra numerical dissipation outside shock layers. The non-dissipative spatial base scheme of arbitrarily high order of accuracy can be maintained without compromising its stability at all parts of the domain where the solution is smooth. Two types of redundant non-orthogonal wavelet basis functions are considered. One is the B-spline wavelet (Mallat \& Zhong 1992 ) used by Gerritsen and Olsson (1996) in an adaptive mesh re nement method, to determine regions where re nement should be done. The other is the modi cation of the multiresolution method of Harten (1995) by converting it to a new, redundant, non-orthogonal wavelet. The wavelet sensor is then obtained by computing the estimated Lipschitz exponent of a chosen physical quantity (or vector) to be sensed on a chosen wavelet basis function. Both wavelet sensors can be viewed as dual purpose adaptive methods leading to dynamic numerical dissipation control and improved grid adaptation indicators. Consequently, they are useful not only for shock-turbulence computations but also for computational aeroacoustics and numerical combustion. In addition, these sensors are scheme independent and can be stand alone options for numerical algorithm other than the Yee et al. scheme.},

  abstract = {This is an attempt to clarify and size up the many levels possible for the numerical prediction of a turbulent flow, the target being a complete airplane, turbine, or car. Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate reflection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier\textendash Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed ``VLES'', ``URANS'' and ``DES''. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for bluff-body and similar flows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy demands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage. (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid refinement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some approaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very fine; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaffordable. Their empirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are offered of the grid resolution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.},

Three flow conditions, corresponding to experiments conducted at the Purdue Mach 6 quiet wind tunnel are simulated. Solutions are obtained using a high-order, low-dissipation scheme for the convection terms in the Navier\textendash Stokes equations. The lowest Reynolds number ( ) case is steady, whereas the two higher cases break down to a quasi-turbulent state. Statistics from the highest case show the presence of a wedge of fully developed turbulent flow towards the end of the domain. The simulations do not employ forcing of any kind, apart from the roughness element itself, and the results suggest a self-sustaining mechanism that causes the flow to transition at a sufficiently large Reynolds number. Statistics, including spectra, are compared with available experimental data. Visualizations of the flow explore the dominant and dynamically significant flow structures: the upstream shock system, the horseshoe vortices formed in the upstream separated boundary layer and the shear layer that separates from the top and sides of the cylindrical roughness element.

  abstract = {A facility was built to investigate shock trains in a rectangular duct. A throttle valve, installed downstream of the diffuser, was used to create a hack pressure and hence a shock train, thus simulating the process that occurs in a ramjet engine. Results are presented for shock trains in a duct with a rectangular cross section. The shock train length is correlated to the conditions at the start of the shock train and the pressure rise achieved through the shock system. Two different step heights were used to determine the effect that the scramjet injectors will have on the ramjet isolator performance. Instream pitot and cone static pressure surveys were made downstream of the shock train.},

  abstract = {In this research, we study the general form of the Navier-Stokes equations in arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system which it is the governing equation of fluid flow. We often found that some engineering or applied sciences problems are in complex geometries domain such as irregular or infinite which it is not easy to solve their problems. Most Researchers will be transform into a domain that is easy to calculate, such as rectangle domain for the flow in two dimensions or rectangular shape domain for the flow in three dimensions. This makes it easy to calculate the basic parameters of the problem, such as speed, pressure and so on. Therefore, the main purpose of this work discusses the detailed transformation of the Navier-Stokes equations in curvilinear coordinate systems. In addition, we write the code in symbolic computation for the transformation by Maple Software. The Maple software was used to perform calculate all operators of scalar, vector and tensor quantities in the Navier-Stokes equations. The program for transformation the Navier-Stokes equations in orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems was obtained.},

  abstract = {Transitional boundary layer flows on a flat plate, subjected to different freestream turbulence intensities, have been investigated experimentally in details. The inlet freestream turbulence levels were varied from 1.5 to 4.4 per cent using different circular bar grids of various sizes installed upstream in a proper distance from the plate leading edge. A single hot-wire probe was used for the measurements of instantaneous flow velocities within the boundary layer. Longitudinal and vertical movements of the hot-wire probe were performed by a twocomponent traversing device, which was itself controlled by a computerized system. Experiments were conducted in an open circuit wind tunnel of suction type. For each level of freestream turbulence, boundary-layer surveys of the mean longitudinal velocity and root mean square of the velocity fluctuations were obtained at several streamwise locations. Experimental results were used to determine the variations of streamwise skin-friction coefficient and the boundarylayer shape factor versus the local Reynolds number. Evaluation of the final results showed that increasing the freestream turbulence intensity causes the transitional region to shrink and to shift up-stream. Current experimental results together with reliable data presented by other researchers led to propose a new correlation capable of predicting the onset of transition for a wide range of freestream turbulence intensities.},

  abstract = {Simple aerodynamic configurations under even modest conditions can exhibit complex flows with a wide range of temporal and spatial features. It has become common practice in the analysis of these flows to look for and extract physically important features, or modes, as a first step in the analysis. This step typically starts with a modal decomposition of an experimental or numerical dataset of the flow field, or of an operator relevant to the system. We describe herein some of the dominant techniques for accomplishing these modal decompositions and analyses that have seen a surge of activity in recent decades. For a non-expert, keeping track of recent developments can be daunting, and the intent of this document is to provide an introduction to modal analysis that is accessible to the larger fluid dynamics community. In particular, we present a brief overview of several of the well-established techniques and clearly lay the framework of these methods using familiar linear algebra. The modal analysis techniques covered in this paper include the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (Balanced POD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), Koopman analysis, global linear stability analysis, and resolvent analysis.},

  abstract = {The network of interactions among fluid elements and coherent structures gives rise to the incredibly rich dynamics of vortical flows. These interactions can be described with the use of mathematical tools from the emerging field of network science, which leverages graph theory, dynamical systems theory, data science, and control theory. The blending of network science and fluid mechanics facilitates the extraction of the key interactions and communities in terms of vortical elements, modal structures, and particle trajectories. Phasespace techniques and time-delay embedding enable a network-based analysis of time-series measurements in terms of visibility, recurrence, and cluster transitions. Equipped with the knowledge of interactions and communities, the network-theoretic approach enables the analysis, modeling, and control of fluid flows, with a particular emphasis on interactive dynamics. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to network science and an overview of the progress on network-based strategies to study the complex dynamics of fluid flows. Case studies are surveyed to highlight the utility of network-based techniques to tackle a range of problems from fluid mechanics. Towards the end of the paper, we offer an outlook on network-inspired approaches.},

  abstract = {Acoustics problems are governed by the linearized Euler equations. According to wave propagation theory, the number of wave modes and their wave propagation characteristics are all encoded in the dispersion relations of the governing equations. Thus one is assured that the numerical solutions of a high order finite difference scheme will have the same number of wave modes (namely, the acoustic, vorticity, and entropy waves), the same wave propagation characteristics (namely, nondispersive, nondissipative, and isotropic) and the same wave speeds as those of the solutions of the Euler equations if both systems of equations have the same dispersion relations. Finite difference schemes which have the same dispersion relations as the original partial differential equations are referred to as dispersion-relation-preserving (DRP) schemes. A way to construct time marching DRP schemes by optimizing the finite difference approximations of the space and time derivatives in the wave number and frequency space is proposed. The stability of these schemes is analyzed and a sufficient condition for numerical stability is established. A set of radiation and outflow boundary conditions compatible with the DRP schemes is constructed. These conditions are derived from the asymptotic solutions of the governing equations. The asymptotic solutions are found by the use of Fourier-Laplace transforms and the method of stationary phase. A sequence of numerical simulations has been carried out. These simulations are designed to test the effectiveness of the DRP schemes and the radiation and outflow boundary conditions. The computed solutions agree very favorably with the exact solutions. The radiation boundary conditions perform satisfactorily causing little acoustic reflections. The outflow boundary conditions are found to be quite transparent to outgoing disturbances even when the disturbances are made up of a combination of acoustic, vorticity, and entropy waves.},

Also, we account for curvature effects. Spatial optimal growth is studied for boundary layers over both flat and curved swept plates with adiabatic and cooled walls. We find that optimal growth increases for higher Mach numbers. In general, extensive non-modal growth is observed for all boundary layer cases even in subcritical regions, i.e. where the flow is stable with respect to modal crossflow disturbances. Wall cooling, despite stabilizing crossflow modes, destabilizes disturbances of non-modal nature. Curvature acts similarly on modal as well as nonmodal disturbances. Convex walls have a stabilizing effect on the boundary layer whereas concave walls have a destabilizing effect. The physical mechanisms of optimal growth in all studied boundary layers are found to be similar to those identified for incompressible flat-plate boundary layers.},

  abstract = {A summary is presented of physical insights gained into three-dimensional linear instability through solution of the two-dimensional partial-differential-equation-based nonsymmetric real or complex generalised eigenvalue problem. The latter governs linear development of small-amplitude disturbances upon two-dimensional steady or time-periodic essentially nonparallel basic states; on account of this property the term BiGlobal instability analysis has been introduced to discern the present from earlier global instability methodologies which are concerned with the analysis of mildly inhomogeneous two-dimensional basic flows. Alternative forms of the two-dimensional eigenvalue problem are reviewed, alongside a discussion of appropriate boundary conditions and numerical methods for the accurate and efficient recovery of the most interesting window of the global eigenspectrum. A number of paradigms of open and closed flow systems of relevance to aeronautics are then discussed in some detail. Besides demonstrating the strengths and limitations of the theory, these examples serve to demarcate the current state-of-the-art in applications of the theory to aeronautics and thus underline the steps necessary to be taken for further progress to be achieved.},

  abstract = {This article reviews linear instability analysis of flows over or through complex two-dimensional (2D) and 3D geometries. In the three decades since it first appeared in the literature, global instability analysis, based on the solution of the multidimensional eigenvalue and/or initial value problem, is continuously broadening both in scope and in depth. To date it has dealt successfully with a wide range of applications arising in aerospace engineering, physiological flows, food processing, and nuclear-reactor safety. In recent years, nonmodal analysis has complemented the more traditional modal approach and increased knowledge of flow instability physics. Recent highlights delivered by the application of either modal or nonmodal global analysis are briefly discussed. A conscious effort is made to demystify both the tools currently utilized and the jargon employed to describe them, demonstrating the simplicity of the analysis. Hopefully this will provide new impulses for the creation of next-generation algorithms capable of coping with the main open research areas in which step-change progress can be expected by the application of the theory: instability analysis of fully inhomogeneous, 3D flows and control thereof.},

  abstract = {Resolvent analysis is a powerful tool for modelling and analysing transitional and turbulent flows and, in particular, for approximating coherent flow structures. Despite recent algorithmic advances, computing resolvent modes for flows with more than one inhomogeneous spatial coordinate remains computationally expensive. In this paper we show how efficient and accurate approximations of resolvent modes can be obtained using a well-posed spatial marching method for flows that contain a slowly varying direction, i.e. one in which the mean flow changes gradually. First, we derive a well-posed and convergent one-way equation describing the downstream-travelling waves supported by the linearized Navier\textendash Stokes equations. The method is based on a projection operator that isolates downstream-travelling waves. Integrating these one-way Navier\textendash Stokes (OWNS) equations in the slowly varying direction, which requires significantly less CPU and memory resources than a direct solution of the linearized Navier\textendash Stokes equations, approximates the action of the resolvent operator on a forcing vector. Second, this capability is leveraged to compute approximate resolvent modes using an adjoint-based optimization framework in which the forward and adjoint OWNS equations are marched in the downstream and upstream directions, respectively. This avoids the need to solve direct and adjoint globally discretized equations, therefore bypassing the main computational bottleneck of a typical global resolvent calculation. The method is demonstrated using the examples of a simple acoustics problem, a Mach 1.5 turbulent jet and a Mach 4.5 transitional zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary layer. The optimal OWNS results are validated against corresponding global calculations, and the close agreement demonstrates the near-parabolic nature of these flows.},

We use a semi-discrete approach that allows the method to be applied to a wider class of problems than existing methods based on analytical factorization of idealized dispersion relations. After establishing the existence of an exact one-way equation for systems whose coefficients do not vary along the axis of integration, efficient approximations of the one-way operator are constructed by generalizing techniques previously used to create nonreflecting boundary conditions. When physically justified, the method can be applied to systems with slowly varying coefficients in the direction of integration. To demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach, the method is applied to model problems in acoustics and fluid dynamics via the linearized Euler equations; in particular we consider the scattering of sound waves from a vortex and the evolution of hydrodynamic wavepackets in a spatially evolving jet. The latter problem shows the potential of the method to offer a systematic, convergent alternative to ad hoc regularizations such as the parabolized stability equations.},

  abstract = {We consider the frequency domain form of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) called spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). Spectral POD is derived from a space-time POD problem for statistically stationary flows and leads to modes that each oscillate at a single frequency. This form of POD goes back to the original work of Lumley (Stochastic tools in turbulence, Academic Press, 1970), but has been overshadowed by a space-only form of POD since the 1990s. We clarify the relationship between these two forms of POD and show that SPOD modes represent structures that evolve coherently in space and time while space-only POD modes in general do not. We also establish a relationship between SPOD and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD); we show that SPOD modes are in fact optimally averaged DMD modes obtained from an ensemble DMD problem for stationary flows. Accordingly, SPOD modes represent structures that are dynamic in the same sense as DMD modes but also optimally account for the statistical variability of turbulent flows. Finally, we establish a connection between SPOD and resolvent analysis. The key observation is that the resolvent-mode expansion coefficients must be regarded as statistical quantities to ensure convergent approximations of the flow statistics. When the expansion coefficients are uncorrelated, we show that SPOD and resolvent modes are identical. Our theoretical results and the overall utility of SPOD are demonstrated using two example problems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a turbulent jet.},

The flow parameters at the edge of the boundary layer correspond to a high-speed free-stream flow of a calorically perfect gas, and the boundary layer velocity and temperature profiles are obtained using the local-similarity approximation. The governing PSE equations are derived from the linearized Navier-Stokes equations in spherical coordinates within the scope of the concept of optimal perturbations as streamwise vortices. Analysis of the transient growth phenomenon revealed that an increase of the sphere radius leads to an increase of the transient growth, and that the transient growth effect is stronger in the vicinity of the stagnation point. Similarly to previous results for compressible boundary layers, cooling of the wall destabilizes the boundary layer flow.},

Turbulent velocity measurements show that, in absolute magnitudes, the longitudinal component decreases and the lateral component increases as t h e flow accelerates through the contraction. Post- and precontraction spectra are measured to get an idea about the distortion of turbulence structure. Corresponding to the test section of a wind tunnel, a uniform section was placed after the contraction. The turbulence is fairly homogeneous and axisymmetric at the end of the contraction, and the turbulent energy in three velocity components slowly equalizes as the flow goes through the uniform section. Measurements show that the lateral (larger) component is losing more energy due to viscosity than by transfer to the longitudinal (smaller) component. The longitudinal component is receiving enough energy to compensate for its decay, and, in fact, it is slowly increasing.},

Transition characteristics of a sharp cone and a nose cone with non-zero angle of attack, and a supersonic natural laminar flow (NLF) wing designed by our agency were analyzed. The Navier-Stokes code was used for the estimation of the threedimensional laminar boundary layer profiles that are the greatest controlling factor of the accuracy of the eN method. Transition location on the side surface of the sharp cone and nose cone moved forward significantly in comparison with that on the top and the bottom lines of the bilateral symmetry plane. It is dominated by the crossflow instability on the whole surface except extremely near the top and the bottom lines. Strong forward movement of transition was only found on the top line of the sharp cone. It is based on the instability due to the inflection point of two-dimensional laminar boundary layer profile. It became clear that the transition location estimated by the present analysis was in the rear of the wing as compared to the result by the 3-dimensional boundary layer code with the conical flow approximation by KaupsCebeci. This was caused by over estimation of the crossflow near the leading edge of the wing under the influence of the approximation. Therefore, it is thought that the highly accurate laminar boundary layer has large influence on estimating critical Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the potent second-mode instability in hypersonic boundary layers (HBLs) is examined holistically, by tracking its linear and nonlinear evolution, followed by its role in initiating transition and eventual breakdown of the HBL into a fully turbulent state. Linear stability theory is utilized to first identify the features of the second-mode wave after FS-synchronization. These are then employed in separate linearly and nonlinearly forced two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) direct numerical simulations (DNS). The nonlinear 2-D DNS shows saturation of the fundamental frequency, and the resulting superharmonics induce tightly braided `rope-like' patterns near the generalized inflection point (GIP). The instability exhibits a second region of growth constituted by the fundamental frequency downstream of the primary envelope, which is absent in the linear scenario. Subsequent fully 3-D DNS identify this region as crucial in amplifying oblique instabilities riding on the 2-D second-mode `rollers'. This results in lambda vortices below the GIP, which are detached from the rollers in the inner boundary layer. Streamwise vortex-stretching results in a localized peak in length scales inside the HBL, eventually forming hairpin vortices. Spectral analyses track the transformation of harmonic peaks into a turbulent spectrum. The appearance of oblique modes at the fundamental frequency suggests that fundamental resonance is the most dominant mechanism of transition. The bispectrum reveals coupled nonlinear interactions between the fundamental and its superharmonics leading to spectral broadening, as well as traces of subharmonic resonance. The global forms of the fundamental and subharmonic modes show that the former disintegrate at the location of spanwise breakdown, beyond which the latter amplify. Statistical analyses of the near-wall flow field indicate an increase in large-scale `splatting' motions immediately following transition, resulting in extreme skin-friction events, which equilibrate as turbulence sets in. Fundamental resonance results in complete breakdown of streamwise streaks in the lower log-layer, ultimately resulting in a fully turbulent HBL.},

However, such methods have difficulty in isolating the dynamics of secondary instabilities, which dominate the later stages of transition. A Floquet analysis can bridge this gap; however, typical matrix-based approaches can be cumbersome to implement in general compressible scenarios. We address this difficulty by developing a matrix-free perturbation technique to extract the three-dimensional linearized secondary dynamics of compressible inhomogeneous flowfields. The method can be implemented into traditional Navier-Stokes codes in a straightforward manner. It is then used to examine the transition mechanism in a hypersonic boundary layer saturated by a second-mode instability. The linear response of the time-periodic basic-state is shown to precisely identify the non-parallel amplification and breakdown of oblique modes that disintegrate the boundary layer. It also correctly predicts the fundamental resonance mechanism that leads to transition.},

Post-transition, the effect of surface roughness on a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer (TBL) is explored. In the transitional regime, the onset of flow transition predicted by the current simulations is in agreement with the experimentally based correlations proposed in the literature. Transition mechanisms are shown to change significantly with the increasing roughness height. Roughness elements that are inside the boundary layer create an elevated shear layer and alternating high and low speed streaks near the wall. Secondary sinuous instabilities on the streaks destabilize the shear layer promoting transition to turbulence. For the roughness topology considered, it is observed that the instability wavelengths are governed by the streamwise and spanwise spacing between the roughness elements. In contrast, the roughness elements that are higher than the boundary layer create turbulent wakes in their lee. The scale of instability is much shorter and transition occurs due to the shedding from the obstacles. Post-transition, in the spatially developing TBL, the velocity defect profiles for both the smooth and rough walls collapsed when non dimensionalized in the outer units. However, when compared to the smooth wall, deviation in the Reynolds stresses are observable in the outer layer; the deviation being higher for the larger roughness elements.},

  abstract = {The secondary instability of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, distorted by unsteady Klebanoff streaks, is investigated. The base profiles for the analysis are computed using direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the boundary-layer response to forcing by individual free-stream modes, which are low frequency and dominated by streamwise vorticity. Therefore, the base profiles take into account the nonlinear development of the streaks and mean flow distortion, upstream of the location chosen for the stability analyses. The two most unstable modes were classified as an inner and an outer instability, with reference to the position of their respective critical layers inside the boundary layer. Their growth rates were reported for a range of frequencies and amplitudes of the base streaks. The inner mode has a connection to the Tollmien\textendash Schlichting (T\textendash S) wave in the limit of vanishing streak amplitude. It is stabilized by the mean flow distortion, but its growth rate is enhanced with increasing amplitude and frequency of the base streaks. The outer mode only exists in the presence of finite amplitude streaks. The analysis of the outer instability extends the results of Andersson et al. (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 428, 2001, p. 29) to unsteady base streaks. It is shown that base-flow unsteadiness promotes instability and, as a result, leads to a lower critical streak amplitude. The results of linear theory are complemented by DNS of the evolution of the inner and outer instabilities in a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer. Both instabilities lead to breakdown to turbulence and, in the case of the inner mode, transition proceeds via the formation of wave packets with similar structure and wave speeds to those reported by Nagarajan, Lele \& Ferziger (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 572, 2007, p. 471).},

  abstract = {The perturbations triggered by free-stream vortical disturbances in compressible boundary layers developing over concave walls are studied numerically and through asymptotic methods. We employ an asymptotic framework based on the limit of high G\"ortler number, the scaled parameter defining the centrifugal effects; we use an eigenvalue formulation where the free-stream forcing is neglected; and we solve the receptivity problem by integrating the compressible boundary-region equations complemented by appropriate initial and boundary conditions that synthesize the influence of the free-stream vortical flow. Near the leading edge, the boundary-layer perturbations develop as thermal Klebanoff modes and, when centrifugal effects become influential, these modes turn into thermal G\"ortler vortices, i.e. streamwise rolls characterized by intense velocity and temperature perturbations. The high-G\"ortlernumber asymptotic analysis reveals the condition for which the G\"ortler vortices start to grow. The Mach number is destabilizing when the spanwise diffusion is negligible and stabilizing when the boundary-layer thickness is comparable with the spanwise wavelength of the vortices. When the G\"ortler number is large, the theoretical analysis also shows that the vortices move towards the wall as the Mach number increases. These results are confirmed by the receptivity analysis, which additionally clarifies that the temperature perturbations respond to this reversed behaviour further downstream than the velocity perturbations. A matched-asymptotic composite profile, found by combining the inviscid core solution and the near-wall viscous solution, agrees well with the receptivity profile sufficiently downstream and at high G\"ortler number. The G\"ortler vortices tend to move towards the boundary-layer core when the flow is more stable, i.e. as the frequency or the Mach number increase, or when the curvature decreases. As a consequence, a region of unperturbed flow is generated near the wall. We also find that the streamwise length scale of the boundary-layer perturbations is always smaller than the free-stream streamwise wavelength. During the initial development of the vortices, only the receptivity calculations are accurate. At streamwise locations where the free-stream disturbances have fully decayed, the growth rate and wavelength are computed with sufficient accuracy by the eigenvalue analysis, although the correct amplitude and evolution of the G\"ortler vortices can only be determined by the receptivity calculations. It is further proved that the eigenvalue predictions of the growth rate and wavenumber worsen as the Mach number increases as these quantities show a dependence on the wall-normal direction. We conclude by qualitatively comparing our results with the direct numerical simulations available in the literature.},

  abstract = {This study enables the use of very high-order finite-difference schemes for the solution of conservation laws on stretched, curvilinear, and deforming meshes. To illustrate these procedures, we focus on up to 6th-order Pade-type spatial discretizations coupled with up to 10th-order low-pass filters. These are combined with explicit and implicit time integration methods to examine wave propagation and wall-bounded flows described by the Navier\textendash Stokes equations. It is shown that without the incorporation of the filter, application of the high-order compact scheme to nonsmooth meshes results in spurious oscillations which inhibit their applicability. Inclusion of the discriminating low-pass high-order filter restores the advantages of high-order approach even in the presence of large grid discontinuities. When three-dimensional curvilinear meshes are employed, the use of standard metric evaluation procedures significantly degrades accuracy since freestream preservation is violated. To overcome this problem, a simple technique is adopted which ensures metric cancellation and thus ensures freestream preservation even on highly distorted curvilinear meshes. For dynamically deforming grids, an effective numerical treatment is described to evaluate expressions containing the time-varying transformation metrics. With these techniques, metric cancellation is guaranteed regardless of the manner in which grid speeds are defined. The efficacy of the new procedures is demonstrated by solving several model problems as well as by application to flow past a rapidly pitching airfoil and past a flexible panel.},

  abstract = {A matrix normalization scheme based on thermodynamic entropy is derived for modal decomposition techniques applied compressible flows. It is demonstrated that this normalization scheme is consistent with the scalar form of entropy. Analysis based in this consistency is performed to demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings of the Chu energy norm, which is the industry standard for compressible modal decompositions. The entropy normalization is shown mathematically to converge to the Chu normalization in the absence of strong temperature gradients. It is then compared to the Chu normalization by analyzing transient growth calculated through a linear stability analysis of a self-similar compressible boundary layer profile. The entropy norm is shown to be more sensitive to temperature fluctuations around the boundary layer than the Chu norm. These observations are further validated in a POD implementation of the entropy normalization, contracted about the conservative and primitive variables. The trends observed in transient growth analysis are observed in full-scale POD. The potential for the entropy normalization to be applied to flows with additional relevant physics, such as as thermal and chemical nonequilibrium, is explored.},

The entropy-layer instabilities of blunt wedges are stronger than those of blunt cones. The unstable mode frequency of the entropy layer decreases with increasing bluntness due to a thicker entropy layer. Larger bluntness is effective at widening the region of the unstable mode downstream, creating more opportunities for entropy-layer disturbances to force the triggering of boundary layer transition. Numerical simulations show that the entropy-layer mode can excite the first mode of the boundary layer.},

Upstream, streamwise-elongated vortices yield the largest response per unit of inflow disturbance energy, which takes the form of streamwise-elongated streaks. In this work, we compute the linear and also nonlinear inflow disturbances that generate the largest response inside the boundary layer, for flow over a thin flat plate with a slender leading edge. In order to compare our results with earlier linear analyses, we constrain the inlet disturbance to be monochromatic in time, or a single frequency. The boundary layer effectively filters high frequencies, and only low-frequency perturbations induce a strong response downstream. The low-frequency optimal inflow disturbance has a spanwise wavenumber that scales with , and it consists of streamwise and normal vorticity components: the latter is tilted around the leading edge into the streamwise direction and, further downstream, generates streaks. While none of the computed monochromatic disturbances alone can lead to breakdown to turbulence, secondary instability analyses demonstrate that the streaky base state is unstable. Nonlinear simulations where the inflow disturbance is supplemented with additional white noise undergo secondary instability and breakdown to turbulence.},

  abstract = {The receptivity of a hypersonic flat-plate boundary layer to small surface roughness is investigated by series of numerical simulations. The main objectives of the current paper are to study the receptivity process of a Mach 5.92 flow over a flat plate to surface roughness and the effect of spanwise wave number on the receptivity. The free-stream flow conditions are the same as those of Maslov et al.'s leading-edge receptivity experiment [1]. Two-dimensional steady base flow is firstly achieved by solving compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a combination of a fifthorder shock-fitting method and a second-order TVD scheme. The accuracy of the numerical steady base flow is validated by comparisons with the theoretical self-similar boundary-layer solution and Maslov et al.'s experimental measurements. The three-dimensional base flow is directly extended from two-dimensional base flow due to the fact that the base flow over the flat plate is independent of spanwise coordinate. In receptivity simulations, small surface roughness, periodic in spanwise direction, is introduced on the flat plate. The subsequent responses of the hypersonic boundary layer are simulated by solving three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with a fifth-order shock-fitting method and a Fourier collocation method. Due to small height of roughness element, boundary conditions of temperature and velocities on the rough surface are transferred to original smooth surface by linear extrapolation. The effect of spanwise wave number on the receptivity is studied by considering six cases of receptivity simulations. The numerical results show that counter rotating streamwise vortices and transient growth are induced by surface roughness. The spanwise wave number has a strong effect on the excitation of transient growth. For the six cases considered in current study, surface roughness with the spanwise wave number being 0.0101 has the strongest excitation of transient growth.},

The structure and pressure recovery inside the shock train is analyzed by means of wall pressure measurements, Schlieren images and total pressure probes. During the course of the experiments, the total pressure of the flow, the back pressure level and the Mach number upstream of the compression region have been varied. It is shown that the Reynolds number has some small effect on the shock position and length of the shock train. However, more dominant is the effect of the confinement level and Mach number. The results are compared with analytical and empirical models from the literature. It was found that the empirical pseudo-shock model from Billig and the analytical mass averaging model from Matsuo are suitable to compute the pressure gradient along the shock train and total pressure loss, respectively.},

  abstract = {A direct numerical simulation study of self-similar compressible flat-plate turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) with pressure gradients (PGs) has been performed for inflow Mach numbers of 0.5 and 2.0. All cases are computed with smooth PGs for both favourable and adverse PG distributions (FPG, APG) and thus are akin to experiments using a reflected-wave set-up. The equilibrium character allows for a systematic comparison between sub- and supersonic cases, enabling the isolation of pure PG effects from Mach-number effects and thus an investigation of the validity of common compressibility transformations for compressible PG TBLs. It turned out that the kinematic Rotta\textendash Clauser parameter {$\beta$}K calculated using the incompressible form of the boundary-layer displacement thickness as length scale is the appropriate similarity parameter to compare both sub- and supersonic cases. Whereas the subsonic APG cases show trends known from incompressible flow, the interpretation of the supersonic PG cases is intricate. Both sub- and supersonic regions exist in the boundary layer, which counteract in their spatial evolution. The boundary-layer thickness {$\delta$}99 and the skin-friction coefficient cf , for instance, are therefore in a comparable range for all compressible APG cases. The evaluation of local non-dimensionalized total and turbulent shear stresses shows an almost identical behaviour for both sub- and supersonic cases characterized by similar {$\beta$}K, which indicates the (approximate) validity of Morkovin's scaling/hypothesis also for compressible PG TBLs. Likewise, the local non-dimensionalized distributions of the mean-flow pressure and the pressure fluctuations are virtually invariant to the local Mach number for same {$\beta$}K-cases. In the inner layer, the van Driest transformation collapses compressible mean-flow data of the streamwise velocity component well into their nearly incompressible counterparts with the same {$\beta$}K. However, noticeable differences can be observed in the wake region of the velocity profiles, depending on the strength of the PG. For both sub- and supersonic cases the recovery factor was found to be significantly decreased by APGs and increased by FPGs, but also to remain virtually constant in regions of approximated equilibrium.},

The investigations include the free boundary-layer transition on a flat plate as well as the influence of a shock wave\textendash boundary layer interaction on the transition. The shock is created by a wedge with a small angle of attack resulting in a moderate shock intensity. The experiments were performed at Mach 6.0, at three different unit Reynolds numbers and with a translational displacement of the shock generator. Besides the optical methods\textemdash Schlieren photography and infrared thermography\textemdash several intrusive sensors were used. High-speed measurements were carried out using PCB and atomic layer thermo pile sensors. Kulite sensors were used for low- and mid-speed pressure measurements. The data analysis includes the comparison of the absolute values, the frequency spectra and wavelets and their distributions in time and space.},

  abstract = {A nominally-zero-pressure-gradient incompressible boundary layer over a smooth flat plate was simulated for a continuous momentum thickness Reynolds number range of 80 {$\leq$} Re\texttheta{} {$\leq$} 940. Transition which is completed at approximately Re\texttheta{} = 750 was triggered by intermittent localized disturbances arising from patches of isotropic turbulence introduced periodically from the free stream at Re\texttheta{} = 80. Streamwise pressure gradient is quantified with several measures and is demonstrated to be weak. Blasius boundary layer is maintained in the early transitional region of 80 {$<$} Re\texttheta{} {$<$} 180 within which the maximum deviation of skin friction from the theoretical solution is less than 1\%. Mean and second-order turbulence statistics are compared with classic experimental data, and they constitute a rare DNS dataset for the spatially developing zero-pressure-gradient turbulent flat-plate boundary layer. Our calculations indicate that in the present spatially developing low-Reynolds-number turbulent flat-plate boundary layer, total shear stress mildly overshoots the wall shear stress in the near-wall region of 2\textendash 20 wall units with vanishing normal gradient at the wall. Overshoots as high as 10\% across a wider percentage of the boundary layer thickness exist in the late transitional region. The former is a residual effect of the latter. The instantaneous flow fields are vividly populated by hairpin vortices. This is the first time that direct evidence (in the form of a solution of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, obeying the statistical measurements, as opposed to synthetic superposition of the structures) shows such dominance of these structures. Hairpin packets arising from upstream fragmented {$\Lambda$} structures are found to be instrumental in the breakdown of the present boundary layer bypass transition.},

The transport equation of transition momentum thickness Reynolds number is eliminated for simplicity, and new transition length function and critical Reynolds number correlation are proposed. The new model is implemented into an in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code and validated for low and high-speed flow cases, including the zero pressure flat plate, airfoils, hypersonic flat plate and double wedge. Comparisons between the simulation results and experimental data show that the boundary-layer transition phenomena can be reasonably illustrated by the new model, which gives rise to significant improvements over the fully laminar and fully turbulent results. Moreover, the new model has comparable features of accuracy and applicability when compared with the original c \`A Reht model. In the meantime, the newly proposed model takes only one transport equation of intermittency factor and requires fewer correlations, which simplifies the original model greatly. Further studies, especially on separationinduced transition flows, are required for the improvement of the new model.},

  abstract = {We conduct a series of large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent boundary layers over arrays of cuboidal roughness elements at arbitrary orientation angles (non-frontal orientations with the incident flow). Flow response to changing roughness orientation is systematically studied at two ground coverage densities, {$\lambda$}p = 0.06 and 0.11. As expected, the effective roughness heights zo measured from LES are higher for {$\lambda$}p = 0.11 than for {$\lambda$}p = 0.06, although appreciable changes both in zo and wall shear stress (friction velocity) are observed at both ground coverage densities as the roughness orientation angle changes. This suggests the necessity of accounting for detailed rough wall topology (including more information than just {$\lambda$}p, {$\lambda$}f) when relating rough wall morphology to its aerodynamic properties. To this end, a recently developed analytical rough wall parameterisation is used to predict the aerodynamic properties of the simulated rough surfaces. In this rough wall model, wake interactions among roughness elements are explicitly modelled using the concept of sheltering height and exponential attenuation coefficient. As a result, the parameterisation is responsive to detailed ground roughness arrangements and flow conditions, including roughness height variations, element orientation, incident flow direction, transverse displacements, etc. Model-predicted effective roughness heights, wall stress, mean velocity at the height of the roughness, and in some cases displacement height, are compared against the LES measurements from this study as well as numerical/experiment measurements from other authors. The predictions from the model are found to agree well with the measurements both in trends and in absolute values, thus extending the applicability of the analytical rough wall model to more general surfaces than those previously tested.},

Both the number and the spanwise spacing of roughness elements in the array are varied in order to study their effect on the wake flow topology. Spanwise interaction between the roughness elements has an effect on the connection and the merging of neighbouring low-speed regions, which results in the formation of merged low-speed blobs (MLSs) that modify the spatial distribution and the amplitudes of the velocity streaks. When the spanwise distance between adjacent roughness elements equals 1.5 times the cylinder diameter, the transition location moves rapidly upstream. In this case, the two neighbouring low-speed regions overlap with each other in the near wake of the roughness, leading to the maximum growth in the velocity streak amplitude and the velocity fluctuations. The number of roughness elements affects the total number of MLSs within the boundary layer. For a single MLS behind a pair of cylinders, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability dominates the growth of velocity fluctuations around the three-dimensional shear layers. When three cylinders are placed in the array, two MLSs appear in the near wake, which coalesce in to one lowspeed blob downstream before the onset of transition, revealing the importance of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.},

The method uses the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes as the orthogonal basis and the dynamic mode decomposition method to obtain linear equations for the temporal evolution coefficients of the modes. This method eliminates the need for the governing equations of the flows involved, and therefore saves the effort of deriving the projected equations and proving their consistency, convergence and stability, as required by the conventional Galerkin projection method, which has been successfully applied to incompressible flows but is hard to extend to compressible flows. Using a sparsity-promoting algorithm, the dimensionality of the ROM is further reduced to a minimum. The ROMs of the natural and bypass transitions of supersonic boundary layers at Ma = 2.25 are constructed by the proposed data-driven method. The temporal evolution of the POD modes shows good agreement with that obtained by direct numerical simulations in both cases.},

We derive this condition, in the limit of small microscopic Reynolds numbers, using a multi-scale technique that yields a closed system of equations, the solution of which allows the slip tensor to be univocally calculated, once the roughness geometry is specified. We validate this generalized slip condition by considering the flow about a rough sphere, the surface of which is covered with a hexagonal lattice of cylindrical protrusions. Comparisons with direct numerical simulations performed in both laminar and turbulent regimes allow us to assess the validity and limitations of this condition and of the mathematical model underlying the determination of the slip tensor~ L\{\textbackslash mathcal\{L\}\} .},

  abstract = {This paper aims at characterizing the bypass transition in boundary layers subject to strong pressure gradient and curvature effects. A series of highly resolved large-eddy simulations of a high-pressure turbine vane are performed, and the primary focus is on the effects of free-stream turbulence (FST) states on transition mechanisms. The turbulent fluctuations that have convected from the inlet first interact with the blunt blade leading edge, forming vortical structures wrapping around the blade. For cases with relatively low-level FST, streamwise streaks are observed in the suction-side boundary layer, and the instabilities of the streaks cause the breakdown to turbulence. Moreover, the varicose mode of streak instability is predominant in the adverse pressure gradient region, while the sinuous mode is more common in the (weak) favourable pressure gradient region. On the other hand, for cases with higher levels of FST, the leading-edge structures are more irregularly distributed and no obvious streak instability is observed. Accordingly, the transition onset occurs much earlier, through the breakdown caused by interactions between vortical structures. Comparing between different cases, it is the competing effect between the FST intensity and the stabilizing pressure gradient that decides the path to transition and also the transition onset, whereas the integral length scale of FST affects the scales of the streamwise streaks in the boundary layer. Furthermore, while the streaks in the low-level FST cases are mainly induced by leading-edge vortical structures, the corresponding fluctuations show a stage of algebraic growth despite the weak favourable pressure gradient and curvature.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at characterizing the bypass transition in boundary layers subject to strong pressure gradient and curvature effects. A series of highly resolved large-eddy simulations of a high-pressure turbine vane are performed, and the primary focus is on the effects of free-stream turbulence (FST) states on transition mechanisms. The turbulent fluctuations that have convected from the inlet first interact with the blunt blade leading edge, forming vortical structures wrapping around the blade. For cases with relatively low-level FST, streamwise streaks are observed in the suction-side boundary layer, and the instabilities of the streaks cause the breakdown to turbulence. Moreover, the varicose mode of streak instability is predominant in the adverse pressure gradient region, while the sinuous mode is more common in the (weak) favourable pressure gradient region. On the other hand, for cases with higher levels of FST, the leading-edge structures are more irregularly distributed and no obvious streak instability is observed. Accordingly, the transition onset occurs much earlier, through the breakdown caused by interactions between vortical structures. Comparing between different cases, it is the competing effect between the FST intensity and the stabilizing pressure gradient that decides the path to transition and also the transition onset, whereas the integral length scale of FST affects the scales of the streamwise streaks in the boundary layer. Furthermore, while the streaks in the low-level FST cases are mainly induced by leading-edge vortical structures, the corresponding fluctuations show a stage of algebraic growth despite the weak favourable pressure gradient and curvature.},

  abstract = {The receptivity phenomenon, which is the process of environmental disturbances initially entering the boundary layers and generating disturbance waves, is one of the important but not well understood mechanisms involving laminar\textendash turbulent transition of hypersonic flows. This paper presents a numerical simulation study of the receptivity to weak free-stream fast acoustic waves for a Mach 7.99 axisymmetric flow over a 7{$\circ$}7\^\textbackslash circ half-angle blunt cone. In hypersonic boundary-layer flow over a blunt cone, the process of receptivity to free-stream disturbances is altered considerably by the presence of a bow shock and an entropy layer. In the present study, both steady and unsteady flow solutions are obtained by computing the full Navier\textendash Stokes equations with a fifth-order shock-fitting finite-difference scheme, which is able to account for the effects of bow-shock/free-stream-disturbance interaction accurately. The current numerical results for the steady base flow are compared with previous experimental and numerical results. In addition, a normal-mode linear stability analysis is used to identify the main components of boundary-layer disturbances generated by forcing free-stream fast acoustic waves. It is found that neither the first mode nor the second-mode instability waves are excited by free-stream fast acoustic waves in the early region along the cone surface, although the Mack modes can be unstable there. Instead, the second mode is excited downstream of the second-mode Branch I neutral stability point. The delay of the second-mode excitation is because the hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity is governed by a two-step resonant interaction process: (i) resonant interactions between the forcing waves and a stable boundary-layer wave mode I near the leading-edge region; and (ii) resonant interactions between the induced stable mode I and the unstable second Mack mode downstream. The same receptivity mechanism also explains the results that no first Mack mode components are generated by the current receptivity process because there is no resonant interaction between fast acoustic waves and the first Mack mode.},

  abstract = {The prediction of the laminar-turbulent transition of boundary layers is critically important to the development of hypersonic vehicles because the transition has a first-order impact on aerodynamic heating, drag, and vehicle operation. The success of transition prediction relies on a fundamental understanding of the relevant physical mechanisms. In the 20 years since the review by Kleiser \& Zang (1991) on the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the boundary-layer transition, significant progress has been made on DNS in the hypersonic flow regime and in the spatial DNS approach. Many high-order shock-capturing and shock-fitting finite-difference methods have been developed and extensively applied to numerical simulations of the hypersonic boundary-layer transition. DNS has become a powerful research tool and has led to discoveries of new transition mechanisms. This article reviews the recent progress of DNS on hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity, instability, and transition. The current status and future directions are also presented.},

  abstract = {The direct numerical simulation of receptivity, instability and transition of hypersonic boundary layers requires high-order accurate schemes because lower-order schemes do not have an adequate accuracy level to compute the large range of time and length scales in such flow fields. The main limiting factor in the application of high-order schemes to practical boundary-layer flow problems is the numerical instability of high-order boundary closure schemes on the wall. This paper presents a family of high-order non-uniform grid finite difference schemes with stable boundary closures for the direct numerical simulation of hypersonic boundary-layer transition. By using an appropriate grid stretching, and clustering grid points near the boundary, high-order schemes with stable boundary closures can be obtained. The order of the schemes ranges from first-order at the lowest, to the global spectral collocation method at the highest. The accuracy and stability of the new high-order numerical schemes is tested by numerical simulations of the linear wave equation and two-dimensional incompressible flat plate boundary layer flows. The high-order non-uniform-grid schemes (up to the 11th-order) are subsequently applied for the simulation of the receptivity of a hypersonic boundary layer to free stream disturbances over a blunt leading edge. The steady and unsteady results show that the new highorder schemes are stable and are able to produce high accuracy for computations of the nonlinear two-dimensional Navier\textendash Stokes equations for the wall bounded supersonic flow.},

An analytical model was then proposed to predict the wavelength of the first shock wave in both convergent and convergent\textendash divergent nozzle ejectors. The model results agree well with the measurements for the first shock wave length with a maximum difference of 11\%. The influence of the first shock wave length on the ejector entrainment performance was analyzed to show that the ejector entrainment performance decreases as the shock wave wavelength is increased at a given primary flow inlet pressure.},

  abstract = {Spatial marching methods, in which the flow state is spatially evolved in the downstream direction, can be used to produce low-cost models of flows containing a slowly varying direction, such as mixing layers, jets, and boundary layers. The parabolized stability equations (PSE) are popular due to their extremely low cost but can only capture a single instability mode; all other modes are damped or distorted by regularization methods required to stabilize the spatial march, precluding PSE from properly capturing non-modal behavior, acoustics, and interactions between multiple instability mechanisms. The one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations properly retain all downstream-traveling modes at a cost that is a fraction of that of global methods but still one to two orders of magnitude higher than PSE. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of OWNS whose cost, both in terms of CPU time and memory requirements, approaches that of PSE while still properly capturing the contributions of all downstream-traveling modes. The method is formulated in terms of a projection operator that eliminates upstream-traveling modes. Unlike previous OWNS variants, the action of this operator on a vector can be efficiently approximated using a series of equations that can be solved recursively, i.e., successively one after the next, rather than as a coupled set. In addition to highlighting the improved cost scaling of our method, we derive explicit error expressions and elucidate the relationship with previous OWNS variants. The properties, efficiency, and accuracy of our method are demonstrated for both free-shear and wall-bounded flows.},

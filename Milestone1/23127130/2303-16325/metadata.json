    "abstract": "Characterizing the boundary layer transition to turbulence around realistic hypersonic vehicles is a challenging task due to the numerous parameters that affect the process. To address this challenge, the cone-cylinder-flare (CCF) geometry has been designed to provide a flow topology that captures various transition mechanisms observed on reentry objects, such as absolute and convective instabilities, which are dependent on the free stream conditions. In this study, a global linear stability analysis is performed on the CCF model at Mach=6.0 to investigate and map the dominant instabilities at wind tunnel flow conditions. We examine optimal responses and forcings computed using resolvent analysis, as well as global modes originating from the recirculation bubble at the cylinder flare junction. The effects of bluntness are assessed through analyses of both blunt and sharp configurations. Our results shed light on the linear flow mechanisms that promote the transition to turbulence around such hypersonic objects.",

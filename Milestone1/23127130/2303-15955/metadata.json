    "abstract": "In the last two decades, magnetic, thermodynamic properties and bipartite thermal entanglement in diamond spin clusters and chains have been studied. Such spin structures are presented in various compounds. The ions of $Cu^{2+}$ in the natural mineral azurite are arranged in a diamond spin chain. There are no studies of the entanglement behaviour during the quantum evolution of such systems. Herein, we consider the evolution of entanglement in the diamond spin-1/2 cluster. This cluster consists of two central spins described by the anisotropic Heisenberg model, which interact with two side spins via Ising interaction. The influence of the interaction coupling with side spins on the entanglement of central spins is investigated. It is shown that choosing the value of this coupling allows us to control the behaviour of entanglement between central spins. As a result, we find conditions for achieving the maximal values of entanglement. In addition, the entanglement behaviour between the side spins, central and side spins, and between a certain spin and the rest of the system is studied. In these cases, the conditions for achieving maximal entanglement are also obtained.",

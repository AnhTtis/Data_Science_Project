    "abstract": "Atoms confined in optical tweezer arrays constitute a platform for the implementation of quantum computers and simulators. State-dependent operations are realized by exploiting electrostatic dipolar interactions that emerge, when two atoms are simultaneously excited to high-lying electronic states, so-called Rydberg states. These interactions also lead to state-dependent mechanical forces, which couple the electronic dynamics of the atoms to their vibrational motion. We explore these vibronic couplings within an artificial molecular system -- a Rydberg tweezer molecule -- in which Rydberg states are excited under so-called facilitation conditions. This system undergoes a structural transition between an equilateral triangle and an equal-weighted superposition of distorted triangular states (Jahn-Teller regime) exhibiting spin-phonon entanglement on a micrometer distance. This highlights the potential of Rydberg tweezer arrays for the study of molecular phenomena at exaggerated length scales.",

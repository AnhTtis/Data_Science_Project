    "abstract": "The stability and accuracy of atomic devices can be degraded by the evolution of their cell inner atmosphere. Hence, the undesired entrance or leakage of background or buffer gas, respectively, that can permeate through the cell walls, should be slowed down. In this work, we investigate helium permeation in microfabricated alkali vapor cells filled with He and whose windows are made of borosilicate glass (BSG) or aluminosilicate glass (ASG). The permeation is then derived from routine measurements of the pressure-shifted hyperfine transition frequency of an atomic clock. We first confirm that ASG reduces He permeation rate by more than two orders of magnitude, in comparison with BSG. In addition, we demonstrate that Al$_2$O$_3$ thin-film coatings, known to avoid alkali consumption in vapor cells, can also significantly reduce He permeation. The permeation through BSG is thereby reduced by a factor 110 whereas the one through ASG is decreased by a factor up to 5.8 compared to uncoated substrates. These results may contribute to the development of miniaturized atomic clocks and sensors with improved long-term stability or sensitivity.",

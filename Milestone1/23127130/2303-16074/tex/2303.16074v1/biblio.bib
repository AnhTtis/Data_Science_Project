  Abstract                 = { Currently, portable consumer embedded devices are increasing more and more their capabilities and can now implement new algorithms (e.g. multimedia and wireless protocols) that a few years ago were reserved only for powerful workstations. Unfortunately, the original design characteristics of such applications do not often allow to port them directly in current embedded devices. These applications share complex and intensive memory use. Furthermore, they must heavily rely on dynamic memory due to the unpredictability of the input data (e.g. 3D streams features) and system behaviour (e.g. number of applications running concurrently defined by the user). Thus they require that the dynamic memory subsystem involved is able to provide the necessary level of performance for these new dynamic applications. However, actual embedded systems have very limited resources (e.g. speed and power consumed in the memory subsystem) to provide efficient general-purpose dynamic memory management. We propose a new methodology to design custom dynamic memory managers that provide the performance required in new embedded devices by reducing the amount of memory accesses to handle these new dynamic multimedia and wireless network applications. Our results in real-life dynamic applications show significant improvements in memory accesses of dynamic memory managers, i.e. up to 58%, compared to state-of-the-art dynamic memory management solutions for complex applications.},

  Abstract                 = {{Evolutionary algorithms are relatively new, but very powerful techniques used to find solutions to many real-world search and optimization problems. Many of these problems have multiple objectives, which leads to the need to obtain a set of optimal solutions, known as effective solutions. It has been found that using evolutionary algorithms is a highly effective way of finding multiple effective solutions in a single simulation run.<br> * Comprehensive coverage of this growing area of research<br> * Carefully introduces each algorithm with examples and in-depth discussion<br> * Includes many applications to real-world problems, including engineering design and scheduling<br> * Includes discussion of advanced topics and future research<br> * Can be used as a course text or for self-study<br> * Accessible to those with limited knowledge of classical multi-objective optimization and evolutionary algorithms<br> The integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and examples will benefit those working and researching in the areas of optimization, optimal design and evolutionary computing. This text provides an excellent introduction to the use of evolutionary algorithms in multi-objective optimization, allowing use as a graduate course text or for self-study.}},

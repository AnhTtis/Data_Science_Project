    "abstract": "We review recent developments in the research of nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena in solids focusing on their geometrical aspects. We start with introducing the basic concepts of geometrical phases of Bloch electrons and Floquet theory for periodically driven systems. Then we review recent attempts to engineer topological phases in nonequilibrium matters with circularly polarized light irradiated to graphene, magnets, and superconductors. We next review a bulk photovoltaic effect of inversion broken materials focusing on the shift current response. The shift current is described with Berry connections and has a close relationship to the modern theory of polarization. We further review recent extensions of the shift current to correlated electron systems. Finally we explain the geometric diabatic time evolution in Zenner tunneling process and its consequences on the nonreciprocal transport.",

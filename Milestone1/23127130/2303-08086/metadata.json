    "abstract": "The work analyzed the positioning of IRS over the coverage region of micro cell to derive optimal placement location to support cell-edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices with a favorable signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Moreover, the work derived that the implementation of IRS significantly enhances energy efficiency notably reducing the transmit power of the micro cell base station.",

    "abstract": "A few new indices to characterize the scientific output of scientists are defined in the paper. These indices are compared with -index and its alternative indices using some proven assertions. The gd-indices are introduced as extensions of the g-index to define H-index as an improvement of the h-index. Numerous computational results which are conducted indicate the good behaviour of defined indices to evaluate the scientific impact of scientists. There exist very good approximations between some pairs of all considered indices in the sense that related ratios are often very close to 1.",

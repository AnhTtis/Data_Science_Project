\begin{abstract}
\noindent In the context of complex quadratic networks (CQNs) introduced previously, we study escape radius and synchronization properties in two dimensional networks. We generalize the approach to drive results in higher-dimensional networks, and being part of a strongly connected component of the network is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for nodes to synchronize.

\section{Introduction}

In our previous work we have introduced complex quadratic networks (CQNs) as networks of coupled nodes, the dynamics of which is governed by discrete quadratic iterations in the complex plane. As mathematical objects, they have rich and complex behavior, which can exhibit a wide range of phenomena, far transcending those described for single iterated maps. These behaviors are governed by the interplay between the properties of individual nodes,  the strength of the coupling between them and the topology of the network, making them a fascinating subject of study in the emerging field of network science.
Understanding the effect of edge configuration and weights becomes of crucial interest in the context of understanding and classifying the long-term behavior of the system. In particular, the study of these networks has revealed that even simple changes to the edge weights can lead to large-scale changes in the system's dynamics. This has significant implications not only for network science, but also for other fields such as physics, biology, and engineering, where understanding the dynamics of complex systems is a critical component.

In order to efficiently quantify the asymptotic dynamics of the system in response to network changes, we defined, for any $n$-dimensional network, an extension of the traditional prisoner set (as the set of bounded initial conditions that have bounded orbits in $\mathbb{C}^n$)~\cite{Ariel}. We also defined the \emph{equi-Mandelbrot set}, an extension of the traditional Mandelbrot set, as the set of parameters $c \in \mathbb{C}$ for which the given network with identical nodes $z \to z^2+c$ is postcritically bounded in $\mathbb{C}^n$). Since the properties of the critical orbit are complicated in this case by the fact that is has multiple components, this definition is not equivalent to the connectedness locus in $\mathbb{C}$ of the network prisoner set, but we conjectured that some relationship remains between the two objects in the parameter plane~\cite{Simone}. 

In the context of CQNs, one can study a similar concept with that of traditional ``synchronization'' of nodes' activity described in the context of networks of continuous-time oscillators. Instead of requiring for two nodes to eventually converge to the same attractor, synchronization of two nodes in CQNs required that the two nodes are simultaneously bounded~\cite{AC2}. To fix ideas, We further defined node-wise equi-Mandelbrot sets as the parameter regions for which individual nodes remain bounded (as the critical orbit evolves in $\mathbb{C}^n$). Then we defined two nodes $z_i$ and $z_j$ to be M-synchronized is they have the same node-wise equi-Mandelbrot sets, i.e., ${\cal M}(z_i) = {\cal M}(z_j)$. With this relationship, the nodes of a network can be classified into \emph{clusters} of nodes with identical equi-M sets. 

A substantial focus of our work has been on understanding the contribution of the coupling to the topological properties of the equi-M sets, and to the grouping and shapes of the synchronization clusters. In our previous work, we have approached CQNs from a network science standpoint~\cite{AC2,gender}, and have focused primarily on the contribution of the network architectural aspect to the emerging dynamics. However, in order to have nontrivial architecture, the network has to be reasonably large. This leap to access higher-dimensional, interesting ``connectivity patterns'' omitted a specific analyses of two-dimensional networks, which can only have virtually trivial architecture schemes between two nodes. 

This case is, nontheless, extremely important in understanding analytically how coupling between two nodes affects the equi-M sets and their synchronization. In this paper we focus precisely on this aspect, and embrace a bottom-up, constructive approach. We show that, by building upon results on interaction between two nodes taken in isolation, one can determine how this type of mutual coupling acts more generally when embedded into higher-dimensional networks. 

\section{Dynamics of two coupled maps}

We consider the system of two coupled complex variables $(z_1,z_2)$, evolving discretely according to quadratic complex dynamics $f(z) = z^2+c$, $c \in \mathbb{C}$, and with linear coupling specified by the matrix $A =\left( \begin{array}{cc} a & b\\ d & f \end{array}\right)$. More precisely, the 2-dimensional map describing the coupled dynamics is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
z_1(n+1) &=& (az_1+bz_2)^2+c \nonumber\\
z_2(n+1) &=& (dz_1+fz_2)^2+c
\label{mother_sys}
\end{eqnarray}

For consistency with our more general prior work in complex quadratic networks (CQNs), we will refer to our two-map coupled systems as 2D-CQNs throughout this paper.

\subsection{Escape radius}
 In this section, we will show that the system of two coupled maps described above has an escape radius, for most connectivity matrices $A$. To do this, we will prove a series of lemma, considering separately different cases for the balance of the connectivity parameters $(a,b,d,f)$.
 
 \begin{lemma}
 Suppose the connectivity matrix $A$ is such that $\Delta = \lvert af \rvert - \lvert bd \rvert \neq 0$. Then there exists a large enough $M>0$ such that, for an iteration step $n \geq 0$ we have  $\lvert z_1(n) \rvert>M$ or $\lvert z_2(n) \rvert>M$, then the next iterates $\lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert>2M$ or $\lvert z_2(n+1) \rvert>2M$.
 \label{case1}
 \end{lemma}
 
 \proof{Since $\Delta = \lvert af \rvert - \lvert bd \rvert \neq 0$, we can consider
 $\ds \sqrt{K_1} = \frac{\lvert b \rvert + \lvert f \rvert}{\lvert \Delta \rvert}$, and  $\ds \sqrt{K_2} = \frac{\lvert a \rvert + \lvert d \rvert}{\lvert \Delta \rvert}$, and further:
 $$M_1 = K_1+\sqrt{K_1(K_1 + \lvert c \rvert)} \text{ and } M_2 = K_2+\sqrt{K_2(K_2 + \lvert c \rvert)}$$
 
 Take $M>\max\{ M_1,M_2 \}$. Suppose that, for some $n \geq 0$, we have $z_1(n)>M$ or $z_2(n)>M$. We will show that $z_1(n+1)>2M$ or $z_2(n+1)>2M$. We will argue by contradiction; throughout the argument, we will abbreviate $z_1(n)$ and $z_2(n)$ to $z_1$ and $z_2$, when there is no danger of confusion. Suppose both $z_1(n+1) \leq 2M$ and $z_2(n+1) \leq 2M$. Then
 
 \begin{equation*}
     2M \geq \lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert = \lvert (az_1+bz_2)^2+c \rvert \geq \lvert az_1+bz_2 \rvert^2 - \lvert c \rvert \geq (\lvert az_1 \rvert - \lvert bz_2 \rvert)^2 - \lvert c \rvert
 \end{equation*}
 
\noindent It follows that 
\begin{equation*}
    \lvert \lvert az_1 \rvert - \lvert bz_2 \rvert \rvert \leq \sqrt{2M + \lvert c \rvert}
\end{equation*}
 
\noindent Similarly, starting from $\lvert z_2(n+1) \rvert \leq 2M$, one can show that:
\begin{equation*}
    \lvert \lvert dz_1 \rvert - \lvert fz_2 \rvert \rvert \leq \sqrt{2M + \lvert c \rvert}
\end{equation*}
 
 \noindent Call now $\xi_1 = \lvert f \rvert ( \lvert az_1 \rvert - \lvert bz_2 \rvert )$ and $\xi_2 = \lvert b \rvert ( \lvert dz_1 \rvert - \lvert fz_2 \rvert )$. Then
 
 \begin{equation*}
     \lvert \xi_1-\xi_2 \rvert = \lvert (\lvert af \rvert - \lvert bd \rvert) z_1 \rvert \leq \lvert \xi_1 \rvert + \lvert \xi_2 \rvert \leq (\lvert b \rvert + \lvert f \rvert) \sqrt{2M+\lvert c \rvert}
 \end{equation*}
 
 \noindent hence
 
 \begin{equation*}
     \lvert z_1 \rvert \leq \frac{\lvert b \rvert + \lvert f \rvert}{\lvert \Delta \rvert} \sqrt{2M+\lvert c \rvert}
     \label{ineq_z1}
 \end{equation*}
 
\noindent From our assumption for $M$ large it follows that the right side of \eqref{ineq_z1} is no larger than $M$. Squaring both sides, this is equivalent to $h(M) = M^2-K_1(2M+\lvert c \rvert)>0$, which is guaranteed by taking $M>M_1$, the larger of the quadratic roots of $h$. In conclusion, we obtain that $\lvert z_1(n) \rvert \leq M$.

Similarly, if we call $\psi_1 = \lvert f \rvert ( \lvert az_1 \rvert - \lvert bz_2 \rvert )$ and $\psi_2 = \lvert b \rvert (\lvert dz_1 \rvert - \lvert z_2 \rvert )$, we get that
\begin{equation*}
\lvert \psi_1 - \psi_2 \rvert = \lvert (\lvert af \rvert - \lvert bd \rvert) z_2 \rvert \leq (\lvert a \rvert + \lvert d \rvert) \sqrt{2M+\lvert c \rvert}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Hence 
\begin{equation*}
    z_2(n) \leq \sqrt{K_2} \sqrt{2M + \lvert c \rvert} \leq M
\end{equation*}

\noindent (the second part of the double inequality follows from the condition that $M>M_2$). Since $z_1(n)$ and $z_2(n)$ cannot be simultaneously smaller than $M$, the contradiction follows.

\qed
}

\noindent We then have the following

\begin{thm} In the case of $\lvert af \rvert \neq \lvert bd \rvert$, $M = \max\{M_1,M_2\}$ acts as an escape radius for the iteration, with $M_1$ and $M_2$ described in the proof of Lemma~\ref{case1}.
\end{thm}

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent Hence, when $\lvert af \rvert \neq \lvert bd \rvert$, $M = \max\{M_1,M_2\}$ acts as an escape radius for the iteration, with $M_1$ and $M_2$ described in the proof of Lemma~\ref{case1}. Suppose now $\lvert af \rvert \neq \lvert bd \rvert$. To fix our ideas, suppose that $af = bd$ (the opposite sign case is similar). We want to see if, in this case, there still exists a large enough $M>0$ such that, for an iteration step $n \geq 0$ we have  $\lvert z_1(n) \rvert>M$ or $\lvert z_2(n) \rvert>M$, then the next iterates $\lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert>2M$ or $\lvert z_2(n+1) \rvert>2M$. We need to analyze a few distinct cases, as follows:

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\bf Case 1:} $a,b \neq 0$. Since $af=bd$, we can call $\ds k = \frac{d}{a} = \frac{f}{b}$. Say that, for some fixed iteration $n$, $\lvert z_1(n) \rvert>M$ and $\lvert z_2 \rvert >M$. 

Consider $g = \min\{ \lvert a \rvert, \lvert b \rvert \}$. It follows that $\lvert az_1 + bz_2 \rvert > gM$ or $\lvert az_1 - bz_2 \rvert > gM$. Indeed, suppose by contradiction that both $\lvert az_1 + bz_2 \rvert \leq gM$ and $\lvert az_1 - bz_2 \rvert \leq gM$. Then
\begin{equation*}
2\lvert az_1 \rvert \leq \lvert az_1 + bz_2 \rvert + \lvert az_1-bz_2 \rvert \leq 2gM < 2 \lvert a \rvert M
\end{equation*}
\noindent implying that $z_1 \leq M$. Similarly, 
\begin{equation*}
2\lvert bz_1 \rvert \leq \lvert az_1 + bz_2 \rvert + \lvert bz_2- az_1 \rvert \leq 2gM < 2 \lvert b \rvert M
\end{equation*}
\noindent implies that $z_2 \leq M$. Since we cannot have simultaneously $\lvert z_1 \rvert \leq M$ and $\lvert z_2 \rvert \leq M$, we get our contradiction.

Suppose $\lvert az_1 + bz_2 \rvert >gM$; the case of $\lvert az_1 - bz_2 \rvert >gM$ works similarly and we will skip the proof. We consider:
\begin{equation*}
az_1(n+1)+bz_2(n+1) = (a+bk^2)(az_1+bz_2)^2+c(a+b)
\end{equation*}
\noindent Hence
\begin{equation*}
\lvert az_1(n+1)+bz_2(n+1) \rvert \geq  g^2M^2 \lvert a+bk^2\rvert  - \lvert c(a+b) \rvert
\end{equation*}

\noindent {\bf Case (i):} If $a+bk^2 \neq 0$, we can consider the quadratic function $f(M) = g^2M^2 \lvert a+bk^2\rvert -2(\lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert)M - \lvert c(a+b) \rvert$. The larger root $M_1>0$ of this function is defined explicitly as:
\begin{equation*}
M_1 = \frac{\lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert + \sqrt{(\lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert)^2+g^2 \lvert c \rvert (\lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert) \lvert a+bk^2 \rvert}}{g^2\lvert a+bk^2 \rvert}
\end{equation*}
\noindent If $M>M_1$, then $f(M)>0$, and $\lvert az_1(n+1)+bz_2(n+1) \rvert > 2(\lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert)M$. It follows easily that either $\lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert>2M$ or $\lvert z_2(n+1) \rvert>2M$.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent {\bf Case (ii):} If $a+bk^2=0$, then $a=-bk^2$, $d=-bk^3$ and $f=bk$. Hence the system becomes: $z_1(n+1) = b^2(-k^2z_1+z_2)^2+c$ and $z_2(n+1) = b^2k^2(-k^2z_1+z_2)^2+c$. Call $\xi(n)=-k^2z_1(n)+z_2(n)$. Then one can easily see that $\xi(n)=c(1-k^2)$ is constant for $n \geq 1$. It follows that $z_1(n+1) = b^2 \xi^2(n)+c$ and $z_2=b^2 k^2 \xi^2(n) + c$ are also constant for $n \geq 1$.
\\

\noindent {\bf Case 2:} $a=0$, $b \neq 0$. Then automatically $d=0$, and the system becomes: $z_1(n+1) = (bz_2)^2+c$, $z_2(n+1)=(fz_2)^2+c$. The second equation is decoupled. If $f \neq 0$, one can make the change of variables $\xi = f^2z_2$, and rewrite the equation as $\xi(n+1) = \xi^2+c_f$, where $c_f=f^2c$. It follows from the traditional theory on escape radius for single quadratic maps that $M=\max\{2/f^2,\lvert c \rvert\}$ is an escape radius for $z_2$. Hence the whole system has an escape radius, since $z_1$ only depends on $z_2$. It $f=0$, the system is trivial (both $z_2$ and $z_1$ are constant).

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent {\bf Case 3:} $b=0$, $a \neq 0$. Then automatically $f=0$, and the system becomes $z_1(n+1) = (az_1)^2+c$, $z_2(n+1)=(dz_1)^2+c$. The proof follows similarly with Case 2.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent {\bf Case 4:} $a=b=0$. Then $z_1(n)= c$ for all $n \geq 0$ (constant sequence) and $z_2(n+1)= (dc+fz_2)^2+c$. Withe the change of variable $\xi = f^2z_2+dc$, the second equation becomes: $\xi(n+1) = \xi^2 + c(f^2+d)$, which has an escape radius.\\

\noindent Altogether, these cases imply that the escape radius property remains valid when $\lvert af \rvert = \lvert bd \rvert$, as long as $a+bk^2 \neq 0$. One can easily find singular matrices $A$ (i.e., $af-bd=0$) with $a+bk^2=0$, for which the corresponding system does not satisfy the escape radius property. Take for example $a=1$, $b=-1$, $k=1$, in which case $z_1(n+1)=z_2(n+1)=(z_2-z_1)^2+c$. Initial conditions with arbitrarily large $z_1(0)=z_2(0)$ immediately collapse to $z_1(n)=z_2(n)=c$, for all $n \geq 1$, showing that there is no radius $M>0$ past which orbits automatically escape to infinity. A different and more difficult question is whether there are networks such that, given any large $M$, there are $c$ values for which the critical orbit can grow larger than $N$, but remain asymptotically bounded. This can inform us if we can have a viable computational test for checking whether a $c$ can be unquestionably excluded from the equi-M set of a given network.

\subsection{Synchronization in systems of two coupled maps}

In previous work on CQNs, we showed that nodes can independently have different behaviors, with some nodes remaining bounded, while other nodes in the same coupled network escaping asymptotically to infinity. 

\begin{lemma}
If $z_j$ has a nontrivial input to $z_k$, and if $z_j(n)$ is bounded in $\mathbb{C}$ as $n \to \infty$, then $z_k(n)$ is also bounded.
\label{basic_lemma}
\end{lemma}

\proof{We can assume without loss of generality that $z_1$ is bounded, and that the input $b$ from $z_2$ to $z_1$ is nonzero, and prove that $z_2$ is also bounded. Since $z_1$ is bounded, there exists $M>0$ such that $\lvert z_1(n) \rvert \leq M$, for all $n \geq 0$. Since
$\lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert \geq \lvert az_1 + b z_2 \rvert^2 - \lvert c \rvert$, it follows that $\lvert b z_2 \rvert - \lvert az_1 \rvert  \leq \sqrt{\lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert + \lvert c \rvert}$. Then:
$$\lvert b z_2 \rvert \leq \sqrt{\lvert z_1(n+1) \rvert + \lvert c \rvert} + \lvert a z_1 \lvert \leq \sqrt{M + \lvert c \rvert} + \lvert a \rvert M$$
\noindent Then, if $b \neq 0$, we have, for all $n \geq 0$:
$$\lvert z_1(n) \rvert \leq K = \frac{\leq \sqrt{M + \lvert c \rvert} + \lvert f \rvert M}{\lvert d \rvert}$$

\noindent insuring that $z_2(n)$ is bounded. 

\qed}

\begin{prop}
    If $z_1$ and $z_2$ are nontrivially interconnected (i.e., both $b,d \neq 0$), then they are simultaneously bounded.
    \label{z1z2_bounded}
\end{prop}

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent In previous work, we have looked in particular at the possible behaviors of the components of the critical orbit of the network, and their ``synchronization'' into different clusters with identical bounded versus unbounded behavior. More precisely:

\begin{defn}
For each node $z_k$, $1 \leq k \leq n$, we define the \textbf{node-wise equi-M set} ${\cal M}_k$ as the parameter locus $c \in \mathbb{C}$ for which the component corresponding to the node $z_k$ of the critical multi-orbit is bounded. We say that two network nodes $z_i$ and $z_j$ are \textbf{M-synchronized}, if their equi-M sets ${\cal M}(z_i)$ and ${\cal M}(z_j)$ are identical. We also say that the nodes belong to the same \textbf{M-synchronization cluster} (or simply \textbf{M-cluster}) of the network.
\end{defn}

\noindent In this context, we can reinterpret the results in this sections as

\begin{corol}
If in the network described by \eqref{mother_sys} the nodes $z_1$ and $z_2$ are nontrivially interconnected (i.e., $b,d \neq 0$), then the nodes are simultaneously bounded. In particular, ${\cal M}(z_1) = {\cal M}(z_2)$.
\end{corol}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{figures/d_all.png}
\end{center}
\caption{\emph{\small {\bf Evolution of the equi M set as the value of $d$ increases.} The other entries of the matrix $A$ were fixed to $a=0.6$, $b=0.8$, $f=0.4$. The panel illustrates the equi-M contour (identical between the two nodes), using different colors for different values of $d$, as follows: $d=-0.2$ (grey); $d=0.01$ (cyan); $d=0.1$ (orange); $d=0.3$ (blue, scaling of the traditional Mandelbrot set, since $d$ is the critical values for which $\det(A)=0$); $d=1$ (pink); $d=2$ (green); $d=3$ (brown).}}
\label{d_all}
\end{figure}

\noindent The proof follows directly from Proposition~\ref{z1z2_bounded}. Notice that if in addition the matrix $A$ is singular, then $k=\frac{d}{a} = \frac{f}{b}$ and, with the notation $\xi = (a+bk^2)(az_1+bz_2)$, we have $\xi(n+1) = \xi^2+(a+bk^2)(a+b)c$. The values of $c$ for which $z_1$ and $z_2$ are (simultaneously) bounded are the same as the values of $c$ for which $(a+bk^2)(a+b)c$ is in the traditional Mandelbrot set. Hence the equi M set (identical between the two nodes) is in this case a rescaling of the traditional set. Figure~\ref{d_all} illustrates how the shape of the equi M set of the two synchronized nodes evolves as the value of $d$ increases through the negative and positive range as the other three entries of $A$ are fixed, crossing through the critical value which makes $A$ singular. Notice that, as $d$ is increasing from negative values, the shape slowly approaches that of the traditional Mandelbrot set (achieved for the critical $d=0.3$), and then slowly degrades away from this shape as $d$ continues to increase.

This sheds some light on the effects of the coupling when the nodes are interconnected ($b,d \neq 0$). At the other end of the spectrum, we have the case when the nodes both act independently. This case is trivial, as described in the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
    If $b=d=0$ and $a,f \neq 0$, then the two node-wise equi M sets are both scaled versions of the traditional Mandelbrot set.
\end{lemma}

\proof{We have $z_1(n+1) = (az_1)^2+c$, and $z_2(n+1) = (fz_2)^2+c$. Then $c \in {\cal M}(z_1) \Longleftrightarrow ac \in {\cal M} \Longleftrightarrow {\cal M}(z_1) = \frac{1}{a^2}{\cal M}$. Similarly, ${\cal M}(z_2) = \frac{1}{f^2}{\cal M}$. 
}
\hfill \qed

\vspace{3mm}
A natural question to ask next is whether the nodes need to necessarily be nontrivially interconnected in order to be M-synchronized. The answer to that is negative. The following lemma gives a weaker condition that insures M-synchronization of the two nodes (although it does not deliver the stronger result in Corollary~\ref{z1z2_bounded}).

\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $z_1(n+1) = (az_1)^2 + c$ (decoupled), and $z_2(n+1)=(dz_1+fz_2)^2+c$. Then, for $\lvert f \rvert$ sufficiently small, if the $z_1$ component of the critical orbit is bounded, then the $z_2$ component is also bounded. 
    \label{weak_f}
    \end{lemma}


\proof{ Since $z_1$ is bounded, there exists a large enough $M>0$ such that $z_1(n) \leq M$, for all $n \geq 0$. (Note: the value of $M$ depends on $a$ and $\lvert c \rvert$.) Assume $\lvert f \rvert $ is small enough so that 
\begin{equation}
4M \lvert f d \rvert + 4\lvert f \rvert^2 \lvert c \rvert <1
\end{equation}
Then the discriminant of the quadratic function in $X$
$$h(X) = \lvert f \rvert^2X^2 + (2M\lvert d f \rvert -1)X + M^2 \lvert d \rvert^2 + \lvert c \rvert$$
\noindent is $\Delta = 1 - 4M \lvert f d \rvert - 4\lvert f \rvert^2 \lvert c \rvert > 0$. If we call $X_1<X_2$ the two distinct roots of $h(X)=0$, then the larger root $X_2$is positive. Consider $\max\{X_1,0\}<K<X_2$. Clearly, we have that $h(K)<0$. We will show inductively that $K$ is an upper bound for $z_2(n)$, for all $n \geq 0$. Indeed, $z_2(0)=0<K$. Now suppose $\lvert z_2 \rvert = \lvert z_2(n) \rvert < K$, and consider 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lvert z_2(n+1) \rvert &=& \lvert (d z_1 + f z_2)^2 + c \rvert \leq \lvert d z_1 + f z_2 \rvert ^2 + \lvert c \rvert 
\leq (\lvert d \rvert M + \lvert f z_2 \rvert )^2 + \lvert c \rvert \nonumber\\
\nonumber\\
&=& \lvert d \rvert^2 M^2 + 2\lvert f d \rvert M \lvert z_2 \rvert + \lvert f \rvert^2 \lvert z_2 \rvert^2 + \lvert c \rvert \leq \lvert d \rvert^2 M^2 + 2\lvert f d \rvert M K + \lvert f \rvert^2 K^2 + \lvert c \rvert \nonumber\\
\nonumber\\
&=& h(K)+K < K
\end{eqnarray}

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent Hence $\lvert z_2(n+1) \rvert <K$, and the induction is complete. In conclusion, $K$ is an upper bound for the critical component $z_2$.\\

\noindent {\bf Remark.} Corollary~\ref{f_threshold} states that, if node $z_2$ depends on $z_1$, but $z_1$ does not depend on $z_2$, then a sufficiently weak self-dependence of $z_2$ will still insure M-synchronization. What weak means in this context, and how this bound depends on the other system parameters will become obvious in the proof of the lemma.\\


In Figure~\ref{evolution_f} we illustrate the behavior of the equi M contours for positive values of $f$, as $\lvert f \rvert$ decreases, when the first node is decoupled ($b=0$), for different fixed values of $a \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$. Notice that the nodes eventually synchronize in each case for small enough values of $\lvert f \rvert$. In addition, as expected from the proof of Corollary~\ref{f_threshold},  the threshold depends on the values of $a$ and $d$.

\section{Dynamics in three-node networks}

In this section, we will investigate similar results in three-dimensional networks, i.e., in coupled systems defined by:

\begin{equation}
{\bf z} (n+1) = A{\bf z} + c
\label{3D_system}
\end{equation}

\noindent iterating the variable ${\bf z} = (z_1(n),z_2(n),z_3(n))^t \in \mathbb{C}^3$, with fixed equi-parameter $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and connectivity matrix
$$A = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{array} \right)$$

%\subsection{Cycles and synchronization}

We proved that in two-dimensional CQNs, nontrivial input from a bounded node to another node insures that the receiver is also bounded. While one may expect the same result to hold in higher-dimensional networks, the implication is not trivial, due to the potential interference of the other nodes into the coupled dynamics of the given pair. Below we prove this result for three-dimensional networks, and in a later session we consider the general extension. We phrase the result for nodes $z_1$ and $z_2$, but it is clearly true for any two of the network nodes:

\begin{lemma}
If in a three-dimensional CQN $z_k$ has a nontrivial input to $z_j$ (i.e., $a_{jk} \neq 0$) for some $j \neq k$, and if $z_j$ is bounded, then $z_k$ is also bounded.
\label{link_3D}
\end{lemma}

\proof{ To fix our ideas, we can assume without loss of generality that $z_3$ has a nontrivial input to $z_1$ (hence $a_{13} \neq 0$, and that $z_1$ is bounded, and prove that $z_3$ must be also bounded.

Then, since $z_1$ is bounded and $z_1(n+1)= (a_{11}z_1 + a_{12} z_2 + a_{13} z_3)^2+c$, it follows easily that $a_{12}z_2+a_{13}z_3$ is bounded. Since $a_{13} \neq 0$, call $\ds b=\frac{a_{12}}{a_{13}}$, and it follows that $\xi = bz_2+z_3$ is bounded.

We now distinguish two cases. If $b=0$, then $z_3$ is bounded
%; then, since $z_1$ is bounded and $z_3(n+1) = (a_{31}z_1+a_{32}z_2+a_{33}z_3)^2+c$ and the coefficient $a_{32} \neq 0$, it follows that $z_2$ is bounded, and we are done.

If $b \neq 0$, then rewrite:
\begin{eqnarray*}
z_2(n+1) &=& \left[ a_{21}z_1 + \frac{a_{22}}{b} \xi + \left( a_{23}-\frac{a_{22}}{b} \right)z_3 \right ]^2+c\\
z_3(n+1) &=& \left[ a_{31}z_1 + \frac{a_{32}}{b} \xi + \left( a_{33}-\frac{a_{32}}{b} \right)z_3 \right ]^2+c
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent and calculate 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\xi(n+1) &=& bz_2(n+1)+z_3(n+1) = (A_1 z_1 + A_2 \xi + A_3 z_3)^2+bc + (B_1 z_1 + B_2 \xi + B_3 z_3)^2+c
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent where $A_1 = a_{21}\sqrt{b}$, $\ds A_2 = \frac{a_{22}}{\sqrt{b}}$, $\ds A_3= a_{23}\sqrt{b}-\frac{a_{22}}{\sqrt{b}}$, $B_1=a_{31}$, $\ds B_2={a_{32}}{b}$, $\ds B_3=a_{33}-\frac{a_{32}}{b}$. 

If we call $\psi_1 = A_1z_2 + A_2z_2$, and $\psi_2 = B_1z_1+B_2z_2$, then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\xi(n+1) &=& (\psi_1+A_3z_3)^2+(\psi_2+B_3z_3)^2 + c(b+1)\\\\ &=& (A_3^2+B_3^2)z_3^2+2(A_3\psi_1+B_3\psi_2)z_3+\psi_1^2+\psi_2^2+c(b+1)\\\\
&=& \left[ \sqrt{A_3^2+B_3^2}z_3 
 + \frac{A_3\psi_1+B_3\psi_2}{\sqrt{A_3^2+B_3^2}} \right]^2 + \frac{B_3\psi_1-A_3\psi_2}{A_3^2+B_3^2} + c(b+1)
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent If $A_3^2+B_3^2 \neq 0$, it follows that $z_3$ is bounded (since $z_1$, $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are bounded). 
%Since $b \neq 0$, then $z_2$ is also bounded. 
If, on the other hand, $A_3=B_3=0$, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
z_2(n+1) &=& \left( a_{21}z_1 + \frac{a_{22}}{b} \xi \right )^2+c\\
z_3(n+1) &=& \left( a_{31}z_1 + \frac{a_{32}}{b} \xi  \right )^2+c
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent Since $z_1$ and $\xi$ are bounded, it follows that $z_2$ and $z_3$ are bounded.

\hfill \qed
}

\noindent This result can be rephrased in a few useful directions. First, an extension of Proposition~\ref{z1z2_bounded} to three-dimensional networks follows trivially from Lemma~\ref{link_3D}, saying that, in any three-dimensional CQN, any two nodes linked bidirectionally have automatically the same bounded or unbounded behavior:

\begin{prop}
If, in a three-dimensional CQN with matrix $A$, both $a_{jk} \neq 0$ and $a_{kj} \neq 0$, then $z_j$ and $z_k$ are simultaneously bounded. In particular: ${\cal M}(z_1) = {\cal M}(z_2)$.
\label{zjzk_bounded}
\end{prop}

\noindent A similar statement for three-cycles also follows easily from Lemma~\ref{link_3D}:

\begin{prop}
If a three-dimensional CQN has a cycle including all three nodes, then the nodes are simultaneously bounded. In particular: ${\cal M}(z_1) = {\cal M}(z_2) = {\cal M}(z_3)$.
\end{prop}


\noindent The results can be condensed in a form that facilitates an extension to higher dimensional CQNs: 

\begin{thm}
In any strongly connected component of a three-dimensional CQN, all nodes are simultaneously bounded. 
\label{strong_comp_3D}
\end{thm}

According to Corollary~\ref{path}, we have a nested M sets ${\cal M}(z_3) \subset {\cal M}(z_2) \subset {\cal M}(z_1)$. {\bf C.} The path $z_1$ to $z_2$ to $z_3$ is preserved, hence the Lemma still hold, and subsequently the M set nesting property. However, the additional edge from $z_1$ to $z_2$ changes the shape of ${\cal M}(z_3)$.}}

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\bf Remark.} It is easy to see that the converse of Theorem ~\ref{strong_comp_3D} is not true: nodes can be synchronized without being in the same strongly connected component. For example, see Figure~\ref{3D_example}a for a network in which there is no path between nodes $z_2$ and $z_2$, yet the two nodes are M-synchronized, due to the symmetry of the network, and the equal initial conditions ($z_2(0)=z_3(0)=0$).\\

Using the same technique, the result in Lemma~\ref{link_3D} can be proven for networks of arbitrary dimension. This leads to the following:

\begin{corol}
In any CQN, if there is a path connecting node $z_k$ to node $z_j$ (where $k \neq j$) and $z_j$ is bounded, then $z_k$ is bounded.
\label{path}
\end{corol}

\begin{corol}
If there is a cycle containing nodes $j_1<j_2< \hdots <j_K$ (i.e., $a_{j_i,j_{i+1}} \neq 0$ and $a_{j_K,j_1} \neq 0$) then $z_{j_i}$, $1 \leq i \leq K$ are simultaneously bounded.
\end{corol}

\noindent {\bf Remark.} The converse is not true: two nodes which are simultaneously bounded do not necessarily need to be part of the same strongly connected component. %EXAMPLE.

\subsection{Synchronization of uni-Julia sets}
\label{uniJ}

\color{red}
In the traditional case of single iterated maps, the postcritically bounded parameter locus coincides with the Julia set connectedness locus (the Fatou-Julia theorem). This means that the behavior of the critical orbit (bounded versus unbounded) is determinant of much of the combinatorics of all other orbits. The fact that ``critical'' orbits encode crucial information on the types of trajectories that are accessible to the system is a well-know fact in polynomial iterations (based on results from kneading theory and complex dynamics). Part of our work aims to investigate how this result extends to the context of CQNs. Below, we will remind a possible way to define Julia a set in CQNs (as done in previous work), we discuss how the concept of synchronization applies, and we illustrate the part that synchronization plays in the connection between M and J-synchronization.\\
\color{black}

\begin{defn}
Fix $(c_1,..c_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$. We define the \textbf{node-wise uni-prisoner set} ${\cal P}_k$ for the node $z_k$, $1 \leq k \leq n$, as the parameter locus $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ for which the component corresponding to the node $z_k$ of the multi-orbit of $z_0$ is bounded. The \textbf{node-wise uni-J set} ${\cal J}_k$ corresponding to the node $z_k$ is the boundary of ${\cal P}_k \subset \mathbb{C}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
We say that two network nodes $z_i$ and $z_j$ are \textbf{J-synchronized}, if their uni-J sets  ${\cal J}_i$ and  ${\cal J}_j$ are identical. We also say that the nodes belong to the same \textbf{J-synchronization cluster} (or simply \textbf{J-cluster}) of the network.
\end{defn}

\noindent Figure~\ref{example_5dim_J_clusters} illustrates J-synchronization for the same network as in Figure~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters}, for two values of the parameter $c$: $c=-0.05+0.15i$ (marked as a purple dot in Figure~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters}b), and $c=-0.05+0.2i$ (marked as a brown dot in the parameter complex plane Figure~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters}b). In the first example (with $c$ slightly lower), the five nodes are form three clusters, the members of which are reminiscent of the M-clustering for the same network. The dynamics of node $z_1$ is decoupled from the rest of the network, hence it forms a separate J-cluster (shown in blue), with a J set identical with that for a single map iteration with the corresponding $c=-0.05+0.15i$. Nodes $z_2$, $z_4$ and $z_5$ are J-synchronized (forming the J-cluster shown in cyan). Node $z_3$ forms its own J-cluster, shown in pink.

For the second example ($c=-0.05+0.2i$ slightly higher), the five nodes form five distinct J-clusters. The node $z_1$ still has its own cluster, with a traditional J set slightly perturbed from the first example (since the $c$ has a different value). However, this small perturbation in $c$ has now de-synchonized the rest of the four nodes, which now present with four different uni-J sets. Note that the new value of $c$ (with larger modulus) leads to more fragmented node-wise uni J sets (which is consistent with our previous results on connectivity of uni-J sets). Also notice that the differences between the node-wise uni-J sets for these four nodes are very small (so small that a figure insert was needed to better visualize them).

\end{figure}


This example, together with others from previous work~\cite{radulescu2019asymptotic}, suggest a few basic directions to investigate. First, for a fixed network size $n$, one may ask how M-clusters depend on the network connectivity profile (i.e., on the adjacency matrix and on the edge weights). Second, for a fixed network (which fixes subsequently the M-cluster structure), we may ask how the J-clusters depend on the choice of the parameter $c$. The example seems to suggest that the correspondence between the two types of clustering is not trivial. Hence one may ask how relevant is the relative position of $c$ with respect to the M-clusters in determining the structure of the J-clusters.

Our first simulations suggest that there is a nontrivial relationship between M- and J-synchronization, in the sense that the J-cluster structure is tied to the position of the parameter $c$ in the complex plane. However, it does not seem to be the case that the number of M-clusters for a specific $c$ completely determines the number of J-clusters (as seen when comparing the M-clusters in  Figures~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters} with the J-clusters in Figure~\ref{example_5dim_J_clusters}, for the 5-dimensional network given by the matrix A in our working example.

We want to investigate this dependence a little further. To do so, we computed numerically the node-wise Julia sets for each $c$ in the square $[-0.2,0.2] \times [-0.2,0.2]$ (which includes the two test points illustrated in Figure~\ref{example_5dim_J_clusters}). Then, for each $c$, we estimated the number of J-clusters (identified in Figure~\ref{J_cluster_bookkeep} via a color coding). The contours of the two M set clusters that intersect the region are also overlaid, for comparison.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/bookkeep.png}
\end{center}
\caption{\emph{\small {\bf Number of M-clusters compared to the number of J-clusters in a small region of the complex plane.} For each $c$ value in the region $[-0.2,0.2] \times [-0.2,0.2]$ (sampled with linear step 0.01 in each direction), the uni-Julia set was computed using 50 iterations, with resolution $200 \times 200$ in the $z$-plane. These simulated sets were then used to count the number of J-clusters corresponding to each $c$, and represent this number using the color scheme 1-5 in the legend. The contours of two M sets intersect the region, and are shown in their original colors from Figure~\ref{example_5dim_J_clusters}.}}
\label{J_cluster_bookkeep}
\end{figure}

More specifically: recall  (from Figure~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters}) that the innermost (green) M set contour corresponds to the cluster formed by node $z_3$ alone; the blue contour corresponds to the common cluster formed by the nodes $z_2$, $z_4$ and $z_5$; the original red cluster from Figure~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters}b (corresponding to the independent node $z_1$) is not shown, since it is not in the illustrated range. This chart suggests that there is a central region for the equi-parameter $c \in \mathbb{C}$ (possibly including the M set of $z_3$) characterized by three J clusters (light blue background), and that there is a peripheral region (including the complement of the M set of $z_1$) characterized by two J clusters (dark blue background). Parameters that appear to generate four and five J clusters describe a locus that lies in the transitional region between the other two, in the proximity of the blue M contour. 

The original Figure~\ref{example_5dim_J_clusters} illustrates the J clusters for two values of $c$ marked in Figure~\ref{example_5dim_M_clusters}. Placed in the broader context of Figure~\ref{J_cluster_bookkeep}, these two dots fall respectively into the light blue central region (characterized by three J clusters) and the yellow thin region around the blue M set boundary (representing five J clusters).\\

We also found that the uni J sets of the network exhibit similar clusters. While, these do not precisely coincide with the M clusters, their number and grouping are strongly determined by the node dynamics (i.e., by the equi-parameter value $c$). In fact, for a fixed network, very small perturbations of $c$ can change the J clustering without affecting the postcritical behavior of any of the nodes (i.e., without crossing any node M set boundaries). In other words, small perturbations of the node dynamics within the quadratic family may de-synchronize nodes in a cluster, or synchronize nodes which originally had a different distribution of asymptotic behaviors. In the new regime, an initial condition can escape in components which remained bounded before the perturbation.

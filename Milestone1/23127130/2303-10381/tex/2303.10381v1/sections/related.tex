The rules of the chess game have been incorporated in other formalisms as well but from the different publications it is unclear to what extend they have incorporated the more complicated rules such as castling \cite{Korner&21,Krings&21,Saralaya&11}. Most of the other formal methods analysis of the chess game are considering this from a model checking perspective. Thus, the focus is primarily in analysing the potential future outcome of a game of chess or simply looking into whether a sequence of moves are legal or not. In contrast the work presented in this paper focus more on the most natural way to represent the rules of the chess game. However, in \cite{Krings&21} there is an attempt of first generalising the rules of games before specialising it to different games such as chess. It is possible that this approach could be reused more systematically in the work presented in this paper with advantage as well.

    "abstract": "The game of chess is well-known and widely played all over the world. However, the rules for playing it are rather complex since there are different types of pieces and the ways they are allowed to move depend upon the type of the piece. In this paper we discuss alternative paradigms that can be used for modelling the rule of the chess game using VDM++ and show what we believe is the best model. It is also illustrated how this model can be connected to a standard textual notation for the moves in a chess game. This can be used to combine the formal model to a more convenient interface.",

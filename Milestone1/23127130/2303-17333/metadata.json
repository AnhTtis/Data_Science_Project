    "abstract": "This paper introduces a uniform substitution calculus for $\\mathsf{dL}_\\text{CHP}$, the dynamic logic of communicating hybrid programs. Uniform substitution enables parsimonious prover kernels by using axioms instead of axiom schemata. Instantiations can be recovered from a single proof rule responsible for soundness-critical instantiation checks rather than being spread across axiom schemata in side conditions. Even though communication and parallelism reasoning are notorious for necessitating subtle soundness-critical side conditions, uniform substitution when generalized to $\\mathsf{dL}_\\text{CHP}$ manages to limit and isolate their conceptual overhead. Since uniform substitution has proven to simplify the implementation of hybrid systems provers substantially, uniform substitution for $\\mathsf{dL}_\\text{CHP}$ paves the way for a parsimonious implementation of theorem provers for hybrid systems with communication and parallelism.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we mainly study the regularity of pullback $\\mathcal{D}$-attractors for a nonautonomous nonclassical diffusion equation with delay term $b(t,u_t)$ which contains some hereditary characteristics. Under a critical nonlinearity $f$, a time-dependent force $g(t,x)$ with exponential growth and a delayed force term $b(t,u_t)$, we prove that there exists a pullback $\\mathcal{D}$-attractor $\\mathcal{A}=\\{A(t):t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ in $\\mathbb{K}^1=H_0^1(Ω) \\times L^2((-h,0);L^2(Ω))$ to problem \\eqref{ine01} and for each $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $A(t)$ is bounded in $\\mathbb{K}^2=H^2(Ω) \\cap H_0^1(Ω) \\times L^2((-h,0);L^2(Ω))$.",

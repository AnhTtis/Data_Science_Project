    "abstract": "Our starting point is the measure $ε_x-α_xρ_x^{ω_1}+β_xρ_x^{ω_2}$, where $ρ_x^{ω_i}$ is the harmonic measure relative to $x \\in ω_1 \\subset \\overlineω_1 \\subset ω_2$ and $ω_i$ are concentric balls of $\\R^n$; $α_x$, $β_x$ are functions depending on $x$ and on the radii of $ω_i$, $(i=1,2)$. Generalizing the above measure, we introduce and study the binormal measures as well as their relation to biharmonic functions.",

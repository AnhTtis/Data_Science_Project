    "abstract": "New feebly interacting particles would emerge from a supernova core with 100-MeV-range energies and produce $γ$-rays by subsequent decays. These would contribute to the diffuse cosmic $γ$-ray background or would have shown up in the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite from SN~1987A. However, we show for the example of axion-like particles (ALPs) that, even at distances beyond the progenitor star, the decay photons may not escape, and can instead form a fireball, a plasma shell with $T\\lesssim 1$ MeV. Thus, existing arguments do not exclude ALPs with few 10 MeV masses and a two-photon coupling of a few $10^{-10}~{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$. However, the energy would have showed up in sub-MeV photons, which were not seen from SN 1987A in the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), closing again this new window. A careful re-assessment is required for other particles that were constrained in similar ways.",

    "abstract": "Let $G = (V,E)$ be a finite simple undirected graph without isolated vertices. A bijective map $f: V \\cup E \\rightarrow \\{1,2, \\dots, |V|+ |E| \\}$ is called total local antimagic labeling if for each edge $uv \\in E, w(u) \\ne w(v)$, where $w(v)$ is a weight of a vertex $v$ defined by $w(v) = \\sum_{x \\in NT(v)} f(x)$, where $NT(u) = N(u) \\cup \\{uv: uv\\in E\\}$ is the total open neighborhood of a vertex $u$. Further, $f$ is called super vertex total local antimagic labeling or super edge total local antimagic labeling if $f(V) = \\{1,2, \\dots, |V|\\}$ or $f(E) = \\{1,2, \\dots, |E|\\}$, respectively. The labeling $f$ induces a proper vertex coloring of $G$. The super vertex (edge) total local antimagic chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors used overall colorings of $G$ induced by super vertex (edge) total local antimagic labeling of $G$. In this paper, we have calculated the super vertex (edge) total local antimagic chromatic number of some families of graphs.",

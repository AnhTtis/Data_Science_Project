    "abstract": "Self-oscillations in some oxidation reactions on metal catalysts are associated with periodic oxidation/reduction of the catalyst surface. If the reaction proceeds in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure, then the reaction dynamics is complicated by the mass transfer in the gas phase. In this paper, the reaction in a flow reactor is described by an 1D system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations with an abstract STM-type kinetic model of the surface catalytic reaction. The dependencies of the solution of the system on the reaction parameters, the intensity of diffusion in the adsorption layer, and on the gas flow rate are studied numerically. Solutions such as localized oscillations (\"breathing\" structures) and mobile oxidation/reduction fronts on the catalyst surface are constructed.",

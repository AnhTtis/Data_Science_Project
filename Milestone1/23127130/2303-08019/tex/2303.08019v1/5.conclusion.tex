\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we explored pretrained representations from different modalities for Alzheimer's Disease detection.
Experiments on the ADReSS corpus have shown superior performance by using acoustic and linguistic embeddings, as well as task-related keywords.
Results indicate that the top layers of pretrained acoustic models and the middle layers of pretrained linguistic models provide features that are more important for the AD detection task.
% It also shows that the correlation and richness assisted by the described picture could also help the task.
It also shows that the correlation and richness measured by task-related keywords and described utterances could also help the AD detection task.

Future work will include multimodal pretrained embeddings to model visual-textual relationships, more efficient fusion strategies to boost performance, as well as using acoustic embeddings for automatic and multilingual AD detection tasks.

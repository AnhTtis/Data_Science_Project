abstract = {The Bouncy Particle Sampler is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on a nonreversible piecewise deterministic Markov process. In this scheme, a particle explores the state space of interest by evolving according to a linear dynamics which is altered by bouncing on the hyperplane tangent to the gradient of the negative log-target density at the arrival times of an inhomogeneous Poisson Process (PP) and by randomly perturbing its velocity at the arrival times of an homogeneous PP. Under regularity conditions, we show here that the process corresponding to the first component of the particle and its corresponding velocity converges weakly towards a Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC) process as the dimension of the ambient space goes to infinity. RHMC is another piecewise deterministic non-reversible Markov process where a Hamiltonian dynamics is altered at the arrival times of a homogeneous PP by randomly perturbing the momentum component. We then establish dimension-free convergence rates for RHMC for strongly log-concave targets with bounded Hessians using coupling ideas and hypocoercivity techniques.},

A thorough theoretical analysis often relies on the generator of the semigroup of these processes. In this work, the main theorem establishes that the infinitely differentiable functions with compact support form a core of the generator of a PDMP under assumptions which are typically fulfilled in piecewise-deterministic MCMC schemes such as the RHMC, the BPS or the Zig-Zag. Due to this result, one is often able to focus on test functions in the analysis of these MCMC algorithms which is illustrated on the example of martingale problems at the end of this work.},

We present a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for performing inference in models with multivariate Gaussian priors. Its key properties are: 1) it has simple, generic code applicable to many models, 2) it has no free parameters, 3) it works well for a variety of Gaussian process based models. These properties make our method ideal for use while model building, removing the need to spend time deriving and tuning updates for more complex algorithms.}

abstract = {Recently, a class of stochastic processes known as piecewise deterministic Markov processes has been used to define continuous-time Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with a number of attractive properties, including compatibility with stochastic gradients like those typically found in optimization and variational inference, and high efficiency on certain big data problems. Not many processes in this class that are capable of targeting arbitrary invariant distributions are currently known, and within one subclass all previously known processes utilize linear transition functions. In this work, we derive a process whose transition function is nonlinear through solving its Fokker-Planck equation in hyperspherical coordinates. We explore its behavior on Gaussian targets, as well as a Bayesian logistic regression model with synthetic data. We discuss implications to both the theory of piecewise deterministic Markov processes, and to Bayesian statisticians as well as physicists seeking to use them for simulation-based computation.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider a continuous-time method of approximating a given distribution π using the Langevin diffusion d Lt= d Wt+1/2∇ log π ( Lt) dt. We find conditions under this diffusion converges exponentially quickly to π or does not: in one dimension, these are essentially that for distributions with exponential tails of the form π(x) ∝ exp(-γ |x|β), 0 < β < ∞, exponential convergence occurs if and only if β ≥ 1. We then consider conditions under which the discrete approximations to the diffusion converge. We first show that even when the diffusion itself converges, naive discretizations need not do so. We then consider a 'Metropolis-adjusted' version of the algorithm, and find conditions under which this also converges at an exponential rate: perhaps surprisingly, even the Metropolized version need not converge exponentially fast even if the diffusion does. We briefly discuss a truncated form of the algorithm which, in practice, should avoid the difficulties of the other forms.},

The form of this penalty encourages sparse solutions (with many coefficients equal to 0). We propose the ‘fused lasso’, a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences—i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the ‘hinge’ loss function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

	abstract = {This review treats the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of non-reversible Markov chains in the context of event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC), a continuous-time lifted Markov chain that employs the factorized Metropolis algorithm. It analyzes a number of model applications and then reviews the formulation as well as the performance of ECMC in key models in statistical physics. Finally, the review reports on an ongoing initiative to apply ECMC to the sampling problem in molecular simulation, i.e., to real-world models of peptides, proteins, and polymers in aqueous solution.},

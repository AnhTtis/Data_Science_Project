\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1ex}
In this paper, we introduced {\algname}, the first to automatically design a quantization-friendly  space for target device, which delivers superior INT8 quantized models with SOTA efficiency on real-world edge devices. %Through the use of accuracy look-up-table, built through block-wise quantization, {\algname} efficiently evolves  search space for the optimal quantization-friendly operator type and configurations guided by the Q-T score. 
Extensive experiments on two popular devices demonstrate its effectiveness compared to prior art manual-designed search spaces. %The searched models, {\sysname}, achieve superior performance to SOTA quantized models. 
We plan to apply {\algname} to other hardware efficiency such as energy-efficient search space design in the future.

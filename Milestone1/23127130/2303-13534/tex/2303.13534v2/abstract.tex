% ====================
%
Humankind is entering a novel era of creativity --- an era in which anybody can synthesize digital content.
The % interactional
paradigm under which this revolution takes place is prompt-based learning (or in-context learning).
This paradigm was first applied to adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks without the need for retraining the language model. % in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The paradigm also found fruitful application in text-to-image generation where it is being used to synthesize digital images from zero-shot text prompts in natural language for the purpose of creating AI art.
% Practitioners of prompting for text-to-image generation sometimes call themselves `prompt engineers.'
% In this context,
This activity is referred to as prompt engineering --- the practice of iteratively crafting prompts
% using specific keywords
to generate and improve images.
%
In this paper, we investigate prompt engineering as a novel creative skill for creating prompt-based art.
In three studies with participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we explore whether untrained participants could 1) recognize the quality of prompts, 2) write prompts, and 3) improve their prompts.
% We investigate whether prompt engineering is a skill that participants apply intuitively or whether it is a learned skill that requires expertise.
% We investigate whether laypeople apply the skill intuitively or whether it is a learned skill that is acquired from experimentation and practice.
% We investigate this research question in four studies with participants ($n=355$) recruited from a crowdsourcing platform.
% In three studies, we investigated whether participants could recognize the quality of prompts (Study 1), write prompts (Study 2), and improve prompts (Study 3).
Our results indicate that
    % Our first study shed light on whether people have an understanding of what makes a ``good'' prompt.
    % Interestingly, participants were better able to identify the quality of prompts than images.
    % This is surprising, given the difficulty of the task of imagining the visual outcome of a prompt.
    % % The presence of style modifiers may have been an indicator for workers to rate these prompts higher than prompts without prompt modifiers.
    % %%%ChatGPT:
    % The presence of style modifiers may have influenced participants to rate these prompts higher than prompts without style modifiers.
    % %
    % Our findings nevertheless indicate that
participants could assess the quality of prompts and respective images. This ability increased with the participants' experience and interest in art.
%
Participants further were able to write prompts in rich descriptive language.
% , but did not apply the expert vocabulary needed for producing images of a certain style of quality.
    % and some participants had a good grasp of what makes a prompt successful.
However, even though participants were specifically instructed to generate artworks, participants' prompts were missing the specific vocabulary needed to
% turn images into artworks of
apply a certain style to the generated images.
Our results suggest that prompt engineering is a % non-intuitive
learned skill that requires expertise and practice.
Based on our findings and experience with running our studies with participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we provide ten recommendations for conducting experimental research on text-to-image generation and prompt engineering with a paid crowd.
Our studies offer a deeper understanding of prompt engineering thereby opening up avenues for research on the future of prompt engineering.
We conclude by speculating on four possible futures of prompt engineering.
% and how crowd workers would be affected.
% In this paper, we present an exploration of the potential for crowd workers to contribute to this novel creative economy.
% In four studies with 355 crowd workers, we explore workers' knowledge of Fine Art, understanding of prompt quality, and practical ability to write and improve prompts for text-to-image systems with a specific focus on generating digital artworks.
% Our results indicate that crowd workers can write prompts in rich descriptive language and some workers have a good grasp of what makes a prompt successful.
% We also investigate whether prompt engineering is a skill that we humans apply intuitively or whether it is a learned skill that requires expertise. We conclude by discussing four possible futures of prompt engineering and how crowd workers would be affected.

Some workers correctly identified the style in 100\% of their completed tasks, but none of the artists (top left) and vice versa (bottom right).
Many workers were not able to neither identify the artist name nor artwork style in any of their tasks (bottom left).
However, about 30\% of the workers correctly identified both the artist and style in all of their tasks (top right).}}%

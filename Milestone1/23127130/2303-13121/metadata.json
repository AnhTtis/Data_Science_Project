    "abstract": "We address the challenge of training a large supernet for the object detection task, using a relatively small amount of training data. Specifically, we propose an efficient supernet-based neural architecture search (NAS) method that uses transfer learning and search space pruning. First, the supernet is pre-trained on a classification task, for which large datasets are available. Second, the search space defined by the supernet is pruned by removing candidate models that are predicted to perform poorly. To effectively remove the candidates over a wide range of resource constraints, we particularly design a performance predictor, called path filter, which can accurately predict the relative performance of the models that satisfy similar resource constraints. Hence, supernet training is more focused on the best-performing candidates. Our path filter handles prediction for paths with different resource budgets. Compared to once-for-all, our proposed method reduces the computational cost of the optimal network architecture by 30% and 63%, while yielding better accuracy-floating point operations Pareto front (0.85 and 0.45 points of improvement on average precision for Pascal VOC and COCO, respectively).",

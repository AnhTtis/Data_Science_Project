    "abstract": "Probabilistic diffusion models enjoy increasing popularity in the deep learning community. They generate convincing samples from a learned distribution of input images with a wide field of practical applications. Originally, these approaches were motivated from drift-diffusion processes, but these origins find less attention in recent, practice-oriented publications. We investigate probabilistic diffusion models from the viewpoint of scale-space research and show that they fulfil generalised scale-space properties on evolving probability distributions. Moreover, we discuss similarities and differences between interpretations of the physical core concept of drift-diffusion in the deep learning and model-based world. To this end, we examine relations of probabilistic diffusion to osmosis filters.",

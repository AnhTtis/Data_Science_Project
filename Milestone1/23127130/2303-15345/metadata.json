    "abstract": "We investigate the spectrum of a Laplace operator with mixed boundary conditions in an unbounded chamfered quarter of layer. The geometry depends on two parameters gathered in some vector $κ=(κ_1,κ_2)$ which characterizes the domain at the edges. We identify the essential spectrum and establish different results concerning the discrete spectrum with respect to $κ$. In particular, we show that for a given $κ_1>0$, there is some $h(κ_1)>0$ such that discrete spectrum exists for $κ_2\\in(-κ_1,0)\\cup(h(κ_1),κ_1)$ whereas it is empty for $κ_2\\in[0;h(κ_1)]$. The proofs rely on classical arguments of spectral theory such as the max-min principle. The main originality lies rather in the delicate use of the features of the geometry.",

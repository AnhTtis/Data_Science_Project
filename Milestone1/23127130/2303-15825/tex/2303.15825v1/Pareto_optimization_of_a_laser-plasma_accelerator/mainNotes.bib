@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The scan ranges were chosen as follows: The gas jet was allowed to move within a range of 9 mm in $z$ and 4 mm in $x$. The blade in a range of 2.5mm in $z$ into the jet and 1.5 mm in $x$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="This is calculated using the relative standard deviations $\sigma $ of the individual objectives, \begin {equation} S(\protect \bm  {x}) = \protect \sqrt  {\left ({\protect \frac  {\sigma _{Q}(\protect \bm  {x})}{\mu _Q(\protect \bm  {x})}}\right )^{2}+\left ({\protect \frac  {\sigma _{\sigma _E}({\protect \bm  {x}})}{\mu _{\sigma E}({\protect \bm  {x}})}}\right )^{2}+\left ({\protect \frac  {\sigma _{\Delta E}({\protect \bm  {x}})}{\mu _{\Delta E}({\protect \bm  {x}})}}\right )^{2}} \ . \end {equation} This parameter can be interpreted as the sum of the standard deviations of the marginal distributions for $Q, \sigma _E$ and $\Delta E$ respectively. Therefore minimizing this parameter will also minimize the standard deviation of their joint distribution. We would like to note that this choice of the instability parameter can still be improved. A known issue with this definition is that stability naturally deteriorates as parameters such as the energy spread or distance to target energy are minimized."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="For this purpose, we define the loss function \begin {equation} \ell (\protect \bm  {p}, \protect \bm  {p}') = \protect \qopname  \relax m{max}_{\protect \bm  {p}'\in \protect \mathcal  {P}}\{ {O_{\protect \mathrm  {sing}}(\protect \bm  {p}')}\} - O_{\protect \mathrm  {sing}}(\protect \bm  {p}), \end {equation} which returns a value of zero when the chosen point has the maximum value of the single objective for a given set of hyper-parameters. This loss function is minimized to find the hyper-parameters ($a$, $b$, $c$) of the single objective function."}

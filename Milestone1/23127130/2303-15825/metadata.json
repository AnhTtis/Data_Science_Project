    "abstract": "Optimization of accelerator performance parameters is limited by numerous trade-offs and finding the appropriate balance between optimization goals for an unknown system is challenging to achieve. Here we show that multi-objective Bayesian optimization can map the solution space of a laser wakefield accelerator in a very sample-efficient way. Using a Gaussian mixture model, we isolate contributions related to an electron bunch at a certain energy and we observe that there exists a wide range of Pareto-optimal solutions that trade beam energy versus charge at similar laser-to-beam efficiency. However, many applications such as light sources require particle beams at a certain target energy. Once such a constraint is introduced we observe a direct trade-off between energy spread and accelerator efficiency. We furthermore demonstrate how specific solutions can be exploited using \\emph{a posteriori} scalarization of the objectives, thereby efficiently splitting the exploration and exploitation phases.",

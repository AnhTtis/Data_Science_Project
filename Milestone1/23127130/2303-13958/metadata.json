    "abstract": "Secure quantum communication protocols based on prepare-and-measure scheme employ mutually unbiased bases. In these protocols, a large number of runs, in which different participants measure in different bases, simply go wasted. In this paper, we show that it is possible to reduce the number of such runs by a suitable design of the key generation rule. This results in a significant increase in the key generation rate (KGR). We illustrate this advantage by proposing quantum key distribution protocols and semi-quantum key distribution protocols by employing effective qubits encoded in higher dimensional quantum systems. Since none of them demands the preparation of entangled states as resources and a relatively large amount of information can be transferred, we believe that our proposals are worth pursuing experimentally.",

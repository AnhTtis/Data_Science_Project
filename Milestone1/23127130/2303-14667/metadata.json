    "abstract": "Nuclear charge radius provides a vital role in determining the equation of state (EoS) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter.\n  Based on the correlation between the differences of charge radii of mirror-partner nuclei ($Δ{R_{\\mathrm{ch}}}$) and the slope parameter ($L$) of symmetry energy at the nuclear saturation density, an analysis of the calibrated slope parameter $L$ is performed in finite nuclei. In this work, the relativistic and non-relativistic energy density functionals (EDFs) are employed to make constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy through the available databases of these mirror pairs nuclei $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe. The deduced nuclear symmetry energy is firmly located at the range of 29.89-31.85 MeV and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy essentially covers the range of 22.50-51.55 MeV.",

    "abstract": "Processes of random tessellations of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\geq 1$, are considered which are generated by subsequent division of their cells. Such processes are characterized by the laws of the life times of the cells until their division and by the laws for the random hyperplanes that divide the cells at the end of their life times. Up to now, for this type of tessellations only the existence of the STIT tessellation model was shown. In the paper a sufficient condition for the existence of such cell division tessellation processes is provided and a construction is described. In particular, for the case that the random dividing hyperplanes have a Mondrian distribution -- which means that all cells of the tessellations are cuboids -- it is shown that the intrinsic volumes, except the Euler characteristic, can be used as the parameter for the exponential life time distribution of the cells.",

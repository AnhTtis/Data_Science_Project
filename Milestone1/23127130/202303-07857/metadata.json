    "abstract": "A detailed study of small-scale Hall magnetohydrodynamic dynamo has been\nperformed both analytically and numerically. Assuming the magnetic field and\nthe current to be separate fields, the contribution of the Hall term has been\ndecomposed into two parts and their individual contributions have been studied\nseparately. Calculating the scale-separated transfer rates described in Dar\n\\textit{et. al.} (Physica D, 157 (207), 2001), it is found that the small-scale\ncurrent fields are the primary contributors in sustaining large scale magnetic\nfields. Furthermore, the nature of the scale-to-scale fluxes are found to be\nglobally intact with the ion inertial scale.",

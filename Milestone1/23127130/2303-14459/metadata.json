    "abstract": "A Pfaffian-type Murnaghan-Nakayama rule is derived for the Hecke-Clifford algebra $\\mathcal{H}^c_n$ based on the Frobenius formula and vertex operators. Based on the tableaux realization of Schur's $Q$-functions, the Pfaffina-type Murnaghan-Nakayama rule leads to a combinatorial version. As a consequence, a general formula for the irreducible characters $ζ^{\\la}_μ(q)$ using partition-valued functions is derived. Meanwhile, an iterative formula on the indexing partition $\\la$ via the Pieri rule is also deduced. As applications, some compact formulae are given for special partitions and a symmetric property of the irreducible character is found. We also introduce the spin bitrace as the analogue of the bitrace for the Hecke algebra and derive its general combinatorial formula. Tables of irreducible characters are listed for $n\\leq7.$",

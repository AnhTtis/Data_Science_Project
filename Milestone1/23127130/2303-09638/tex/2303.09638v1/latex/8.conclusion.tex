\section{Conclusion}
This paper offers a new Multi-Site Physiological Monitoring
(MSPM) dataset with multiple contact-based PPG measurements and simultaneous video to enable rPPG from multiple parts of the human body including the face, arms, legs, and neck. We applied various rPPG methods, including CHROM\cite{DeHaan2013}, POS\cite{Wang2017} and RPNet\cite{Speth_IJCB_2021}, to MSPM samples and performed pulse rate estimation on all face and non-face body regions. We observed that the heart rate estimation from non-face body parts, especially palm and arms, showed a promising accuracy compared to face-based rPPG. However, the deep learning-based (3D-CNN) approach evaluated in this paper, and trained entirely on facial data, learned spatial pulse estimation priors which disrupted its ability to generalize to non-facial regions. This suggests that training deep learning rPPG systems using non-facial regions may be needed to offer good fidelity for rPPG outside the face region. We also positively verified a possibility to apply rPPG to estimate pulse transit times (PTT) between various body parts by comparing rPPG-based PTT with PPG-based PTT. We believe that these baseline experiments along with the new MSPM dataset opens an interesting research area focused on non-face multi-site rPPG.

    "abstract": "Proto-neutron stars are born when a highly evolved and massive star collapses under gravity. In this paper, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in proto-neutron stars. Based on the scalar tensor theory of gravity as well as the physical conditions in proto-neutron star, we examine the structure of proto-neutron star. To describe the fluid in proto-neutron star, we utilize $SU(2)$ chiral sigma model and the finite temperature extension of the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone quantum many-body theory in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation. Here, we apply the equation of state of proto-neutron stars considering different cases i.e. hot pure neutron matter and hot $β$-stable neutron star matter without neutrino trapping as well as with neutrino trapping. The effects of temperature and entropy of proto-neutron stars on the star structure are also studied. Our results confirm that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by different physical conditions in proto-neutron stars.",

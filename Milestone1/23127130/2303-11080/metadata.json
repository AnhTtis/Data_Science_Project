    "abstract": "In this manuscript, we examine the gravitational radiation emitted by binary systems using an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to gravitons. Recoil is incorporated into the system via a kinetic energy term in the energy gap of the detector. We find a splitting of the gravitational wave frequency due to the recoil. Implications for the recoil velocity and force are discussed.",

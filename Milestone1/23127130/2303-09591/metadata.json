    "abstract": "Quantum criticality typically lies outside the bounds of the conventional Landau paradigm. Despite its significance, there is currently no generic paradigm to replace the Landau theory for quantum phase transition, partly due to the rich variety of quantum orders. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of quantum criticality based on a novel geometric approach. Instead of focusing on microscopic orderings, our approach centers on the competition of commuting operators, which can be best investigated through the boundary geometry of their expectation values. We demonstrate that the quantum phase transition occurs precisely at the zero-curvature point on this boundary, which implies the competing operators are maximally commuting at the critical point.",

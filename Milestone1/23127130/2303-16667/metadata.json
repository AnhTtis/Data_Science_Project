    "abstract": "Fock states are quantized states of electromagnetic waves with diverse applications in quantum optics and quantum communication. However, generation of arbitrary optical Fock states still remains elusive. Majority of Fock state generation proposals rely on precisely controlling the atom-cavity interactions and are experimentally challenging. We propose a scheme to distill an optical Fock state from a coherent state. A conditional phase flip (CPF) with arbitrary phase is implemented between the atom and light. The CPF along with the unitary rotations and measurements on the atoms enables us to distil required Fock-state. As an example, we show the distillation of Fock-sate $\\ket{100}$.",

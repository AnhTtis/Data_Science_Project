    "abstract": "Existing modularity-based community detection methods attempt to find community memberships which can lead to the maximum of modularity in a fixed graph topology. In this work, we propose to optimize the graph topology through the modularity maximization process. We introduce a modularity-guided graph optimization approach for learning sparse high modularity graph from algorithmically generated clustering results by iterative pruning edges between two distant clusters. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first attempt for using modularity to guide graph topology learning. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-world data sets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art graph construction methods by a large margin. Our experiments show that with increasing modularity, the accuracy of graph-based clustering algorithm is simultaneously increased, demonstrating the validity of modularity theory through numerical experimental results of real-world data sets. From clustering perspective, our method can also be seen as a self-boosting clustering method.",

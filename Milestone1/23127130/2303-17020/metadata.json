    "abstract": "For random matrices with block correlation structure we show that the fluctuations of linear eigenvalue statistics are Gaussian on all mesoscopic scales with universal variance that coincides with that of the Gaussian unitary or Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, depending on the symmetry class of the model. Block correlations appear in linearizations of non-commutative polynomials and rational functions in several random matrices. This is used in the companion paper to prove the mesoscopic central limit theorem for such models.",

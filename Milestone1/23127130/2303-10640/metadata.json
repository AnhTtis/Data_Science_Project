    "abstract": "By refining Holley's free energy technique, we show that, under quite general assumptions on the dynamics, the attractor of a (possibly non-translation-invariant) interacting particle system in one or two spatial dimensions is contained in the set of Gibbs measures if the dynamics admits a reversible Gibbs measure. In particular, this implies that there can be no reversible interacting particle system that exhibits time-periodic behaviour and that every reversible interacting particle system is ergodic if and only if the reversible Gibbs measure is unique. In the special case of non-attractive stochastic Ising models this answers a question due to Liggett.",

abstract="Automatic deception detection has been extensively studied considering their applicability in various real-life applications. Since humans will express the deception through non-verbal behavior that can be recorded in a non-intrusive manner, the deception detection from video using automatic techniques can be devised. In this paper, we present a novel technique for the video-based deception technique using Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network. The proposed method uses the sequential input that can capture the spatiotemporal information to capture the non-verbal behavior from the video. The deep features are extracted from the sequence of frames using a pre-trained GoogleNet CNN. To effectively learn the extended sequence, the bi-directional LSTMs are connected to the GoogleNet and can be jointly trained to learn the perceptual representation. Extensive experiments are carried out on a publicly available dataset [5] with 121 deceptive and truthful video clips reflecting a real-life scenario. Obtained results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method when compared with the four different state-of-the-art techniques.",

abstract="A face morphing attack image can be verified to multiple identities, making this attack a major vulnerability to processes based on identity verification, such as border checks. Various methods have been proposed to detect face morphing attacks, however, with low generalizability to unexpected post-morphing processes. A major post-morphing process is the print and scan operation performed in many countries when issuing a passport or identity document. In this work, we address this generalization problem by adapting a pixel-wise supervision approach where we train a network to classify each pixel of the image into an attack or not, rather than only having one label for the whole image. Our pixel-wise morphing attack detection (PW-MAD) solution proved to perform more accurately than a set of established baselines. More importantly, PW-MAD shows high generalizability in comparison to related works, when evaluated on unknown re-digitized attacks. Additionally to our PW-MAD approach, we create a new face morphing attack dataset with digital and re-digitized samples, namely the LMA-DRD dataset that is publicly available for research purposes upon request.",

ABSTRACT = {Face morphing and related morphing attacks have emerged as a serious security threat for automatic face recognition systems and a challenging research field. Therefore, the availability of effective and reliable morphing attack detectors is strongly needed. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a double Siamese architecture to tackle the morphing attack detection task in the differential scenario, in which two images, a trusted live acquired image and a probe image (morphed or bona fide) are given as the input for the system. In particular, the presented framework aimed to merge the information computed by two different modules to predict the final score. The first one was designed to extract information about the identity of the input faces, while the second module was focused on the detection of artifacts related to the morphing process. Experimental results were obtained through several and rigorous cross-dataset tests, exploiting three well-known datasets, namely PMDB, MorphDB, and AMSL, containing automatic and manually refined facial morphed images, showing that the proposed framework was able to achieve satisfying results.},

abstract="Face morphing attacks create face images that are verifiable to multiple identities. Associating such images to identity documents lead to building faulty identity links, causing attacks on operations like border crossing. Most of previously proposed morphing attack detection approaches directly classified features extracted from the investigated image. We discuss the operational opportunity of having a live face probe to support the morphing detection decision and propose a detection approach that take advantage of that. Our proposed solution considers the facial landmarks shifting patterns between reference and probe images. This is represented by the directed distances to avoid confusion with shifts caused by other variations. We validated our approach using a publicly available database, built on 549 identities. Our proposed detection concept is tested with three landmark detectors and proved to outperform the baseline concept based on handcrafted and transferable CNN features.",

ABSTRACT = {Face-morphing operations allow for the generation of digital faces that simultaneously carry the characteristics of two different subjects. It has been demonstrated that morphed faces strongly challenge face-verification systems, as they typically match two different identities. This poses serious security issues in machine-assisted border control applications and calls for techniques to automatically detect whether morphing operations have been previously applied on passport photos. While many proposed approaches analyze the suspect passport photo only, our work operates in a differential scenario, i.e., when the passport photo is analyzed in conjunction with the probe image of the subject acquired at border control to verify that they correspond to the same identity. To this purpose, in this study, we analyze the locations of biologically meaningful facial landmarks identified in the two images, with the goal of capturing inconsistencies in the facial geometry introduced by the morphing process. We report the results of extensive experiments performed on images of various sources and under different experimental settings showing that landmark locations detected through automated algorithms contain discriminative information for identifying pairs with morphed passport photos. Sensitivity of supervised classifiers to different compositions on the training and testing sets are also explored, together with the performance of different derived feature transformations.},

abstract="This paper introduces a topological approach to detection of image tampering for forensics purposes. This is based on the emerging Topological Data Analysis (TDA) concept of persistent homological invariants associated with certain image features. Image features of interest are pixels that have a uniform Local Binary pattern (LBP) code representing texture feature descriptors. We construct the sequence of simplicial complexes for increasing sequence of distance thresholds whose vertices are the selected set of pixels, and calculate the corresponding non-increasing sequence of homology invariants (number of connected components). The persistent homology of this construction describes the speed with which the sequence terminates, and our tamper detection scheme exploit its sensitivity to image tampering/degradation. We test the performance of this approach on a sufficiently large image dataset from a benchmark dataset of passport photos, and show that the persistent homology sequence defines a discriminating criterion for the morphing attacks (i.e. distinguishing morphed images from genuine ones).",

A morphed face in an electronic machine readable travel document may allow a wanted criminal to illicitly cross a border. This paper describes an improvement of our ongoing web-based experiment for a border control simulation in which human examiners should first detect high-resolution morphed face images and second match potentially morphed document images against "live" faces of travelers. The error rates of humans in both parts of the experiment are compared with those of automated morphing detectors and face recognition systems. This experiment improves understanding the capabilities and limits of humans in withstanding the face morphing attack as well as the factors influencing their performance.},

abstract = "Artificial neural networks tend to use only what they need for a task. For example, to recognize a rooster, a network might only considers the rooster’s red comb and wattle and ignores the rest of the animal. This makes them vulnerable to attacks on their decision making process and can worsen their generality. Thus, this phenomenon has to be considered during the training of networks, especially in safety and security related applications. In this paper, we propose neural network training schemes, which are based on different alternations of the training data, to increase robustness and generality. Precisely, we limit the amount and position of information available to the neural network for the decision making process and study their effects on the accuracy, generality, and robustness against semantic and black box attacks for the particular example of face morphing attacks. In addition, we exploit layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to analyze the differences in the decision making process of the differently trained neural networks. A face morphing attack is an attack on a biometric facial recognition system, where the system is fooled to match two different individuals with the same synthetic face image. Such a synthetic image can be created by aligning and blending images of the two individuals that should be matched with this image. We train neural networks for face morphing attack detection using our proposed training schemes and show that they lead to an improvement of robustness against attacks on neural networks. Using LRP, we show that the improved training forces the networks to develop and use reliable models for all regions of the analyzed image. This redundancy in representation is of crucial importance to security related applications."

abstract = {Many studies have shown better recognition for faces we have greater experience with, relative to unfamiliar faces. However, it is still not clear if and how the representation of faces changes during the process of familiarization. In a previous study, we discovered a subset of facial features, for which we have high perceptual sensitivity (PS), that were critical for determining the identity of unfamiliar faces. This was done by assigning values to 20 different facial features based on perceptual rating, converting faces into feature-vectors, and measuring the correlations between face similarity ratings and distances between feature-vectors. In the current study, we examined the contribution of high and low-PS features to face identity after familiarization. To familiarize participants with unfamiliar faces, we used an individuation training protocol that was found to be effective in previous studies, in which different names are assigned to different faces and participants are asked to learn the face-name association. Our findings show that even after repeated exposure to the same image of each identity, which allows close examination of all facial features, only high-PS features contributed to face identity, while low-PS features did not. This subset of high-PS features includes both internal and external features and part and configuration features. We therefore conclude that identification of familiarized and unfamiliar faces may rely on the same subset of critical features. These findings further support a new categorization of facial features according to their perceptual sensitivity.}

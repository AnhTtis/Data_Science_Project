\subparagraph*{Shortest Paths To/From Edges.}
\label{sec:shortest-paths}

As basic tools, we need \reviewerchange{linear-time algorithms} to find  shortest paths from a  given  point to all edges of the polygon, and to find shortest paths from a  given  edge to all  vertices of the polygon.
See Appendix~\ref{appendix:shortest-paths}.

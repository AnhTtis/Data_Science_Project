    \caption{\textbf{Consistency:} Vertical slices of a rendered novel camera path show the consistency across varying viewpoints. The original NeRF rendering (top) is quite consistent, similar to our edited result (middle), using the prompt \textit{``turn him into a clown"}. Conversely, running InstructPix2Pix~\cite{brooks2022instructpix2pix} on each rendered frame independently results in notable inconsistency, such as varying hair and shirt colors.}

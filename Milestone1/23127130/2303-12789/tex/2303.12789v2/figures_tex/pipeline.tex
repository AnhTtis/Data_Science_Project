    \caption{\textbf{Overview}: Our method gradually updates a reconstructed NeRF scene by iteratively updating the dataset images while training the NeRF: (1) an image is rendered from the scene at a training viewpoint, (2) it is edited by InstructPix2Pix given a global text instruction, (3) the training dataset image is replaced with the edited image, and (4) the NeRF continues training as usual.}

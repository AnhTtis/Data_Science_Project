We introduced IRFL, a dataset of Figurative and Literal images for idioms, metaphors, and similes. We introduced two novel tasks as a benchmark for figurative understanding. Our tasks are easy for humans and challenging for state-of-the-art models. We provided an extensive evaluation of the dataset. \\\\Our pipeline has several limitations. Future work can focus on improving the pipeline, in particular, improving the quality of figurative candidates for idioms, and increasing the automation for metaphors and similes. We hope that the IRFL dataset and benchmark will drive the development of models that will better understand figurative language.

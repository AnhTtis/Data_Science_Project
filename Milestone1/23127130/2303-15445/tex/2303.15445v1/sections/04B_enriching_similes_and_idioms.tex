We want to find literal and figurative images for each idiom we collected from the MAGPIE dataset. For that, we collect the idioms' definitions from online dictionaries and parse them into ``search queries''. We first search Wiktionary for each idiom's definition and scrape the data using a web crawler. In case no definitions are found, we search the Oxford Dictionary and collect definitions using a similar method. The definitions in Wiktionary are usually tagged with the context in which they appear. For example, the idiom ``white hat'' has the ``figurative'' definition of ``A good person; a hero'', and the ``slang'' definitions of ``a sailor'' and ``A well-meaning hacker''. We collect this data and filter idioms with no ``figurative'' or ``idiomatic'' definitions. We then construct search queries by parsing the ``figurative'' and ``idiomatic'' definitions of idioms \footnote{We also construct search queries from untagged definitions. Even though untagged definitions are rare (1-2\% of all definitions), they are typically idiomatic.}. The parsing process separates definitions that are in fact several definitions concatenated into one. For example, we split the definition ``A good person; a hero'' into two search queries ``A good person'' and ``A hero''. In some rare cases, a definition may be an idiom, and to tackle such cases, we replace the idiom with its definitions.

To examine whether generative models can generate figurative images, we sampled 15 idioms from the IRFL dataset and experimented with the idioms and their definitions as input to Dall E and Stable Diffusion. We annotated $345$ generated images and found that generative models failed to generate figurative images for given idioms but instead generated literal images. When provided with the definitions as input, the models succeeded in creating figurative images to some extent. Statistics on the generated images and the matching IRFL images can be seen in Table \ref{tab:generative-models-statistics}.\\

\newline The experiment results show that our pipeline extracted more Figurative, Figurative literal, and Caption images and fewer None images than the generative models. Future work might focus on the quality of generative models' figurative images and the emotions they evoke.

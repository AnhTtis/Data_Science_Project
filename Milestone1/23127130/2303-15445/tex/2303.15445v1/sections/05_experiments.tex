% The task is discriminative for humans, the annotators were able to distinguish between the different relations of image and the idiomatic phrase without coordination.

\subsection{Understanding Task}
\label{sec:understanding_task}
The figurative understanding task evaluates VL-PTMs’ ability to understand the relation between an image and a figurative phrase. The task is to choose the image that best visualizes the figurative phrase out of X candidates. Our goal was to create an understanding task that consists of ``mixed'' candidate types and represents the richness of our dataset. The ``mixed'' tasks provide a holistic image of the figurative understanding of vision and language models. We constructed and crowdsourced $810$ ``mixed'' figurative understanding task instances for idioms, metaphors, and similes. \\\\
\noindent The basic structure of all ``mixed'' instances is the same. Each instance contains four candidates, of which one is the correct answer, and $1-3$ candidates are partially literal distractors. The ``mixed'' idiom instances have one to two partially literal distractors and one to two random images. The simile ``mixed'' instances contain a distractor image of the target concept without the compared property or with its antonym visualized, a distractor image of the source concept, and one random image. The metaphor ``mixed'' instances consist of between one to three partially literal distractors, and the remaining candidates are random images. In $65\%$ of the idioms understanding task instances, the correct answer is ``Figurative'', and in the other $35\%$, the correct answer is ``Figurative  Literal''. Figure~\ref{fig:first-task-idiom-figurative} shows two examples of the ``mixed'' figurative understanding task for metaphor and simile.

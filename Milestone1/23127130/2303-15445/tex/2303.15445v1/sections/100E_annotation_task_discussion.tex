The nature of the image annotation task is very subjective, and often the relation worker A sees between an idiom and an image differs from the relation worker B sees. The connection a worker sees between an image and an idiom can vary based on his understanding of the image scene and his interpretation of that scene. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:tiget_by_the_tail} shows a "Caption" image of a person holding a tiger by the tail in a non-dangerous or difficult situation in which one should not remain. The person is smiling as it seems like he is playing with a very young tiger (small in size). The majority of workers agreed with this explanation, except one who disagreed and chose the "Figurative Literal" category. This worker's interpretation arose from her viewpoint as a mother, and she said, "as a mother, I would still say that it's dangerous and the person is being foolish".\\\\

\noindent Another example of different interpretations is the image seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cowboy_bunny}, which shows an image of a cowboy bunny drawing with the idiom - "quick on the draw". The annotations of this image were very diverse as $5$ workers chose $4$ different categories. Two workers chose "Figurative" as they saw a connection to the idiom definitions. One worker chose "Figurative Literal" as he saw a connection to the idiom definitions and a literal connection to the idiom. Another worker chose "Caption" because he did not find the image to be "Figurative" and saw the idiom literally as illustrating the image. The last worker selected "None" as he did not find a clear literal connection and didn't see the image as "Figurative" as it lacked an indication that the bunny was "quick to act" or "characterized by rapid response".

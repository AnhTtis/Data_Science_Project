Our goal is to find literal and figurative images for each idiom from the MAGPIE dataset. Searching for an idiom using image search often results in literal images. To find figurative images, we need to understand the \emph{meaning} of the idiom; however, the MAGPIE dataset does not contain idiom definitions, so we crawl them from online dictionaries (Wiktionary definitions tagged with `figurative'' or ``idiomatic''\footnote{We also construct search queries from untagged definitions. Even though untagged definitions are rare (<3\%), they are typically idiomatic.}; if no such definitions exist, we try the Oxford Dictionary).

For example, in Figure \ref{fig:figurative-pipeline}, the idiom ``white hat'' nd is defined as ``A good person; a hero'' (tagged with ``idiomatic''), and also as ``a sailor'' and ``A well-meaning hacker'' (tagged with ``slang"). 

%To accomplish this, we use the idioms and their definitions as search queries for an image search engine.  For each idiom, we search Wiktionary for definitions, and if no definitions are found, we search the Oxford Dictionary. Wiktionary definitions are usually accompanied by tags that indicate the context in which they appear. For example, the idiom ``white hat'' and its definition ``A good person; a hero'' is tagged with "figurative" and "idiomatic" tags, and the definitions ``a sailor'' and ``A well-meaning hacker'' are tagged with a "slang" tag. Using this data, we filter idioms with no ``figurative'' or ``idiomatic'' tags and construct search queries from these definitions \footnote{We also construct search queries from untagged definitions. Even though untagged definitions are rare (<3\%), they are typically idiomatic.}. 
We split concatenated definitions (e.g., ``A good person; a hero'' is split into two definitions). %concatenated into one. For example, we split the definition ``A good person; a hero'' into two search queries ``A good person'' and ``A hero''. 
In some rare cases, a definition may be another idiom, and then we replace that idiom with its definitions.

We then searched Google images for the idioms and their definitions, taking up to $20$ images per search query. Images were searched with ``SafeSearch'' flag ``on'', and in ``United States'' region.

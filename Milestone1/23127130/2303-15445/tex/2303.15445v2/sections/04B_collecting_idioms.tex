We collected $628$ idioms from the MAGPIE corpus \citep{haagsma-etal-2020-magpie} of idiomatic expressions. The MAGPIE corpus contains $56,622$ crowdsourced potentially idiomatic expressions, covering $1,756$ unique idioms that appear in at least two of the following dictionaries: Wiktionary, Oxford Dictionary of English Idioms, and UsingEnglish.com. After collecting the idioms, we feed them into our pipeline. 

Our pipeline consists of four main steps, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:figurative-pipeline}. Given an idiom, we first get its definitions from online dictionaries and parse them into search queries (\S\ref{sec:enriching_similes_and_idioms}). Second, we search for candidate images using the search queries. Third, we filter the images and select the best $k$ literal and figurative candidates for annotation (\S\ref{sec:choosing_images}). Lastly, we annotate the different images via crowdworkers (\S\ref{sec:human_annotation}).

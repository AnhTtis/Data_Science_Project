\caption{The performance of Supervised and Zero-shot models, both when provided with only idioms and when provided with idioms along with their definitions. During training, the supervised model received the same input configuration as it was tested on. Compared to zero-shot results, the supervised results are about $3.6-9\times$ better in the figurative category, while figurative-literal results improved by $13-20\%$.}

Idiomatic expressions can sometimes be used as slang for cursing or passing inappropriate messages. We've ensured every query and idiom passes through automatic and manual verification, preventing inappropriate content from infiltrating our dataset. This approach is also applied to the selection of images, considering that idiom definitions can be abstract and appear in varied contexts. We've excluded any visuals we found inappropriate to minimize the potential harm that could come from offensive or inappropriate material. As we do not own or distribute the images used, we will provide their links and acknowledgment to the website they originated from.

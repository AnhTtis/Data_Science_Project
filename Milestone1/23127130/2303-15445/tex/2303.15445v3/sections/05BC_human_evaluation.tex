We asked annotators that did not work on previous IRFL tasks to solve the multimodal figurative language detection task. Each instance of the ``mixed'' multimodal detection task was annotated by $5$ annotators, and the correct answer was chosen by the majority. We find that human performance on the data sampled for all figures of speech ranges between $90\%-100\%$ (Table~\ref{tab:mixed-single-choice-results}). Additionally, in $82\%-99\%$ of the instances, there was an agreement between at least four annotators compared to a random chance of $6\%$. Samples from the validation process are presented in Appendix \ref{sec:task_samples}.

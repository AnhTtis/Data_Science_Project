%Common sense is a topic of increasing interest \cite{Yejin2022Commonsense}. Many commonsense reasoning tasks have been proposed, both in NLP \citep{zellers2019hellaswag,sap2019atomic,forbes2019neural,saha-etal-2021-explagraphs}, and computer vision \citep{Marino2019OKVqa, zellers2019recognition, Park2020VisualCOMETRA, bitton2023breaking} ranging from physical context \citep{bisk2020piqa} to social interactions \citep{Sap2019}.

Commonsense is a topic of increasing interest.
Particularly relevant lines of work deal with abstractions, associations, and analogies \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2102-10717,Ji2022Kilogram,Bitton2022WinoGAViLGA}, all required for understanding figurative language. For example, understanding ``as stubborn as a mule'' requires the commonsense (false) association between mules and stubbornness. % (where in fact, they are not). %The metaphor ``John is a fox'' uses the association of foxes with slyness.
% Aesop's ``The Fox and the Crow,'' painted the fox as a very crafty and cunning hunter.

%Our automated pipeline is designed specifically for idioms, which presents certain limitations. Creating search queries to find figurative images for metaphors and other figures of speech poses considerable challenges. Furthermore, 
Our dataset focuses on English idioms. As translation of figurative expressions is a particularly delicate task, it is not straightforward to expand our dataset to other languages, and further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of our pipeline to other languages. In addition, our method heavily relies on sources of figurative expressions, their definitions, and the image search engine.

%so generating multimodal figurative language datasets for non-English idioms may be problematic due to the absence of corresponding textual datasets. In addition, the methods and heuristics we've employed may not be suitable for other languages.

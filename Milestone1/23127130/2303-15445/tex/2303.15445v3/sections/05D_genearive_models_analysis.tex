In our work so far, we focused on finding existing images matching a figurative expression. We now explore the question of whether generative models can \emph{generate} figurative images. We sampled $15$ idioms from the IRFL dataset and experimented with the idioms and their definitions as input to Dall-E \cite{ramesh2021zero} and Stable Diffusion \cite{rombach2022high}. We annotated $345$ generated images and found that generative models failed to generate figurative images for given idioms, generating literal images instead. When provided with the definitions as input, the models had some more success in creating figurative images. Statistics on the generated images can be seen in Table \ref{tab:generative-models-statistics}. We also included the percentage of images from each category found by our pipeline.

\input{tables/generative_models_statistics.tex}

The results show that our pipeline extracted more Figurative, Figurative+Literal, and Literal images and fewer None images than the generative models managed to generate. %Future work might focus on the quality of generative models' figurative images and the emotions they evoke.

In this work we introduced IRFL, a dataset of Figurative and Literal images for idioms, metaphors, and similes. We developed two novel tasks as a benchmark for multimodal figurative language understanding. Our experiments demonstrate that the tasks are easy for humans and challenging for state-of-the-art vision and language models. 
We publish our dataset, benchmark, and code. 

In the future, we hope to extend this work to other modalities and different forms of figurative speech. In addition, there are interesting cross-cultural connections between figurative expressions. For example, the English expression ``cost an arm and a leg'' (meaning expensive) has a corresponding expression in French: ``Coûter les yeux de la tête'' (literally, cost the eyes of the head). Adapting our ideas to languages other than English, taking advantage of such connections, is another promising direction.

We believe that multimodal figurative language is an essential aspect of human communication that is under-explored in AI; we hope that this work will encourage the development of multimodal models that can better understand figurative language.  

More broadly, metaphorical reasoning
is strongly tied to problem-solving and creativity;
we believe that models that can see analogies between situations that share very little on the surface could find many potential applications.

    "abstract": "In this paper we prove a group theoretic analogue of the well known local nilpotence theorem for sandwich Lie algebras due to Kostrikin and Zel'manov. We introduce the notion of a strong left 3-Engel element of a group G and show that these are always in the locally nilpotent radical of G. This generalises a previous result of Jabara and Traustason that showed that a left 3-Engel element a of a group G is in the locally nilpotent radical of G whenever a is of odd order.",

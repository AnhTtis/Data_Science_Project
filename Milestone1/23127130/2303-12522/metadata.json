    "abstract": "We construct unique regular solutions to the minimal nonlinear system of the 1d thermoelasticity. The obtained solution has a positive temperature. Our approach is based on an estimate, using the Fisher information, which seems completely new in this context. It is combined with a recent inequality in [2] and embeddings, which allows us to obtain a new energy estimate. The latter is used in a half-Galerkin procedure yielding global solutions. The uniqueness and further regularity of such solutions are obtained.",

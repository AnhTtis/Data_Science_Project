    "abstract": "We consider two models which couple derivatives of the inflaton to ordinary matter, both to fermions and to scalars. Such couplings induce changes to the inflaton kinetic energy, analogous to the cosmological Coleman-Weinberg potentials which come from nonderivative couplings. Our purpose is to investigate whether these quantum-induced K-Essence models can provide efficient reheating without affecting the observational constraints on primordial inflation. Our numerical studies of both models show that both properties cannot be simultaneously preserved.",

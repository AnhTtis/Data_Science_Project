    "abstract": "In this work, we study cosmological solutions of the 8-dimensional Einstein Yang-Mills theory coupled to a perfect-fluid matter. A Yang-Mills instanton of extra dimensions causes a 4-dimensional expanding universe with dynamic compactification of the extra dimensions. To construct physically reliable situations, we impose the null energy condition on the matter. This energy condition is affected by the extra dimensions. Then, we consider cosmological constant to grasp the structure of the solution space. Even in this simple case, we find several interesting solutions, such as bouncing universes and oscillatory solutions, eventually arriving at a de Sitter universe with stabilized compact dimensions. In addition, we consider a class of matters whose energy density depends on the volume of the extra dimensions. This case shows another set of bouncing universes. Also, a real scalar with potential is taken into account. The scalar field model admits de Sitter solutions due to the choice of potential, and we demonstrate how potentials can be constructed using flow equations.",

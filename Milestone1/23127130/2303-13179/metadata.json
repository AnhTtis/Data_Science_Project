    "abstract": "We establish some similarities/analogies between uncountable cardinals or powersets and the class $V$ of all sets. They concern mainly the Boolean algebras ${\\cal P}(κ)$, for a regular cardinal $κ$, and ${\\cal C}(V)$ (the class of subclasses of the universe $V$), endowed with some ideals, especially the ideal $[κ]^{<κ}$ for ${\\cal P}(κ)$, and the ideal of sets $V$ for ${\\cal C}(V)$.",

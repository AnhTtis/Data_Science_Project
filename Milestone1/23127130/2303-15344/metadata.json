    "abstract": "The theory of multiplexing electromagnetic signals by means of twisted photons generated by a uniform circular array is developed in the case when the receiving antenna represents an array of elements located on a circular arc. The notion of discrete twisted photons of the order $N$ is introduced and orthogonality of these modes modulo $N$ is established. Both paraxial and planar discrete twisted photons are considered. It is shown that in the simplest scenario a $K$ times decrease of the circular arc where the receiving array antenna is placed results in a $K$ times decrease of the number of independent information channels. In the more sophisticated approach, one can restore all $N\\gg1$ independent information channels in receiving the signal by an array antenna with $N$ elements located on a circular arc with the central angle $2π/K$. However, this problem becomes rapidly ill-conditioned as one increases $K$. The method mitigating this issue is described. The estimates for the corresponding condition numbers are found.",

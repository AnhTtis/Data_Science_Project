    "abstract": "We provide the first example of a geometric transition that resolves the Schwarzschild black hole into a smooth microstructure in eleven-dimensional supergravity on a seven-torus. The geometry is indistinguishable from a Schwarzschild black hole dressed with a scalar field in four dimensions, referred to as a Schwarzschild scalarwall. In eleven dimensions, the scalar field arises as moduli of the torus. The resolution occurs at an infinitesimal scale above the horizon, where it transitions to a smooth bubbling spacetime supported by M2-brane flux.",

    "abstract": "In this short note, we show that the number of monogenic submonoids of the full transformation monoid of degree $n$ for $n > 0$, equals the sum of the number of cyclic subgroups of the symmetric groups on $1$ to $n$ points. We also prove an analogous statement for monogenic subsemigroups of the finite full transformation monoids, as well as monogenic inverse submonoids and subsemigroups of the finite symmetric inverse monoids.",

\section{Pseudoforest Deletion Set}
%: ILP Formulations, LP Integrality Gap, and Extreme Point Properties}
\label{sec:PFDS}
In this section, we formally prove our main results for Pseudoforest Deletion Set. We prove \Cref{lemma:orientation-formulation} in \Cref{sec:orientatin-polytope}, \Cref{thm:weak-density-extreme-point} in \Cref{sec:extreme-point-weak-density}, and \Cref{thm:orientation-polyhedron-extreme-point} in \Cref{sec:orientation-polytope-extreme-point}.
%i.e. we show that the IP with orientation and 2-pseudotree covering constraints is a formulation for pseudoforest deletion set; moreover, we show that the LP relaxation is polynomial time solvable and that its integrality gap is at most $2$. 
%In subsequent sections, we study extreme point properties of the weak density polyhedron and the orientation polyhedron, and show that for extreme points of both polyhedra, there exist co-ordinates with value at least $1/3$. In particular,  we prove \Cref{thm:weak-density-extreme-point} in \Cref{sec:extreme-point-weak-density} and we prove \Cref{thm:orientation-polyhedron-extreme-point} in \Cref{sec:orientation-polytope-extreme-point}.

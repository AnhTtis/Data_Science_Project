In this section, we prove our main results for FVS. We prove \Cref{thm:integrality-gap-wd+cycle-cover} in Section \ref{sec:integrality-gap-of-weak-density-and-cycle-cover} and \Cref{thm:poly-sized-LP-with-integrality-gap-atmost-2-for-FVS} in Section \ref{sec:orientation-and-cycle-cover-formulation}. We discuss two additional polynomial-sized ILP formulations for FVS with integrality gap at most $2$ in Section \ref{sec:more-FVS-formulations}.

%In this section, we prove \Cref{thm:poly-sized-LP-with-integrality-gap-atmost-2-for-FVS} by giving three polynomial-sized LP-relaxations for FVS with integrality gap at most $2$. 
In Section \ref{sec:orientation-and-cycle-cover-formulation}, we described an ILP formulation based on orientation and cycle cover polyhedra and showed that its LP-relaxation is at least as strong as (\ref{FVS-LP:weak-density-cycle-cover}). We briefly discuss two more polynomial-sized LP-relaxations for FVS with integrality gap at most $2$. We give full details in the appendix for the sake of completeness. 

We recall that Chekuri and Madan \cite{chekuri-madan16} gave a polynomial-sized ILP formulation for Subset-FVS. We note that the LP-relaxation of their ILP-formulation specialized for FVS has integrality gap at most that of the LP-relaxation of  \eqref{FVS-IP: orient-and-cycle-cover}. %\commentop{Chandra: The previous sentence seems awkward. What is the first ILP formulation? Instead of "note" we should say "prove" or "observe".}
Consequently, the LP-relaxation of their ILP formulation has integrality gap at most $2$. We present the details in Appendix \ref{sec:CM-formulation}. This result gives additional impetus to improving the integrality gap analysis of their LP-relaxation for Subset-FVS. 
%analyzing Chekuri-Madan's ILP with the hope of tightening the approximability of Subset-FVS. 

Next, we give an ILP formulation based only on orientation constraints (without relying on cycle cover constraints) - see Appendix \ref{sec:orientation-formulation}. We show that its LP-relaxation is at least as strong as that of the strong density constraints based formulation and consequently is also at most $2$. 
%Since we know that the LP-relaxation of the strong density constraints based formulation has integrality gap at most $2$ (as shown by \cite{CHUDAK1998111}), the integrality gap of the LP-relaxation of our orientation constraints based formulation is also at most $2$.

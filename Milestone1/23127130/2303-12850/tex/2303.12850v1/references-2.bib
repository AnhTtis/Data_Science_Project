	abstract = {We study the problem of finding highly connected subgraphs of undirected and directed graphs. For undirected graphs, the notion of density of a subgraph we use is the average degree of the subgraph. For directed graphs, a corresponding notion of density was introduced recently by Kannan and Vinay. This is designed to quantify highly connectedness of substructures in a sparse directed graph such as the web graph. We study the optimization problems of finding subgraphs maximizing these notions of density for undirected and directed graphs. This paper gives simple greedy approximation algorithms for these optimization problems. We also answer an open question about the complexity of the optimization problem for directed graphs.},

abstract = {This article considers the node-weighted Steiner tree (NWST) problem and the maximum-weight connected subgraph (MWCS) problem, which have applications in the design of telecommunication networks and the analysis of biological networks. Exact algorithms with provable worst-case runtimes are provided. The first algorithm for NWST runs in time for n-vertex instances when the number of terminals is bounded. It is based on dynamic programming and generalizes a Steiner tree algorithm of Dreyfus and Wagner. When used alongside Hakimi's spanning tree enumeration algorithm, it implies a time algorithm for NWST. It is also shown that Hakimi's 46-year-old algorithm for Steiner tree is essentially best-possible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). Then two algorithms for MWCS are provided. Their runtimes are polynomial in the number of vertices of the graph, but exponential in the number of vertices that have positive (or negative) weight. The latter is shown to be essentially best-possible under SETH. Together, they imply that MWCS can be solved in time . To the best of the authors’ knowledge, these are the first improvements over exhaustive search in the literature.},

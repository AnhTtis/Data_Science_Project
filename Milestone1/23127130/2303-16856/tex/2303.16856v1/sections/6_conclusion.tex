\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present a 3D dance synthesis system that can generate realistic and style-consistent dance movements to accompany a piece of long music. For the lack of data, we propose an efficient unpaired learning scheme to take advantage of the easy-to-get unpaired data. For the synthesis of long-term dance, we devise a long-history attention mechanism based on choreography theory, which can perceive the choreographic structure from long historical motion and ensure style-consistent during long-term generation. Our system is comparable to strong baseline systems both objectively and subjectively, despite using only the unpaired data. The long-term dance generation experiment demonstrates the robustness of our system. Finally, we conduct detailed ablation studies that justify the effectiveness of our designs.

There are still many open topics for future exploration. First, identifying onsets as the music beats is not perfect. Onsets generally correspond to musical stresses, but in practice, dance beats may not always coincide with stress notes. Second, there are more to choreographic rules than the motion repeat constraint. For instance, identical bars in a musical phrase often correspond to symmetrical motions, which is called the \emph{mirror constraint} \cite{chen2021choreomaster}. Last, our unpaired learning scheme are scalable for larger unpaired datasets. Building a general pre-trained model based on a large-scale unpaired music-dance dataset is an interesting topic worth exploring.

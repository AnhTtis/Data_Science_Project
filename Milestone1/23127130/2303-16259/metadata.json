    "abstract": "We define and study the subspace of cuspidal functions for $G$-bundles on a class of nilpotent extensions $C$ of curves over a finite field. We show that this subspace is preserved by the action of a certain noncommutative Hecke algebra $\\mathcal{H}_{G,C}$. In the case $G=\\rm{GL}_2$, we construct a commutative subalgebra in $\\mathcal{H}_{G,C}$ of Hecke operators associated with simple divisors.\n  In the case of length 2 extensions and of $G=\\rm{GL}_2$, we prove that the space of cuspidal functions (for bundles with a fixed determinant) is finite-dimensional and provide bounds on its dimension. In this case we also construct some Hecke eigenfunctions using the relation to Higgs bundles over the corresponding reduced curve.",

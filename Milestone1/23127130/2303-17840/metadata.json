    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of randomly perturbed path-dependent stochastic differential equations with small parameter $\\vartheta_{\\varepsilon}$, when $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, $\\vartheta_\\varepsilon$ goes to $0$. When $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, we establish large deviation principle. The proof of the results relies on the weak convergence approach. As an application, we establish the large deviation for functionals of path-dependent SDEs in small time intervals.",

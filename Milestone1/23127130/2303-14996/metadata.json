    "abstract": "Many real-world systems involving higher-order interactions can be modeled by hypergraphs, where vertices represent the systemic units and hyperedges describe the interactions among them. In this paper, we focus on the problem of hyperlink prediction which aims at inferring missing hyperlinks based on observed hyperlinks. We propose three similarity indices for hyperlink prediction based on local random walks and Jensen-Shannon divergence. Numerical experiments show that the proposed indices outperform the state-of-the-art methods on a broad range of datasets.",

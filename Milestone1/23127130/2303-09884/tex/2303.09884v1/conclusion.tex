\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
This work investigated the problem of cooperative target tracking and target radio-jamming with a team of pursuer agents. A novel distributed control framework is presented, in which a team of pursuer agents select their mobility and transmit power-level control actions that result in accurate target tracking and  uninterrupted target radio-jamming, while avoiding the jamming interference amongst them. Future directions include a real-world implementation of the proposed system and its extension to multiple targets.

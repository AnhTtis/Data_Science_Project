\section{System Overview}\label{sec:system_overview}
The problem tackled in this work can be stated as follows: \textit {At each time-step $t$ each agent $j \in [1,..,N]$ must decide its mobility control action $u_t^{j} \in \mathbb{U}_t^j$ and transmit power-level $\ell^j_t \in \mathbb{L}_t^j$ that results in accurate target tracking and uninterrupted target radio-jamming. At each time-step the agents cooperate to maximize the joint tracking and radio-jamming performance of the system, while avoiding the induced radio-jamming interference amongst them}.


Figure \ref{fig:sys_arch} illustrates the proposed system architecture. 
Each agent $j \in [1,..,N]$ uses stochastic filtering in order to estimate at each time-step $t$: (a) the probability mass function of the target existence $p^j_{t}(\epsilon^j_t|Z_{1:t})$ given target measurements up to time $t$, $Z^j_{1:t}$ and (b) the filtering distribution $f_{t}^j(x_t|Z_{1:t})$ of the target state $x^j_t$. This is illustrated by the probabilistic graphical model in Fig. \ref{fig:sys_arch}, where the target state $x^j_t$ and the target existence $\epsilon^j_t$ are the random variables of an unobserved Markov process with observations $z^j_t$ (i.e., target measurement). In the problem considered, the target measurement $z^j_t$ received by agent $j$ depends on the agent's applied mobility control action $u^j_t$ as shown in the figure. As a result, to optimally estimate the state of the target, the agent must make optimized mobility control decisions which is achieved by the proposed controller. The objective of the \textit{tracking-and-jamming} controller is not only to find the optimal mobility control actions $u^j_t$  but also the optimal transmit power-level $\ell^j_t$ for agent $j$ such that the  received power at the rogue drone is maximized in order to achieve uninterrupted radio jamming. The agents cooperate by exchanging information (i.e., their current state and target estimated state) in order to optimize the target radio-jamming and avoid the jamming interference amongst them. This work does not consider a target that has the potential to jam the pursuer agents. Moreover, it is assumed that each agent is able to identify with absolute certainty if another entity is a pursuer agent, i.e., an agent cannot be mistaken for a target by another pursuer agent.

    "abstract": "We prove effective density of random walks on homogeneous spaces, assuming that the underlying measure is supported on matrices generating a dense subgroup and having algebraic entries. The main novelty is an argument passing from high dimension to effective equidistribution in the setting of random walks on homogeneous spaces, exploiting spectral gap of the associated convolution operator.",

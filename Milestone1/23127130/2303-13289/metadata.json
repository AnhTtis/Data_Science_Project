    "abstract": "We establish an optimal (topological) irreducibility criterion for $p$-adic Banach principal series of $\\mathrm{GL}_{n}(F)$, where $F/\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is finite and $n \\le 3$. This is new for $n = 3$ as well as for $n = 2$, $F \\ne \\mathbb{Q}_p$ and establishes a refined version of Schneider's conjecture [Sch06, Conjecture 2.5] for these groups.",

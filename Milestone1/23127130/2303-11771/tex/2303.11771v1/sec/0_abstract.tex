The goal of this work is to develop \emph{self-sufficient} framework for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) that addresses key issues of sign language recognition.
These include the need for
complex multi-scale features such as hands, face, and mouth for understanding, and absence of frame-level annotations.
To this end, we propose (1) Divide and Focus Convolution (DFConv) which extracts both manual and non-manual features without the need for additional networks or annotations, and (2) Dense Pseudo-Label Refinement (DPLR) which propagates non-spiky frame-level pseudo-labels by combining the ground truth gloss sequence labels with the predicted sequence.
We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among RGB-based methods on large-scale CSLR benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014 and PHOENIX-2014-T, while showing comparable results with better efficiency when compared to other approaches that use multi-modality or extra annotations.

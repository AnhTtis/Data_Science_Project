\begin{abstract}
%Uranium ditelluride is a prime candidate for topological superconductivity, a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Further developments are reliant on first-principles calculations to fully understand the superconducting order parameters in relation to the magnetic instability. Band structure calculations have show a 3D Fermi Surface is necessary to capture the rich superconducting properties from experimental reports. ARPES results were the first to spur a reexamination of the Kondo ground state and the possibility of a 3D Fermi surface. Using the Tunnel Diode Oscillator measurements in high magnetic fields, we report new quantum oscillation frequencies, with isotropic field dependence, and electron-hole tunneling between cylindrical Fermi surface sheets. Theses measurements support two Fermi surface sheets with $k_f$ $\approx$ 0.7-0.8 \AA$^{-1}$, and a spherical Fermi surface with $k_f$ $\approx$ 0.7-0.8 \AA$^{-1}$

Spin triplet superconductor UTe$_{2}$ is widely believed to host a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, revealed by first principal calculations, photoemission and quantum oscillation measurements. An outstanding question still remains as to the existence of a three-dimensional Fermi surface pocket, which is crucial for our understanding of the exotic superconducting and topological properties of UTe$_{2}$. This 3D Fermi surface pocket appears in various theoretical models with different physics origins, but has not been detected experimentally. Here for the first time we provide a concrete evidence for a relatively isotropic, small Fermi surface pocket of UTe$_{2}$ via quantum oscillation measurements. In addition, we observed high frequency quantum oscillations corresponding to electron-hole tunneling between adjacent electron and hole pockets. The coexistence of 2D and 3D Fermi surface pockets, as well as the breakdown orbits, provides a test bed for theoretical models and aid the realization of a unified understanding of superconducting state of UTe$_{2}$ from the first-principles approach.

\maketitle{}

Spin triplet superconductivity offers a promising route to topologically protected quantum computing, with Majorana Fermions as surface state excitations~\cite{Sato2017,Kallin2016}. The recent discovery of spin triplet superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has has prompted intense research efforts~\cite{ran2019nearly}. Spin triplet pairing is strongly suggested by the extremely large, anisotropic upper critical field $H_{\textup{c2}}$~\cite{ran2019nearly} and the temperature independent NMR Knight shift in the superconducting state~\cite{nakamine2019superconducting,PhysRevB.103.L100503,fujibayashi2022superconducting}. Time reversal symmetry breaking is indicated by the observation of finite Kerr rotation ~\cite{hayes2021multicomponent} as well as the chiral in-gap bound states shown by scanning tunneling spectroscopy~\cite{jiao2020chiral}. Charge density waves have been observed in the normal state of UTe$_{2}$ from scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements~\cite{aishwarya2022magnetic}, which develop into an unprecedented spin triplet pair density wave in the superconducting state\cite{gu2022detection}.

%Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has detected charge density wave order, below 4 K \cite{aishwarya2022magnetic}. Accompanied by a Pair Density Wave (PDW) order,  the SC order parameter has a spatial modulation that is indistinguishable from the chiral Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase \cite{gu2022detection}. This brings new evidence to the origin of TRS breaking, whether it is inherit in the normal state, or broken upon the superconducting transition .

%The spin-triplet superconductor, UTe$_2$, has prompted intense research efforts as a candidate for Weyl Superconductivity.\cite{ran2019nearly,jiao2020chiral,PhysRevB.103.104504,hayes2021multicomponent,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2002.02539} On the edge of magnetic order, the superconducting ground state is assisted by Ferromagnetic (FM) instability\cite{ran2019nearly, PhysRevB.100.140502}. Rapid theoretical progress has been made, but first-principles calculations rely on experimental results to further understand the ground state \cite{PhysRevLett.123.217002, PhysRevLett.123.217001, PhysRevLett.125.237003,PhysRevB.103.104504,ishizuka2021periodic,kang2022orbital,choi2022correlated}. In this letter, we confirm a highly re-normalized 2D Fermi surface, supported with high frequency oscillations originating from electron-tunneling, and detect a low frequency oscillation corresponding to a spherical Fermi surface.

%Uranium ditelluride crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure, forming 1D chains of Uranium and Telleriuim along the crystallographic $a$-axis \cite{ikeda2006single}. Magnetic moments are consistent with U 5$f^2$ or U 5$f^3$, which prefer to align to the $a$-axis \cite{ikeda2006single,liu2022identifying,fujimori2021core}. Below T$_{Kondo}$ = 50 K, the Uranium 5f electrons hybridize with conduction electrons. This causes a Lifshitz transition to metallic ground state, characterized by isotropic resistivity \cite{PhysRevB.106.L060505}. 
 
 Even more strikingly, UTe$_{2}$ hosts two independent field-induced superconducting phases~\cite{ran2019extreme}. Embedded in a field polarized state, the higher-field superconducting phase reenters at an unusually high magnetic field of 45~T and persists up to 65~T when the magnetic field is aligned over a limited angular range about the normal direction to the (011) plane. This high-field phase greatly challenges our current understanding of superconductivity, and no theoretical explanation has emerged. 

 %The pairing mechanism is highly unconventional, persisting in magnetic fields up to  H$_{C2}$ $||$ $b$ = 34 T, coinciding with a transition to a field polarized (FP) magnetic state \cite{ran2019extreme}. Multiple surface and bulk probes provide evidence for spin-triplet pairing, with the $d$-vector pointing along the $b$-axis \cite{PhysRevB.100.220504,jiao2020chiral,hayes2021multicomponent,PhysRevB.103.L100503,fujibayashi2022superconducting}. The breaking of Time Reversal Symmetry (TRS) at the SC transition has been observed with a non-zero Kerr rotation \cite{hayes2021multicomponent} and small NMR Knight-Shift \cite{PhysRevB.103.L100503,nakamine2019superconducting,fujibayashi2022superconducting}. 
 
 %Spin-triplet pairing is aided by short range FM interactions, but the FP magnetic phase also hosts an additional superconducting state with long range order\cite{ran2019extreme}. 
 
 %The diverse pairing states has prompted investigations with muon spin roation/relaxation ($\mu$SR)~\cite{sundar2019coexistence} and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) \cite{ambika2022possible} measurements, revealing a weak FM system coexisting with Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions. On the contrary, Ineleastic Neutron scattering (INS) has detected Antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations and an absence of Ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations at ambient pressure, which is expected from spin-triplet pairing near an FM quantum critical point \cite{duan2021resonance}. Neutron scattering (NS) evaluate the AFM wave vector to be incommensurate with the native lattice  \cite{PhysRevLett.125.237003}.%The spin interactions can be tuned with pressure, revealing the suppression of superconductivity into an AFM ordered state \cite{thomas2020evidence,PhysRevB.101.140503,ran2021expansion,aoki2021field,li2021magnetic}. Understanding the dynamic nature of spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ is necessary to comprehend the emergence quantum phases.

A knowledge of electronic band structure is essential in the understanding of superconducting and topological properties of UTe$_{2}$. Despite extensive efforts~\cite{xu2019quasi,ishizuka2019insulator,PhysRevB.103.104504,PhysRevB.103.094504,kang2022orbital,choi2022correlated}, a unified picture has not been achieved. A quasi-2D Fermi surface, oriented along $k_x$ and $k_y$ , was revealed by first-principles calculations~\cite{xu2019quasi,ishizuka2019insulator,PhysRevB.103.104504}, and supported by angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements~\cite{miao2020low,aoki2022first}. On the other hand, this large 2D Fermi surface alone does not explain various properties of UTe$_{2}$, e.g., the non-trivial topology of the superconductivity~\cite{xu2019quasi,ishizuka2019insulator}, the multiple superconducting states~\cite{Ran2020,Thomas2020,braithwaite2019multiple}, the Fermi surface reconstruction at the metamagentic transition~\cite{Niu2020a, Niu2020}, and the nearly isotropic electronic transport~\cite{PhysRevB.106.L060505}. This spurred searches for additional Fermi-surface sections, likely with a 3D character. A reexamination of the Kondo interaction within DFT+DMFT calculations predicted a 3D isotropic Fermi-surface pocket surrounding the $\Gamma$-point~\cite{choi2022correlated}. The electron and hole Fermi-surfaces are also reconstructed to enclose the corners of the Brillouin zone~\cite{choi2022correlated}. In contrast, a tight binding model approach preserves the quasi-2D structure calculated from DFT+$U$ while introducing a new Fermi surface with 3D character at the $k_z = \pi/2c$ plane~\cite{PhysRevB.103.094504}. Small Fermi-surface sections may have been observed by soft x-ray ARPES measurements~\cite{fujimori2019electronic}. However, a close examination reveals that the same data set could as well match predictions of quasi-2D Fermi surface sections, leaving the conclusions ambiguous.  

Here we report quantum oscillations of UTe$_{2}$ observed on high quality single crystals grown using molten salt flux method~\cite{sakai2022single}. Most importantly, we provide the first concrete evidence for a relatively isotropic, small Fermi surface pocket, in addition to the quasi-2D cylindrical Fermi surface. We also observed quantum oscillations with very high frequencies, consistent with breakdown orbits due to the tunneling between electron and hole pockets. The 3D Fermi surface holds the promise for the understanding of many exotic properties of UTe$_{2}$, such as the topology of the superconducting state~\cite{choi2022correlated}, the nature of magnetic fluctuations~\cite{PhysRevB.103.094504}, and the mechanism of the high field induced superconductivity. Our observations apply strong constrains on the theoretical understanding of UTe$_{2}$. Any successful model of UTe$_{2}$ needs to account for all three salient features: the 2D cylindrical Fermi-surface section, small isotropic Fermi-surface sections and adjacent pockets allowing for tunneling.
%{\bf Comment- the whole assembly of pockets and sheets is the Fermi surface; each part is a Fermi-surface section.}

%To fully understand the topological nature of UTe$_2$, the mixing of 5$f$ electrons and magnetic correlations must be explained from first principles calculations. 


%The metallic ground state has been established to originate from the Fermi level intersecting the U 6$d$ and Te 5$p$ bands, creating Fermi surface sheets 

 %Initial experimental progress was lead by Angle Resolved Photo-Electron Spectroscopy (ARPES), by confirming first-principles calculations of two orthogonal, rectangular Fermi Surfaces and multiple reports of a 3D Fermi surface were also observed with ARPES at the $Z$-point in the BZ \cite{fujimori2019electronic,miao2020low}. Resonant Photo-electron Spectroscopy (RPES) captured the itinerant nature of 5$f$ electrons near the Fermi level and the finite participation of U 5$f$ band in the Te 5$p$ band at higher binding energies \cite{fujimori2019electronic}.  

 %to study Ising type FM spin coupling on the Periodic Anderson model, Local Density Approximations (LDA) and a Mean Field approximation
 
 %Experimental results are vital to theoretical progress by confirming initial band structure calculations and indicating a potential 3D Fermi Surface. The recent development of single crystal growth from the Molten Salt Flux (MSF) method has prompted the first de Hass van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations \cite{sakai2022single,aoki2022first}. The calculated cyclotron effective mass ($m^*$) is found to be an order of magnitude larger than current theory suggests, extending the participation of U 5f contribution to the Te 5p and U 6d bands \cite{aoki2022first}. 


The quantum oscillations of UTe$_2$ were measured using an inductance coil as part of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) circuit, where the resonant frequency, $f_{TDO}$, is coupled to the sample magnetization and conductivity (see SI for details~\cite{suppinfo}). Figure~1a plots the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of $\Delta f_{\rm TDO}$ with magnetic field oriented close to the $c$ axis. There are three groups of well resolved frequencies, below 1~kT, around 4~kT and 8~kT. As expected for magnetic quantum oscillations, the amplitudes of all of these frequencies decrease with increasing temperature, in agreement with the expectations of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The effective masses are calculated from the temperature dependent dampening using the Lifshitz–Kosevich (L-K) formalism \cite{DShoenberg_1988}. The obtained values are large for all the frequencies, in the range of $5-25~m_0$, where $m_0$ is the mass of the free electron, consistent with heavy electronic states. Note that our base temperature, 0.35~K, is about 50 times higher than that in the previous dHvA study~\cite{aoki2022first}, while our magnetic field is only three times larger. Nevertheless, quantum oscillations are successfully observed, indicating the good quality of the samples used in the current study. 

%The amplitudes of all frequencies show clear temperature dependence, which demonstrates that all these frequencies are from real quantum oscillations instead of measurement noises. 

The mid-range frequencies around 4~kT are in a good agreement with previous dHvA oscillations seen in magnetic fields of up to 14~T~\cite{aoki2022first}. These frequencies are consistent with those of the GGA+$U$ calculations with $U$ = 2~eV, which predicts quasi-2D electron and hole Fermi surfaces with a cylindrical shape~\cite{ishizuka2019insulator}. Based on these calculations, F$_{\delta}$ = 3.2~kT corresponds to a hole pocket oriented along $k_x$, and F$_{\epsilon}$ = 3.7~kT and F$_{\zeta}$ = 4.1~kT to an electron pocket oriented along $k_y$~\cite{ishizuka2019insulator, xu2019quasi}. %The calculated $m^*$ are a factor of two smaller than previously reported \cite{aoki2022first}. A field dependent analysis of $m^*$ reveals only small deviations. While this does not resolve the difference with previous dHvA oscillations, it supports a much heavier orbit than theoretical prediction.

Further knowledge is gained on the topology of the Fermi surface from the angle dependence of the quantum oscillation frequencies. Here, two samples are measured: sample S1, which rotates from $H \parallel c$ towards the $b$-axis, and sample S2, which rotates from $H \parallel c$ towards the $a$-axis. To further confirm the rotation angle, the critical field for the metamagnetic transition was used for sample S1 and the superconducting critical field was used for sample S2, as shown in Fig.~2d. The FFT peak positions for both samples are collected in Fig.~2c, with the $c-a$ axis rotation plotted against recent dHvA oscillations~\cite{aoki2022first}. The $c-a$ axis rotation provides good agreement, with the both electron and hole orbit showing cylindrical angle dependence. Similar cylindrical angle dependence is observed for the $c-b$-axis rotation in the low angle range, while the FFT peaks quickly drop to the noise level for angles above 30$^{\circ}$.  

%nearly mirroring the $a$-axis rotation. The same cannot be said for the hole pockets. While F$_{\delta}$ slowly increases but remains below 4 kT, F$_{\zeta}$ remains at a constant at 4.2 kT. %This is an-isotropic to the $b$-axis rotation, where only F$_{\delta}$ has a small change in frequency. 

%The smaller hole orbit (F$_{\delta}$) shows similar 1/$Cos(\theta)$ dependence but not as steep. There is another hole branch appearing at around $\theta_b = 30^{\circ}$ with has steep angle dependence. This angle dependence indicates the minimal FS orbit (F$_{\delta}$) is more spherical, while the maximal FS orbit (F$_{\delta_2}$), depicts a more cylindrical shape.

%The FFT spectrum is plotted as magnetic field rotates toward the $b$-axis, see Figure 3b.The mid frequency peaks, F$_{\delta}$ and F$_{\epsilon}$, have an increase for small angles while F$_{\zeta}$ remains relatively constant. There is a signature that the frequency decreases after a 30$^{\circ}$, but the signal-noise ratio becomes challenging to distinguish at higher angles. 

Our key finding is the observation of quantum oscillations with new frequencies in two frequency ranges, below 1~kT and around 8~kT. First we investigate the frequencies around 8~kT. Figure~2a shows 2~kT high pass filtered $\Delta f_{TDO}$ from sample S1, with a 5$^{\circ}$ rotation from $c$ towards to the $b$-axis ($\theta_b = 5$). Below 36~T, there is a prevalent 7.7~kT oscillation, which is shrouded by a larger magnitude 4~kT oscillation as $H$ increases. The beating phenomenon in the high field range is due to a collection of frequencies around 4~kT. The FFT shows at least two well resolved frequencies around 8~kT. The peak position is tracked until $\theta_b = 20$, depicting a similar angle dependence to its mid-frequency counterparts.

%The high frequency peaks,  F$_{\eta}$ and  F$_{\theta}$, are also tracked, in addition to the QI orbits. The dominant peak, F$_{\theta}$ splits into F$_{\theta'}$ with small angle offsets;even so, F$_{\zeta+\delta}$ follows with good agreement. The same can be said of F$_{\epsilon+\delta}$. This provides additional support for the assignment of the mid-frequency peaks, where F$_\delta$ is a hole orbit and F$_\epsilon$ and F$_\zeta$ are electron orbits.

\end{figure}

A frequency of 7.7~kT would correspond to a Fermi surface area of ${\rm 0.74~\AA^{-2}}$, which is $48\%$ of the Brillouin zone in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane. There is no experimental nor theoretical indication of such a large Fermi-surface section \cite{fujimori2019electronic,miao2020low,xu2019quasi,ishizuka2019insulator}, coexisting with the electron and hole pockets discussed above. There are a few other mechanisms that can potentially give rise to high oscillation frequencies: high order harmonics, magnetic breakdown, and quantum interference \cite{shoenberg2009magnetic}. The high-frequency peaks, F$_{\eta}$ and F$_{\theta}$, are close to being second harmonics of the mid-frequency peaks. However, the temperature dependence of the $n$th harmonic should give an apparent effective mass that is $n$ times the mass of the fundamental $(n=1)$ frequency\cite{DShoenberg_1988,shoenberg2009magnetic}. The apparent effective masses for the high frequencies are smaller than those of the 4~kT frequencies, ruling out this possibility. 


%While magnetic breakdown corresponds the the sum or difference between the FS area and $m^*$ of like-carrier orbits. Quantum Interference allows interactions between electron and hole orbits, allowing the difference of $m^*$ when adding different carriers\cite{shoenberg2009magnetic}. To resolve the small $m^*$ of the high-frequency orbits, further analysis shows that F$_{\eta}$ (F$_{\theta}$) arises from electron-hole tunneling between F$_{\epsilon}$ (F$_{\zeta}$) and F$_{\delta}$. There is an additional increase in FFT frequency corresponding to the tunneling length in k-space. Using the peak positions from Figure 1a, there is a shift of 350 T (0.23 \AA$^{-1}$) and 450 T (0.26 \AA$^{-1}$), for  F$_{\epsilon +\delta}$ and F$_{\zeta +\delta}$ respectively. While this phenomenon is not allowed in semi classical theory, the magnetic breakdown between electron and holes has been investigated as a consequence of Klein tunneling in $k$-space \cite{PhysRevLett.116.236401,PhysRevLett.121.256602}.

In high magnetic fields, electrons could tunnel between adjacent pockets, giving rise to new quantum oscillations in breakdown orbits~\cite{shoenberg2009magnetic}. Such oscillations are suppressed in amplitude by a factor exp(-$B$/$B_c$). The breakdown field $B_c \propto \Delta k^2$, with $\Delta k$ being the gap between adjacent pockets of the Fermi surface, is typically too large for this effect to be observed in most materials. In UTe$_{2}$, adjacent pockets are close to each other in $k$-space, making it possible to observe new oscillations in relatively low magnetic field (starting from around 30~T). Our analysis indicates that the each of the high frequencies is roughly the addition of two frequencies in the 4~kT range, consistent with the breakdown orbits. There is an additional increase ($\sim$ 400~T) in FFT frequency corresponding to the tunneling length in $k$-space. Note that in case of UTe$_{2}$ the tunneling happens between adjacent electron and hole pockets, in which electrons move in oppostie directions. Similar electron-hole tunneling has been observed in Weyl semimetals where electron and hole pockets are close in $k$ space~\cite{Delft2018, Brien2016}.  

%, e.g., F$_{\eta}$ (F$_{\theta}$) arises from electron-hole tunneling between F$_{\epsilon}$ (F$_{\zeta}$) and F$_{\delta}$

In Fig. 3 we present two scenarios for the tunneling. In the first case, figure of eight pattern, electrons keep the same direction when tunneling between electron and hole pockets. This tunneling is allowed by semiclassical theory. The resulting oscillation frequency of the breakdown orbit equals the difference of the involved frequencies $f_a - f_b$ (due to the opposite enclosed areas defined by electron and hole paths, detailed in SI) and the effective mass equals the sum of the involved effective masses $m_a + m_b$. This is opposite to what we observed. As a matter of fact, due to the large resulting effective mass, it requires much lower temperatures to observe frequencies due to this type of tunneling. The frequency we observed, $f = f_a + f_b$, seems to correspond to the second case, known ad Stark quantum interference, which has been observed in other materials\cite{Sasaki1990,Harrison1996,Delft2018}.
This effect is due to interference between alternative quasiparticle orbits around different Fermi-surface sections that are weakly connected via tunnelling~\cite{Stark1977,Morrison1981}. The interference leads to and apparent effective mass that is the difference between the effective masses of the constituent orbits, $m = m_a - m_b$, in agreeement with our observations (see SI~\cite{suppinfo}). 
%The exact mechanism of the electron-hole tunneling in UTe$_{2}$ begs the further theoretical and experimental investigations.

 %with two orthogonal, rectangular Fermi Surfaces. The red region represents a hole orbit, centered along the $k_x$. The green region represents an electron orbit, centered along the $k_y$. 

Now we turn to the other group of new frequencies. In the low frequency regime, we observed oscillations with $F_{\alpha} = 270$~T, $F_{\beta} = 680$~T, and $F_{\gamma} = 1000$~T. The signature of the lowest frequency oscillation, $F_{\alpha}$, is prominent for both samples S1 and S2. Note that the low frequency oscillations are readily visible even in the raw data of S2, displayed in Fig. 4a. Similar oscillations for S1 are plotted in Fig.~4b and 4c, with field oriented along the $c$- and $b$-axis respectively. While $F_{\beta}$ and $F_{\gamma}$ peaks appear close to the second and third harmonics of $F_\alpha$, the peak positions are not exact multiples. In addition, the effective mass is not consistent with the expected $n$th multiple. The low frequency peaks could as well come from magnetic breakdown of 4~kT orbits in the form of figure of eight. However, the effective mass would be $m_a + m_b$, much higher than the observed values. Therefore the low frequency oscillations must pertain to a real carrier orbit on the Fermi surface that have not been captured from previous ARPES and dHvA measurements. 

%The raw data of TDO measurement of S2, from the $a$-axis, is , with an inset of the background subtracted oscillations. 
 
%The low frequency peaks could as well come from MB between the two electron orbits (F$_{\epsilon}$ and F$_{\zeta}$), giving a frequency of 350 T, with m* = 1 m$_e$, which does not fit F$_{\alpha}$. The quantum interference effects would not be observed because $m^*$ would sum between the electron and hole mass, which would not be discernible in our measurements. Instead, the low frequency oscillations must pertain to a real carrier orbit on the Fermi surface.

%Fig. 4a, logs the H$_{SC,PM}$ to confirm the $a$-axis field-angle and H$_{FP}$ for the $b$-axis. 

The geometry of this small Fermi-surface pocket is investigated using the field-angle dependence in Fig.~4e. For a large angle range, only a few cycles of oscillations were observed, therefore we use the frequency obtained from sinusoidal fit instead of the FFT peak position to trace the angle dependence of $F_{\alpha}$ (see SI for a comparison between sin fit and FFT). There is a small dip in frequency at $\theta_b = 60^{\circ}$, which is consistent for multiple field sweeps. This angle range coincides with the field induced superconducting state ~\cite{ran2019extreme}. Other than that, $F_{\alpha}$ is almost angle independent, indicating a nearly spherical Fermi-surface section. A sufficient number of cycles were observed near the $a$-axis, which allows to construct Landau level fan diagrams for two angles, $\theta_a$ = 90$^{\circ}$ and 84$^{\circ}$, shown in Fig. 4b. The linear extrapolation for both angles show a y-intercept close to zero, indicating topologically trivial orbit.  


%{\bf (NB It's inevitable that referees will ask about how the superconductivity would affect the quantum oscillations. The answer is that the oscillations are in a vortex state, which will affect their phase, amplitude and possibly frequency becuase the orbits do not experience a uniform field.

%We follow the conventions for TDO measurements, corresponding to half integer levels for maximums, and integer filling at minimums. Frequencies obtained from the slope of the Landau level fan diagrams are in good agreement with the frequencies obtained from the Fourier transform, indicating the signals are well preserved when filters are applied. 

%On the left hand side, the field-angle rotates toward the $a$-axis. The FFT frequency looks to drop monotonically, but the sinusoidal supports a constant value. A similar trend is observed on the right hand side, where the field rotates towards the $b$-axis. The sinusoidal fit smooths out the trend, showing small angle dependence.  This could indicated a slight deformations, but lack of angular dispersion suggest a spherical Fermi surface.

This nearly isotropic, small Fermi-surface section provides a test bed for different theoretical models of UTe$_{2}$. First principles calculations have predicted a wide range of underlying band structures, largely due to the modeling complexity associated with $f$-electron strong correlations and Kondo lattice physics. Results of DFT+$U$ and GGA+$U$ calculations are very sensitive to the choice of $U$~\cite{ishizuka2019insulator}. A quasi-2D Fermi surface is predicted by GGA+$U$ for $U$ = 2~eV (DFT+$U$ for $U$ = 6~eV ), which is in a fairly good agreement with the apparent ARPES observation of rectangular pockets and dHvA oscillations of 4~kT frequency~\cite{miao2020low,aoki2022first}. A topological Lifshitz transition occurs as $U$ decreases~\cite{ishizuka2019insulator}. When $U$ is decreased to 1.0~eV, GGA+$U$ calculations predict a tiny electron pocket appearing at the Brillouin zone boundary around the $X$ point and a tiny hole pocket around the $R$ point. These small Fermi-surface sections could potentially correspond to the low frequencies we observed. However, for $U$ = 1.0 eV, the large cylindrical Fermi surface no longer exists. It is not clear whether fine tuning of $U$ could lead to both small and large Fermi-surface pockets that we observed.%For $U$ = 1.1-1.5~eV, while the quasi-2D cylindrical Fermi surface for hole pocket remains similar shape, the quasi-2D cylindrical Fermi surface for electron pocket evolves into a ringlike sheet. The ringlike electron Fermi surface gives rise to quantum oscillations with frequencies near 8~kT and the cylindrical hole Fermi surface gives rise to frequencies around 4 kT. For very small $U$, even insulating state is predicted. 

Another possible origin for the small Fermi-surface section is suggested by a recent DFT + DMFT calculations, considering Kondo interaction induced Fermi-surface reconstruction\cite{choi2022correlated}. At low temperatures, due to the Kondo resonance, the original quasi-2D Fermi surface morphs into another quasi-2D Fermi-surface section surrounding the Brillouin zone corners and a 3D small Fermi pocket closing the $\Gamma$ point. The renormalized bands are not accessible to the ARPES measurements as they are expected to emerge below 10~K. At the first glance, the presences of both large 2D and small 3D Fermi-surface sections could be responsible for the frequencies we observed. However, the renormalized 2D Fermi-surface section no longer has pockets close in the $k$-space, leaving the electron-hole tunneling impossible. It would require additional mechanism to explain the frequencies we observed around 8~kT. 

The most promising route might be the tight binding model~\cite{PhysRevB.103.094504}, based on the results of DFT+$U$ calculations with an intermediate $U$. The 2D cylindrical Fermi-surface section is preserved in this model. In the meantime, due to the contribution of itinerant $f$-electrons, the hole Fermi-surface section is bent and encloses the $X$-point. It is conceivable that when hybridization between the Te 5$p$-orbital of the hole pocket and the U 5$f$-orbital is turned on, a gap will open and isolated small pockets will form around $X$-point that are almost spherical. In this scenario, 4~kT frequencies from 2D cylindrical Fermi-surface sections, 8~kT frequencies from tunneling between electron and hole pockets, as well as low frequencies from small Fermi-surface pockets, could all be captured in one model. Further theoretical investigation is required to verify this hypothesis.  

%This spherical orbit is likely related to itinerant Uranium 5f electrons forming an coherent band below the Kondo coherence temperature. This is not a new idea, since  ARPES spectra have indicated a non-disperse Fermi surface enclosing the $Z$-point\cite{fujimori2019electronic,miao2020low}, similar to that predicted from the Periodic Anderson model \cite{PhysRevB.103.094504}. Another possibility comes from 3D FS at the $\Gamma$-point. This has been captured through modeling the Kondo Interaction with LDA +DMFT, with reconstructed Te 5$p$ and U 6$d$ orbits \cite{choi2022correlated}. This is different from initial DFT + U, which only resolves a FS at the $\Gamma$-point for an insulating ground state \cite{ishizuka2019insulator}. While previous research offers two scenarios, it is still uncertain to the placement in the BZ and whether the reconstruction comes from the U 5$f$ or 6$d$ bands. It has been gathered that Kondo interaction plays a vital role in the origin of F$_{\alpha}$, through the mixing of heavy U bands into the quasi-particle Fermi surface. 

Our observation of the 3D Fermi-surface pocket is crucial for the understanding of the exotic properties of UTe$_{2}$. Although the new small Fermi-surface section itself has trivial topology, it could still give rise to a nontrivial topology of superconductivity. Both GGA+$U$ and DFT+$U$ calculations predict a topologically trivial superconducting state for the 2D cylindrical Fermi surface~\cite{xu2019quasi,ishizuka2019insulator}. The addition of a 3D Fermi surface changes the occupation number at time-reversal invariant momenta, which in turn changes the winding number and could potentially lead to topological superconductivity~\cite{Sato2010,Fu2010}. In addition, new 3D Fermi surface might be responsible for the magnetic fluctuations and multiple order parameters observed in UTe$_{2}$. In the tight binding model, the appearance of Fermi surface at $k_z$ plan enhances ferromagnetic fluctuations, rather than antiferromagnetic ones, and extends the odd-parity symmetry from $B_{iu}$ to include the $A_u$ point-group, which transforms to the even-parity $A_g$ state under pressure~\cite{PhysRevB.103.094504}. This makes the small Fermi surface sections key to the understanding of multiple superconducting states under pressure and the overall $P-T$ phase diagram~\cite{Ran2020,Thomas2020,braithwaite2019multiple,Lin2020,ran2021expansion,ambika2022possible}. Another open question about UTe$_{2}$ is the origin of the high-field superconducting phase existing inside the field-polarized state. Upon the metamagnetic transition into the field polarized state, a Fermi-surface reconstruction has been suggested by the thermopower experiments~\cite{Niu2020a, Niu2020}, which likely involves a small, rather than large, Fermi-surface section. It is crucial to investigate how the small Fermi-surface pocket we observed here changes upon the metamagnetic transition, which is an undergoing project. 

%{(\bf how do you know this? did you do some phase analysis? This needs to account for the phase change induced by TDO)}

%Band structure calculations cannot assign non-trivial topological order to any time reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) without a 3D Fermi Surface \cite{ishizuka2019insulator}, unless considering the Strong SOC limit \cite{xu2019quasi}. In this case, Point nodes appear in a degenerate pairing state (B$_{2u}$+$i$B$_{3u}$), which is broken in large magnetic fields\cite{xu2019quasi}. 

%We present a constraint for another, 3D Fermi surface. This is notably produced from a 24-band tight binding model, where the Te 5p and U 6d bands are preserved, but introduced a 3D Fermi surface in the $k_z$ = $\pi$/2$c$ plane \cite{PhysRevB.103.094504}. 



%The addition of a 3D Fermi surface increasing the number Pairing states allowed symmetry, which all fall under the odd-parity representations of the native, D$_{2h}$, point-group symmetry.  
%The exact Fermi surface in the field polarized state is essential to the understanding of the high-field superconducting phase, but is not accessible to the photoemission measurements.  

%An alternative approach to model the Kondo interaction, using LDA + DMFT, produces is a singular pairing state which survives to high magnetic fields, due to a homogeneous participation from U 5$f$ band. The difference comes from a classification as a 3D superconductor, solely from the 3D Fermi surface at the $\Gamma$-point \cite{choi2022correlated}. To obtain this symmetry requires the normalization of the Te 5$p$ and U 6$d$ bands \cite{choi2022correlated}, which cannot be reconciled with the Klein tunneling between electron-hole pockets, with a $q$-vector $\approx$ 0.25 \AA$^{-1}$. Many pairing scenarios still exists and Fermi surface calculations are highly dependent on tuning parameters. 

To summarize, we provide concrete evidence for a small 3D Fermi-surface section in UTe$_{2}$ via quantum oscillations measurements, owing to the large magnetic field range in this study. The 3D small Fermi-surface pocket is crucible for our understanding of various exotic properties of UTe$_{2}$: nontrivial topological superconductivity, multiple order parameters, and the extremely high-field-induced superconducting state. Together with the observation of electron-hole tunneling, this discovery applies strong constrains to theoretical models, aiding the eventual realization of a unified understanding of the superconducting states of UTe$_{2}$. %from the first-principles approach.  

%This isotropic Fermi surface appears in various theoretical calculations with different physical origins, but has not been captured in previous ARPES and quantum oscillation measurements. 

%Experimental work applies constraints on theory, to aid the realization of a unified understanding from the first-principles approach. From these quantum oscillation measurements we support the large effective mass of electron and hole orbits, establish proximity in $k$-space from electron-hole tunneling, and uncover a 3D Fermi surface.

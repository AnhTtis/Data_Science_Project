    "abstract": "Quantum coherence will undoubtedly play a fundamental role in understanding of the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, thereby to reveal its genuine contribution is of great importance. In this paper, we specialize our discussions to the one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model initialized in the coherent Gibbs state. After quenching the strength of the transverse field, the effects of quantum coherence are studied by the rate function of quantum work distribution. We find that quantum coherence not only recovers the quantum phase transition destroyed by thermal fluctuations, but also generates some entirely new singularities both in the static state and dynamics. It can be manifested that these singularities are rooted in spin flips causing the sudden change of the domain boundaries of spin polarization. This work sheds new light on the fundamental connection between quantum critical phenomena and quantum coherence.",

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images
that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object
or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to
provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in
3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high
probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also
describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition
proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects
using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify
clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through
least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition
can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time
performance.},

available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity has two components.
A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented
which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly
almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully
computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm
is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely
in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and
additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated
at singular points or along lines in the image.},

abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.}

ABSTRACT={Mesoscopic environments and particles diffusing in them are often studied by tracking such particles individually while their Brownian motion explores their environment. Environments may be, e.g., a domain in a cell membrane, an interior compartment of a cell, or an engineered nanopit. Particle trajectories are typically determined from time-lapse recorded movies. These are recorded with sufficient exposure time per frame to be able to detect and localize particles in each frame. Since particles move during this exposure time, particles image with motion blur. This motion blur can compromise estimates of diffusion coefficients and the size of the confining domain if not accounted for correctly. We do that here. We give explicit and exact expressions for the variance of measured positions and the mean-squared displacement of a Brownian particle confined in, respectively, a 1D box, a 2D box, a 2D circular disc, and a 3D sphere. Our expressions are valid for all exposure times, irrespective of the size of the confining space and the value of the diffusion coefficient. They apply also in the common case where the exposure time is smaller than the time-lapse due, e.g., to “dead time” caused by the readout process in the camera. These expressions permit determination of diffusion coefficients and domain sizes for given movies for the simple geometries we consider. More important, the trends observed in our exact results when parameter values are varied are valid also for more complex geometries for which no exact analytical solutions exist. Wherever the underlying physics is the same, the exact quantitative description of its consequences provided here is portable as a qualitative and semi-quantitative understanding of its consequences in general. The results may also be useful for other types of reflected Brownian motion than those occurring in single-particle tracking, e.g., in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging techniques. For use in that particular context, we briefly discuss the effects of confinement on anisotropic Brownian motion imaged with motion blur.}

abstract = "How does one optimally determine the diffusion coefficient of a diffusing particle from a single-time-lapse recorded trajectory of the particle? We answer this question with an explicit, unbiased, and practically optimal covariance-based estimator (CVE). This estimator is regression-free and is far superior to commonly used methods based on measured mean squared displacements. In experimentally relevant parameter ranges, it also outperforms the analytically intractable and computationally more demanding maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). For the case of diffusion on a flexible and fluctuating substrate, the CVE is biased by substrate motion. However, given some long time series and a substrate under some tension, an extended MLE can separate particle diffusion on the substrate from substrate motion in the laboratory frame. This provides benchmarks that allow removal of bias caused by substrate fluctuations in CVE. The resulting unbiased CVE is optimal also for short time series on a fluctuating substrate. We have applied our estimators to human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycolase proteins diffusing on flow-stretched DNA, a fluctuating substrate, and found that diffusion coefficients are severely overestimated if substrate fluctuations are not accounted for.",

The precision of estimators for the diffusion coefficient is affected by motion blur, limited photon statistics, and the length of recorded time series. We demonstrate for a particle undergoing free diffusion that precision is negligibly affected by motion blur in typical experiments, while optimizing photon counts and the number of recorded frames is the key to precision. Building on these results, we describe for a wide range of experimental scenarios how to choose experimental parameters in order to optimize the precision. Generally, one should choose quantity over quality: experiments should be designed to maximize the number of frames recorded in a time series, even if this means lower information content in individual frames.",

For some models, the distribution of the short-range diffusion coefficient is much narrower than the observed distribution for proteins diffusing in cell membranes.

abstract = {Cells contain molecules, which become fluorescent when excited by UV/Vis radiation of suitable wavelength. This fluorescence emission, arising from endogenous fluorophores, is an intrinsic property of cells and is called auto-fluorescence to be distinguished from fluorescent signals obtained by adding exogenous markers. The majority of cell auto-fluorescence originates from mitochondria and lysosomes. Together with aromatic amino acids and lipo-pigments, the most important endogenous fluorophores are pyridinic (NADPH) and flavin coenzymes. In tissues, the extracellular matrix often contributes to the auto-fluorescence emission more than the cellular component, because collagen and elastin have, among the endogenous fluorophores, a relatively high quantum yield. Changes occurring in the cell and tissue state during physiological and/or pathological processes result in modifications of the amount and distribution of endogenous fluorophores and chemical–physical properties of their microenvironment. Therefore, analytical techniques based on auto-fluorescence monitoring can be utilized in order to obtain information about morphological and physiological state of cells and tissues. Moreover, auto-fluorescence analysis can be performed in real time because it does not require any treatment of fixing or staining of the specimens. In the past few years spectroscopic and imaging techniques have been developed for many different applications both in basic research and diagnostics.}

title = {Learning From Data},
year = {2012},
isbn = {1600490069},
publisher = {AMLBook},
abstract = {Machine learning allows computational systems to adaptively improve their performance
with experience accumulated from the observed data. Its techniques are widely applied
in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. This book is designed for a short
course on machine learning. It is a short course, not a hurried course. From over
a decade of teaching this material, we have distilled what we believe to be the core
topics that every student of the subject should know. We chose the title `learning
from data' that faithfully describes what the subject is about, and made it a point
to cover the topics in a story-like fashion. Our hope is that the reader can learn
all the fundamentals of the subject by reading the book cover to cover. ---- Learning
from data has distinct theoretical and practical tracks. In this book, we balance
the theoretical and the practical, the mathematical and the heuristic. Our criterion
for inclusion is relevance. Theory that establishes the conceptual framework for learning
is included, and so are heuristics that impact the performance of real learning systems.
---- Learning from data is a very dynamic field. Some of the hot techniques and theories
at times become just fads, and others gain traction and become part of the field.
What we have emphasized in this book are the necessary fundamentals that give any
student of learning from data a solid foundation, and enable him or her to venture
out and explore further techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own.
---- The authors are professors at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and National Taiwan University (NTU), where this book
is the main text for their popular courses on machine learning. The authors also consult
extensively with financial and commercial companies on machine learning applications,
and have led winning teams in machine learning competitions.}

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

abstract={With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become more important for object detection. Compared with traditional handcrafted feature-based methods, the deep learning-based object detection methods can learn both low-level and high-level image features. The image features learned through deep learning techniques are more representative than the handcrafted features. Therefore, this review paper focuses on the object detection algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks, while the traditional object detection algorithms will be simply introduced as well. Through the review and analysis of deep learning-based object detection techniques in recent years, this work includes the following parts: backbone networks, loss functions and training strategies, classical object detection architectures, complex problems, datasets and evaluation metrics, applications and future development directions. We hope this review paper will be helpful for researchers in the field of object detection.},

In terms of greyscale imaging, a plethora of denoising algorithms have been documented in the literature, in spite of which the level of functionality of these algorithms still holds margin to acquire desired level of applicability. Quite often noise affecting the pixels in image is Gaussian in nature and uniformly deters information pixels in image. Based on some specific set of assumptions all methods work optimally, however they tend to create artefacts and remove fine structural details under general conditions. This article focuses on classifying and comparing some of the significant works in the field of denoising.}

abstract={Diffusion theory explains in physical terms how materials move through a medium, e.g. water or a biological fluid. There are strong and widely acknowledged grounds for doubting the applicability of this theory in biology, although it continues to be accepted almost uncritically and taught as a basis of both biology and medicine. Our principal aim is to explore how this situation arose and has been allowed to continue seemingly unchallenged for more than 150 years. The main shortcomings of diffusion theory will be briefly reviewed to show that the entrenchment of this theory in the corpus of biological knowledge needs to be explained, especially as there are equally valid historical grounds for presuming that bulk fluid movement powered by the energy of cell metabolism plays a prominent note in the transport of molecules in the living body. First, the theory's evolution, notably from its origins in connection with the mechanistic materialist philosophy of mid nineteenth century physiology, is discussed. Following this, the entrenchment of the theory in twentieth century biology is analyzed in relation to three situations: the mechanism of oxygen transport between air and mammalian tissues; the structure and function of cell membranes; and the nature of the intermediary metabolism, with its implicit presumptions about the intracellular organization and the movement of molecules within it. In our final section, we consider several historically based alternatives to diffusion theory, all of which have their precursors in nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy of science.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

QDs are ultrasmall, typically falling in the size range between 1.5 and 10.0nm. Recently, QD nanotechnology has successfully entered numerous electronic and biomedical industries. QDs have been demonstrated successfully due to their unique properties including superior photostability, size-dependent optical properties, high extinction coefficient and brightness, and large Stokes shift. Organic dyes are limited in exhibiting all these properties and therefore not suitable for many imaging and biosensing applications. Moreover, ultrasmall size of QDs may have added advantages over relatively larger silica and polymer-based nanoparticles for developing multimodal/multifunctional probes due to large surface area, in vitro/in vivo optical trackability. In this chapter, we will introduce the fundamental concepts, design, and synthesis for QD probes for sensing biologically relevant stimuli, such as pH, metal ions, DNA, and enzyme activity. In addition, delivery of therapeutics will be discussed with outlook toward potential clinical applications.}

abstract = {The Gaussian function is simple and easy to implement as Point Spread Function (PSF) model for fitting the position of fluorescent emitters in localization microscopy. Despite its attractiveness the appropriateness of the Gaussian is questionable as it is not based on the laws of optics. Here we study the effect of emission dipole orientation in conjunction with optical aberrations on the localization accuracy of position estimators based on a Gaussian model PSF. Simulated image spots, calculated with all effects of high numerical aperture, interfaces between media, polarization, dipole orientation and aberrations taken into account, were fitted with a Gaussian PSF based Maximum Likelihood Estimator. For freely rotating dipole emitters it is found that the Gaussian works fine. The same, theoretically optimum, localization accuracy is found as if the true PSF were a Gaussian, even for aberrations within the usual tolerance limit of high-end optical imaging systems such as microscopes (Marechal's diffraction limit). For emitters with a fixed dipole orientation this is not the case. Localization errors are found that reach up to 40 nm for typical system parameters and aberration levels at the diffraction limit. These are systematic errors that are independent of the total photon count in the image. The Gaussian function is therefore inappropriate, and more sophisticated PSF models are a practical necessity.},

Cytoskeletal actin dynamics is essential for T cell activation. Here, we show evidence that the binding kinetics of the antigen engaging the T cell receptor influences the nanoscale actin organization and mechanics of the immune synapse. Using an engineered T cell system expressing a specific T cell receptor and stimulated by a range of antigens, we found that the peak force experienced by the T cell receptor during activation was independent of the unbinding kinetics of the stimulating antigen. Conversely, quantification of the actin retrograde flow velocity at the synapse revealed a striking dependence on the antigen unbinding kinetics. These findings suggest that the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton actively adjusted to normalize the force experienced by the T cell receptor in an antigen-specific manner. Consequently, tuning actin dynamics in response to antigen kinetics may thus be a mechanism that allows T cells to adjust the lengthscale and timescale of T cell receptor signaling.}

	abstract = {Whilst Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of proton energy deposition have been well-validated at the macroscopic level, their microscopic validation remains lacking. Equally, no gold-standard yet exists for experimental metrology of individual proton tracks. In this work we compare the distributions of stochastic proton interactions simulated using the TOPAS-nBio MC platform against confocal microscope datia for Al2O3:C,Mg fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). We irradiated mm3 FNTD chips inside a water phantom, positioned at seven positions along a pristine proton Bragg peak with a range in water of 12 cm. MC simulations were implemented in two stages: (1) using TOPAS to model the beam properties within a water phantom and (2) using TOPAS-nBio with Geant4-DNA physics to score particle interactions through a water surrogate of Al2O3:C,Mg. The measured median track integrated brightness (IB) was observed to be strongly correlated to both (i) voxelized track-averaged linear energy transfer (LET) and (ii) frequency mean microdosimetric lineal energy, , both simulated in pure water. Histograms of FNTD track IB were compared against TOPAS-nBio histograms of the number of terminal electrons per proton, scored in water with mass-density scaled to mimic Al2O3:C,Mg. Trends between exposure depths observed in TOPAS-nBio simulations were experimentally replicated in the study of FNTD track IB. Our results represent an important first step towards the experimental validation of MC simulations on the sub-cellular scale and suggest that FNTDs can enable experimental study of the microdosimetric properties of individual proton tracks.}

	abstract = {Quantitative tracking of features from video images is a basic technique employed in many areas of science. Here, we present a method for the tracking of features that partially overlap, in order to be able to track so-called colloidal molecules. Our approach implements two improvements into existing particle tracking algorithms. Firstly, we use the history of previously identified feature locations to successfully find their positions in consecutive frames. Secondly, we present a framework for non-linear least-squares fitting to summed radial model functions and analyze the accuracy (bias) and precision (random error) of the method on artificial data. We find that our tracking algorithm correctly identifies overlapping features with an accuracy below 0.2\% of the feature radius and a precision of 0.1 to 0.01 pixels for a typical image of a colloidal cluster. Finally, we use our method to extract the three-dimensional diffusion tensor from the Brownian motion of colloidal dimers.}

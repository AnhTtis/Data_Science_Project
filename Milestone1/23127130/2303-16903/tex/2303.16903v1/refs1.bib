              (SMLM) techniques like STORM and PALM have transformed cellular
              microscopy by substantially increasing spatial resolution. In
              this paper we introduce a new algorithm for a critical part of
              the SMLM process: estimating the number and locations of the
              fluorophores in a single frame. Our algorithm can analyze a
              20000-frame experimental 3D SMLM dataset in about one second ---
              substantially faster than real-time and existing algorithms. Our
              approach is straightforward but very different from existing
              algorithms: we train a neural network to minimize the Bayes' risk
              under a generative model for single SMLM frames. The neural
              network maps a frame directly to a collection of fluorophore
              locations, which we compare to the ground truth using a novel
              loss function. While training the neural network takes several
              hours, it only has to be done once for a given experimental
              setup. After training, localizing fluorophores in new images is
              extremely fast --- orders of magnitude faster than existing
              algorithms. Faster recovery opens the door to real-time
              calibration and accelerated acquisition, and future work could
              tackle more complicated optical systems and more realistic
              simulators.",

              for use in three-dimensional (3D) localization microscopy
              experiments. The method estimates a global pupil phase function
              (which includes both the PSF and system aberrations) over the
              full axial range from a simple calibration scan. The pupil
              function is used to refine the PSF model and hence enable
              superior localizations from experimental data. To demonstrate the
              utility of the procedure, we apply it to experimental data
              acquired with a microscope employing a tetrapod PSF with a 6 µm
              axial range. The phase-retrieved model demonstrates significant
              improvements in both accuracy and precision of 3D localizations
              relative to the model based on scalar diffraction theory. The
              localization precision of the phase-retrieved model is shown to
              be near the limits imposed by estimation theory, and the
              reproducibility of the procedure is characterized and discussed.

              Diffusion Coefficient and Size of Confining Space",
  author   = "Mortensen, Kim I and Flyvbjerg, Henrik and Pedersen, Jonas N",
  abstract = "Mesoscopic environments and particles diffusing in them are often
              studied by tracking such particles individually while their
              Brownian motion explores their environment. Environments may be,
              e.g., a domain in a cell membrane, an interior compartment of a
              cell, or an engineered nanopit. Particle trajectories are
              typically determined from time-lapse recorded movies. These are
              recorded with sufficient exposure time per frame to be able to
              detect and localize particles in each frame. Since particles move
              during this exposure time, particles image with motion blur. This
              motion blur can compromise estimates of diffusion coefficients
              and the size of the confining domain if not accounted for
              correctly. We do that here. We give explicit and exact
              expressions for the variance of measured positions and the
              mean-squared displacement of a Brownian particle confined in,
              respectively, a 1D box, a 2D box, a 2D circular disc, and a 3D
              sphere. Our expressions are valid for all exposure times,
              irrespective of the size of the confining space and the value of
              the diffusion coefficient. They apply also in the common case
              where the exposure time is smaller than the time-lapse due, e.g.,
              to ``dead time'' caused by the readout process in the camera.
              These expressions permit determination of diffusion coefficients
              and domain sizes for given movies for the simple geometries we
              consider. More important, the trends observed in our exact
              results when parameter values are varied are valid also for more
              complex geometries for which no exact analytical solutions exist.
              Wherever the underlying physics is the same, the exact
              quantitative description of its consequences provided here is
              portable as a qualitative and semi-quantitative understanding of
              its consequences in general. The results may also be useful for
              other types of reflected Brownian motion than those occurring in
              single-particle tracking, e.g., in nuclear magnetic resonance
              imaging techniques. For use in that particular context, we
              briefly discuss the effects of confinement on anisotropic
              Brownian motion imaged with motion blur.",

              However, nanoparticle drug carriers explored for this purpose
              show negligible brain uptake, and the lack of basic understanding
              of nanoparticle-BBB interactions underlies many translational
              failures. Here, using two-photon microscopy in mice, we
              characterize the receptor-mediated transcytosis of nanoparticles
              at all steps of delivery to the brain in vivo. We show that
              transferrin receptor-targeted liposome nanoparticles are
              sequestered by the endothelium at capillaries and venules, but
              not at arterioles. The nanoparticles move unobstructed within
              endothelium, but transcytosis-mediated brain entry occurs mainly
              at post-capillary venules, and is negligible in capillaries. The
              vascular location of nanoparticle brain entry corresponds to the
              presence of perivascular space, which facilitates nanoparticle
              movement after transcytosis. Thus, post-capillary venules are the
              point-of-least resistance at the BBB, and compared to

              which constitutes a key microenvironment for cellular
              communication and the clearance of toxic metabolites. The spatial

              macroscopic biophysical investigations. Here we show an approach
              to directly observe the local ECS structures and rheology in

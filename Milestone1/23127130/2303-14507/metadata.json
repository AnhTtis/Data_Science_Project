    "abstract": "In 1980 M{é}tivier characterized the analytic (and Gevrey) hypoellipticity of $L^2$-solvable partial linear differential operators by a-priori estimates. In this note we extend this characterization to ultradifferentiable hypoellipticity with respect to Denjoy-Carleman classes given by suitable weight sequences. We also discuss the case when the solutions can be taken as hyperfunctions and present some applications.",

In this work, we tackle a novel task of category-level functional hand-object manipulation synthesis. To generate human-like and physically realistic manipulation sequences, we design a two-level space hierarchy named CAnonicalized Manipulation Spaces (CAMS) and thus present a two-stage framework containing a planner and a synthesizer that leverage CAMS as an intermediate representation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both articulated and rigid object categories.

%\textbf{Limitations} One of the main challenge we face is from the perspective of data. Our representation - CAMS is really sensitive to different contact, which is an advantage in most cases. However, this also indicates that our work relies on precise ground truth manipulation data, which is hard to collect in the real world. This is also the reason why we only contain four categories in the main body of our paper. Despite we have shown several most representative categories in HOM, there are still many categories remain unexplored, and we will add the result of them later in the supplementary material.

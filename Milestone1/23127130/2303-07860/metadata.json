    "abstract": "A problem of constructing the trajectory of a spacecraft flight to Venus within the framework of a mission including landing of a lander in a given region of the planet's surface is being considered. A new celestial mechanics related method based on the use of gravity assist maneuver near Venus is proposed to transfer the spacecraft to a heliocentric orbit resonant with the orbit of Venus, so that, at the next approach the planet, the given region of the surface becomes attainable for landing. It is shown that the best resonant orbit in terms of the cost of the characteristic velocity is an orbit with a 1:1 ratio of the period to the orbital period of Venus. A procedure for choosing one of possible resonant orbits depending on coordinates of the desired landing point on the surface and the launch date of the mission is described. An example of calculating the flight trajectory that ensures landing in the Vellamo-South region of the Venus surface at launch from the Earth in 2031 is considered.",

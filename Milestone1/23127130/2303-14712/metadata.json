    "abstract": "In this study, we deal with the sharp bounds of certain Toeplitz determinants whose entries are the logarithmic coefficients of analytic univalent functions $f$ such that the quantity $z f'(z)/f(z)$ takes values in a specific domain lying in the right half plane. The established results provide the bounds for the classes of starlike and convex functions, as well as various of their subclasses.",

  \caption{Adding $k$ items with concatenated training examples to give exposure to long sequences greatly improves structural generalization on COGS for both LSTM-based and transformer-based models. (Transformer-based) SoTA performance is taken from \citet{zheng2020compositional}. The plots show means (of 20 runs) with 95\% confidence interval.}

abstract = {Cyclic polymers, as one of the oldest topological polymers, are undergoing resurgence. This is largely ascribed to the significant achievements in modern polymer chemistry. The novel ring-expansion techniques have conveniently produced varied cyclic polymers with highly topological purity and on large scales, which should facilitate their use in the near future. Beyond the monocyclic molecular conformations, the combination of controlled polymerization techniques and click chemistry have established a robust strategy for preparing cyclic polymers with more complex architectures, such as theta, eight, and tadpole shapes. This diversification in cyclic polymer composition and conformation significantly broadens interest in the cyclic polymers. However, compared to the synthesis achievements, the exploration of cyclic polymer property and application are lagging behind. Recently, we explored the ring-expansion metathesis polymerization on various functional ring-strained olefin monomers to produce cyclic functional polymers, which were then used as the building blocks to fabricate cyclic brush polymers and cyclic gel materials and will be discussed here.}

abstract  ="Friction between ring polymer brush bilayers sliding past each other at melt densities is studied using extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and scaling arguments{,} and the results are compared to the friction between bilayers of linear polymer brushes. We show that for a velocity range spanning over three decades{,} the frictional forces measured for ring polymer brushes are half of the corresponding friction in the case of linear brushes. In the linear-force regime{,} the weak inter-digitation between ring brush layers as compared to linear brushes leads also to a lower number of binary collisions between the monomers from opposing brushes. At high velocities{,} where the thickness of the inter-digitation between bilayers is on the order of monomer size regardless of brush topology{,} stretched segments of ring polymers adopt the double-stranded conformation. As a result{,} monomers of the double-stranded segments collide on average less with the monomers of the opposing ring brush even though a similar number of monomers occupies the inter-digitation layer for ring and linear brush bilayers. The numerical data obtained from our simulations are consistent with the proposed scaling analysis. Conformation-dependent friction reduction observed in ring brushes can have important consequences in non-equilibrium bulk systems."}

ST-30/80 exhibits an entanglement plateau and shows a clearly slower terminal relaxation than that of its component ring and linear polymers. When the zero-shear viscosity η0 for ST-30/80 is plotted against the molecular weight of a linear tail chain{,} the data point lies on the single curve of η0 for 4- and 6-arm star polymers and the single-tail tadpoles with MR ∼ 60 kg mol−1. These results suggest that the tadpole molecule in this study spontaneously forms a characteristic entanglement network{,} i.e.{,} the intermolecular ring–linear threading{,} in the same manner as the previous tadpole samples{,} even though the size of the ring part is just slightly larger than the entanglement molecular weight (i.e.{,} MR ∼ 1.8Me)."}

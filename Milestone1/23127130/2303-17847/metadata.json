    "abstract": "We propose a system for passive magnetic levitation and three-dimensional harmonic trapping of soft ferromagnets. Our protocol utilizes the magnetic field gradient for vertical trapping, and the finite size effect of the Meissner effect for horizontal trapping. We provide numerical and analytical estimations of possible mechanical dissipations to show that our system allows high mechanical Q-factors above $ Q > 10^8 $, and quantum control of the levitated object is within reach of current technologies. The utilization of soft ferromagnet's internal collective spin excitation may allow quantum mechanical phenomena with particles as large as the sub-millimeter-scale.",

    "abstract": "We study the error-correction problem of the communication between two vertices in a social network. By applying the concepts of coding theory into the Social Network Analysis (SNA), we develop the code social network model, which can offer an efficient way to ensure the correctness of the message transmission within the social netwoks. The result of this study could apply in vary of social science studies.",

    "abstract": "We study the gravity solution dual to the D0 brane quantum mechanics, or BFSS matrix model, in the 't Hooft limit.\n  The classical physics described by this gravity solution is invariant under a scaling transformation, which changes the action with a specific critical exponent, sometimes called the hyperscaling violating exponent. We present an argument for this critical exponent from the matrix model side, which leads to an explanation for the peculiar temperature dependence of the entropy in this theory, $S \\propto T^{9/5}$. We also present a similar argument for all other $Dp$-brane geometries.\n  We then compute the black hole quasinormal modes. This involves perturbing the finite temperature geometry. These perturbations can be easily obtained by a mathematical trick where we view the solution as the dimensional reduction of an $AdS_{ 2 + 9/5 } \\times S^8$ geometry.",

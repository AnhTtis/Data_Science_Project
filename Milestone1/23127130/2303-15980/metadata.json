    "abstract": "By using the five Angstrom diameter pores of calcined zeolite as the template, we have fabricated boron doped carbon nanotube networks via the chemical vapor deposition method. Raman data indicate the network to comprise segments of interconnected carbon nano tubes. Transport measurements showed a superconducting transition initiating at 40K, with a sharp downturn around 20K to a low resistance state at 2K, accompanied by a low resistance plateau in the current voltage characteristic, fluctuating around zero resistance. Magnetic measurements exhibited the Meissner effect characteristic of thin superconducting wire networks in which the superconducting wire radius is much smaller than the London penetration length. At low magnetic field, the negative diamagnetic susceptibility was observed to persist beyond 200K. The transport and magnetic data are reconciled on the basis of a physical model based on weak links comprising short, one-dimensional superconducting nano tubes, that govern the global transport behavior.",

\begin{abstract}

Small collision systems, e.g.\ $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collisions, comprise a potential reference for more-central A-A collisions with regard to production (or not) of a thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Small systems with low particle densities should evolve according to simple QCD mechanisms including projectile-nucleon dissociation and dijet production. But it is now claimed that QGP may appear  even in \pp\ collisions based on apparent evidence for radial flow from shape evolution of $p_t$ spectra and from variation of total yields for strange and multistrange hadrons relative to statistical models. The present study confronts such arguments with a detailed analysis of $p_t$ spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions and 13 TeV $p$-$p$ collisions via a two-component model (TCM) of hadron production. Based on previous analysis the TCM accurately predicts spectra for Cascade and Omega hadrons.  Significant results include multistrange hadron spectra dominated by jet fragments, variation of strange-hadron abundances exaggerated by certain plot formats and spectrum extrapolations, and detailed relations between ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ evolution with event charge density and small shifts of jet fragment distributions on $p_t$. Within the context of the TCM, $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collision systems with comparable jet contributions are found to be equivalent within data uncertainties. Attribution of certain data features to radial flow is falsified.

\section{Introduction}

This article describes analysis of \pt\ spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions via a two-component (soft+hard) model (TCM) of identified-particle (PID) spectra. One motivation is investigation of claims that evolution of yields for (multi)strange hadrons with charge multiplicity \nch\ or charge density $\bar \rho_0$ demonstrates that for higher \nch\ strangeness production comparable to that observed in central \pbpb\ collisions is observed. That result in turn has been interpreted to suggest that production of a thermalized, flowing quark-gluon plasma (QGP) may be achieved also in smaller collision systems albeit for higher charge densities. The importance of such conclusions has been emphasized: ``...the field of relativistic heavy ion physics is in the midst of a revolution...driven by the experimental observation of flow-like features in the collisions of small hadronic systems''~\cite{nagle}.

So-called strangeness enhancement was proposed as a signature of QGP formation in more-central \aa\ collisions~\cite{mullerqgp}, and that signature has been claimed for more-central heavy ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC~\cite{auausss,pbpbsss}. Reference~\cite{alippss} notes that  ``In central heavy-ion collisions, the yields of strange hadrons turn out to be consistent with the expectation from a grand-canonical ensemble, i.e.\ the production of strange hadrons is compatible with thermal equilibrium....''  Apparent enhancement in more-central \aa\ collisions is contrasted with strangeness production in small systems: ``On the other hand, the strange hadron yields in elementary collisions are suppressed with respect to the predictions of the (grand-canonical) thermal models.''
% The suppression of the relative abundance of strange hadrons with respect to lighter flavours was suggested to be...a consequence of the finite volume, which makes the application of a grand-canonical ensemble not valid in hadron-hadron and hadron-nucleus interactions (canonical suppression).''
Reference~\cite{alippbss} refers to canonical suppression in similar terms: ``In smaller collision systems..., in particular proton-proton (pp) collisions, the relative abundance of multi-strange baryons is lower with respect to A-A collisions.... This led to the interpretation that strangeness enhancement is observed in \aa\ collisions. ... This means that strange hadrons are produced with a lower relative abundance in small systems, an effect known as canonical suppression.'' 

However, regarding previously-assumed contrasts in strangeness production between \aa\ and small collision systems Ref.~\cite{alippss} asserts that ``...strangeness enhancement is no longer considered an unambiguous signature for deconfinement [QGP formation].'' It notes that ``The ALICE Collaboration recently reported an enhancement in the relative production of (multi-) strange hadrons...in \pp\ collisions...and in \ppb\  collisions.... In the case of \ppb\ collisions, the yields of strange hadrons relative to pions reach values close to those observed in \pbpb\ collisions {\em at full equilibrium} [emphasis added].'' And Ref.~\cite{alippbss} interprets results from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions to conclude that ``...lifting of strangeness suppression with system size has been observed with measurements in a single collision systems. Hyperon to pion ratios are shown to increase with multiplicity in \ppb\ collisions from the values measured in pp to those observed in Pb-Pb. ...the behavior is qualitatively consistent with the lifting of canonical suppression with increasing multiplicity.'' Rather than admitting such results as challenging interpretations of \aa\ data the current trend has been to place small collision systems on a continuum with \aa\ regarding QGP formation. Such arguments may be strongly questioned~\cite{nature}.

%``The origin of the collectivity in small collision systems has now become one of the most interesting and important topics in heavy-ion physics. The final answer to it may significantly affect our understanding of the collective behaviors and transport properties of the dense QCD matter produced in nucleus-nucleus collision systems.''

The present study addresses the structure of PID \pt\ spectra for (multi)strange hadrons from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions reported in Ref.~\cite{alippbss} and from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions reported in Ref.~\cite{alippss}. A context for this study is provided by previous TCM analysis of PID spectrum data for lower-mass hadrons from Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} reported in Refs.~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2} and from Ref.~\cite{alicepppid} reported in Ref.~\cite{pppid}. This study addresses the evolution with charged-particle multiplicity \nch\ of differential PID \pt\ spectra, integrated yields and  ensemble-mean \mmpt\ for strange hadrons in comparison to nonstrange hadrons. The analysis is intended to extract {\em all statistically significant information} from particle data regarding those data features. In particular, contributions from minimum-bias (MB) jet production~\cite{mbdijets} are accurately identified as a determining factor.

A further context comes from Ref.~\cite{transport} wherein it is determined that PID spectrum evolution with \nch\ corresponds to transport of hadron species from soft (nonjet) to hard (jet-related) spectrum components while conserving {\em total} species abundances approximately consistent with statistical-model predictions. The degree of transport depends linearly on hadron mass permitting quantitative {\em predictions} of spectrum evolution for multistrange hadron transport that are confirmed by the present study.

Abundance variations vs charge multiplicity \nch\ for several hadron species are compared for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. Variations for the two systems are quite similar when compared on the basis of a TCM hard/soft ratio but {\em not} when compared on the basis of charge density. The relation of such variations to strangeness {\em per se} vs hadron mass, and the {\em significance} of measured variations compared to data uncertainties, are examined -- factors with critical relevance in regard to ``strangeness enhancement'' as an indicator for equilibration via particle rescattering and QGP formation.

\section{PID TCM for small systems}  \label{spectrumtcm}

In this section PID TCMs for 13 TeV \pp\ and 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions are introduced, referring to previous analyses of PID spectra for lower-mass hadrons~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2,pppid}. Parameter values for PID model functions and for species fractions of soft $\bar \rho_s$ and hard $\bar \rho_h$ charge densities from those previous independent studies are presented unchanged as a test of consistency. That material then provides a reference for analysis of PID spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons in the present study.

\subsection{PID spectrum TCM definition}   \label{pidspec}

Given a \pt\ spectrum TCM for unidentified-hadron spectra~\cite{ppprd,tomnewppspec} a corresponding TCM for identified hadrons can be generated by assuming that each hadron species $i$ comprises certain {\em fractions} of soft and hard TCM components denoted by $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$. The PID spectrum TCM can then be written as
\bea \label{pidspectcm}
\bar \rho_{0i}(y_t,n_s) &\approx&  z_{si}(n_s) \bar \rho_{s} \hat S_{0i}(y_t) +   z_{hi}(n_s) \bar \rho_{h} \hat H_{0i}(y_t),
\eea
where for \pp\ collisions $\bar \rho_h \approx \alpha(\sqrt{s}) \bar \rho_s^2$~\cite{tomnewppspec} and $\bar \rho_0 = \bar \rho_{s} + \bar \rho_h$ is the measured event-class nonPID charge density. $\bar \rho_s$ is then obtained from measured  $\bar \rho_0$ as the root of $\bar \rho_0 = \bar \rho_{s} + \alpha \bar \rho_s^2$. Unit-normal model functions $\hat S_{0i}(y_t)$ and $\hat H_{0i}(y_t)$ are determined for each hadron species, but similarity to unidentified-hadron models is expected. 

The data soft component for a specific hadron species $i$ (except pions, with a resonance contribution) is well described by a L\'evy distribution as a density on $m_{ti}  = \sqrt{p_t^2 + m_i^2}$. The unit-integral soft-component model is 
\bea \label{s00}
\hat S_{0i}(m_{ti}) &=& \frac{A_i}{[1 + (m_{ti} - m_i) / n_i T_i]^{n_i}},
\eea
where $m_{ti}$ is the transverse mass for hadrons $i$ of mass $m_i$, $n_i$ is the L\'evy exponent, $T_i$ is the slope parameter and coefficient $A_i$ is determined by the unit-integral condition. As defined, the soft-component model is a density on \pt\ or \mt\ which may be plotted vs pion \yt. The unit-integral hard-component model is simply defined on pion $y_{t\pi} \equiv \ln((p_t + m_{t\pi})/m_\pi)$ as a Gaussian, with exponential (on $y_t$) or power-law (on $p_t$) tail at higher \yt\
\bea \label{h00}
\hat H_{0}(y_t) &\approx & B \exp\left\{ - \frac{(y_t - \bar y_t)^2}{2 \sigma^2_{y_t}}\right\}~~~\text{near mode $\bar y_t$}
\\ \nonumber
&\propto &  \exp(- q y_t)~~~\text{for higher $y_t$ -- the tail},
\eea
where the transition from Gaussian to exponential is determined by slope matching (see the macro in Ref.~\cite{hardspec}). Coefficient $B$ is determined by the unit-integral condition. This hard-component model defined as a density on $y_{t\pi}$ may be transformed to a density on \pt\  via  Jacobian $y_{t\pi} / m_{t\pi} p_t $.  The $\hat H_0$ tail then varies on \pt\ as power law $1/p_t^{q + 2.2}$ reflecting an underlying jet spectrum~\cite{fragevo}.

The PID spectrum TCM for \ppb\ collisions has the same structure as Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) but $\bar \rho_s \rightarrow (N_{part}/2) \bar \rho_{sNN}$ and $\bar \rho_h \rightarrow N_{bin} \bar \rho_{hNN}$, where $N_{part}$ is the number of participant nucleons N, $N_{bin}$ ($= N_{part}-1$ for \ppb) is the number of \nn\ (in this case \pn) binary collisions, and densities $\bar \rho_{xNN}$ are averages over all participant pairs. For assumed \pn\ linear superposition within \ppb\ collisions $\bar \rho_{hNN} \approx \alpha \bar \rho_{sNN}^2$ as for \pp\ collisions. Hard/soft ratio $\bar \rho_h / \bar \rho_s \equiv x(n_s) \nu(n_s)$, with $x \approx \alpha \rho_{sNN}$ ($\approx \alpha \bar \rho_s$ for \pp\ collisions) and $\nu = 2 N_{bin} / N_{part}$ (= 1 for \pp\ collisions), is of central importance. Parameter estimation requires accurate determination of \ppb\ centrality or collision geometry vs measured charge density $\bar \rho_0$ as reported in Ref.~\cite{tomglauber}, which also notes that determination of \ppb\ geometry via a classical Glauber model produces very inaccurate results~\cite{tomexclude}. Table~\ref{rppbdata} presents centrality parameter values (unprimed values) for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions.

\subsection{$\bf \hat S_{0i}$ and $\bf \hat H_{0i}$ model-function parameters}

Table~\ref{pidparams} shows 5 TeV \ppb\ TCM model parameters for hard component $\hat H_0(y_t)$ (first three) and soft component $\hat S_0(y_t)$ (last two) reported in Ref.~\cite{pidpart1}. Hard-component parameters vary significantly with hadron species and centrality: Gaussian width $\sigma_{y_t}$ is greater for mesons than for baryons while exponent $q$ is substantially greater for baryons than for mesons, and modes $\bar y_t$ for baryons shift to higher \yt\ with increasing centrality while modes for mesons (from \ppb\ collisions) shift to lower \yt. Soft-component model parameter $T$ is independent of collision energy but increases substantially with hadron mass. L\'evy exponent $n$ and hard-component exponent $q$ have substantial systematic energy dependence~\cite{alicetomspec}.

Table~\ref{engparamsyy} presents 13 TeV \pp\ TCM model parameters from Table V of Ref.~\cite{pppid}. Uncertainties for proton parameters $\bar y_t$ and $\sigma_{y_t}$ indicate the range of variation of those parameters for the variable-TCM hard component. Corresponding ensemble-mean \pt\ values $\bar p_{tsi}$ and $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ for soft and hard spectrum components corresponding to these model parameters are discussed in Sec.~\ref{mptsec}.

The entries for \ppb\ collisions in Table~\ref{pidparams} define a {\em fixed} TCM reference independent of centrality that describes the {\em most central} event class (wherein $\bar y_t \approx 3.0$ for baryons)~\cite{pidpart1} wheres entries for \pp\ collisions in Table~\ref{engparamsyy} define a fixed TCM describing an {\em average over event classes}, with proton uncertainties reflecting variation of its hard component. In Refs.~\cite{pidpart2,pppid} variation of some hard-component model parameters is determined so as to describe all event classes within statistical uncertainties (e.g.\ see Fig.~4 of Ref.~\cite{pidpart2}). Required variations are linear on hard/soft ratio $x(n_s) \nu(n_s)$: with increasing ratio hard-component modes $\bar y_t(n_s)$ shift to higher \yt\ for baryons while, {\em for \ppb\ spectra only}, hard-component widths above the mode decrease for mesons. In the present study the meson width evolution is reported in terms of equivalent mode shifts per $\bar y_t(n_s)$.

\subsection{TCM PID hadron fractions $\bf z_{si}(n_s)$ and $\bf z_{hi}(n_s)$}

Table~\ref{otherparamsx} shows PID parameters $z_{0i}$ and $\tilde z_i = z_{hi}/ z_{si}$ for five hadron species, determined from PID spectrum data for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions, as reported in Ref.~\cite{pidpart1}. While $z_0$ was found to be independent of \ppb\ centrality within uncertainties the \ppb\ $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ exhibit significant centrality dependence as shown in Fig.~8 of Ref.~\cite{pidpart1}. It is notable that the $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ depend only on hadron mass, not on strangeness or baryon identity. Measurements of individual centrality trends for $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$ based on spectrum analysis are presented in Sec.~IV of Ref.~\cite{pidpart1}.  Individual fractions $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$ may also be derived from model parameters $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ and $z_{0i}$ via relations
\bea \label{zsix}
z_{si}(n_s) &=& \frac{1 + x(n_s) \nu(n_s)}{1 + \tilde z_i(n_s)x(n_s) \nu(n_s)} z_{0i}(n_s)
\\ \nonumber
z_{hi}(n_s) &=& \tilde z_i(n_s)z_{si}(n_s).
\eea
 5 TeV \ppb\ geometry (centrality) parameters $x(n_s)$ and $\nu(n_s)$ are determined in Refs.~\cite{alicetommpt,tommpt,tomglauber} based on ensemble-mean \mmpt\ data (see Table~\ref{rppbdata}). For \pp\ collisions $\nu \equiv 2 N_{bin} / N_{part} \rightarrow 1$. The $\tilde z_i = z_{hi}/ z_{si}$ values included in Table~\ref{otherparamsx} represent averages over \ppb\ centrality. 
 
 %Given the TCM expression in Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) the correct rescaling via $\bar \rho_{si} = z_{si}(n_s) \bar \rho_{s}$ results in data spectra coinciding with $\hat S_0(y_t)$ as $y_t \rightarrow 0$ for all centralities.

Table~\ref{otherparamsy} shows results for three hadron species from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions that may be compared with results for 5 TeV \ppb\ described above. With the exception of pion $\tilde z_i$ the $z_{xi}$ values determined for the two collision systems are consistent within data uncertainties. The significant change for pion $\tilde z_i$, related to proton-pion crosstalk in $dE/dx$ analysis,  is explained in Ref.~\cite{pppid} Sec.~IX B.

Ensemble-mean \mmpt\ values in right columns of Tables~\ref{otherparamsx} and \ref{otherparamsy}, based on model-function parameters in Tables~\ref{pidparams} and \ref{engparamsyy}, were used in a study of hadron species transport from soft to hard component within small collision systems~\cite{transport}.  The apparent disagreement between $\bar p_{thi}$ value 1.34 for neutral kaons from \ppb\ collisions and 1.46 for charged kaons from \pp\ collisions arises from different evolution with \nch\ for two systems as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} (right): The value for midcentral ($n = 4$) \ppb\ is 1.35 whereas the constant value for \pp\ is 1.44, agreeing within uncertainties with the entries in Tables~\ref{otherparamsx} and \ref{otherparamsy}.

In previous studies mean values of TCM parameters are reported in tables as above whereas any significant evolution with \nch\ is indicated within the text or by in-line equations. In the present study display equations are defined for relevant TCM variables with parameter values denoted in the tables by starred quantities.

Since $\tilde z_i$ values are simply proportionality to hadron mass and the $z_{0i}$ values are consistent with statistical-model predictions~\cite{statmodel} the PID TCM for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions is predicted quantitatively {\em within data uncertainties} by previous results from other collision systems. Extrapolation of the same mass dependence is applied to the present study of more-massive (multi)strange hadrons.

Figure~\ref{tildezparams} (left) shows ratios $\tilde z_{i}(n_s) = z_{hi}(n_s)/z_{si}(n_s)$ (points) inferred from $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$ data reported in Ref.~\cite{pidpart1} for charged hadrons (solid dots) and neutral hadrons (open circles), from pions at the bottom to Lambdas at the top. Solid, dashed and dotted lines corresponding to pions, kaons and baryons are Eq.~(\ref{tildez}) with parameters from the right panel. The pion line ($\approx 0.6$) corresponds to strict charge conservation as noted in Ref.~\cite{pppid} whereas the data points ($\approx 0.85$) from Ref.~\cite{pidpart1} may include crosstalk from misidentified protons.

\section{Strange and multistrange TCM} \label{smallspec}

This section presents a comprehensive TCM analysis of PID spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons based on PID spectrum data from Ref.~\cite{alippbss} for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and from Ref.~\cite{alippss} for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. Spectra for the present study are presented as densities on \pt\ plotted vs pion rapidity $y_{t\pi}$ with pion mass assumed.  $\hat S_{0i}(m_{ti})$ for species $i$ is defined by Eq.~(\ref{s00}). $\hat H_{0}(y_{t\pi})$ in Eq.~(\ref{h00}) is defined as a density on $y_{t\pi}$ where it has a simple form and is then converted to $\hat H_{0}(p_t)$ via the Jacobian factor $y_{t\pi} / m_{t\pi} p_t $. In general, plotting spectra as densities on \pt\ against logarithmic variable \yt\ permits superior visual access to important low-\pt\ structure where the {\em majority of jet fragments appears}. A further motivation is comparison of spectrum hard components interpreted to arise from a common underlying jet spectrum on \pt\ \cite{hardspec,fragevo}, in which case $y_{t\pi}$ serves simply as a logarithmic measure of hadron \pt\ with well-defined zero. Starred parameters below relate to Eqs.~(\ref{ytbar}), (\ref{tildez}), (\ref{z0trend}) and (\ref{mpth}) that define variable-TCM parameters $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$, $\tilde z_i(n_s)$, $z_{0i}(n_s)$ and $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ respectively. Solid curves in Figs.~\ref{ppbpiddata} and \ref{piddata} are the variable TCM with those definitions implemented.

\subsection{5 $\bf TeV$ $\bf p$-Pb PID Spectrum data}

The 5 TeV \ppb\ PID spectrum data used for this analysis were reported by Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} (for $K_\text{S}^0$ and $\Lambda$ data, 25 million  events) and Ref.~\cite{alippbss} (for $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ data, 100 million events). Events are sorted into seven multiplicity classes based on charge accumulated within a V0A or V0M detector combination~\cite{aliceppbpid}. Mean charge densities $dN_{ch} / d\eta \rightarrow \bar \rho_0$  as integrated within $|\eta| < 0.5$ or angular acceptance $\Delta \eta = 1$ are 45, 36.2, 30.5, 23.2, 16.1, 9.8 and 4.3 for event class $n \in [1,7]$ respectively. 

Figure~\ref{ppbpiddata} shows PID \pt\ spectra (points) for neutral kaons (a), Lambdas (b), Cascades (c) and Omegas (d) plotted vs pion rapidity \yt. The solid curves are TCM spectra determined as described below. The dashed curves are soft-component models in the form $z_{si}(n_s) \bar \rho_s \hat S_{0i}(p_t)$. The dotted curve in (d) is the Omega hard-component model in the form $z_{hi}(n_s) \bar \rho_h \hat H_{0i}(p_t)$. The latter serves to demonstrate that a large fraction of Omegas from central \ppb\ collisions are jet fragments.

The TCM for strange-hadron spectra in Fig.~\ref{ppbpiddata} is based in part on results from Refs.~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2} (for  $K_\text{S}^0$ and $\Lambda$) and on the present study (for $\Xi$ and $\Omega$). Table~\ref{pidparamz} presents hard-component model $\hat H_{0i}(y_t)$ parameter values with variable mode position $\bar y_t(n_s)$ defined by
\bea \label{ytbar}
\bar y_t(n_s) &=& \bar y_t^* + \delta \bar y_t^* x(n_s)\nu(n_s).
\eea
The soft-component parameter values are $T = 200$ MeV and $n = 14$ for the four species. For heavier hadrons there is reduced sensitivity to L\'evy exponent $n$. Note that in Ref.~\cite{pidpart2} kaon hard-component widths above the mode were observed to decrease. In the present study that evolution is expressed in terms of an equivalent mode shift to lower \yt. $\delta \bar y_t^*$ for neutral kaons is then {\em negative}.

Table~\ref{coefparams} below shows \ppb\ parameter values for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions that determine PID fraction coefficients $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$ as defined by Eqs.~(\ref{zsix}). Variable hard/soft fractional-coefficient ratio $\tilde z_i(n_s) = z_{hi}(n_s) / z_{si}(n_s)$ is obtained from
\bea \label{tildez}
\tilde z_i(n_s) &=& \tilde z_i^* + \delta \tilde z_i^* x(n_s)\nu(n_s).
\eea
As noted in Refs.~\cite{pppid,transport} the starred $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ parameters vary simply proportional to hadron mass and show no significant sensitivity to baryon identity or strangeness content. $\tilde z_i^*$ and $ \delta \tilde z_i^*$ values for $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ are thus obtained for this study by extrapolation of the mass dependence (see Fig.~\ref{tildezparams}, right). Fractional abundance coefficient $z_{0i}$ appearing in Eqs.~(\ref{zsix}) was assumed independent of charge multiplicity for lighter hadrons~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2,pppid}. 
However, significant variation of $z_{0i}$ with event class is observed for $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ in \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions and is incorporated in variable $z_{0i}(n_s)$ defined by Eq.~\ref{z0trend} (Sec.~\ref{variable}). That combination of parameter values plus Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) determines the solid curves in Fig.~\ref{ppbpiddata}.  

\subsection{13 $\bf TeV$ $\bf p$-$\bf p$ PID Spectrum data} \label{alicedata}

The 13 TeV \pp\ PID spectrum data used for this analysis were reported in Ref.~\cite{alippss}. Spectrum data were obtained from 50 million \pp\ collision events satisfying an INEL $> 0$ minimum-bias trigger (at least one charged particle within $|\eta| < 1$). Collision events were sorted into ten multiplicity classes based on charge accumulated within a V0 detector (V0M amplitude). Mean charge densities $dN_{ch} / d\eta \rightarrow \bar \rho_0$  as integrated within $|\eta| < 0.5$ or angular acceptance $\Delta \eta = 1$ are 25.8, 19.8 16.1, 13.8, 12.1 10.1 8.1, 6.5, 4.6 and 2.5 for $n \in [1,10]$ respectively. Note that a factor ten increase in $\bar \rho_0$ implies approximately {\em 100-fold increase in jet production} per the fundamental relation $\bar \rho_h \approx \alpha \bar \rho_s^2$ for \pp\ collisions~\cite{ppprd,pppid}.

Figure~\ref{piddata} shows PID spectrum data from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions reported in Ref.~\cite{alippss} (points) as densities on \pt\ vs transverse rapidity \yt\ with pion mass assumed. Published spectra have been divided by published $p_t$ values relative to the presentation in Fig.~2 of Ref.~\cite{alippss}. Especially for Cascades note that there is no other rescaling. The Cascade data spectra then fall systematically below the TCM predictions. The spectra are rescaled by powers of 10 according to $10^{n-1}$ where $n \in [1,10]$ is the centrality class index and $n = 10$ is here most central, following the practice in Ref.~\cite{alippss}. Elsewhere in this paper event class $n = 1$ is most central (see $\bar \rho_0$ values listed above). The solid curves are full TCM parametrizations. 
The dash-dotted curves are TCM predictions scaled down by factor 2/3. The dashed curves are TCM soft components in the form $ z_{si }\bar \rho_s \hat S_0(y_t)$. The differences represent minimum-bias jet contributions modeled by $ z_{hi} \bar \rho_h \hat H_0(y_t)$.

The plotting format in Figs.~\ref{ppbpiddata} and \ref{piddata} is desirable for two reasons: 
(a) Soft component $\hat S_0(y_t)$ that (for example) describes low-\pt\ data within their statistical uncertainties for \ppb\ and \pp\ collisions~\cite{pidpart1,pidpart2} closely approximates a Boltzmann exponential on \mt\ at lower \mt\ and thus follows an $A - m_i \cosh(y_t)/T$ trend in this semilog format on \yt\ (where $m_i$ is the mass for hadron species $i$ and A is some constant).
(b) Hard component $\hat H_0(y_t)$ that describes high-\pt\ data within statistical uncertainties for \ppb\ and \pp\ collisions follows an exponential $\exp(-q\, y_t)$ at higher \yt\ equivalent to a power law on \mt\ or \pt\ that manifests in this format as a straight line for $y_t > 4$. 

In contrast, the plotting format chosen for Fig.~2 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} shows spectra in the form $d^2 N_{ch} / dp_t dy_z$ that is missing a factor $1/p_t$ appropriate for momentum in the transverse plane and thus does not approximate a Boltzmann exponential for low \mt. The data are presented on linear \pt\ rather than logarithmic \yt, and data binning is also defined on \pt\ requiring dramatic variation of bin widths to control statistical uncertainties. On linear \pt\ there is no hint of the simple data trends evident on \yt. 

Table~\ref{pidparamx} shows hard-component parameters for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. Parameters $\bar y_t^*$ and $\delta \bar y_t^*$ are used to define variable mode $\bar y_t(n_s)$ per Eq.~(\ref{ytbar}). Soft-component slope parameters $T = 200$ MeV and $n = 14$ are held fixed at those values for more-massive hadrons (as for \ppb).

Table~\ref{coefparams2} below shows fractional-coefficient parameters for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. Parameters $\tilde z_i^*$ and $\delta \tilde z_i^*$ are used to define variable hard/soft ratio parameter $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ per Eq.~(\ref{tildez}). Variable $z_{0i}(n_s)$ is defined by Eq.~\ref{z0trend} (Sec.~\ref{variable}). $z_{0i}(n_s)$ and $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ are then combined to define fractional coefficients $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$ per Eqs.~(\ref{zsix}). That combination plus Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) determines the solid curves in Fig.~\ref{piddata}.  

\subsection{PID spectrum evolution}

Figure~\ref{shapes} (left) shows data (plotted as curves rather than points) for neutral kaons (dashed), Lambdas (dotted), Cascades (dash-dotted) and Omegas (solid) for event class $n=9$ (low \nch) from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. The data are rescaled by $z_{si}(n_s) \bar \rho_s$ so as to be directly comparable to soft-component models. The solid curve marked $S_0$ is the soft-component model $\hat S_0(m_t)$ for neutral kaons. The lower curves are $\hat S_0(m_t)$ for four hadron species reduced by factor 50 showing shape variation due solely to hadron mass. Those curves, within that plot space, are almost exactly Boltzmann exponentials on \mt. \mmpt\ soft components $\bar p_{tsi}$ are thus determined by $ \hat S_{0i}(m_t)$ model functions that depend only on hadron mass.

%%%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{shapes} (right) shows equivalent data for event class $n = 1$ (high \nch) demonstrating that above $y_t \approx 2$ (0.5 GeV/c) PID spectra for more-massive hadrons are dominated by MB jet fragments. The L\'evy exponent $n$ then has no significance, TCM soft component $\hat S_0(m_t)$ is in effect a pure Boltzmann exponential. With increasing \pp\ \nch\ an {\em approximately fixed} hard-component shape increases in amplitude {\em linearly} relative to fixed $\hat S_0(y_t)$ per $\bar \rho_h / \bar \rho_s \approx \alpha \bar \rho_s$. That is especially obvious for higher-mass baryons. These results are of interest in part because of the dramatic contrast to the blast-wave model and interpretation of spectrum ``hardening'' as indicating radial flow. Simultaneous BW model fits to multiple hadron species typically fall off rapidly with increasing \yt\ relative to spectrum data~\cite{tommodeltests,tombw,pppid}, and thus cannot represent jet-related hard components that dominate high \pt.
 
\subsection{Data description quality}

In previous TCM analyses of PID spectra from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2} and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions~\cite{pppid} data description quality was studied in detail using the Z-score statistic~\cite{zscore}. It was established that spectrum data are described by the TCM within their statistical uncertainties. In the present analysis emphasizing multistrange baryons statistical uncertainties are substantially larger. The description quality is then apparent simply by visual comparison of data and TCM in Figs.~\ref{ppbpiddata} and \ref{piddata}.

The most recent modification to the variable TCM is Eq.~\ref{z0trend} that provides for variable abundances $z_{0i}(n_s)$ for Cascades and Omegas per Tables~\ref{coefparams} and \ref{coefparams2} based on yields from Refs.~\cite{alippbss,alippss} (see Sec.~\ref{totyields}). Without that addition TCM spectra would be systematically displaced from data for Cascades and Omegas in  Figs.~\ref{ppbpiddata} and \ref{piddata}.

This section responds to presentations of total integrated PID yields $\bar \rho_{0i}$ from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions reported in Refs.~\cite{alippss} and \cite{alippbss} respectively. Variations of total yields, various combinations thereof and integrals over restricted high-\pt\ intervals as defined in Eq.~(\ref{ratint}) are considered relative to increasing total charge density $\bar \rho_0$. The relation of yield data to canonical suppression of strangeness is considered.

\subsection{PID integrated high-$\bf p_t$ yields} \label{highpt}

This subsection relates specifically to Fig.~6 of Ref.~\cite{alippss}. Referring to spectra in ratio to a MB reference spectrum as in its Figs.~2-4 it is acknowledged that the ratios ``...reach a plateau for $p_T \geq 4$ GeV/c'' corresponding to the power-law trends obvious in the plot format of Sec.~\ref{smallspec} above. In its Fig.~6, spectrum integrals over $p_t > 4$ GeV/c are plotted vs charge density $\bar \rho_0$. The quantities are ``self-normalized,'' that is, divided by their average over event classes. It is noted that ``...the high-$p_T$ yields of strange hadrons increase  faster than the charged particle multiplicity. ...the data also hint at the increase being non-linear. ...the...yields of baryons are higher than those of [neutral kaons].'' It is of interest to contrast those observations with information derived from the TCM.

Figure~\ref{highptx} (left) shows PID yield data (solid dots) for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions from Ref.~\cite{alippss} corresponding to its Fig.~6 (upper left). PID spectra in Fig.~\ref{piddata} above (solid dots) are integrated over high-\pt\ intervals ($> 4$ GeV/c, except $>3.8$ GeV/c for Omegas). Integrated yields are then rescaled by the same integral applied to a minimum-bias spectrum for the corresponding hadron species.  A similar rescaling is applied to total charge density $\bar \rho_0$ on the $x$ axis, where $\bar \rho_{0\text{MB}} \approx 6.9$. The open squares highlight the Omega data points. The open circles result from the same procedure applied to TCM spectra (solid curves in Fig.~\ref{piddata}). The curves are explained below. Given the structure of Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) the integrals have the form
\bea \label{ratint}
&\propto& z_{hi}(n_s) \bar \rho_{h} \int_\text{4 GeV/c}^\infty dp_t p_t \hat H_{0i}(p_t,n_s),
\eea
where $\bar \rho_{h} \approx \alpha \bar \rho_s^2 \equiv x(n_s) \bar \rho_s$ and $\bar \rho_s$ is obtained from measured charge density $\bar \rho_0$ as the root of $\bar \rho_0 \approx \bar \rho_s + \alpha \bar \rho_s^2$, with $\alpha \approx 0.017$ for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions~\cite{tomnewppspec}. Soft-component $\hat S_0(p_t)$ can be neglected above 4 GeV/c. Clearly, the left panel does not provide access to detailed trends.

Figure~\ref{highptx} (right) shows an alternative plotting format based on the TCM. Given the structure of Eq.~(\ref{ratint}) the data and curves in the left panel are divided by density $\bar \rho_h = x(n_s) \bar \rho_s$ as shown in the right panel. The error bars represent uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. If data hard components $\hat H_{0i}(p_t)$ were independent of event class each integral would remain constant.  Variation with $\bar \rho_0$ would then be determined solely by PID coefficients $z_{hi}(n_s)$ defined by Eqs.~(\ref{zsix}) (solid curves in right panel). But as reported in Refs.~\cite{pidpart2,pppid} spectrum hard components $\hat H_{0i}(p_t,n_s)$ vary substantially with event class, meson functions shifting to {\em lower} \yt\ (for \ppb\ collisions) while baryon functions shift to higher \yt, with corresponding strong variation of the integral in Eq.~(\ref{ratint}). The trends for high-\pt\ integrals in the right panel correspond directly to trends for PID ensemble-mean $\bar p_{thi}$ in Fig.~\ref{mptss}.

Rescaling of TCM elements for Fig.~\ref{highptx} is performed as follows. For each hadron species the TCM integrals (open circles, derived from solid curves in Fig.~\ref{piddata}) are rescaled to agree with the ALICE data (solid dots) {\em on average} as they appear in the right panel.  The TCM hard-component centroids are then temporarily fixed at event class 5 (or 3 for Omegas) and TCM curves $z_{hi}(n_s)$ for each hadron species are rescaled to coincide with the resulting TCM integrals (i.e.\ corresponding to $z_{hi}(n_s) / \bar z_{hi} \approx O(1)$). The {\em variable} TCM hard components are then restored and TCM points and curves are transformed appropriately to appear in the left panel. 

In the format  at right one observes the effects of shifting hard components (jet fragment distributions): strong increase for baryons {\em relative to} $z_{hi}(n_s)$ (solid curves) but no significant variation for mesons $K_\text{S}^0$. The data increase in the left panel relative to linear $\bar \rho_0$ is dominated by factor $\bar \rho_h \propto \bar \rho_s^2 \sim \bar \rho_0^2$, that quadratic relation being a {\em signature feature of jet production} in \pp\ collisions~\cite{jetspec2}.
%
The right panel reveals details relative to the dominant jet-production quadratic trend: the effects on high-\pt\ integrals of jet-related hard-component mode shifts on \yt. Even more insight can be gained by differential analysis of intact PID spectra as in Sec.~\ref{smallspec} and Refs.~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2,pppid}.

%TCM integrals are rescaled with the same $ \bar z_{hi}$ but require additional factors $O(50)$ to deal with the integrals over $p_t > 4$ of $\hat H_0(y_t)$: 25, 60, 75 and 25, the last because of the lower bound on the Omega integral.

\subsection{PID integrated total yields} \label{totyields}

Figures~8-11, 13 and 14 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} relate to integrated total yields $\bar \rho_{0i}$ for 13 TeV \pp\ PID spectra in various combinations or ratios. Figures 8, 9 and 11 show $\bar \rho_{0i}$ vs total charge density $\bar \rho_{0}$. Figure 10 shows $\bar \rho_{0i}$ vs $\bar \rho_{0j}$ for various species combinations $(i,j)$. Figure 13 shows ratios $\bar \rho_{0i}/\bar \rho_{0j}$  for various combinations $(i,j)$, and Fig.~14 repeats Fig.~8 in comparison with Monte Carlos.  Based on its Fig.~11, a log-log version of its Fig.~8, Ref.~\cite{alippss} asserts that ``As can be seen in Fig.~11, the yields of strange hadrons increase with the charged particle multiplicity following a power law behaviour...,'' the same for 7 and 13 TeV.  A straight line on a log-log plot does represent a power law, but in this case the power is trivially $\approx 1$ (modulo variations in slope as revealed in Fig.~\ref{ratios} below). Given the basic result from Fig.~8 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} the yield trends in the other plot formats  are easily generated.

The TCM of Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) in combination with Eq.~(\ref{zsix}) previously assumed $\bar \rho_{0i} = z_{0i} \bar \rho_{0}$ with $z_{0i}$ approximately independent of event class~\cite{pidpart1}. In the present study ratios $\bar \rho_{0i} / \bar \rho_{0} \approx z_{0i}(n_s)$ vs $\bar \rho_0$, which may represent all the information carried by PID spectrum integrals $\bar \rho_{0i}$, are addressed differentially to determine $z_{0i}(n_s)$ variation.

Figure~\ref{ratios} (left) compares \pp\ data (solid dots) and \ppb\ data (open circles) for integrated yields $\bar \rho_{0i}$ in the form of ratios $\bar \rho_{0i} / \bar \rho_{0} \approx z_{0i}(n_s)$ plotted vs $\bar \rho_{0}$. Some \pp\ data are derived from $K^\pm/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ ratios appearing in Fig.~5 of Ref.~\cite{alicepppid}.

The \pp\ $X/\pi$ ratios are converted to $z_{0i}$ estimates by multiplying the ratios by fixed $z_{0i}^* \approx 0.8$ for pions. In addition, they are corrected for pion $dE/dx$ bias by factor 1/0.85 as discussed below. The error bars show systematic errors uncorrelated across event classes. 
The solid lines are values $z_{0i}^*$ from Tables~\ref{coefparams} and \ref{coefparams2}. The hatched bands represent NSD values $\bar \rho_{0\text{NSD}} \approx 5$ for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and $\approx 6.5$ for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions.

Figure~\ref{ratios} (right) shows the results in the left panel replotted against hard/soft ratio $x(n_s) \nu(n_s)$ (with $\nu = 1$ for \pp). In that plot format the near equivalence of \ppb\ and \pp\ data is apparent.  A similar equivalence between \pp\ and \ppb\ systems is revealed for ensemble-mean \mmpt\ data in Sec.~\ref{mptsec}. \ppb\ Omega errors have been doubled to make them visible. The dash-dotted line corresponds to Cascade spectra in Fig.~\ref{piddata} (c) (dash-dotted curves) that are consistent with $z_{0i}^* \approx 0.0030$ but contradict total yields.

\subsection{Variable fractional coefficients $\bf z_{0i}(n_s)$} \label{variable}

Significant variation of parameters $z_{0i}(n_s)$ for Cascade and Omega baryons is obvious in Fig.~\ref{ratios}. In order to incorporate that feature into a PID TCM the yield data must be examined more differentially.
Variable $z_{0i}(n_s)$ is  expressed in terms of TCM hard/soft ratio $x \nu$ as 
\bea \label{z0trend}
z_{0i}(n_s) \approx z_{0i}^* [1 + \delta z_{0i}^*(x\nu - 0.20)].
\eea
The value 0.20 is a consequence of choosing $z_{0i}^*$ values that correspond to spectra for central event class 5 (for \pp) or 4 (for \ppb), in which case the crossover in Fig.~\ref{ratios} (right) must occur near $x\nu \approx 0.2$. The $z_{0i}^*$ and $\delta z_{0i}^*$ values appear in Tables~\ref{coefparams} and \ref{coefparams2}. The following figure presents a more differential analysis of coefficients $z_{0i}$.

Figure~\ref{ratiosx} shows ratios $z_{0i}(n_s) / z_{0i}^*$ vs hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)$ for \pp\ collisions (left) and vs $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ for \ppb\ collisions (right) and for charged hadrons (solid dots) and neutral hadrons (open circles, or open squares for Omegas) where the curves guide the eye. In the right panel it is notable that the {\em published} yields for pions and protons relative to statistical-model expectations differ systematically from reference value 1 to an extent consistent with bias arising from $dE/dx$ PID crosstalk as discussed in Refs.~\cite{pidpart1,pppid}. The dash-dotted line in the left panel represents the {\em average} value 0.83 of proton inefficiency function $\epsilon_p(p$-$p)$ defined by Eq.~(10) of Ref.~\cite{pppid}. 

The charged $K^\pm$ and proton $p$ points in the left panel, obtained from biased  $X/\pi$ ratios, are corrected by factor $1.18 \approx 1/0.85$ (hatched band) to compensate in part for the pion yield excess. That procedure does not remove {\em variation} of the pion ratio with \nch\ as appears in the right panel (upper solid points). The $K^\pm$ points thus approximate the ($2\times $)$K_\text{S}^0$ data but increase significantly with increasing \nch\ whereas $K_\text{S}^0$ do not.  This result confirms that the proton suppression for two collision systems is equivalent, as was concluded for PID spectra in Ref.~\cite{pppid}.

Especially for \pp\ data all hadron species decrease substantially relative to the reference for \nch\ below the NSD value ($\bar \rho_0 \approx 6.5 \Rightarrow x \approx 0.1$ for \pp\ collisions, vertical hatched band). No attempt is made within the TCM to describe those {\em local} trends. The dashed lines in the two panels describe a more-gradual variation approximately linear vs hard/soft ratio $x$ or $x\nu$. The slopes of the dashed lines are then incorporated as parameter $\delta z_{0i}^*$ into Eq.~\ref{z0trend}. The lines for Cascades and Omegas pass through 1.0 for $x\nu = 0.2$ while the line for pions passes through 1.17 and that for protons through 0.81 at  that point.

Tables~\ref{coefparams} and \ref{coefparams2} summarize fractional-coefficient parameters based on TCM analysis of PID spectra in the present study plus $X/\pi$ ratios and/or integrated PID yields from Refs.~\cite{aliceppbpid,alicepppid,alippbss,alippss}. 
The $z_{0i}^*$ values are determined such that data trends approximate value 1 near $x\nu = 0.20$ in Fig.~\ref{ratiosx}. 
The exceptions are for pion and proton yields where the $z_{0i}^*$ values are fixed at 0.80 and 0.070 respectively from Ref.~\cite{pppid} as presented in Table~\ref{otherparamsy} based on proton spectra corrected for $dE/dx$ bias and on pion $z_{si}(n_s)$ values determined by charge conservation.

Note that hard/soft ratio $\tilde z_i^*$, measuring the jet contribution to species $i$, varies from $\approx 0.6$ for pions to $\approx 9.5$ for Omegas reflecting the mass dependence in Fig.~\ref{tildezparams} (right). The spectra for heavier hadrons are thus dominated by MB jet fragments for larger event \nch\ while still preserving integrated yields that remain close to statistical-model predictions due to conservative transport from soft to hard components as reported in Ref.~\cite{transport}. Also note  that $z_{0i}^* \approx 0.0030$ is required for Cascades spectra from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions (see Fig.~\ref{piddata}) whereas for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions it is 0.0045. The difference is well outside systematic uncertainties. However, the integrated Cascades {\em yields} for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions from Ref.~\cite{alippss} are consistent with the 0.0045 value for \ppb\ collisions. See the \pp\ Cascade yield data points (solid dots) in Fig.~\ref{ratios}.
%
In Eq.~(\ref{z0trend}) hard/soft ratio $x\nu$ varies over interval 0.3 implying that for \ppb\ collisions $z_{0i}(n_s)$ increases by 40\% for Cascades and 60\% for Omegas whereas for \pp\ collisions the increases are 30\% and 60\% respectively. 

\subsection{Omega baryons and jet production} \label{omegajets}

Figure~\ref{omegarats} (left) shows results reported in Ref.~\cite{transport}. Hadron production within jet and nonjet components of the final state is closely correlated so as to preserve the {\em total} hadron number or fraction for each species consistent with statistical-model predictions. The rate of jet production indicated by hard/soft coefficient ratio $\tilde z_i$ for each species (relative to total charge density $\bar \rho_{0}$) is simply proportional to hadron mass {\em irrespective of baryon identity or strangeness}. The curves correspond to ratios $\bar \rho_{si}/\bar \rho_{0i}$ and $\bar \rho_{hi}/\bar \rho_{0i}$ for Omega baryons from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions predicted by Ref.~\cite{transport}. The corresponding parameter values appearing in Tables~\ref{coefparams} and~\ref{coefparams2}  describe \pp\ and \ppb\ Omega spectra within uncertainties.  This plot illustrates how low-\pt\ behavior [$\bar \rho_{si}(n_s) = z_{si}(n_s)\bar \rho_s$] predicts high-\pt\ behavior [$\bar \rho_{hi}(n_s) =z_{hi}(n_s)\bar \rho_h$], for example enabling correction of proton inefficiencies in Refs.~\cite{pidpart1,pppid}.

The hatched bands correspond to values of hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)$ for 13 TeV \pp\ event classes 1  (0.28, high \nch) and 5 (0.052, low \nch) for Omega spectra. For event class 5 more  than two-thirds of Omegas are nonjet (projectile proton fragments) while for event class 1 {\em three quarters of Omegas are jet fragments}, thus representing a dramatic change in hadron production while still maintaining approximately the same Omega fraction $z_{0i}^* \approx 0.00047$.

%Above: the TCM solid curves integrate to 1. The data integrate to z0-variable / z0-fixed neq 1.

Figure~\ref{omegarats} (right) shows Omega spectra (points) for \pp\ event classes 1 and 5 in the form $(1/z_{0i} \bar \rho_0) d^2n_{chi} / dp_t dy_z$ without the usual additional factor $1/p_t$, better indicating what fraction of particles lies within a given \pt\ interval; in this application data spectra are not compared with a Boltzmann distribution on \mt. In that format the TCM spectra each integrate on \pt\ to 1. The error bars are total systematic uncertainties published with the data. The solid curves are TCM spectra corresponding to Fig.~\ref{piddata} (d) rescaled in the same way, but with  {\em fixed values} $z_{0i}^*$. %Because of the evolution of $z_{0i}(n_s)$ for data spectra data points then appear above and below those curves for $n = 1$ and 5 respectively. 
The dashed curves are soft components and the dotted curves are corresponding TCM hard components -- jet fragment distributions. Note the substantial mode shift to higher \yt\ for $n = 5 \rightarrow 1$. As in the left panel the integrated hard component is three times the integrated soft component for event class 1, and the data points lie almost entirely on the hard component. Jets dominate Omegas from \pp\ collisions for event class $n = 1$.

Taken together, Omega data for event class 1 lie systematically above the TCM curve that assumes constant $z_{0i}^*$, and the data for event class 5 lie systematically below that TCM curve. Those trends are consistent with Fig.~\ref{ratios} (right) which also demonstrates that when compared on hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)$ ({\em not} on charge density $\bar \rho_0$) the \pp\ and \ppb\ collision systems are equivalent. The TCM for Omega spectra is based in part on {\em predictions} from Ref.~\cite{transport} wherein it is determined that fractional coefficient $z_{0i}$ controls integrated yields from entire hadron spectra, {\em including jet contributions} up to high \pt, while the TCM accurately describes dramatic changes in differential spectrum shape in terms of two fragmentation processes. A major challenge for advocates of thermal models and canonical suppression (of strangeness) in small collision systems, claiming that for increasing ``centrality'' a volume increases and suppression is relaxed, is how a simple thermal model for Omegas may accommodate a heterogeneous system {\em dominated by jet production}.

\subsection{Canonical suppression and $\bf z_{0i}(n_s)$}

Deviations of parameters $z_{0i}(n_s)$ from fixed values $z_{0i}^*$ are discussed in Refs.~\cite{alippbss,alippss} in connection with canonical suppression of strangeness abundance. 
%A responding argument based on the PID TCM is presented here. 
In reference to claims that suppression or enhancement of specific hadron species with varying \nch\ depends strongly on strangeness content the following observations based on Fig.~\ref{ratiosx} are relevant: For \pp\ collisions {\em all} hadron species (except possibly pions) exhibit substantial reduction below the NSD $\bar \rho_0$ value relative to the reference. The hadrons that elsewhere exhibit {\em significant} variation of $z_{0i}(n_s)$ with \nch\ are pions and protons for \ppb\ collisions and Cascades and Omegas for \ppb\ and \pp\ collisions. 

%What follows is a commentary on canonical suppression relative to a statistical model in the context of the TCM.

Figure~4 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss} shows ratios $\bar \rho_{0i}/\bar \rho_{0j}$ vs $\bar \rho_0$ for $\Xi / \pi$ and $\Omega / \pi$, where the $\bar \rho_{0}$ axis is logarithmic while the ratio ($y$) axis is linear. One could argue that the linear vs log plot format exaggerates $2\sigma$ data variations and emphasizes deviations at low charge densities. Note that if the relation $y = kx$ is plotted as $y$ vs $\ln(x)$ the {\em apparent} local slope is $dy/d\ln x = kx$, not a constant value.  In contrast, Fig.~7 is linear vs linear with reference 1. An observation is made that the ratios increase significantly with charge density: ``The relative increase is more pronounced for [Omegas] than for [Cascades] ... indicating that strangeness content may control the rate of increase with multiplicity.'' What we might expect for intermediate \nch\ values, given Fig.~\ref{ratios} above, is ratio values $z_{0i} / z_{0j} = 0.0045 / 0.8 = 0.0056$ for  $\Xi / \pi$ and $0.00047 / 0.8 \approx  0.0006$ for $\Omega / \pi$. Those ratios correspond to the lines ($z_{0i}^*$ values) in Fig.~\ref{ratios} compared to pion $z_{0i} \approx 0.80$ with negligible variation~\cite{pppid}. Close examination of Fig.~4 in Ref.~\cite{alippbss} suggests that assumed pion $z_{0i}$ is $\approx 0.95$, whereas the value determined in Ref.~\cite{pppid} for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions is 0.80$\pm 0.01$ consistent with a statistical-model prediction~\cite{statmodel}. That result supports inference of $dE/dx$ bias for pions associated with Fig.~\ref{ratiosx} above. It is notable that the \pbpb\ result for Cascades is consistent with the higher-\nch\ result for \ppb\ whereas the \pbpb\ result for Omegas is 50\% higher than for \ppb. That difference is quite relevant to Fig.~5 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss}. 

Figure~13 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} shows $X/K_\text{S}^0$ ratios for Lambdas, Cascades and Omegas from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions in which the ratios increase significantly with increasing charge density $\bar \rho_0$. Again, the horizontal axis is logarithmic while the vertical axis is linear, exaggerating the variation at lower \nch. The data are interpreted as follows: ``In the context of a canonical thermal model..., an increase of the relative strangeness abundance depending on the strange quark content can be interpreted as a consequence of a change in the system volume, called canonical suppression.'' Based on entries in Table~\ref{coefparams2} the expected ratio values are 0.30 for Lambdas, 0.070 for Cascades and 0.0070 for Omegas. The data are consistent  with those values for larger \nch. One should note that the more significant deviations from fixed values are confined to \nch\ values below the NSD charge density 6.5 for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. Association of modest variations with {canonical suppression} of strangeness seems unjustified. Such claims confront a context wherein differential spectrum analysis reveals copious jet production, especially for more-massive hadrons as in Fig.~\ref{omegarats}. Reference~\cite{transport} summarizes extensive TCM analysis of PID spectra from \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions and notes the implication that despite heterogeneous collision systems with jet and nonjet components {\em total} PID yields are consistent with some statistical models. That combination may have major implications for interpretation of \aa\ data.

\section{$\bf \bar p_t$ trends for strange hadrons} \label{mptsec}

This section presents a TCM analysis of PID ensemble-mean \mmpt\ data for strange and multistrange hadrons based on PID spectrum data from Refs.~\cite{aliceppbpid,alippbss,didiersss} for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and from Refs.~\cite{alicepppid,alippss} for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. Physical interpretation of conventional presentations of PID ensemble-mean \mmpt\ data seem ambiguous. In this section \mmpt\ data are explored within a PID TCM context. \mmpt\ trends for \pp\ and \ppb\ collision systems vs hard/soft ratio $x\nu$ correspond closely and relate simply to two basic fragmentation processes. In particular, manifestations of systematic shifts of hard-component (jet fragment) distributions are confirmed and reveal substantial differences between mesons and baryons.

\subsection{PID TCM for ensemble-mean $\bf \bar p_t$}

Given the PID spectrum TCM in Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) the corresponding ensemble-mean {\em total} \pt\ for identified hadrons of species $i$, integrated over some angular acceptance $\Delta \eta$ that includes integrated charge $n_{chi}$, is
\bea \label{ptintid}
\bar P_{ti} 
%&=& \Delta \eta \int_0^\infty dp_t\, p_t^2\, \bar \rho_{0i}(p_t)~=~ \bar P_{tsi} + \bar P_{thi}
%\\ \nonumber
&=&  z_{si}(n_s)  n_{s} \bar p_{tsi} +  z_{hi}(n_s) n_{h} \bar p_{thi}(n_s).
\eea 
%
The TCM for conventional ensemble-mean $\bar p_{ti}$  is then
\bea \label{pampttcmid}
\frac{\bar P_{ti}}{n_{chi}}  &\equiv&    \bar p_{ti}   \approx \frac{\bar p_{tsi} + \tilde z_i(n_s) x(n_s)\nu(n_s) \, \bar p_{thi}(n_s)}{1 +  \tilde z_i(n_s)x(n_s)\nu(n_s)}.
\eea
As an alternative, a \mmpt\ expression based on the TCM  has the particularly simple form
\bea \label{pampttcmpid}
\frac{\bar P_{ti}}{n_{si}} &=& \frac{n_{chi}}{n_{si}}\bar p_{ti} \approx \bar p_{tsi} + \tilde z_i(n_s) x(n_s)\nu(n_s) \, \bar p_{thi}(n_s).~~~
\eea
Factors $\tilde z_i(n_s) x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ have been defined above and soft- and hard-component mean values $\bar p_{tsi}$ and $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ are obtained from TCM models $\hat S_{0i}(y_t)$ and $\hat H_{0i}(y_t,n_s)$, where $\hat H_{0i}(y_t,n_s)$ may be slowly varying with $n_s$~\cite{pidpart2,pppid}.

\subsection{Ensemble-mean $\bf \bar p_t$ for lower-mass hadrons}

Figure~\ref{mpttrends} shows \mmpt\ data (open circles) for 
5 TeV \ppb\ collisions from Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} (a) and for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions from Ref.~\cite{alicepppid} (c) plotted in the format of Fig.~7 of the latter reference. The solid dots are derived from TCM spectrum models (including for {\em corrected} proton spectra). The open triangles in (c) are Lambda data for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions as reported in Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} for comparison. The solid curves are Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmid}) with fixed $\bar p_{tsi}$ and with fixed $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ for event class 4. The pion value $\bar p_{tsi}\approx 0.40$ GeV/c includes a resonance contribution. For \pp\ data in (c) $ x\nu \rightarrow x$ in Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmid}). Published pion \mmpt\ data (lowest open points in (a, c) fall substantially {\em above} the TCM predictions (lowest solid curves), which may relate to  {\em pion-proton misidentification} as discussed in Ref.~\cite{pppid}.

Figure~\ref{mpttrends} (b,d) shows the same data and curves in the format of Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmpid}) with trends vs hard/soft (jet/nonjet) ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ or $x(n_s)$ exhibiting approximately linear dependences. Note that in this format the Lambda data in (b,d) correspond closely to {\em corrected} proton data (solid dots). Also note in (b,d) that baryon (including corrected proton) \mmpt\ increases somewhat faster than the TCM linear reference (solid lines) due to hard-component shifts to higher \yt\ with increasing \nch\ as reported in Refs.~\cite{pidpart2,pppid}. The dash-dotted curve in (d) is  TCM Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmpid}) for protons with $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ derived from {\em variable} $\hat H_{0i}(y_t,n_s)$. The simplicity of this format demonstrates the importance of a TCM reference for precision tests of data trends. 

%However, integral measures such as total $\bar P_{ti}$ and its ratio to $n_{chi}$ or $n_s$ represent {\em reduction} of information compared to intact differential PID spectra and their TCM representations.

\subsection{Ensemble-mean $\bf \bar p_t$ for multistrange hadrons} \label{strangemmpt}

Figure~\ref{mptss} is similar to Fig.~\ref{mpttrends} but includes multistrange hadrons. The results in panels (a) and (b) of Fig.~\ref{mptss} correspond to left and right panels of Fig.~\ref{mpttrends}. Data for $K_\text{S}^0$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions (solid dots in all panels) are as reported in Ref.~\cite{alippss}. 
%
Regarding \mmpt\ data in its Fig.~5 Ref.~\cite{alippss} observes that ``The increase of the $\langle p_T \rangle$ as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity is compatible, within uncertainties, for all particle species.'' 
%
The open circles are $K_\text{S}^0$ and $\Lambda$ data as reported in Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} and $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ data as reported in Ref.~\cite{didiersss} from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions. Solid curves correspond to a \pp\ PID TCM with fixed hard components corresponding to event class 5 (except event class 3 for $\Omega$). Open boxes (connected by dashed curves) are \mmpt\ values derived from corresponding PID TPC spectra (solid curves in Fig.~\ref{piddata}).  

%The dash-dotted curves are corresponding \ppb\ PID TCM results as reported in Ref.~\cite{ppbpid}. 

In Fig.~\ref{mptss} panel (a) presents a conventional \mmpt\ format per Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmid}). Panel (b) presents the same data and curves transformed to the format of Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmpid}) by multiplication with factor $1 + \tilde z_i(n_s) x(n_s) \nu(n_s)$ ($\nu \rightarrow 1$ for \pp\ data). In the format of Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmpid}) \pp\ and \ppb\ data are directly comparable, and the close correspondence between the two systems (note open circles vs solid dots) is evident whereas that is not the case in panel (a).

%why is intercept for Omegas so high? What is uncertainty?

Panel (c) shows a further manipulation via Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmpid}) so that the product $\tilde z_i(n_s) \bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ is isolated given estimates of $\bar p_{tsi}$ from TCM model functions $\hat S_{0i}(y_t)$. 
%In this panel the published data are connected by dashed lines for clarity while TCM open squares lie along solid lines. 
For each hadron species the same transformation is applied to data and curves. The general increases vs $x(n_s) \nu(n_s)$ arise from shifts of baryon (but not meson) hard components to higher \yt\ and {\em mass-dependent} increases of hard/soft ratios $\tilde z_i(n_s)$. The \pp\ $K_\text{S}^0$ data show good agreement with the TCM and {\em seem} to agree with \ppb\ data in that format. However, there appear to be significant deviations from the TCM for \pp\ $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ data. 

Panel (d) isolates $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ via division of panel (c) by $\tilde z_i(n_s)$. For the TCM that is a consistency check. The open squares are derived from TCM spectra (solid curves in Fig.~\ref{piddata}) while the open crosses are derived directly from $\hat H_0(y_t)$ model functions. If TCM analysis were linear and self-consistent the two results should be essentially identical, and they are. The open circles are $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ values inferred by transforming 5 TeV \ppb\ $\bar p_{ti}$ data from panel (a) as described above, with statistical errors only. The solid dots correspond to 13 TeV \pp\ $K_\text{S}^0$ data from Ref.~\cite{alippss}. The dash-dotted line represents TCM results for Lambdas from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions. This is a highly differential  format with precision $\approx 30$ MeV/c or 2\% of $\bar p_{thi}$ averages over event classes.

%They are compared here with inferred TCM $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends (dashed) from Fig.~13 (left) of  Ref.~\cite{pidpart2}.

Much of the information carried by PID \mmpt\ data is represented in panel (c): The combination $\tilde z_i(n_s) \bar p_{thi}(n_s)$, the slope for \mmpt\ trends in panel (b), increases dramatically with hadron mass: $\approx 0.7$ GeV/c for pions vs $\approx 20$ GeV/c for Omegas by the combination of $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ (simply proportional to hadron mass per Fig.~\ref{tildezparams}) and $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ (via spectrum hard components reflecting PID fragmentation functions~\cite{ppbpid}). Variation of $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ shows no sensitivity to baryon identity or strangeness content {\em per se} and, given panel (d), there is no clear systematic trend for $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ other than mesons vs baryons. The direct quantitative connection between \mmpt\ evolution and the high-\pt\ portions of spectra precludes effective description in terms of flows and the blast-wave (BW) model. Simultaneous BW model fits to multiple hadron species typically fall off rapidly with increasing \yt\ relative to spectrum data~\cite{tommodeltests,tombw,pppid}, and thus cannot represent spectrum hard components that dominate \mmpt\ trends especially for more-massive hadrons. In general, \mmpt\ data represent information {\em reduction} relative to differential spectra: spectrum structure can be used to interpret \mmpt\ data, but \mmpt\ data cannot be used to interpret spectrum structure.

\subsection{Direct comparison of hard-component trends} \label{directcomp}

At this point it is of interest to summarize differences among two collision systems and four hadron species. As demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{ratios} (right) hadron species abundances are similar for \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions when compared vs hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$. As demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{shapes} (left) soft components $\hat S_{0i}(y_t)$ vary simply with mass, independent of collision system. Since \mmpt\ soft components $\bar p_{tsi}$ are derived from those model functions the same applies to them. Thus, interesting variations apply only to evolution of jet-related hard components $\hat H_{0i}(y_t,n_s)$. Especially for higher-mass hadrons with limited \pt\ coverage exponent $q$ is not determining. Centroids $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ and Gaussian widths $\sigma_{y_ti}$ are the critical parameters.

Figure~\ref{ybarcomp} presents a comparison between TCM hard-component variable modes $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ (left) and \mmpt\ hard-components $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ (right). The TCM mode shifts are determined by parameters $\bar y_{ti}^*$ and $\delta \bar y_{ti}^*$ in Tables~\ref{pidparamz} for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions (dashed) and \ref{pidparamx} for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions (solid). The 13 TeV \pp\ Lambda centroid trend is indicated by the dash-dotted line to distinguish from the \pp\ Cascade trend (solid).

Figure~\ref{ybarcomp} (right) shows the corresponding $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends derived from published \mmpt\ data (solid dots and open circles for \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions respectively). The data are in this case plotted with {\em statistical} uncertainties only. The open crosses and dashed curves are derived from \ppb\ TCM hard components while the solid curves are derived from \pp\ TCM hard components except the dash-dotted curve for Lambdas. The $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ vs  $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ differences in relative position arise mainly from differences in TCM hard-component widths $\sigma_{y_ti}$ that also affect the resulting $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends. The $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends for  $K_\text{S}^0$ at right are higher relative to other species than the $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ trends on the left because $\sigma_{y_ti}$ for kaons is 0.58 compared to 0.50 for other species (except Cascades as noted below). The \pp\ TCM trend for Cascades $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ on the right (solid) is lower relative to other species compared to its $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ trend at left because {\em for \pp\ spectrum data only} the required Cascade width $\sigma_{y_ti}$ is 0.46 rather than 0.50 (see below).

$\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ values derived from \mmpt\ data generally agree with TCM trends within statistical uncertainties, with the exception of \pp\ Cascades. (Lambda data for \pp\ are not plotted to minimize confusion among different symbols.) \pp\ cascade data in  the right panel lie systematically {\em above} the TCM trend derived from TCM spectra in Fig.~\ref{piddata}. 
%The dash-dotted line corresponds to TCM $\sigma_{y_ti} \rightarrow 0.50$ from the 0.46 required by spectrum data. Those results suggest the width could be even greater. 
As noted in connection with $z_{0i}(n_s)$ trends, \pp\ Cascade spectra are unique in requiring $z_{0i}^* = 0.00030$ rather than 0.00047 and $\sigma_{y_ti}=0.46$ rather than 0.50. Yet {\em integral} measures derived from the same $\Xi$ spectra such as $z_{0i}(n_s)$ values in Fig.~\ref{ratios} (right)  conform to expectations from other species and to the TCM. 

It should be noted that correspondence between the PID TCM and details of PID \mmpt\ data at the percent level, and correspondence between left and right panels above, relies on a TCM based on accurate determination of jet contributions to PID spectra and on accurate determination of \ppb\ centrality and hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$.

\subsection{Direct comparison of multistrange spectra}

The trends in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} suggest making direct comparisons between data and TCM spectra for pairs of event classes from  \pp\ and \ppb\ collision data that should correspond most closely. Rescaled spectra in the form $\bar \rho_{0i} / \bar \rho_s$ are compared. Based on Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) the rescaled spectra should depend only on hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$. For spectrum equivalence quantities $z_{si}(n_s)$, $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ and $\hat H_{0i}(y_t,n_s)$ in Eq.~(\ref{pidspectcm}) should agree between two collision systems. For a given hadron species the first two quantities agree if $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ for the two systems agree. Agreement for $\hat H_{0i}(y_t,n_s)$ is then determined by the $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends or $\bar y_t(n_s)$ trends in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp}. Thus, for each hadron species, event classes for \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions near {\em crossovers} of $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends on  $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ are selected. 

Figure~\ref{comparehc} (a) shows neutral kaon spectrum data and TCM for event class 5 from both \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions corresponding to the crossover of kaon trends for $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ near $x(n_s)\nu(n_s) \approx 0.16$ in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} (right). Data and TCM for \pp\ collisions are solid dots and solid curve wheres for \ppb\ collisions they are open circles and dashed curve. The data and curves are duplicated from Figs.~\ref{ppbpiddata} and \ref{piddata}.

Figure~\ref{comparehc} (b) shows a similar comparison for Lambdas corresponding to the  $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ crossover near $x(n_s)\nu(n_s) \approx 0.08$ in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} (right). Again,  the correspondence is within data uncertainties and confirms agreement of data and TCM trends.

Figure~\ref{comparehc} (c) shows direct comparison for Cascades. In this case issues raised previously are apparent: (a) The \pp\ cascade data spectrum falls below the \ppb\ spectrum by 2/3, corresponding to $z_{0i} = 0.0030$ for \pp\ vs 
0.0045 for \ppb. In addition, the \pp\ Cascade spectrum requires width $\sigma_{y_ti} \approx 0.46$ rather than 0.50 for other hadron species, evident by the disagreement between \ppb\ TCM (dashed) and \pp\ TCM (solid) at higher \yt. The width change has an effect on $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ because $\hat H_{0i}(y_t)$ is asymmetric, having a power-law high-\pt\ tail. The lowered dash-dotted TCM curve corresponds to $z_{0i} = 0.0030$

Figure~\ref{comparehc} (d) shows comparable results for Omegas showing consistency with general trends among hadron species and collision systems. Here event class $n=3$ for \ppb\ collisions (out of seven classes) is compared to event class 1 for \pp\ collisions (out of five classes) as most similar in their jet-related hard-component configuration. 

In panels (c) and (d) the curvature of the TCM trends actually  {\em changes sign} near \yt\ = 2 ($p_t \approx 0.5$ GeV/c). That distinctive variation results from the large hard/soft ratios for the higher-mass hadrons: The hard components, with modes near \yt\ = 3, push well above the soft components creating the minima near \yt\ = 2. See Fig.~10 (right) of Ref.~\cite{ppprd} for anticipation of such structure.

\section{Systematic uncertainties} \label{sys}

This analysis emphasizes detailed comparisons among collision systems and hadron species requiring consistency at the level of data random uncertainties across several studies. \ppb\ geometry determination as reported in Refs.~\cite{tommpt,tomglauber,ppbpid} must be compatible with jet production in \pp\ collisions~\cite{ppprd,alicetomspec,pppid}. The possibility for major systematic error in the \ppb\ geometry determination is demonstrated by the difference between primed and unprimed numbers in Table~\ref{rppbdata}. TCM hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)$ for \pp\ collisions or $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ for \ppb\ collisions is the basic TCM control parameter  that provides a common basis for differential comparison of  several systems and species. Examples include Figs.~\ref{ratios}, \ref{mptss}, \ref{ybarcomp} and \ref{comparehc}.

\subsection{TCM model function consistency}

For heavier hadrons and limited \pt\ acceptances TCM ``tail'' parameters $n$ and $q$ may be neglected. TCM soft component $\hat S_0(m_t)$ includes the collision-energy dependent L\'evy exponent $n$ \cite{alicetomspec} that however does not play a significant role for more-massive hadrons where, per Ref.~\cite{transport}, the spectra are dominated by jet (hard-component) contributions.  Within data \pt\ acceptances for the present study the TCM soft component is indistinguishable from a Boltzmann exponential on \mt. Slope parameter $T \approx 200$ MeV describes data for all hadron species except pions within data uncertainties. TCM hard component $\hat H_0(y_t)$ includes exponent $q$ which however has large uncertainties due to data \pt\ upper limits near 4 GeV/c, the transition point from Gaussian to exponential for $\hat H_0(y_t)$. The TCM for the present study is effectively a three-parameter model: $T_i$, $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ and $\sigma_{y_t i}$.

TCM hard component $\hat H_0(y_t,n_s)$ exhibits significant variation, with hard/soft ratio or soft multiplicity $n_s$, of Gaussian widths $\sigma_{{y_t}i}$ and modes $\bar y_{ti}$ that differs substantially between mesons and baryons~\cite{pidpart2,pppid}. For the present study effective variation with \nch\ is represented by variable modes $\bar y_{ti}(n_s)$ defined by Eq.~(\ref{ytbar}) and by starred parameter values in Tables~\ref{pidparamz} and \ref{pidparamx}. The results differ substantially between \pp\ and \ppb\ data.  

%Significant differences between collision systems might indicate inconsistent analysis methods.

\subsection{Hard-component mode shifts and $\bf \bar p_{thi}(n_s)$}

%$\bf p$-$\bf Pb$ and $\bf p$-$\bf p$

Given published PID \mmpt\ data and Eq.~(\ref{pampttcmpid}) further \mmpt\ analysis relies on $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ that is determined only by hadron mass (see Fig.~\ref{tildezparams}), hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ that was previously determined by nonPID analysis~\cite{tommpt,tomglauber} and $\bar p_{tsi}$ that is determined only by hadron mass via $\hat S_{0i}(m_t)$. There is no adjustment to accommodate specific PID data. Resulting $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends in Figs.~\ref{mptss} (d) and \ref{ybarcomp} (right) can be compared with $\bar y_t(n_s)$ trends in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} (left) as a test of self-consistency of the TCM system.

In Ref.~\cite{pppid} the modes for \ppb\ protons {\em and} Lambdas shift according to $\bar y_t(n_s) \approx 2.86 + 0.40 x\nu$ that is compatible with {\em ad hoc} expression $\bar y_t(n_s) \approx 2.96 - 0.015(n - 4)$ with $n \in [1,7]$ the event class number as reported in Ref.~\cite{ppbpid}. The trend for protons from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions reported in Ref.~\cite{pppid} is $\bar y_t(n_s) \approx 2.81 + 0.40 x\nu$ compared to $2.80 + 0.40 x\nu$ for \ppb\ $\Lambda$ data from Table~\ref{pidparamz} of the present study compared to  $2.80 + 0.70 x\nu$ for \pp\ $\Lambda$ data from Table~\ref{pidparamx}. Significant differences between collision systems might indicate inconsistent analysis methods. However, the comparison in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} between $\bar y_t(n_s)$ trends on the left and $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends on the right (derived from published PID \mmpt\ data) confirms that the $\bar y_t(n_s)$ trends accurately reflect real data spectrum variation. The corresponding TCM and data $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends agree at the few percent level, i.e.\ within data statistical uncertainties, with the exception of \pp\ Cascade data.

In essence, most of the information in PID \mmpt\ data lies in the $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ trends that are predicted accurately by spectrum hard-component evolution with \nch. PID hard components are in turn consistent with (mass-dependent) PID fragmentation functions convoluted with a common underlying scattered-parton (gluon) energy spectrum~\cite{fragevo,jetspec2,ppbpid}. Some quantitative differences between mesons and baryons and between \ppb\ and \pp\ data may depend in part on event selection bias, e.g.\  via V0M yields.

\subsection{PID TCM hadron species fraction accuracy}

Accuracy of hadron species fractions $z_{si}(n_s)$ and $z_{hi}(n_s)$ determined by parameters $z_{0i}(n_s)$ and $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ via Eqs.~(\ref{zsix}) is a central issue for PID spectrum studies. That is an especially critical issue for (multi)strange hadron abundances -- their variation with charge multiplicity \nch\ in relation to claims of canonical suppression and thermalization in small collision systems. For lower-mass hadrons the $z_{0i}(n_s)$ were assumed fixed and the $\tilde z_i(n_s)$ were determined via low-\pt\ spectrum trends~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pppid}. $dE/dx$ biases for protons and pions were estimated and, in the case of protons, the spectra were corrected~\cite{pidpart1}. The combined results led to discovery of soft $\rightarrow$ hard hadron transport conserving total species abundances~\cite{transport}. For higher-mass (multistrange) hadrons substantial variation of $z_{0i}(n_s)$ is reported. One may question whether the variation is dominated by systematic error or not and, if correct, are reported variations consistent between \pp\ and \ppb\ collision systems?

Tables~\ref{coefparams} and \ref{coefparams2} provide final comparison between collision systems. The $\tilde z_i^*$ and $\delta \tilde z_i^*$ values are simply proportional to hadron mass as in Fig.~\ref{tildezparams} (right) the same for both systems. The yields (measured by $z_{0i}(n_s)$) for protons and pions from \ppb\ collisions exhibit a substantial {\em decrease} with increasing \nch\ as represented by negative values for $\delta z_{0i}^*$ in Table~\ref{coefparams}. No such values appear in Table~\ref{coefparams2} because only $X/\pi$ {\em ratios} are reported in Ref.~\cite{alicepppid} for \pp\ collisions, not total yields as in Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} for \ppb\ collisions. The \pp\ charged-kaon yield data (solid dots) in Fig.~\ref{ratiosx} (obtained from $K^\pm/\pi$ {\em ratios} assuming {\em constant} $z_{0i} = 0.80$ for pions) increase significantly with \nch\ whereas the neutral-kaon data (open circles) corresponding to integrated yields~\cite{alippss} remain constant within uncertainties. However, the spectrum data for the two kaon species are statistically equivalent. Apparent increase for charged kaons may arise from a pion {\em decrease} in the ratio denominator. Different Lambda $z_{0i}^*$ values 0.036 and 0.038 are required by yield data in Fig.~\ref{ratiosx}. Within data uncertainties kaons and Lambdas as strange hadrons show {\em no  significant increase} with \nch. Cascade and Omega variation is then open to question.

The Cascade and Omega yields require substantial spectrum extrapolation from rather high \pt\ data lower bounds down to zero. For 13 TeV \pp\ collisions ``In order to compute $\langle p_T \rangle$ and the $p_T$-integrated production yields, the spectra are fitted with a Tsallis-L\'evy distribution to extrapolate in the unmeasured $p_T$ region. The systematic uncertainties on this extrapolation procedure are evaluated using other fit functions, as discussed in Sec.~4''~\cite{alippss}. The estimated extrapolation uncertainties for Omegas (for example) are 4\% for central and 12\% for peripheral event classes. For 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions ``The calculation of $p_T$-integrated yields can be performed by using data in the measured region and a parametrization-based extrapolation elsewhere. The Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast-Wave...model gives a good description of each $p_T$ spectrum and has been used as a tool for this extrapolation''~\cite{alippbss}. Estimated uncertainties for Omega yields are 8\% for central and 15\% for peripheral event classes.

Extrapolation of high-mass hadron spectra with a monolithic spectrum model may be strongly questioned. As pointed out in Fig.~\ref{comparehc} (d) for example the Omega {\em data} spectra for higher \nch\ are dominated by the jet contribution which requires its own unique model function $\hat H_0(y_t)$. Also see Fig.~\ref{omegarats} (right). Attempting to extrapolate data spectra with a {\em monolithic} model function (more appropriate for the data spectrum soft component alone) may then lead inevitably to substantial overestimation of the soft-component contribution for higher \nch.  Estimating extrapolation uncertainties by comparison with other monolithic model functions {\em having the same basic limitation} may greatly underestimate the true uncertainty.

Figure~\ref{axbad} illustrates extrapolation issues. Left and right panels are Fig.~\ref{piddata} Cascades (c) and Omegas (d) repeated but with $z_{0i}(n_s)$ values derived from published total yields as shown in Fig.~\ref{ratiosx} (left) open circles (Cascades) and open boxes (Omegas). The published values replace the TCM values obtained from Eq.~(\ref{z0trend}) and parameters from Table~\ref{coefparams2}. The greatest changes are for the most-peripheral event classes. For Cascades in the left panel the comparison is not definitive given the data, suggesting that estimated uncertainties are appropriate. However,  for Omegas at right the published yield for the lowest event class is definitely excluded by  spectrum data. Systematic yield underestimation for more-massive hadrons resulting from extrapolation via a monolithic model function may be related to the spectrum curvature changes noted in Fig.~\ref{comparehc} (c,d) arising from jet production.

%Note that the Omega uncertainty for \ppb\ data at 40\% is much higher than the estimate for \pp\ data at 12\% although the \ppb\ spectra extend down to \yt\ = 2.65 ($p_t \approx 0.99$ GeV/c) for \ppb\ vs  \yt\ = 2.90 ($p_t \approx 1.27$ GeV/c) for \pp\ data.

To summarize, with the exception of suppression of all hadrons (except pions) below NSD \nch\ the lack of significant variation above that point for singly-strange hadrons (mesons or baryons) coupled with substantial uncertainty in the method of integrating total yields by extrapolation for Cascades and Omegas with their limited \pt\ acceptances calls into question support for claims of canonical suppression of strangeness based on total yield variation. Invoking ratios to pions (with the pion nontrivial variation), including yield suppression below NSD \nch\ and using a linear $y$ vs logarithmic $x$ plot format tends to exaggerate increases to favor a specific hypothesis.

\section{Discussion} \label{disc}

This section considers (a) the quality of the TCM description of data and particularly evolution of PID spectrum shapes and their intrepretation in terms of radial flow as opposed to minimum-bias jet production, (b) variation of integrated PID hadron yields in the context of strangeness enhancement claims, (c) trends for PID high-\pt\ yields in relation to jet-related spectrum hard components and (d) to what extent evolution of PID spectra for (multi)strange hadrons may be interpreted to indicate formation of a thermalized QGP in small systems.

\subsection{PID spectrum shape evolution}

The TCM describes PID \pt\ spectrum data across multiple collision systems and collision energies within their statistical uncertainties~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2,pppid}. The basic model has been applied more generally to nonPID spectrum data from various A-B systems since first introduced to describe spectra from 200 GeV \pp\ collisions~\cite{ppbpid}. The TCM has been related to fundamental QCD processes: jet production and fragment distributions (TCM hard components)~\cite{eeprd,fragevo,jetspec2}. It is of interest to examine interpretations of spectrum evolution as reported in Refs.~\cite{alippss,alippbss}.

Reference~\cite{alippss}, referring to its Figs.~2-4, addresses systematic variation of spectrum {\em ratios} (lower panels in those plots): In the results section ``The $p_T$ spectra become harder as the multiplicity increases, as also shown in Fig. 5, which shows [ensemble-mean \mmpt] as a function of the mid-rapidity charged particle multiplicity.'' And in the summary ``Hardening of the $p_T$ spectra with the increase of the multiplicity is observed, as already reported for pp...and p-Pb collisions...at lower energies.'' Reference~\cite{alippbss} observes that ``The spectra exhibit a progressive flattening with increasing multiplicity, which is qualitatively reminiscent of what is observed in Pb-Pb....'' In its conclusions it asserts that ``The multi-strange baryon spectra exhibit a progressive flattening with increasing multiplicity suggesting the presence of radial flow.''

Such qualitative references to ``hardening'' or ``flattening'' with increasing charge density $\bar \rho_0$ discard almost all of  the information content of PID spectra. The phrase ``...reminiscent of what is observed in Pb-Pb'' is an example of argument from analogy: Since we ``know'' that hydrodynamic flow occurs in more-central A-A collisions, and hydrodynamic flow causes ``hardening'' of \pt\ spectra, hardening of \pt\ spectra in small collision systems must then indicate flow. What is missing from such argument is the reality of jet production as a {\em fundamental manifestation of QCD in high-energy nuclear collisions}. Jet fragment contributions to \pt\ spectra, predicted {\em quantitatively} by measured jet properties (jet energy spectra and fragmentation functions), peak near 1 GeV/c and dominate the evolution of hadron spectra with $\bar \rho_0$ as demonstrated for instance in Refs.~\cite{ppprd,hardspec,fragevo,alicetomspec,ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2,pppid}. 
%
Spectrum ``hardening'' is a manifestation of the quadratic relationship, first observed (2006) in 200 GeV \pp\ collisions~\cite{ppprd}, between jet production and the nonjet soft component in \nn\ collisions. One may also consider the detailed quantitative relation between features of PID \mmpt\ evolution with event class (multiplicity for \pp\ or centrality for \ppb) and the details of PID spectrum evolution within a TCM context that are {\em dominated by jet contributions} as demonstrated in Sec.~\ref{mptsec}. Almost all jet fragments appear at low \pt. Collision models that do not account {\em quantitatively} for jet fragments, especially those near 1 GeV/c, cannot properly describe high-energy nuclear collisions.

\subsection{PID integrated-yield $\bf \bar \rho_{0i}$ trends relative to $\bf \bar \rho_0$}

A major issue for Refs.~\cite{alippss,alippbss} is variation of strange-hadron integrated yields $\bar \rho_{0i}$ (for hadron species $i$) vs total charge density $\bar \rho_0$. Several strategies are utilized to seek insight for interpretation of such trends. Some common interpretations are considered here, accompanied by responses expressed in the context of the PID TCM. 

``When comparing to lower energy results, the yields of strange hadrons are found to depend only on [at least are correlated with] the mid-rapidity charged particle multiplicity [$\bar \rho_0$]''~\cite{alippss}. It cannot be otherwise since event classes are in effect defined based on $\bar \rho_0$. That such an inevitable correlation might exist does not exclude dependence on other factors also varying with event class.

``The production rates [yields] of [four hadron species] increase with the multiplicity faster than what is reported for inclusive charged particles [$\bar \rho_0$].%
\footnote{That is a peculiar observation: ``multiplicity'' is presumably at least linearly proportional to ``inclusive charged particles.'' The statement translates to A increases faster with X than with X.} %
The increase is found to be more pronounced for hadrons with a larger strangeness content''~\cite{alippss}. The expression ``faster than'' is ambiguous, likely referring to deviation from {\em linear} proportionality $\bar \rho_{0i} \propto \bar \rho_0$. As addressed in the present study there are two manifestations of nonlinearity: (a) modest variation of fractional coefficient $z_{0i}(n_s)$ from a fixed value and (b)  more rapid increase of integrated {\em high}-\pt\ yields due to jet production. That such trends are related to strangeness {\em per se}, not hadron mass, is not established.

``As can be seen in Fig.\ 11, the yields of strange hadrons increase with the charged particle multiplicity following a power law behaviour, and the trend is the same at...7 and 13 TeV. ... This result indicates that the abundance of strange hadrons depends on the local charged particle density and turns out to be invariant with the collision energy.... It should also be noted that the yields of particles with larger strange quark content increase faster as a function of multiplicity....'' As noted, the power in ``power law'' is in this case simply 1. Deviations from linear proportionality (varying $z_{0i}$ in $\bar \rho_{0i} \approx z_{0i} \bar \rho_0$) are subtle as indicated by Fig.~\ref{ratios} above. Again, ``increase faster'' presumably refers to small deviations of $z_{0i}$ from a constant value in that figure. Whether such effects relate to strangeness or to hadron mass remains to be established.

Referring to Fig.~13 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} is ``This behaviour [effectively, variation of $z_{0i}(n_s)$ with $\bar \rho_0$] is even more pronounced for particles with higher strangeness content.\ This leads to a multiplicity-dependent increase of [$\Xi / K_\text{S}^0$ and $\Omega / K_\text{S}^0$] while [$\Lambda / K_\text{S}^0$] turns out to be constant within uncertainties.'' But given the plotted systematic uncertainties in that figure the Lambda trend shows relatively similar decreases for {\em lower} \nch\ to those for Cascades.

Reference~\cite{alippbss} reports that ``Both the [$\Xi/\pi$ and $\Omega/\pi$] ratios are observed to increase as a function of multiplicity, as seen in [its] Fig. 4. The relative increase is more pronounced for the [$\Omega$] than for [$\Xi$], being approximately 100\% for the former and 60\% for the latter. These relative increases are larger than the 30\% increase observed for the [$\Lambda/\pi$] ratio, indicating that strangeness content may control the rate of increase with multiplicity.'' The statement about $\Lambda/\pi$ (``the 30\% increase'') contradicts a conclusion of Ref.~\cite{alippss} noted above. Also, {\em linear increase} of $z_{0i}(n_s)$ with hard/soft ratio $x\nu$ corresponds to 30\% for Cascades and 60\% for Omegas. Those estimates are derived from variation of $x\nu$ by 0.3 in Fig.~\ref{ratiosx} and $\delta z_{0i}^* \approx 1$ for Cascades and 2 for Omegas from Tables~\ref{coefparams} and \ref{coefparams2}. Any Lambda variation is within data uncertainties. Hadron mass is not excluded as a control parameter.

%Figure~4 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss} is  linear vs log, which tends to exaggerate variations at smaller $\bar \rho_0$ common to several species. Plotting PID ratios vs $\bar \rho_0$ misses an essential aspect of PID trends: As demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{ratios} (right) \pp\ and \ppb\ $z_{0i}(n_s)$ trends {\em are equivalent} within data uncertainties vs hard/soft (jet/nonjet) ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$ and {\em vary linearly} with $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$, suggesting that jet production is an {\em essential element} of  $z_{0i}(n_s)$ variation.

\subsection{Integrated high-$\bf p_t$ yields $\bf \bar \rho_{0i}(p_t)$ relative to $\bf \bar \rho_0$}

In reference to high-\pt\ yields Ref.~\cite{alippss} asserts that ``The trend at high-$p_T$ is highlighted in Fig.~6, which shows the integrated yields for $p_T >$ 4 GeV/c as a function of the mid-rapidity multiplicity. ... The high-$p_T$ yields of strange hadrons increase faster than the charged particle multiplicity.%
\footnote{Again, ``increase faster'' is not well defined. Is the coefficient $k$ of $y=kx$ larger or is the exponent $n$ of $y \propto x^n$ greater than 1?} %
Despite the large uncertainties, the data also hint at the increase being non-linear.''%
\footnote{This would seem to imply that the previous observation does not refer to nonlinearity $y \propto x^n$ with $n \neq 1$.} %
It is not clear how ``large uncertainties'' play a role. Figure~\ref{highptx} (left) above shows the same data with their published uncertainties. When transformed to the right panel it is evident that the uncertainties are small compared to relevant and informative data trends.
Again, the phrase ``increase faster than the charged particle multiplicity'' is ambiguous. As demonstrated in Sec.~\ref{highpt} the dominant trend at high \pt\ is {\em quadratic} increase of high-\pt\ $\bar \rho_{0i}$ vs $\bar \rho_0$ reflecting {\em jet production}. Relative to that trend are variations due to hard-component mode $\bar y_t$ shifting on \yt\ as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{highptx} (right) (high-\pt\ yields) and Fig.~\ref{mptss} (c) (\mmpt\ hard components). Those {\em jet-related} effects have little or nothing to do with integrated {\em total} yields~\cite{transport}. There is no significant strangeness dependence apparent in the figure, whereas mesons {\em are} distinct from baryons.

The results and interpretations reported in Refs.~\cite{alippss,alippbss} concerning variation of PID integrated yields with event class present a confusing picture. The phrases ``depend on,'' ``depend only on,'' ``increase with'' and ``increase faster than'' are not well defined. What one should want to know is the {\em specific} algebraic relation between variable $x$ and variable $y$, but that information is not forthcoming. Contrast the various and confusing plots of the same basic quantities in Ref.~\cite{alippss} with Fig.~\ref{ratios} of the present study that efficiently summarizes all structure in PID integrated {\em total} yields in a format (right panel) that demonstrates near {\em equivalence} of \pp\ and \ppb\ collision systems in that context. Whether those trends have anything to do with strangeness {\em per se} is not demonstrated.

\subsection{Thermalization and canonical suppression}

As noted in the introduction, strangeness enhancement in more-central \aa\ collisions compared to reference \pp\ collisions has been assumed as one indication of QGP formation in large collision systems: a thermalized medium of deconfined quarks and gluons. Thermalization is associated with hadron species abundances distributed according to a statistical model assuming a grand canonical ensemble. ``Canonical suppression'' of strangeness in smaller systems was expressed in terms of collision volumes: ``The suppression of the relative abundance of strange hadrons with respect to lighter flavours was suggested to be...a consequence of the finite volume, which makes the application of a grand-canonical ensemble not valid in hadron-hadron and hadron-nucleus interactions (canonical suppression)''~\cite{alippss}. That narrative however has been challenged by observation of (multi)strange hadron abundances in \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions, albeit with greater particle multiplicities than minimum bias, comparable to those in more-central \aa\ collisions. 

Also as noted in the introduction Ref.~\cite{alippss} cautions that ``...strangeness enhancement is no longer considered an unambiguous signature for deconfinement [i.e.\ QGP],'' and notes that ``These are surprising observations, because thermal strangeness production was considered to be a defining feature of heavy ion collisions....''
%
Reference~\cite{alippss} concludes that ``In the context of a canonical thermal model, an increase of the relative strangeness abundance depending on the strange quark content can be understood as a consequence of an increase in the system volume leading to a progressive removal of canonical suppression.'' Strangeness abundances vs system size, as measured by charge density or A-B centrality, vs thermal or statistical models would then be the objects of study.

In the language of their proponents such arguments assume that almost all hadrons emitted in \aa\ collisions emerge from a large-volume ``fireball'' in thermal equilibrium. Strangeness abundances in that case should be consistent with a grand-canonical ensemble (GCE). Relative to those abundances strangeness abundances from small collision systems should then be reduced via canonical suppression. Increase of strangeness abundances from low-\nch\ \pp\ through increasing \nch\ for \pp\ and \ppb\ to central \pbpb\ must be due to increasing fireball volumes and restoration of GCE conditions. It is then inferred that strangeness production in \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions is different {\em only in degree} (emitter volume) from that in \aa\ collisions arising from QGP formation.

There are several problems with such scenarios: 

(a) Jet production in high-\nch\ \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions dominates hadron production, as illustrated in Secs.~\ref{omegajets} and \ref{strangemmpt} above. PID spectrum and \mmpt\ systematics are dramatically inconsistent with a thermalized emitting system resulting from partonic or hadronic {\em rescattering} (see Ref.~\cite{stock}). In high-\nch\ 13 TeV \pp\ collisions for instance 3/4 of Omegas are associated with jet production, with a unique \pt\ distribution characteristic of jet fragments (see Sec.~\ref{omegajets}). Copious production of strange and multistrange baryons is expected from gluons: ``We found that predominantly the gluon component in the QGP produces strange quark pairs rapidly...''~\cite{kochqgp}. But large-angle scattered gluons near midrapidity may, by the same argument, be copious sources of strange-quark pairs emerging then as elements of (multi)strange jet fragments. Such a result can be seen for example in Sec.~\ref{omegajets}.

(b) Arguments related to canonical suppression based on varying emitter or fireball volume are problematic. Reference~\cite{cleymanssuppress} states that ``This strongly supports that the yields are directly proportional to the volume of the fireball....'' The assertion is based on fits of a resonance gas model to strangeness abundances (from \pp, \ppb\ and \pbpb\ collisions) with the fireball volume as a fit parameter. But measured \pp\ charge multiplicities typically vary by at least a factor ten, and jet production (with most-probable fragment momentum 1 GeV/c) as a consequence increases 50-100 fold~\cite{ppprd,tomnewppspec,pppid}. Which component then corresponds to a varying fireball volume?

Figure~\ref{ratios} (right) demonstrates that variation of strangeness fractional abundances $z_{0i}(n_s)$ for 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and  13 TeV \pp\ collisions are {\em nearly equivalent} when compared on the basis of {\em jet-related} hard/soft ratio $x(n_s)\nu(n_s)$. Yet in ``central'' \ppb\ collisions the particle source consists of more than four nucleon participants and three binary collisions (see Table~\ref{rppbdata}) while in \pp\ collisions there are by definition two and one respectively. Volume-based arguments also conflict with observation of \ppb\ collisions as {\em linear superpositions} of individual \pn\ collisions~\cite{pidpart1} and the principle of {\em exclusivity}, that each \pn\ collision proceeds independently~\cite{tomexclude}.

(c) It is concluded that certain data features are ``...compatible with thermal equilibrium,'' but correspondence of some data with statistical-model predictions does not demonstrate thermalization by multiple scattering. An interesting alternative approach to \ee\ collision data based on a statistical model is reported in Ref.~\cite{statmodel}. The analysis assumes that ``each jet [of an \ee\ hadronic final state] represents an independent phase in complete thermodynamic equilibrium....'' That assumption is taken to imply that ``one can describe a jet as an object defined by thermodynamic and mechanical quantities such as temperature, volume....'' The basis for analysis is ``...the canonical partition functions of systems with internal symmetries.'' The study concludes that ``...this model [thermal equilibrium] is able to fit impressively well the average multiplicities of light hadrons....''

It can be argued that ``an independent phase in complete thermodynamic equilibrium'' is not demonstrated by model agreement with hadron species abundances. In discussing the statistical properties of hadrons emerging from ``freezeout'' of A-A collisions at the SPS, Ref.~\cite{stock} warns that ``...this apparent `thermal' equilibrium is a result of the decay process, the nature of which lies well beyond the statistical model which `merely' captures the apparent statistical order, prevailing right after decay. ... The observed equilibrium is, thus, {\em not achieved by inelastic transmutation of the various hadronic species densities, in final hadron gas rescattering cascades}, i.e.\ not by hadron rescattering approaching a dynamical equilibrium [emphasis added].'' One may argue by analogy that the emerging hadrons within a jet do not rescatter so as to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium during hadronization. It is the hadronization process itself, as a {\em quantum transition following a least-action principle}, that leads to approximate agreement with the description of Ref.~\cite{statmodel}. While a system in thermodynamic equilibrium may produce certain data features, observation of such features in data does not demonstrate thermodynamic equilibrium.

\section{Summary}\label{summ}

This article reports analysis of identified-hadron (PID) \pt\ spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions based on a two-component (soft+hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions. A major motivation is claims in recent years that certain data features associated with particle spectra from small collision systems are similar to features in more-central \aa\ collisions that are conventionally interpreted to demonstrate formation of a thermally equilibrated quark-gluon plasma or QGP. Relevant data features include: 
(a) so-called ``hardening'' or ``flattening'' of PID \pt\ spectra increasing with charged-particle multiplicity \nch\ and with hadron mass commonly interpreted to indicate radial flow, 
(b) ensemble-mean \mmpt\ increasing with \nch, more so for higher mass and more strangeness, also commonly associated with radial flow and
(c) variation of total hadron species yields {\em in ratio to} charge density $\bar \rho_0$ for strange and multistrange hadrons apparently increasing with $\bar \rho_0$ and with strangeness toward values observed in central \aa\ collisions. Such trends are interpreted to indicate strangeness enhancement and formation of a thermalized QGP. 

The present study is based on previous TCM analysis of PID spectra for lower-mass hadrons from the same \ppb\ and \pp\ collision systems wherein spectrum data were described within their statistical uncertainties. 
Major new insights included (a) discovery of a simple mass dependence of individual hadron species fractions of total charge densities that permit predictions for multistrange hadrons, (b) discovery of transport from soft to hard components via jet production that conserves total species yields consistent with a statistical model, (c) systematic evolution of jet-related hard-component shapes varying linearly with hard/soft or jet/nonjet ratios, (d) detailed explanation of PID spectrum {\em ratio} variation with charge density $\bar \rho_0$ in terms of spectrum hard components shifting on transverse rapidity \yt\ differently for mesons vs baryons, and (e) detailed explanation of PID ensemble-mean \mmpt\ trends again in terms of jet production.

Given those developments a TCM for multistrange hadron spectra has been quantitatively predicted and the predictions confirmed in the present study via PID spectrum data for Cascades and Omegas. The \pt\ intervals covered by available multistrange data are dominated by jet contributions. Measured trends for hadron yields integrated above 4 GeV/c are quantitatively explained by systematic shifts on \yt\ of jet-related spectrum hard components, differently for mesons vs baryons but with no clear relation to strangeness. Variation of hadron  yields with charge density $\bar \rho_0$ are substantial for all species (except pions) {\em below} the non-single-diffractive value. However, variation above that point is significant only for Cascades and Omegas and only at the two-sigma level.

Hard components of PID ensemble-mean \mmpt\ extracted via the TCM  are observed  to vary linearly vs hard/soft (jet/nonjet) ratio. Variations for the different species are quantitatively related to measured shifts on \yt\ of spectrum hard-component peak modes. Given those systematics, pairs of spectra from \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions are compared for those event classes where hard-component mode positions and/or \mmpt\ hard components coincide. Spectrum pairs for each species coincide within data uncertainties except for Cascades where the \pp\ spectra appear to be systematically biased by factor 2/3 compared to published Cascade yields for 13 TeV \pp\ collisions.

In summary, PID spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions are accurately and completely described by a simple few-parameter TCM based on two related fragmentation processes that provide the {\em default} QCD description of high-energy nuclear collisions. Resulting TCM parametrizations do not depend on fits to individual spectra and arguably represent all significant information carried by particle spectrum data.
%
Some conventional interpretations of spectrum features appear to arise from a strong assumption that {\em any} deviation of particle spectra from a Boltzmann exponential must arise from collective motion of the particle source, hence reference to spectrum ``hardening'' or ``flattening'' as evidence for flow. That basic assumption is consistent with the Bevalac discovery of collectivity (flows) in A-B collisions, and data from more-central A-A collisions seem compatible with that scenario. However, at RHIC and LHC energies jet production dominates spectrum evolution and is {\em quantitatively predictable}. The present study provides simple and detailed explanations for data features in terms of minimum-bias jet production. While there is some evidence for significant dependence on strangeness it remains at the two-sigma level and is therefore not compelling. The \pp\ and \ppb\ small collision systems remain reliable references that can be simply understood within a QCD context. That reference system then forms a counter to novel phenomena in more-central \aa\ collisions that may lead to improved understanding of QCD.

PYTHIA is dead because to deal with \mmpt\ trend it uses CR -- but that is major change in fragment distribution that does not appear in spectrum data. Changes in $\bar p_{thi}$ are on the few-percent level compared to large ensemble-average changes arising from increased jet production.

Fig.~7 of 2003.02 demonstrates that to fix PYTHIA requires an increase in pthi of factor 5 or more, not a few tens of percent as in Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} here.

``...none of the tested models can reproduce the data from a quantitative point of view....''

No Monte Carlos reproduce data quantitatively, as opposed to the TCM

Reference~\cite{cleymanssuppress} makes the following observation: ``The strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity \pp\ collisions observed by the ALICE collaboration and the relation of those data to [larger collision systems] cannot be explained quantitatively by general purpose QCD Monte Carlo models.'' In this subsection application of several Monte Carlo models to PID spectrum and \mmpt\ data from 5 TeV \ppb\ collisions and 13 TeV \pp\ collisions is examined based on material from four LHC studies by the \mbox{ALICE} collaboration. It is important to note that for MC-data comparisons {\em dis}agreement with data, i.e.\ {\em falsification}, is the important issue. Observations of ``qualitative agreement'' for example are not scientifically meaningful.

\subsubsection{Lighter hadrons from \ppb\ collisions} 

Figure~7 of Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid} shows PID spectra from nominally 5-10\% central \ppb\ collisions. According to Table~\ref{rppbdata} above the correct \ppb\ centrality interval for those data is approximately 20-30\% based on analyses in Refs.~\cite{tommpt,tomglauber}. Given the major disagreement it is not clear how a Monte Carlo model can be implemented for comparison to data.

The DPMJET MC disagrees dramatically with spectrum data over the entire \pt\ acceptance. It relies on the dual-parton model (DPM) for soft particle production and includes a pQCD treatment of jet production CITE. Neither component seems to correspond to data. Reference~\cite{aliceppbpid} admits failure of the MC: DPMJET ``...cannot reproduce the $p_T$ distribution and the $\langle p_T \rangle$ of charged particles.'' The model is falsified.

The blast-wave (BW) model applied over quite limited \pt\ intervals in Fig.~7 of Ref.~\cite{aliceppbpid}, as for pions, charged kaons and protons, is not effectively tested. However, for neutral kaons and Lambdas with data extending out to 8 GeV/c the BW model falls dramatically below spectrum data. Reference~\cite{tombw} examines the relevance of the BW model to 5 TeV \ppb\ spectra and rejects it.

The effectiveness of the Krakow hydrodynamics-based MC is not evident from Fig.~7, especially since is seems not to be applied to neutral kaons and Lambdas in that figure. The EPOS MC, combining pQCD elements, flux tubes and ``collective expansion,'' seems competitive out to high \pt\ but one may question how many parameters are fitted in what way to which spectra. It should be noted that data-model comparisons based on spectrum ratios tend to be deceptive. The proper statistical test is via differential (e.g.\ on \pt) Z-scores that compare data-model {\em differences} to statistical uncertainties~\cite{pidpart2,pppid}.

\subsubsection{Lighter hadrons from \pp\ collisions} 

Figure~2 of Ref.~\cite{alicepppid} shows integrated-yield ratios $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ within three \pt\ intervals in what is a complicated but important comparison. The ratio data are analyzed in detail in Sec.~VII B of Ref.~\cite{pppid}, particularly Fig.~20 (b-d). The $p/\pi$ ratios for two higher \pt\ intervals are strongly suppressed (by factor 0.35) by apparent misidentification of some fraction of protons as pions~\cite{pidpart1,pppid}. The $K/\pi$ ratio is suppressed by factor 0.6 due to the resulting pion excess. There is no significant suppression for data below 0.5 GeV/c. Outstanding MC issues are as follows:

For $p/\pi$ in the lowest \pt\ interval the data are unbiased and only HERWIG provides an acceptable approximation. Other MCs are 30-40\% high. In the intermediate \pt\ interval $K/\pi$ is suppressed by factor 0.6 but all MCs are substantially lower, whereas for $p/\pi$ suppressed by factor 0.35 all MCs agree with the data. In the highest \pt\ interval $K/\pi$ is again suppressed by factor 0.6 and the MCs are 30\% lower, while for $p/\pi$ suppressed by factor 0.35 the MCs are substantially above the data. The decreasing and increasing trends for $p/\pi$ data in the first two \pt\ intervals are significant and relate to shifts of kaon and proton hard-component modes $\bar y_t(n_s)$ relative to pion modes as discussed in Sec.~\ref{directcomp} above.

Figure~5 of Ref.~\cite{alicepppid} shows fully-integrated yield ratios $K^\pm/\pi$ and $p/\pi$. The expected (approximately constant) values based on $z_{0i}^*$ values  consistent with statistical-model predictions~\cite{statmodel} are 2 $\times$ 0.064 / 0.80 = 0.16 from Table~\ref{coefparamsx} for $K/\pi$ and 0.070 / 0.80 = 0.088 from Table~\ref{otherparamsy} for $p/\pi$. The data for both ratios are suppressed below those expectations but, for full \pt\ integrals, not as much as for the two higher-\pt\ intervals in Fig.~2 of  Ref.~\cite{alicepppid}. The MCs are close to published ratio data for $K/\pi$ but substantially below the expectation whereas, except for HERWIG, they fall substantially above the data for $p/\pi$ but still significantly below the expectation. The large upward excursion for PYTHIA + color ropes is notable.

Figure~7 of Ref.~\cite{alicepppid} shows ensemble \mmpt\ trends vs charge density $\bar \rho_0$ for three charged-hadron species. HERWIG agrees closely with data except for low \nch\ where it drops well below the expected $y$-axis intercepts at $\bar p_{tsi}$ = 0.60 and 0.73 GeV/c for kaons and protons respectively as in Table~\ref{otherparamsx}. PYTHIA without color reconnection (CR) or other manipulation of Lund strings (e.g.\ color ropes) increases only very slowly with \nch\ due to suppressed jet production, contradicting the observed {\em quadratic} relation between hard and soft components for \nn\ collisions~\cite{ppprd,alicetomspec,jetspec2}. PYTHIA with CR or color ropes still falls well below the data for kaons and protons. The PID \mmpt\ data thus falsify the PYTHIA MC in any variation.

\subsubsection{Heavier hadrons from \ppb\ collisions} 

Figure~4 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss} shows $\Xi/\pi$ and $\Omega/\pi$ ratios vs charge density  $\bar \rho_0$ from \pp, \ppb\ and \pbpb\ collisions compared to chemical equilibrium predictions. The expected values based on $z_{0i}^*$ values for \ppb\ collisions from Table~\ref{coefparams} are 0.0045 / 0.80 = 0.0056 and 0.00047 / 0.80 = 0.00059. In either case those values are consistent with the middle event class for either 5 TeV \ppb\ or 13 TeV \pp\ collisions per Fig.~\ref{ratios}. The data appearing in Fig.~4 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss} suggest that $z_{0i}^*$ assumed for pions is 0.90 rather than 0.80 leading to values 0.0050 and 0.00052 for the two ratios. The thermal-model predictions for $\Xi/\pi$ are consistent with 0.0050, but the predictions for $\Omega/\pi$ are 50\% higher than 0.0052, just below \pbpb\ results that are {\em exceptionally high} compared to the smaller systems. That inconsistency is also apparent in Fig.~5 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss} wherein ratio values $z_{0i}^*$ are rescaled by limiting values for large \nch\ (i.e., central \pbpb), leading to displacement of rescaled $\Omega/\pi$ values well below $\Lambda / \pi$ and $\Xi/\pi$ trends.

\subsubsection{Heavier hadrons from \pp\ collisions} 

Figure~12 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} shows PID \mmpt\ trends for four hadron species from 13 TeV \pp\ collisions compared to several MC predictions. As noted above, $y$-axis intercepts $\bar p_{tsi}$ in Table~\ref{mptparamsx} (first column) are well-defined by TCM soft components $\hat S_{0i}(m_t)$ and depend only on hadron mass. Those \pp\ \mmpt\ data are processed in Fig.~\ref{mptss} above. The DIPSY MC fails the $\bar p_{tsi}$ limit dramatically for smaller \nch. PYTHIA falls well below the data except for $K_\text{S}^0$. EPOS also tends to dive below the $\bar p_{tsi}$ limit and has a substantially different shape than data. The data-model differences presented there may be compared with the TCM results of Figs.~\ref{mptss} (d) and \ref{ybarcomp} (right) above wherein PID \mmpt\ hard-components $\bar p_{thi}(n_s)$ are determined consistently across systems at the few-percent level.

Figure~13 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} shows hadron ratios to $K_\text{S}^0$ vs charge density $\bar \rho_0$. The expected ratios based on Table~\ref{coefparamsxx} are 1/2 $\times$ 0.035 / 0.065 = 0.27, 0.0045 / 0.065 = 0.069 and 0.00047 / 0.065 = 0.0072. The thermal-model predictions are either well below the data (Lambdas and Cascade) or well above the data (Omegas). Note that Cascades $z_{0i}^* = 0.0030$ in that table corresponds to the spectra in Fig.~\ref{piddata} (c) but does not agree with published spectrum integrals for the same spectra in Fig.~\ref{ratios} above.

Figure~14 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} shows integrated yields $\bar \rho_{0i}$ for four hadron species plotted vs charge density $\bar \rho_0$, basically a repeat of its Fig.~8 for V0M event classes only. As demonstrated in Sec.~\ref{totyields} the ratios $\bar \rho_{0i}/\bar \rho_0 = z_{0i}(n_s)$ appearing in Fig.~\ref{ratios}, essentially the local slope of the trends in Fig.~14 of Ref.~\cite{alippss}, are slowly varying over a limited range with increasing \nch. The MC variations in its Fig.~14, especially for more-massive hadrons, are inexplicable. PYTHIA  falls below data by factors 2-4 for more-massive hadrons. Other MC trends relating to ratios $z_{0i}(n_s)$ varying strongly. Reference~\cite{alippss} states in its abstract that ``Several features of the data are reproduced qualitatively by general purpose QCD Monte Carlo models.... However, none of the tested [MC] models reproduce the data quantitatively.'' In fact, those data-model comparisons demonstrate falsification of the several MCs.

\subsubsection{PYTHIA, jet production and \mmpt\ trends}

The PYTHIA Monte Carlo includes so-called color reconnection (CR) as a strategy to accommodate \mmpt\ variation with charge density $\bar \rho_0$ among other issues. Without the CR feature PYTHIA \mmpt\ trends fall far below \mmpt\ data with increasing \nch. See Fig.~7 of Ref.~\cite{alicepppid}. A central issue for PYTHIA is the choice to model jet production in \pp\ collisions assuming a classical Glauber model of \pp\ overlap geometry (assuming such geometry is even relevant). The number of binary collisions (i.e.\ dijets) per participant-parton (i.e.\ low-$x$ gluons represented by $\bar \rho_s$) pair then varies approximately as $N_{part}^{4/3}$ just as for participant nucleons and corresponding dijets in \aa\ collisions. The {\em increase} of \mmpt\ with \nch\ is just the dijet contribution, which for PYTHIA without CR then varies as jets/\nch\ $ \sim \bar \rho_s^{4/3} / (\bar \rho_s + \alpha \bar \rho_s^2) \rightarrow  \rho_s^{1/3} / (1 + \alpha \bar \rho_s)$ within the context of the TCM. That expression describes the NoCR dash-dotted curves in Fig.~7 of Ref.~\cite{alicepppid}: Initial increase $\propto \rho_s^{1/3}$ then flattening and, for large \nch, {\em decrease} $\propto 1/\rho_s^{2/3}$. 

As described in Ref.~\cite{colour} color reconnection is an {\em ad hoc} strategy (actually, multiple strategies are available) to reduce the lengths of Lund strings connecting color charges (partons) emerging during the \pp\ collision process. It is possible to interpret the CR strategy as strongly affecting jet fragmentation functions (FFs): by minimizing string length one is reducing the number of fragments per scattered parton resulting in ``hardening'' of effective fragmentation functions. One (sought-after?) result is MC \mmpt\ trends with CR implemented that increase more rapidly and thereby approximate \mmpt\ vs \nch\ data trends.

A central problem for CR  strategies is evidence from spectrum hard components that reveal actual FF trends in the form of differential PID \pt\ spectrum systematics and from corresponding PID \mmpt\ hard components. As demonstrated in Refs.~\cite{ppbpid,pidpart1,pidpart2,pppid} and the present study spectrum hard components are quite stable across event classes representing typically a factor ten increase in event charge density and therefore a factor $\approx 100$ increase in jet production. In Fig.~\ref{ybarcomp} (left) shifting of hard-component modes $\bar y_t(n_s)$ is typically a few percent of the mean value $\bar y_t^*$, and corresponding variation of \mmpt\ hard components on the right is typically 10\% or less. Note that for kaons the variation is negligible or {\em even negative}. Thus, strong increase of \mmpt\  trends with \nch\ does not arise from, in effect, string-string interactions {\em a la} PYTHIA.

A possibly related problem is underprediction of multistrange hadron yields with increasing \pp\ \nch. Referring to Fig.~14 of Ref.~\cite{alippss} PYTHIA (presumably with CR invoked) falls far below the Omega data trend, and similarly for Cascades and Lambdas. The PYTHIA Perugia ``tune'' at $\bar \rho_0 = 30$ is 0.0035/0.014 $\rightarrow$ 25\% of the data trend at higher \nch. The more-recent Monash tune is less. The source of that discrepancy could well correspond to Fig.~\ref{omegarats} above and the mass dependence of hadron species {\em production from jets} as described in Ref.~\cite{transport}. In higher-\nch\ \pp\ collisions up to 80\% of Omegas are jet fragments. If jet production within a Monte Carlo is too small (for instance resulting from incorrect modeling of parton interactions) the result is likely to be strong suppression of {\em more-massive} hadron species having nothing to do with strangeness or baryon identity {\em per se}.

\subsection{Cleymans}

Reference~\cite{cleymanssuppress} applies a hadron resonance gas model (HRG) to integrated yields and their ratios for (multi)strange hadrons from A-B collisions at LHC energies. The principal issue is description of variation with charge density $\bar \rho_0$ of fractional abundances $z_{0i}(n_s)$ (using terminology and symbols from the present study). Certain comments from that paper are of interest.
%
``The analysis of data on hadron yields produced in heavy-ion collisions [various collision systems] confirms that produced hadrons originate from a thermal fireball formed in such collisions.''
%
Within the model ``The volume of the fireball [$V_A$] is fixed such as to reproduce the multiplicities of hadrons at a given collision energy....''
%
``It is shown that the number of charged hadrons is linearly proportional to the volume.''
%
Parameter $z_{0i}(n_s) = \bar \rho_{0i} / \bar \rho_0$ (integrated yield of species $i$ over total {\em charge} yield) is observed to decrease for lower charge densities, referred to within the HRG (among other thermal models) as canonical suppression. The magnitude of variation increases for more-massive hadrons.
%
``Actually, the observed properties of multi(strange) [sic] hadrons with charged-particle multiplicity was predicted in the context of the thermal model as being due to the canonical suppression effect.''
%
It is then asserted that ``...the canonical suppression depends on...the correlation volume parameter $V_C$ which quantifies the range of strangeness conservation and can be parametrized by [$\bar \rho_0$].''
%
It is observed that data require ``canonical correlation volume [$V_C$] larger than the fireball volume [$V_A$] at midrapidity.''
%
In passing it is noted that ``the HRG predicts about 25\% more protons and antiprotons than measured by the ALICE collaboration in central \pbpb\ collisions at the LHC. This constitutes the much-debated `proton-yield anomaly' in the heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.''
%
Although the HRG may be adapted to accommodate such suppression of {\em integrated} yields (via a proposed $S$-matrix correction), detailed differential PID spectrum analysis in Refs.~\cite{pidpart1,pppid} determined that the proton suppression is a real {\em instrumental} effect (biased $dE/dx$ analysis) that may be corrected accurately. 
%
It is concluded that
%
``These results provide further evidence for the thermal origin of particle production at the LHC in \pp, \pa\ and \aa\ collisions....''

Reference~\cite{cleymanssuppress} then addresses experimental results for \pp, \ppb\ and \pbpb\ collisions from the ALICE collaboration. Its Fig.~5 compares the HRG model to PID yield data.  That figure may be compare to Fig.~\ref{ratios} above where the relation  of $\bar \rho_{0i}$ to $\bar \rho_0$ is explicit and precise, where small deviations from simple proportionality (i.e.\ variation of $z_{0i}(n_s)$) are clearly evident. 
%
``...in the SCE [canonical ensemble with exact strangeness conservation] only two parameters remain, the volume of the system...$V_A$ [determined by the total particle yield] and the canonical volume $V_C$....''
%
If $V_C = V_A$ is assumed the model fails.  ``...a single volume  canonical model implies too strong suppression in low multiplicity systems.''
%
``...the strangeness canonical volume...$V_C$ can be larger than the fireball volume $V_A$...''\ indicating that $V_C$ and $V_A$ are simply fitting parameters.

Although the format of Fig.~\ref{ratios} above presents a clear picture of PID yield trends there is a preference to consider ratios to pion yields as in Fig.~8 of Ref.~\cite{cleymanssuppress}. Based on $z_{0i}^*$ values in Table~\ref{coefparams} with 0.80 for pions~\cite{pppid} (and factors in the figure) the saturation values for those ratios should be $2 \times 0.064 / 0.80 = 0.16$ for neutral kaons, $2 \times 0.037 / 0.80 = 0.093$ for Lambdas, $6 \times 0.0045/0.80 = 0.034$ for Cascades and $16 \times 0.00047 / 0.80 = 0.0094$ for Omegas. Fixed $z_{0i}^*$ numbers in Table~\ref{coefparams} describe the ALICE PID spectrum data within uncertainties (modulo small variations in Fig.~\ref{ratios}) as is apparent in Figs.~\ref{ppbpiddata} and \ref{piddata} above. Substantial disagreements with those numbers in Fig.~8 of Ref.~\cite{cleymanssuppress} are thus puzzling.
%
In  Fig.~9 (left) of Ref.~\cite{cleymanssuppress} the $p/\pi$ ratio is approximately 0.055, but from Ref.~\cite{pppid} the expectation is 0.066/0.80 $\approx 0.080$. The 33\% discrepancy corresponds in part to the `proton-yield anomaly' referred to earlier. As noted, differential analysis of proton spectra from \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions indicates systematic bias arising from $dE/dx$ analysis~\cite{pidpart1}. A corresponding {\em excess} for pion spectra is reported in Ref.~\cite{pppid} indicating that missing protons are misidentified as pions. The combination leads to the 33\% above.

Figure~9 (right) of Ref.~\cite{cleymanssuppress} shows $p/\Lambda$ ratios for three collision systems. In this case one expects ratios $0.70 / 0.035 \approx 2.0$. The trend for larger \nch\ (and more jet production) is instead $\approx 1.4$. The $\approx$ 30\% discrepancy is consistent with  the $p/\pi$ results above. Note that for smaller \nch\ the ratio approaches the expected value 2.0. That is consistent with the finding that the proton inefficiency in \pp\ and \ppb\ collisions occurs above 0.5 GeV/c and thus impacts mainly jet fragment yields. With lower \nch\ the spectra become dominated by soft components, and the proton misidentification plays a lesser role. 

In Fig.~10 of Ref.~\cite{cleymanssuppress} yield ratios to Lambdas are shown. Expected values are $0.065 / 0.035 \approx 1.9$, $0.0045 / 0.035\approx 0.13$ and $0.00047 / .035 \approx 0.013$ for $K_\text{S}^0 / \Lambda$, $\Xi / \Lambda$ and $\Omega / \Lambda$ respectively. Data in its panel (a) ($\approx 3.7$) make no sense. The data for smaller systems in (b) and (c) saturate at expected values for $\bar \rho_0 \sim 40$, but the data for \pbpb\  (triangles) in panel (c) are about 70\% higher. That is consistent with the clear Omega excess for $\Omega / \pi$ in its Fig.~8 relative to expected 0.0094. It is also consistent with Fig.~5 of Ref.~\cite{alippbss} where $\Omega / \pi$ ratios for \pp\ and \ppb\ rescaled by values for \pbpb\ (``high multiplicity limit'') are substantially suppressed (by about 30\%) compared to $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$. The results in Fig.~\ref{ratios} (right) indicate that differences among those three species are actually subtle.

Aside from the numerical issues listed above there are several aspects of the HRG as utilized in Ref.~\cite{cleymanssuppress} that seem questionable. The model is based on the assumption that almost all hadrons emerge from a ``fireball'' represented by some volume $V$ and temperature $T$: ``...the chemical freezeout of all hadrons is quantified by the temperature and the volume of the fireball only.'' The concept is more recently applied to \ppb\ and even \pp\ collisions. But the actual volume of a particle source is not well defined. For \ppb\ collisions individual \pn\ collisions are observed to be independent~\cite{tomglauber} based on {\em exclusivity}~\cite{tomexclude}: a projectile proton may interact with only one target nucleon {\em at a time}. That finding is consistent with the TCM relation $\bar \rho_h \approx \alpha \bar \rho_s^2$ indicating that \nn\ collisions are ``all or nothing'' -- independent quantum transitions.

\section{OLD Discussion} \label{}

Total yields throw away almost all information. HCs have measurable energy dependence.

EbyE fluctuations should be much larger in small systems making junk more prevalent

\subsection{Misleading plots}


\vskip .1in

(d) Certain plot formats are misleading. Assuming that charge density $\bar \rho_0$ is the appropriate control parameter is incorrect. The total charge density arises from two mechanisms which are thus confused. Consider left and right panels of Fig.~\ref{ratios} or Fig.~\ref{mpttrends} for example. The hard/soft (jet/nonjet) ratio is the relevant control parameter relating two {\em distinct} particle production mechanisms that may not coexist as such within a thermalized fireball.

Aside from plot formats {\em per se}, comments relating to data plots that include the word ``qualitative'' as in ``qualitative agreement'' or ``qualitatively consistent'' are meaningless. If two trends are in ``qualitative agreement'' then they must be in {\em quantitative disagreement}, the degree to which should be reported in terms of a proper {\em statistical-significance} measure (e.g.\ Z-scores). A model may thereby be falsified or some data found to be erroneous in comparison with others.

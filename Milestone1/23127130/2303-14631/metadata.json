    "abstract": "In the lyotropic phase of lipids with excess water, multilamellar tubules (MLTs) grow from defects. A phenomenological model for the stability of MLTs is developed that is universal and independent of the underlying growth mechanisms of MLTs. The stability of MLTs implies that they are in hydrostatic equilibrium and stable as elastic objects that have compression and bending elasticity. The results show that even with 0.1 atm solvent pressure differences, the density profile is not significantly altered, thus determining that the stability is due to the trapped solvent. The results are of sufficient value in relation to lamellar stability models and may have implications beyond the described MLT models, especially in other models of membrane systems.",

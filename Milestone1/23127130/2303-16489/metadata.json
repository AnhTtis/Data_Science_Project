    "abstract": "In this article we prove that nonlinear resolvents of infinitesimal generators on bounded and convex subdomains of $\\C^n$ are decreasing Loewner chains. Furthermore, we consider the problem of the existence of nonlinear resolvents on unbounded convex domains in $\\C$. In the case of the upper half-plane, we obtain a complete solution by using that nonlinear resolvents of certain generators correspond to semigroups of probability measures with respect to free convolution.",

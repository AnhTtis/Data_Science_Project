\subsection{Scalability test}\label{sec_scalability}
This experiment is to evaluate the scalability of \samgreedy~and BAB~when we increase the network size. To vary the network size, we partition Gowalla dataset into five subgraphs, and each of them covers 20\% nodes of the dataset. To avoid smashing the network into pieces, each subgraph is generated by a breadth-first traversal process. %It is worth noting that if one method has more than 25G of memory consumption or runs more than 3000s, we will omit it. 
Figure \ref{fig:exp_scalability} shows the result, and we have the following observations. (1) The performance of \samgreedy~and ProBAB is about 2 and 1 orders of magnitude faster than BAB, respectively. (2) When the graph size is increasing, the memory consumption of \samgreedy, BAB and ProBAB is increasing slowly but no more than 25GB.


%The run time of \samgreedy~and \indexgreedy~increases faster than that of \samgreedyplus~and \indexgreedyplus, with the growth of graph size. This is because the runtime of \samgreedy~and \indexgreedy increases with respect to $n^2$, while the runtime of \samgreedyplus~and \indexgreedyplus increases with respect to $n\log n$. (2) When the graph size is increasing, the memory consumption of \degreeTop, \samgreedy~and \indexgreedy~also increases faster than that of \samgreedyplus~and \indexgreedyplus. As we analyzed in Section~\ref{sec_4:pre-sampling}, \presample~can eliminate some node, which can't reach rumor set $\ru$. Therefore, \presample~can slow down the growth of the memory consumption when the graph size is increasing.

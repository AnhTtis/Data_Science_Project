In this paper, we studied the \prob~problem based on a non-submodular influence block model and proved that it is NP-hard to approximate. %More importantly, a simple sampling-based greedy method cannot work well since the logistic-based influence block model is not submodular. 
%Then, we proposed a sampling-based method to compute the upper
%bound by using a dynamic tangent line to tightly bound the actual influence block. By utilizing this upper bound computation method, we built a branch-and-bound framework to solve \prob~problem. 
Then, we proposed a branch-and-bound framework with a sampling-based upper-bound estimation method to solve \prob~problem.
To further improve the efficiency, we optimized our framework with a progressive sampling-based greedy method for upper bound estimation. Lastly, we conducted experiments on real-world datasets to verify the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our methods.\\

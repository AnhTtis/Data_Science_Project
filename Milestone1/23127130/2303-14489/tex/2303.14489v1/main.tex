\begin{abstract}
Quenched disorder is known to lead to peculiar dynamical phases including trapping behavior in active matter. We construct a minimal model for a collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) having soft repulsive interactions on a chemically patterned substrate that serves as a disorder. Using numerical simulations, we vary the strength of the chemical potential spatially for a range of self-propulsion speeds of the Brownian particles for the proposed variant of the Keller-Segel model. The interplay between chemo-phoretic interactions and activity results in a chemo-motility-induced phase-separated state and a new cohesive phase having synchronized rotations, amongst two other dynamically almost frozen phases. We show that rotational order can emerge in systems by virtue of activity and repulsive interactions alone without the need to explicitly model alignment interactions.

\maketitle

\hspace{0.5cm} Active matter refers to any collection of entities that individually and dissipatively break time-reversal symmetry \cite{rmpbechinger2016, annalsofphys2005, vicsek2012, rmp2013}. The continuous energy feed keeps the system out of equilibrium. The living world is overwhelmingly constituted by active matter in the form of cells \cite{cell}, flocks of birds \cite{physicstoday2006}, human crowds \cite{humancrowd1, humancrowd2}, etc. Active units not only show interesting features as a collection but also perform dynamic individual motions and reach a statistical steady state in response to an external stimulus \cite{vicseknatphys}. A collection of microorganisms having an intrinsic time-reversal asymmetry in its dynamics is central to many fascinating properties of active systems: viz collective foraging \cite{foraging}, swarming of bacteria \cite{bacteria1, bacteria3}, dynamical clustering in active colloids \cite{activecolloids}, etc. 

\hspace{0.5cm} Ordering emerges in systems as a result of alignment interactions even in the presence of thermal fluctuations \cite{orderingnoise}. The onset of disorder in systems proceeds through various biological phenomena.
%, the most well-known of all being predator-prey dynamics. In such a case, an organized group of prey can disperse into many small units when it senses a predator. 
In theory and simulations, we customarily model disorder by considering field variations in density \cite{densityfield}, chemical potential \cite{chemicalfield}, polarization \cite{polfield, pol2}, etc, that affect the spatiotemporal self-propulsion speeds of the agents, and also by introducing geometrical obstacles \cite{obstacle} on the substrate. The effect of quenched (time-independent) disorder in the dynamical phases of self-propelled particles \cite{coldperuani, vivekepje} is a topic of great interest but is lacking in its representation in literature.

\hspace{0.5cm} Bacterial populations migrate in response to a self-generated chemical gradient, enabling cells to escape from toxic environments, build colonies and coexist \cite{chemo1, chemo2}. With the development of synthetic microswimmers, synthetic signaling can be used as a design principle to create and study pattern formations \cite{acc1, acc2}. The response of active agents to a chemo-phoretic field and its effect on the fascinating non-equilibrium phenomena: motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is recently studied in \cite{arXiv}. The interplay between steric, chemo-phoretic interactions and activity, leads to the emergence of a phase-separated state very recently coined as the chemo-motility-induced phase-separated (CMIPS) state 
%for surprisingly low packing fractions and moderate Peclet numbers 
\cite{softmatter2023}. On the other hand, surface interactions and morphology can give rise to interesting features in active matter. 
The motion of a Brownian particle as it flows through periodically modulated potential-energy landscapes in two dimensions experiences a crossover from free-flowing to locked-in transport that depends on the periodicity of the landscape \cite{morphology}. A self-propelled colloid faces a competition between hindered diffusion from the trapping potential on a periodic crystalline surface and enhanced diffusion due to active motion \cite{periodicsurface}. Further, a periodic arrangement of obstacles on the substrate is found to enhance the persistent motion of an ABP and induce directionality in its motion \cite{sudipta}.

\hspace{0.5cm}  Such studies motivated us to pursue a quench disorder problem for a collection of ABPs in a chemically patterned substrate. In this Letter, we achieve the same by exposing the well-studied collective ABP problem to the Keller-Segel \cite{KS1}-\cite{KS2} model of chemotaxis (swimming up chemical gradients). The interplay between chemo-phoretic interactions and activity suppresses the dynamical phases that a quench-free ABP problem would otherwise produce. In addition to obtaining a CMIPS state, a hopping transport phase, and a localized phase, we obtain a non-trivial dynamically rotating phase. We motivate the emergence of a phase with such rotational order by presenting the dynamics of a single particle first.


%\section{Model and Numerical details}\label{sec2}
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Model-} A collection of ABPs with radii $a_0$ having  a self-propulsion speed $v_0$ are simulated on a two-dimensional surface with a patterned chemical concentration. The steric repulsion $\textbf{F}_{ij}$ between two disks $\textit{i}$ and $\textit{j}$ is short-ranged and repulsive: $\textbf{F}_{ij}=-k(2a_{0}-r_{ij})\textbf{r}_{ij}$ if $r_{ij} < 2a_{0}$ and $\textbf{F}_{ij}=\textbf{0}$ otherwise. In addition to the steric repulsion, particles also experience a time-invariant periodic chemical concentration on the substrate:  $c(\textbf{r}) = h_0  sin(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda}) sin(\frac{2\pi y}{\lambda})$ 
%\begin{equation}
    %c(\textbf{r}) = h_0  sin(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda}) sin(\frac{2\pi y}{\lambda}) 
    %\label{eq2} 
%\end{equation}
 with wavelength $\lambda$ chosen to be $25 a_0$ and amplitude $h_0$ is varied. For a particular 
 $h_0$, each local minima of the patterned $c({\bf r})$ can be treated as a separate subsystem containing a sufficient number of ABPs. Due to the chemical field, particles experience both a force acting on their center of mass and a torque due to the local gradient of the chemical field. Then, the motion of a chemotactic particle self-propelling with a velocity $v_0$ (independent of chemotaxis) in a direction \textbf{p}(t) = $(cos\theta_{i}(t),sin\theta_{i}(t))$ is given by the following over-damped equations :
\begin{equation}
    \partial_t \textbf{r}_i = v_0 \textbf{p}_i(t) + \beta_D \nabla c(\textbf{r}_{i},t) + \mu \sum_{j\neq i} \textbf{F}_{ij} 
    \label{eq3} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \partial_t \textbf{$\theta$}_i = \beta \textbf{p}_i(t)\times \nabla c(\textbf{r}_{i},t) + \eta^R_i(t) 
    \label{eq4} 
\end{equation}
\hspace{0.5cm} Equations \ref{eq3} and \ref{eq4} model the response of active particles to the local chemical gradient drawing from the Keller-Segel 
%\cite{KS1}-\cite{KS2} 
(KS) model of chemotaxis. $\beta_D$ is the chemotactic coupling coefficient which measures the translational diffusion in response to the chemical gradient. %$\mu$ is the mobility due to interaction forces between the particles. 
Angular diffusion is measured by the orientational coupling coefficient $\beta$. The swimming direction of the particle is chemo-attractive if $\beta_D, \beta>0$ (motion towards the chemical gradient) and chemo-repulsive if $\beta_D, \beta<0$ (motion away from the chemical gradient) for the position and orientation respectively. We fix $\beta_D=\beta=1$. The symmetry in the functional form of c(\textbf{r}) ensures that the same dynamical steady-states are reached in our system for both chemo-attractive and chemo-repulsive interactions.

    \label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\hspace{0.5cm} The ratio of translational diffusion to angular diffusion due to the chemical concentration sets an intrinsic time scale: $\tau_{c}=\beta_D/\beta^{2}=1$. The ratio $\beta_D/\beta$ sets an intrinsic length scale: \textit{l$_{c}$}, the length up to which a particle translates before it experiences a rotation due to the chemical gradient. All other times and lengths in the system are scaled with $\tau_c$ and $l_c$. The elastic time scale $(\mu k)^{-1}$ is fixed to $5 \times 10^{-2} \tau_c$.
$\eta^R_i(t)$ is the Gaussian white noise for thermal rotational diffusion with zero mean and delta correlation having the strength $D_{R}$. To compare the active force to the chemical force, we define a dimensionless activity $\nu = \frac{v_{0}} {\sqrt{\lambda^-1 \beta_D \beta}}$ which is varied between $[0.25, 10]$ as $v_0$ $\in [0.05, 2]$. The surface gradient $\epsilon$ = $h_0/\lambda$  quantifies the steepness of  chemical concentration and is kept in the range $[10^{-3}, 10^{1}]$. The dynamics and steady state of the system are studied by varying $\epsilon$ and $\nu$. Each realization of the system is $5\times$$10^{5} $ time steps long with a time step $\Delta t =5\times$$10^{-3} \tau_{c}$. The system is studied for a $L$ $\times$ $L$ square geometry and the periodic boundary condition (PBC) is applied in both directions. For the purpose of statistical averaging, data from $20$ independent realizations are used.

%\subsection{Non-interacting model}
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Non-interacting model-} We first study the effect of the patterned surface on the dynamics of a single particle by setting $\mu=0$ in Eq. \ref{eq3} and $D_{R}=0$. A unit cell ($L = \lambda/2$) of the periodic chemical patterned substrate is chosen. A model cartoon is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig1} (a) and the dynamics for a chosen set of system parameters are reported in Figs. \ref{fig:fig1} (b-d).

\hspace{0.5cm} Dynamics of a single particle for various \textit{$\nu$} and $\epsilon$ are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig2}. The particle's trajectory is scattered for small $\nu$ whereas it is localized along a straight line for large $\nu$. For low $\epsilon$ [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig2} (a)], the particle exhibits unconfined diffusive dynamics, the diffusivity increasing with $\nu$. There is a preference to traverse along the $x-y$ direction followed by $x$ and $y$ directions owing to the form of c(\textbf{r}) and PBC. For moderate $\epsilon$, the particle is unable to escape the valley where it was initialized [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig2} (b-c)]. However, sufficient $\nu$ can give the particle the required energy to deviate from the valley. The combined effect results in the particle preferring to move tangentially to $\nabla$c minima. Note that the radius $R$ of circular motion decreases with increasing $\epsilon$ and increases with increasing $\nu$ [see annotations in Fig. \ref{fig:fig2}]. For very high $\epsilon$ [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig2} (d)], the confinement is strong and the particle is effectively localized, only to be freed by very high $\nu$. 


%\subsection{Interacting model}
%\newpage
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Interacting model-} We set $\mu=1$,  $D_{R} = 10^{-4}\tau_{c}^{-1}$ and $L=4\lambda$. The number of particles \textit{N} in the system is decided by the packing fraction $\phi = \frac{N \times \pi a_0^2}{L \times L}$ which is fixed to $0.6$. The simulation starts from a homogeneous arrangement of particles with the same speeds and randomized orientations on the substrate. We explored the ($\nu$,$\epsilon$) phase-space and present the system snapshots at time $t=2500\tau_{c}$ (steady-state) in Fig. \ref{fig:fig3}.

    \label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Phases}
\hspace{0.5cm} Fig. \ref{fig:fig3} shows that there are $3$ distinct phases in the structural sense, namely the chemo motility-induced phase-separated (\textit{CMIPS}) phase, delocalized periodic clustering phase and the localized clustering phase (\textit{LC}). The chemical field dictates the particles to accumulate in regions where $\nabla$c is minimum. Consequently, periodic clusters form in systems with non-negligible $\epsilon$. However, the delocalized periodic clustering phase shows two kinds of dynamics based on the strength of $\epsilon$. Hence we further divide this class into rotating clusters (\textit{RC}) and non-rotating clusters (\textit{NC}). The characteristics of these phases follow.



\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Chemo-motility-induced phase-separated (CMIPS) state:} For very low $\epsilon$ and $\nu\geq0.75$, we obtain a macroscopic cluster formation (color-coded \textit{orange} in Fig. \ref{fig:fig3}) wherein a dense liquid phase coexists with the gaseous phase. \textit{CMIPS} is structurally similar to MIPS, but the origins of phase separation in \textit{CMIPS} is due to an interplay between long-range chemo-phoretic interactions that collapse particles into valleys of the chemical concentration forming clusters and activity that disperses particles from the clusters. This is in contrast with the self-trapping positive feedback loop that leads to MIPS \cite{prl2012filly, prl2013exp}.

\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Rotating clusters (RC):} For slightly higher $\epsilon$'s and moderate $\nu$'s, the \textit{CMIPS} phase is suppressed by chemotaxis. We obtain periodic clusters that rotate about their cluster centers (color-coded \textit{red} in Fig. \ref{fig:fig3}). The sense of rotation of a cluster may change with time [see Supp. Movie $S2$]. Each cluster acts like a chemo-repulsive shell due to the local anisotropy in the chemical concentration. This constricts the freedom of a cluster to grow beyond a certain size.

%\subsection{Mean-square displacement}
\begin{figure}[tb!]
\center
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{msd.png} 
    \caption{Mean-square displacement $<\Delta r^2>$ \textit{vs.} time for the $4$ distinct phases. Inset shows diffusivity \textit{D} as a function of \textit{$\nu$} for the first $3$ phases. The dashed line is drawn for slope $1$ and the solid line is drawn for slope $2$. Key: \textit{orange square} for \textit{CMIPS}; \textit{red cross} for \textit{RC}; \textit{blue diamond} for \textit{NC}; \textit{black star} for \textit{LC}.}
    \label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Non-rotating clusters (NC):} For higher $\epsilon$'s, field strength dominates highly over the activity. This results in the formation of connected periodic clusters (color-coded \textit{blue} in Fig. \ref{fig:fig3}) that allow \textit{hopping transport} of particles between clusters to a considerable extent. These cluster boundaries lack curvature and possess sharp edges. They are also more closely packed than \textit{RC}.

\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Localized clusters (\textit{LC}):} For very high $\epsilon$ ($>$1), the clusters are completely localized and show little to no dynamics (color-coded \textit{black} in Fig. \ref{fig:fig3}). Particle trajectories asymptotically converge to bounded areas in space leading to trapping in the valleys of c(\textbf{r}). Boundaries of \textit{LC} are very sharp and the dynamics of one cluster are independent of the others in the system. 
%The size of the clusters can again be determined by $R$. 
Hence system collapses to the non-interacting model, \textit{i.e.,} each localized cluster can be treated as an independent subsystem.

%\hspace{0.5cm} Our study will shed more light on \textit{RC} as rotational order emerges without an explicit alignment interaction in this phase. While the steepness of the valley ($\epsilon$) is responsible for driving the particles into periodic clusters, once the clusters are formed, the activity ensures the particle dynamics within the cluster. However, moving tangentially along the radial layers of the cluster is the only means to minimize the surface potential. Thus, activity and steric forces alone contribute to the synchronized rotations in \textit{RC}.


 %\subsubsection{Statics and Dynamics}
\hspace{0.5cm} We further quantify the dynamics of the phases by calculating the mean square displacement (MSD) of the particles: 
\begin{equation}
     <\Delta r^{2} (t)>  = \frac{1}{N} {\sum_{i=1}^{N} |r_i(t_{0}+t) -r_i(t_{0})|^{2}}
\end{equation}


%\subsection{Radial Distribution function g(r)}
\begin{figure}[tb!]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{g2r.png} 
    \caption{The pair correlation function g$_{2}(r')$ for (a) \textit{CMIPS} (b) \textit{RC} (c) \textit{NC} and (d) \textit{LC}. The \textit{black} dashed line is drawn at $r'=\sqrt{3}$. The magenta dashed curve in panel (c) corresponds to a \textit{NC} system with lower $\nu$. Inset I zooms into $r' \in (1.5,2.25)$. Inset II zooms into $r' \in (5.25,9.5)$.}
    \label{fig:fig5}
\end{figure}
MSD regime shifts from ballistic (slope $2$) for initial times to diffusive (slope $1$) for late times [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig4}]. The effective diffusivity $\textit{D}=\lim_{t \to \infty}<\Delta r^2>/(4t)$ is shown in the inset of Fig. \ref{fig:fig4}. We find the scaling relation: \textit{D} $\sim$ $\nu$$^{\beta}$. We get $\beta \simeq 2$ for {\it CMIPS} as is known for self-propelled rods \cite{beta1, beta2}; $1<\beta<2$ for \textit{RC} and \textit{D} is independent of $\nu$ for \textit{LC}. We state that \textit{NC} shows anomalous diffusivity (data not shown). 
%systems very close to the boundary of \textit{LC} show a drop in diffusivity with an increase in $\nu$, while the systems far away from this boundary show anomalous diffusivity.

\hspace{0.5cm} We further characterize the structural ordering of the particles in different phases. The radial distribution function (RDF) $g_{2}$(r) is a measure of the probability of finding a particle at $r_{2}$ given a particle at $r_{1}$ with $r=|r_{2}$-$r_{1}|$. In two dimensions, $<n>g(r)d^{2}r$ gives the number of particles in $d^{2}r$, where $<n>$ is the mean number of particles in the unit area. RDF is plotted against the normalized radial distance $r' = r/(2a_{0})$ in Fig. \ref{fig:fig5}. Evidently, \textit{CMIPS}, \textit{RC} and \textit{NC} show their largest peak at the nearest-neighbor(\textit{nn}) distance $r'=1$. The second and third peaks occur at  $r'=\sqrt{3}$ (second \textit{nn}) and $r'=2$ (third \textit{nn}) respectively [see insets I of Fig. \ref{fig:fig5}]. This indicates the presence of hexagonal close-packing (HCP). For \textit{LC}, the major peaks occur before this distance as their constituents are more tightly packed than HCP.
\hspace{0.5cm} Note that in \textit{NC}, the minor peaks are less dense for higher $\nu$ (solid curve) compared to lower $\nu$ (dashed curve) [see inset I of Fig. \ref{fig:fig5} (c)]. This is an indication that the boundary is more rigid and particles experience more confinement for higher $\nu$'s. Continuing to increase $\nu$ for a certain $\epsilon$ will lead to strict confinement as in \textit{LC}. This supports our observation of anomalous diffusivity in \textit{NC}. Insets II of Fig. \ref{fig:fig5} zoom into the radial distances near the start of the next periodic valley. \textit{CMIPS} shows long-range ordering, \textit{LC} indicates periodicity in clustering but such information is inconclusive in \textit{RC} and \textit{NC}.

\hspace{0.5cm} The  velocity auto-correlation function (VACF) of the particles is given by: 
\begin{equation}
C_{v}(t) = <\cos(\phi(t_{0})-\phi(t+t_{0}))>-<\cos\phi(t+t_{0})>^{2}
\end{equation}
where the $<...> $ is the average over many times $t_0$, particles \textit{N} and many independent realisations. VACF for the four phases is reported in Fig. \ref{fig:fig6}. VACF exponentially decays for \textit{CMIPS} [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig6} (a)]. Exponential fitting of the same yields the decay time: $t_{c}\sim 50\tau_{c}$. Hence, velocity has a long decay time for \textit{CMIPS} phase, unlike MIPS. The VACF shows clear oscillations for \textit{RC} indicating rotational order in the system [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig6} (b)]. To support it, snapshots of a single cluster with a tagged particle (\textit{cyan} filled-circle) and its variation over time are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig7} (a). The time taken to complete one full cycle is annotated in Fig. \ref{fig:fig6} (b) by highlighting two velocities separated by $t_{4}-t_{1}=60\tau_{c}$. While it is the steepness of the valley ($\epsilon$) that drives the particles into periodic clusters, once the clusters are formed, the activity ensures the particle dynamics inside the cluster. However, moving tangentially along the radial layers of the cluster is the only means to minimize the surface potential. Thus, activity and steric forces alone contribute to the rotations in \textit{RC}. Velocities of particles in \textit{NC} and \textit{LC} do not share a functional relationship, hence the VACF is almost zero [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig6} (c-d)].

%\subsection{Velocity Auto-correlation function (VACF)}
\begin{figure}[tb!]
\center
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{vacf.png} 
    \caption{Variation of the particle velocity auto-correlation function C$_{v}(t)$ for (a) \textit{CMIPS} (b) \textit{RC} (c) \textit{NC} and (d) \textit{LC}. This is calculated for $350\tau_{c}$ in the steady state.}
    \label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

\hspace{0.5cm} The handedness of any two nearest rotating clusters in \textit{RC} are opposite [see Fig. \ref{fig:fig7} (b)]. The sense of rotation of a cluster is purely decided by the particles which are at the outer layer as they have the highest magnitude of instantaneous velocity in the cluster. The regions in which the exchange of particles is taking place between clusters are highlighted by \textit{black} dashed circles. If a particle from a cluster is leaving to join one of the nearest clusters, it changes its sense of rotation. In this way, the periodic chemical concentration leads to synchronized rotations in the whole system.

%\newpage
\hspace{0.5cm} The macroscopic clusters we obtained in \textit{CMIPS} also rotate as a part or whole [see Supp. Movie $S1$]. Hence our rotational states are from both \textit{CMIPS} (macroscopic rotation)  and \textit{RC} (synchronized rotations). To characterize the rotation we calculate the global rotational order parameter $\Omega(\nu,\epsilon)$: 
\begin{equation}
    \Omega (\nu, \epsilon) = <\frac{1}{N_{c}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{c}} |\sum_{j=1}^{N_{c, j}} (\textbf{r}_{j}\times \textbf{v}_{j})| >
\end{equation}

where $N_{c}$ denotes the number of valleys in the system (fixed for a certain $\lambda$); $N_{c, j}$ refers to the number of particles in the $i^{th}$ cluster computed by counting particles within a radial distance of $\lambda/8$ from the center of the $i^{th}$ valley.  ${\bf r}_j$ and ${\bf v}_j$ are the position of the $j^{th}$ particle relative to the center of the valley and instantaneous velocity of the $j^{th}$ particle respectively. Table \ref{table1} reports the values of $\Omega$ for systems with such rotational order. 
%We propose a functional dependence between $\Omega$ and $\nu$: $\Omega \sim \nu^{\gamma}$. \textbf{The rotating systems from \textit{CMIPS} follow $\gamma \sim$ 1; \textit{RC} follows $\gamma \lessapprox$ 3 (or) a complex power-law.}

\hspace{0.5cm} We accumulated all information from Fig. \ref{fig:fig3} -Fig. \ref{fig:fig7} for demarcation and classification of the phases. We report these phases along with their effective diffusivities in the $(\nu, \epsilon)$ plane in Fig. \ref{fig:fig8}.

\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Concluding remarks-} We have studied the dynamics and steady states of a collection of chemo-phoretically interacting ABPs for the case of a chemical potential that is quenched in time and periodic in space. The study elucidates the competition between activity and chemotaxis. In the extreme limits, when activity dominates we obtain chemotactic-MIPS \textit{i.e., CMIPS}, and when chemotaxis dominates we obtain localized clusters having glassy dynamics. When the active force and the chemical force are comparable, particles arrange themselves into periodic clusters of finite length  showing synchronized rotations about their centers. 


\hspace{0.5cm} We emphasize that for the case of synchronized rotations, a strict sense of handedness is picked up by a cluster without any intrinsic alignment interaction within the model. An interplay of time-reversal asymmetry and chemo-phoretic interactions between the repulsive disks is responsible for such collective rotations in the system. The observed rotations are more robust and are in contrast with swarms that generally have one cluster rotating about its center of mass \cite{swarm} as a response to external obstacles or phoretic-motility \cite{vicseknatphys, honeybee, swarming}. While our study has focused on a purely symmetric quench, it will be interesting to study a system with spatially random or time-dependent chemotaxis. We further vouch for the reproducibility of our results for other kinds of time-quenched taxis, viz, phototaxis \cite{photo}, viscotaxis \cite{visco}, electrotaxis \cite{electro}, thermotaxis \cite{thermo}, etc. Our results can also be tested in experiments by designing a patterned substrate for synthetic as well as natural microswimmers. Such experiments can be crucial in understanding the chemotactic response of biological swimmers to the underlying medium.

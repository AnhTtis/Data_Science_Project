    "abstract": "Many microorganisms use chemical 'signaling' -- a quintessential self-organizing strategy in non-equilibrium -- that can induce spontaneous aggregation and coordination in behavior. This inspired us to construct a minimal model for a collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) having soft repulsive interactions on a chemically-quenched patterned substrate. We numerically investigate the interplay between chemo-phoretic interactions and activity for a proposed variant of the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis. Such competition not only results in a chemo-motility-induced phase-separated state but also a new cohesive phase with synchronized rotations, amongst two other dynamically nearly-frozen phases. Our results suggest that rotational order can emerge in systems by virtue of activity and repulsive interactions alone without an explicit alignment interaction.",

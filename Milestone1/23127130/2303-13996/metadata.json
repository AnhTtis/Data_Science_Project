    "abstract": "Scientists have been trying to identify all of the genes in the human genome since the initial draft of the genome was published in 2001. Over the intervening years, much progress has been made in identifying protein-coding genes, and the estimated number has shrunk to fewer than 20,000, although the number of distinct protein-coding isoforms has expanded dramatically. The invention of high-throughput RNA sequencing and other technological breakthroughs have led to an explosion in the number of reported non-coding RNA genes, although most of them do not yet have any known function. A combination of recent advances offers a path forward to identifying these functions and towards eventually completing the human gene catalogue. However, much work remains to be done before we have a universal annotation standard that includes all medically significant genes, maintains their relationships with different reference genomes, and describes clinically relevant genetic variants.",

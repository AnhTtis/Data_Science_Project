    "abstract": "Consequences of the consistent exact solution of Einstein-Cartan equation on the time dependence of Hubble parameter is discussed. The torsion leads to a space and time dependent expansion parameter which results into nontrivial windows of Hubble parameter between diverging behaviour. Only one window shows a period of decreasing followed by increasing time dependence. Provided a known cosmological constant and the present values of Hubble and deceleration parameter this changing time can be given in the past as well as the ending time of the windows or universe. From the metric with torsion outside matter it is seen that torsion can feign dark matter.",

The existence of phase transitions in nuclear systems, in particular of the liquid–vapor kind, has been widely discussed and even experimentally claimed.

Since the vapor of clusters coexists with a finite liquid drop, we devise a finite size correction leading to a modified Fisher equation. The application of the above techniques to nuclear systems requires dealing also with the Coulomb force. Nuclear cluster evaporation rates can be corrected for Coulomb effects and can be used to evaluate the cluster concentrations in the ‘virtual’ equilibrium vapor.

abstract = {The Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is widely used for describing simple fluids; it is also a point of departure for developing models of complex fluids. Thermodynamic properties of the LJ fluid have been studied by molecular simulations by many authors and a critical review of the available data, which comprises about 35,000 data points, has been published recently [J. Chem. Inf. Mod. 59 (2019) 4248–4265]. The importance of the LJ fluid has also triggered the development of a large number of equations of state (EOS). In the present work, 20 LJ EOS were critically assessed by comparing their results with consolidated data from computer experiments. A large variety of thermophysical properties was considered: vapor pressure; saturated densities; enthalpy of vaporization; critical properties; thermal, caloric, and entropic properties at homogeneous state points; and second and third virial coefficients. It was found that none of the available LJ EOS meets the following two criteria: (1) it does not yield unphysical artifacts when used for extrapolations, and (2) it describes data from computer experiments within their statistical uncertainty in most fluid regions. Furthermore, a re-parameterization of the monomer term of the PC-SAFT EOS was carried out by fitting it to data of the LJ fluid. The new LJ EOS yields good results for the LJ fluid, but does not outperform the best existing LJ EOS.}

abstract  ="We report numerical results for the third virial coefficient of two center Lennard-Jones quadrupolar molecules. Calculations are performed for 35 models with different elongations and quadrupoles over a temperature range from half to twice the critical temperature. It is found that increasing the elongation at fixed quadrupole has the effect of increasing B3. On the other hand{,} at fixed elongation B3 first decreases with increasing quadrupole at low temperatures{,} then increases with increasing quadrupole at higher temperatures. We estimate the temperature at which the third virial coefficient vanishes. Although both this temperature and the critical temperature increase with the quadrupole moment{,} their ratio remains almost constant. We predict the critical properties using two different truncated virial series. The first one employs the exact second and third virial coefficients. The second one approximates the fourth order contribution by using estimates obtained for hard diatomics. It is found that both methods yield fairly good predictions{,} with a somewhat better performance of the approximate fourth order expansion. The two methods are complementary{,} however{,} because they consistently bracket the exact value as determined from computer simulations."}

abstract = {Spontaneous cavitation in a stretched Lennard-Jones liquid at temperatures above and below the triple point has been studied by the direct forward flux sampling and the seeding methods. A change in the nucleation rate of 230 orders of magnitude has been traced. The data obtained have been compared with calculations according to classical nucleation theory in a capillarity approximation. A discrepancy reaching 16 orders of magnitude in nucleation rate between the results of theory and simulation has been found. It has been shown that the reason for this discrepancy consists in the size dependence of the surface free energy of critical bubbles. The first-order and second-order corrections to the surface free energy of these bubbles with respect to the curvature of the interface have been determined.}

Definitions of clusters providing a geometric interpretation of the liquid–gas phase transition are reviewed with an eye to establishing their physical relevance. The author emphasizes their main features and basic hypotheses, and shows how these definitions lead to a recent approach based on self-bound clusters. Although theoretical, this tutorial review is also addressed to readers interested in experimental aspects of clustering in simple fluids.}

abstract = {We review the recent progress in extracting the equation of state of hot dense hadronic matter from relativistic heavy ion collisions. At first a discussion of the bulk properties of infinite nuclear matter is presented. Next the theoretical approaches are developed which describe the complicated dynamics and non-equilibrium features in actual high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions: Nuclear fluid dynamics, the intranuclear cascade model, classical equation of motion simulations, the Vlasov Uehling-Uhlenbeck theory and the time dependent Dirac equation with meson field dynamics are exhibited. The recent experimental confirmation of the early hydrodynamic predictions on nuclear shock compression establishes the key mechanism for creating high nuclear density and temperatures in the laboratory, and thus the key mechanism for investigating the nuclear equation of state. Evidence for a suprisingly stiff nuclear equation of state is presented from a comparison of the distinct theoretical predictions to recent high multiplicity selected 4π data on fragment formation, pion production and collective sidewards flow. We also discuss the possible creation of a deconfined quark gluon plasma at future ultra-relativistic heavy ion facilities.}

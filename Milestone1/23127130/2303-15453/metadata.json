    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for training an agent to actively request help in object-goal navigation tasks, with feedback indicating the location of the target object in its field of view. To make the agent more robust in scenarios where a teacher may not always be available, the proposed training curriculum includes a mix of episodes with and without feedback. The results show that this approach improves the agent's performance, even in the absence of feedback.",

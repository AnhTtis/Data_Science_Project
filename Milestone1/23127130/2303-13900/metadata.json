    "abstract": "Learning based single image super resolution (SISR) task is well investigated in 2D images. However, SISR for 3D Magnetics Resonance Images (MRI) is more challenging compared to 2D, mainly due to the increased number of neural network parameters, the larger memory requirement and the limited amount of available training data. Current SISR methods for 3D volumetric images are based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), especially Wasserstein GANs due to their training stability. Other common architectures in the 2D domain, e.g. transformer models, require large amounts of training data and are therefore not suitable for the limited 3D data. However, Wasserstein GANs can be problematic because they may not converge to a global optimum and thus produce blurry results. Here, we propose a new method for 3D SR based on the GAN framework. Specifically, we use instance noise to balance the GAN training. Furthermore, we use a relativistic GAN loss function and an updating feature extractor during the training process. We show that our method produces highly accurate results. We also show that we need very few training samples. In particular, we need less than 30 samples instead of thousands of training samples that are typically required in previous studies. Finally, we show improved out-of-sample results produced by our model.",

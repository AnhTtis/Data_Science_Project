In contrast to the original Kennel-Petschek formulation, we carry out a fully relativistic analysis. In addition, we replace the wave reflection criterion in the Kennel-Petschek theory by the condition that the limit on the stably trapped particle flux is attained in the steady state condition of marginal stability when electromagnetic waves generated at the magnetic equator acquire a specified gain over a given convective growth length. We derive relativistic formulae for the limiting electron integral and differential fluxes for a general planetary radiation belt at a given L shell. The formulae depend explicitly on the spectral index and pitch angle index of the assumed particle distribution and on the ratio of the electron gyrofrequency to the electron plasma frequency. We compare the theoretical limits on the trapped flux with observed energetic electron fluxes at Earth, Jupiter, and Uranus.},

abstract = {We present a ray tracing study on the propagation characteristic of the superluminous wave modes (R–X, L–O) that are generated as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) in the Earth's magnetosphere by using a cavity plasma density model and a global core plasma density model. Numerical calculations have been performed for the two modes which originate at three altitudes, r = 1.0, 1.5, and 2 RE in the source cavity along a 70° night field line. We show that the propagation characteristic of the R–X and the L–O modes is found to be essentially controlled by the source cavity position and the plasmapause position, in particular because the reflection occurs at the sharp density edges of the two positions. During high geomagnetic activity (e.g., Kp = 6, where Kp is the geomagnetic activity index), the plasmapause position moves inward, closer to the Earth, the R–X and L–O modes can propagate downward and even through the equatorial plane in the radiation belts under appropriate conditions, since no reflection occurs. However, during low geomagnetic activity (e.g., Kp = 2), both modes basically propagate at higher latitudes because of the reflection in the vicinity of the plasmapause and the source cavity. Furthermore, as the wave frequency or the originated altitude is higher, the reflection becomes weaker, and correspondingly the AKR observational latitude is lower. The wave damping along the ray path is found to be substantially small, primarily because high resonant energies will occur, while specifically Landau damping will not for the electrons in gyroresonance with superluminous waves. The results above provide a new insight into the propagation characteristic of R–X and L–O modes and predict that the two modes may be physically present in the radiation belts of the Earth particularly during strong geomagnetic activities. This needs to be further supplemented by observational analysis.},

abstract = {Superluminous auroral kilometric radiation originates in the auroral cavity of the Earth's magnetosphere as right-hand extraordinary (R-X) mode emissions, with additional contributions from the left-hand ordinary (L-O) and left-hand extraordinary (L-X) modes. The three modes can propagate into the outer radiation belt and undergo gyroresonant interaction with trapped energetic electrons over a broad extent of the outer magnetosphere. We develop a general theory of quasi-linear diffusion and construct resonant diffusion curves in velocity space for each superluminous wave mode. The potential for stochastic electron acceleration is controlled by the dispersive properties of the waves and the ratio between the electron gyrofrequency and plasma frequency. It is found that each of the R-X, L-O, and L-X modes can produce significant acceleration of electrons over individual regions of parameter space. The L-O mode is found to have the potential for accelerating electrons from ∼10 keV to ∼MeV energies, over a broad range of wave normal angles, in spatial regions extending from the auroral cavity to the high-latitude (>30°) outer radiation belt. The R-X mode appears to be less effective for accelerating magnetospheric electrons, since acceleration to significant energies (∼MeV) requires very small wave normal angles (<10°). The potential for significant electron acceleration in the magnetosphere by L-X mode waves is restricted not least by the requirement of high minimum energies, e.g., 400 keV in the outer radiation belt. To assess whether the superluminous wave modes contribute significantly to the stochastic acceleration of relativistic electrons during geomagnetic storms, the present study needs to be supplemented by ray-tracing analyses and the calculation of energy diffusion coefficients incorporating data on wave power.},

The basic physics of thermal conduction in plasmas with ICM-like conditions has yet to be elucidated, however. We use particle-in-cell simulations and analytic models to explore the dynamics of an ICM-like plasma (with small gyroradius, large mean free path, and strongly sub-dominant magnetic pressure) driven by the diffusive heat flux associated with thermal conduction. Linear theory reveals that whistler waves are driven unstable by electron heat flux, even when the heat flux is weak. The resonant interaction of electrons with these waves then plays a critical role in scattering electrons and suppressing the heat flux. In a 1D model where only whistler modes that are parallel to the magnetic field are captured, the only resonant electrons are moving in the opposite direction to the heat flux, and the electron heat flux suppression is small. In 2D or more, oblique whistler modes also resonate with electrons moving in the direction of the heat flux. The overlap of resonances leads to effective symmetrization of the electron distribution function and a strong suppression of heat flux. The results suggest that thermal conduction in the ICM might be strongly suppressed, possibly to negligible levels.}

For 54.5 spacecraft years of measurements the median value of n is 3.7 × 10−4 cm−3, and the median value of T is 148 keV. General statistical properties of n, T, and the 1.1–1.5 MeV flux F are investigated, including local-time and solar-cycle dependencies. Using superposed-epoch analysis where the zero epoch is convection onset, the evolution of the outer electron radiation belt through high-speed-stream-driven storms is investigated. The number-density decay during the calm before the storm, relativistic-electron dropouts and recoveries, and the heating of the outer electron radiation belt during storms are analyzed. Using four different “triggers” (sudden storm commencement (SSC), southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) portions of coronal mass ejection (CME) sheaths, southward-IMF portions of magnetic clouds, and minimum Dst) a selection of CME-driven storms are analyzed with superposed-epoch techniques. For CME-driven storms, only a very modest density decay prior to storm onset is found. In addition, the compression of the outer electron radiation belt at the time of SSC is analyzed, the number-density increase and temperature decrease during storm main phase are characterized, and the increase in density and temperature during storm recovery phase is determined. During the different phases of storms, changes in the flux are sometimes in response to changes in the temperature, sometimes to changes in the number density, and sometimes to changes in both. Differences are found between the density-temperature and flux descriptions, and it is concluded that more information is available using the density-temperature description.},

abstract = {Abstract Decades of in situ observations of whistler mode waves in Earth's magnetosphere reveal that there is frequently a gap in the spectral power at around half the local electron gyrofrequency. Recent theoretical and kinetic simulation studies have suggested that the gap arises due to the presence of temperature anisotropy in both a “warm” and a “hot” electron population, leading to two separate (and independent) regions of wave growth in frequency space. We present two-dimensional kinetic plasma simulations using the powerful EPOCH (Extendable PIC Open Collaboration) particle-in-cell code that offer an alternative explanation. After an initial linear-growth period, our simulations show self-consistent formation of a gap feature. In most cases this arises where linear theory predicts the maximum growth rate and is associated with subtle local structuring of the hot electron distributions. This feature persists in multiple simulations with varying hot electron parameters. We discuss these results in the context of in situ observations of both waves and electron distribution functions and argue that the rapid reorganization of electron distributions in a small, but key, region of phase space during the growth of whistler mode waves naturally results in the spectral gap often observed at half the electron gyrofrequency.},

abstract = {AbstractELF/VLF waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of the radiation belts and are partly responsible for the main losses and the acceleration of energetic electrons. Modeling wave-particle interactions requires detailed information of wave amplitudes and wave normal distribution over L-shells and over magnetic latitudes for different geomagnetic activity conditions. We performed a statistical study of ELF/VLF emissions using wave measurements in the whistler frequency range for 10 years (2001–2010) aboard Cluster spacecraft. We utilized data from the STAFF-SA experiment, which spans the frequency range from 8 Hz to 4 kHz. We present distributions of wave magnetic and electric field amplitudes and wave normal directions as functions of magnetic latitude, magnetic local time, L-shell, and geomagnetic activity. We show that wave normals are directed approximately along the background magnetic field (with the mean value of θ—the angle between the wave normal and the background magnetic field, about 10°–15°) in the vicinity of the geomagnetic equator. The distribution changes with magnetic latitude: Plasmaspheric hiss normal angles increase with latitude to quasi-perpendicular direction at ∼35°–40° where hiss can be reflected; lower band chorus are observed as two wave populations: One population of wave normals tends toward the resonance cone and at latitudes of around 35°–45° wave normals become nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field; the other part remains quasi-parallel at latitudes up to 30°. The observed angular distribution is significantly different from Gaussian, and the width of the distribution increases with latitude. Due to the rapid increase of θ, the wave mode becomes quasi-electrostatic, and the corresponding electric field increases with latitude and has a maximum near 30°. The magnetic field amplitude of the chorus in the day sector has a minimum at the magnetic equator but increases rapidly with latitude with a local maximum near 12°–15°. The wave magnetic field maximum is observed in the night sector at L>7 during low geomagnetic activity (at L∼5 for Kp>3). Our results confirm the strong dependence of wave amplitude on geomagnetic activity found in earlier studies.},

Full measurements of the wave electric and magnetic fields are used to calculate the Poynting fluxes and construct the wave normal vectors, which are then used to calculate the polar and azimuthal angles with respect to the background magnetic field. Statistical results show that the majority of whistler-mode waves propagate away from the magnetic equator, suggesting that the major source region is very close to the equator. The lower band wave normal angle distribution shows a major peak close to the field line direction and a secondary peak near the resonance cone. In contrast, the wave normal distribution of upper band waves exhibits a broad distribution between 0° and 60° with the largest probability at ~0°. The azimuthal component of the wave normal vector predominantly points radially outward for both lower and upper band waves, but a tendency for azimuthal propagation is observed for lower band waves in the day and dusk sectors probably due to pronounced azimuthal density gradients in the afternoon sector. Our statistical results provide crucial information on the Poynting fluxes and wave normal vectors of whistler-mode waves, which play a significant role in radiation belt electron dynamics.},

abstract = {We introduce a new methodology that allows the construction of wave frequency distributions due to growing incoherent whistler-mode waves in the magnetosphere. The technique combines the equations of geometric optics (i.e., raytracing) with the equation of transfer of radiation in an anisotropic lossy medium to obtain spectral energy density as a function of frequency and wavenormal angle. We describe the method in detail and then demonstrate how it could be used in an idealized magnetosphere during quiet geomagnetic conditions. For a specific set of plasma conditions, we predict that the wave power peaks off the equator at ∼15° magnetic latitude. The new calculations predict that wave power as a function of frequency can be adequately described using a Gaussian function, but as a function of wavenormal angle, it more closely resembles a skew normal distribution. The technique described in this paper is the first known estimate of the parallel and oblique incoherent wave spectrum as a result of growing whistler-mode waves and provides a means to incorporate self-consistent wave-particle interactions in a kinetic model of the magnetosphere over a large volume.},

abstract = {The propagation and attenuation characteristics of lower band and upper band chorus waves are investigated by ray tracing, and the evaluation of Landau damping based on an empirical suprathermal electron model derived from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) data. The rate of Landau damping is found to increase at larger L-shell, for more oblique wave normal angles, and for higher geomagnetic activity. Damping is also larger on the nightside than on the dayside and is more pronounced in the upper band than in the lower band. These features can account for the statistical pattern of chorus waves observed away from the equatorial source region. A physical model of the wave normal angle distribution along a field line is presented, which provides insight on how the wave normal angle distribution varies as chorus waves propagate away from the equatorial source region. Our modeling shows that wave emissions at low latitudes (λ ≲ 30°) come predominately from the equatorial source at the same L-shell and that their wave normal angles increase with increasing latitude due to wave refraction caused by magnetic gradients and curvature. However, at high latitudes (λ ≳ 30°), the wave normal angle distribution along a particular field line is affected by chorus waves that arrive from an equatorial source at lower L because of significant cross-L propagation. As a consequence, the lower band wave normal angle tends to decrease with increasing latitudes, while the upper band wave normal angle can either increase or decrease depending on the equatorial source at lower L. The effect of cross-L propagation might also explain why observed wave normal angle distribution tends to become more field-aligned at high latitudes. Interestingly, the upper band chorus at such high latitudes originates from lower band waves originating near the equator at lower L. A global model of wave normal variation along a field line constructed in this study is not currently available from observations but is nonetheless critically important for evaluating bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients for future radiation belt modeling.},

abstract = {Pitch angle scattering of electrons can limit the stably trapped particle flux in the magnetosphere and precipitate energetic electrons into the ionosphere. Whistler mode waves generated by a temperature anisotropy can mediate this pitch angle scattering over a wide range of radial distances and latitudes, but in order to correctly predict the phase space diffusion, it is important to characterize the whistler mode wave distributions that result from the instability. We use previously published observations of number density, pitch angle anisotropy, and phase space density to model the plasma in the quiet prenoon magnetosphere (defined as periods when AE < 100 nT). We investigate the global propagation and growth of whistler mode waves by studying millions of growing raypaths and demonstrate that the wave distribution at any one location is a superposition of many waves at different points along their trajectories and with different histories. We show that for observed electron plasma properties, very few raypaths undergo magnetospheric reflection; most rays grow and decay within 30 degrees of the magnetic equator. The frequency range of the wave distribution at large L can be adequately described by the solutions of the local dispersion relation, but the range of wave normal angle is different. The wave distribution is asymmetric with respect to the wave normal angle. The numerical results suggest that it is important to determine the variation of magnetospheric parameters as a function of latitude, as well as local time and L-shell.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a model to describe the generalized wave–particle instability in a quasi-neutral plasma. We analyze the quasi-linear diffusion equation for particles by expressing an arbitrary unstable and resonant wave mode as a Gaussian wave packet, allowing for an arbitrary direction of propagation with respect to the background magnetic field. We show that the localized energy density of the Gaussian wave packet determines the velocity-space range in which the dominant wave–particle instability and counteracting damping contributions are effective. Moreover, we derive a relation describing the diffusive trajectories of resonant particles in velocity space under the action of such an interplay between the wave–particle instability and damping. For the numerical computation of our theoretical model, we develop a mathematical approach based on the Crank–Nicolson scheme to solve the full quasi-linear diffusion equation. Our numerical analysis solves the time evolution of the velocity distribution function under the action of a dominant wave–particle instability and counteracting damping and shows a good agreement with our theoretical description. As an application, we use our model to study the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability, which is proposed as a scattering mechanism for strahl electrons in the solar wind. In addition, we numerically solve the full Fokker–Planck equation to compute the time evolution of the electron-strahl distribution function under the action of Coulomb collisions with core electrons and protons after the collisionless action of the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability.}

ABSTRACT={The electrons are an essential particle species in the solar wind. They often exhibit non-equilibrium features in their velocity distribution function. These include temperature anisotropies, tails (kurtosis), and reflectional asymmetries (skewness), which contribute a significant heat flux to the solar wind. If these non-equilibrium features are sufficiently strong, they drive kinetic micro-instabilities. We develop a semi-graphical framework based on the equations of quasi-linear theory to describe electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind. We apply our framework to resonant instabilities driven by temperature anisotropies. These include the electron whistler anisotropy instability and the propagating electron firehose instability. We then describe resonant instabilities driven by reflectional asymmetries in the electron distribution function. These include the electron/ion-acoustic, kinetic Alfvén heat-flux, Langmuir, electron-beam, electron/ion-cyclotron, electron/electron-acoustic, whistler heat-flux, oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler, lower-hybrid fan, and electron-deficit whistler instability. We briefly comment on non-resonant instabilities driven by electron temperature anisotropies such as the mirror-mode and the non-propagating firehose instability. We conclude our review with a list of open research topics in the field of electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Observations of solar wind electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) reveal pronounced deviations from a Maxwellian with enhanced numbers of suprathermal electrons. It is shown that these suprathermal tails of the electron VDFs can originate from the solar corona. A model for the acceleration of suprathermal electrons based on resonant interaction with whistler waves is presented. Quasi-linear theory describes this interaction as pitch-angle diffusion in the reference frame of the waves. The waves are assumed to be generated below the coronal base and to propagate antisunward through the corona. Under plasma conditions with high whistler wave phase speeds, the resonant interaction causes electrons to be accelerated from relatively small sunward velocities parallel to the background magnetic field to high speeds perpendicular to the magnetic field. Such plasma conditions are found in the solar corona. A kinetic model is developed to study this acceleration mechanism and the evolution of an electron VDF from the coronal base up into interplanetary space. The kinetic model includes not only the resonant interaction with whistler waves but also Coulomb collisions and the mirror force the electrons experience in the opening magnetic structure of a coronal funnel. The wave absorption of the electrons is also considered to guarantee energy conservation. Kinetic results for the coronal funnel and solar wind are presented. The electron VDFs show deviations from a Maxwellian that are in coincidence with theoretical expectations. The whistler waves generate suprathermal electrons. Toward interplanetary space, the mirror force focuses the electrons toward a narrow "strahl." A comparative study without whistler waves shows that the waves considerably enhance the suprathermal electron fluxes in interplanetary space at 1 AU, as they are observed in the solar wind.}

abstract = {Abstract Characterizing the location of the outer boundary of the outer radiation belt is a key aspect of improving radiation belt models and helps to constrain our understanding of the mechanisms by which the source and seed electron populations are transported into the radiation belts. In this paper, we hypothesize that there are statistical differences in the electron distribution function across the radiation belt outer boundary, and thus analyze electron flux data from the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) satellites to identify this location. We validate our hypothesis by using modeled electron L* values to approximately characterize the differences between electron distribution functions inside and outside of the radiation belts. Initially, we perform a simple statistical analysis by studying the radial evolution of the electron distribution functions. This approach does not yield a clear discontinuity, thus highlighting the need for more complex statistical treatment of the data. Subsequently, we employ machine learning (with no dependence on radial position or L*) to test a range of candidate outer boundary locations. By analyzing the performance of the models at each candidate location, we identify a statistical boundary at ≈8 RE, with results suggesting some variability. This statistical boundary is typically further out than those used in current radiation belt models.},

Using pitch angle–resolved fluxes in the range 30 keV to 1.7 MeV, the evolution of the outer electron radiation belt and the suprathermal tail of the electron plasma sheet are studied. The outer electron radiation belt exhibits perpendicular-dominated anisotropies on the dayside and parallel-dominated anisotropies on the nightside consistent with shell splitting in a distorted magnetosphere. The magnitudes of the radiation-belt anisotropies are weak prior to storm onset and become very large during the storms. The magnitudes of the anisotropies lessen with time as the storm ages and the radiation belt heats, probably owing to a weakening of the magnetic field distortion as the storm ages. When a calm before the storm occurs, the dayside radiation belt approaches isotropy, probably owing to pitch angle scattering in the outer plasmasphere that fills during the calm. If no calm before the storm occurs, the dayside radiation belt is strongly perpendicular dominated. The local-time pattern of anisotropy in storms is very different for the suprathermal tail of the electron plasma sheet, which tends to be perpendicular on the nightside and isotropic elsewhere. The magnitudes of the anisotropies of the suprathermal tail are a factor of ∼10 weaker than the anisotropies of the outer electron radiation belt.},

Here we present a new diffusion matrix for whistler mode chorus waves that can be used in such models. Data from seven satellites are used to construct 3536 power spectra for upper and lower band chorus for 1.5≤L∗≤10 MLT, magnetic latitude 0°≤|λm|≤60° and five levels of Kp. Five density models are also constructed from the data. Gaussian functions are fitted to the spectra and capture typically 90\% of the wave power. The frequency maxima of the power spectra vary with L∗ and are typically lower than that used previously. Lower band chorus diffusion increases with geomagnetic activity and is largest between 21:00 and 12:00 MLT. Energy diffusion extends to a few megaelectron volts at large pitch angles >60° and at high energies exceeds pitch angle diffusion at the loss cone. Most electron diffusion occurs close to the geomagnetic equator (<12°). Pitch angle diffusion rates for lower band chorus increase with L∗ and are significant at L∗=8 even for low levels of geomagnetic activity, while upper band chorus is restricted to mainly L∗<6. The combined drift and bounce averaged diffusion rates for upper and lower band chorus extend from a few kiloelectron volts near the loss cone up to several megaelectron volts at large pitch angles indicating loss at low energies and net acceleration at high energies.},

abstract = {Abstract In the outer radiation belt, the acceleration and loss of high-energy electrons is largely controlled by wave-particle interactions. Quasilinear diffusion coefficients are an efficient way to capture the small-scale physics of wave-particle interactions due to magnetospheric wave modes such as plasmaspheric hiss. The strength of quasilinear diffusion coefficients as a function of energy and pitch angle depends on both wave parameters and plasma parameters such as ambient magnetic field strength, plasma number density, and composition. For plasmaspheric hiss in the magnetosphere, observations indicate large variations in the wave intensity and wave normal angle, but less is known about the simultaneous variability of the magnetic field and number density. We use in situ measurements from the Van Allen Probe mission to demonstrate the variability of selected factors that control the size and shape of pitch angle diffusion coefficients: wave intensity, magnetic field strength, and electron number density. We then compare with the variability of diffusion coefficients calculated individually from colocated and simultaneous groups of measurements. We show that the distribution of the plasmaspheric hiss diffusion coefficients is highly non-Gaussian with large variance and that the distributions themselves vary strongly across the three phase space bins studied. In most bins studied, the plasmaspheric hiss diffusion coefficients tend to increase with geomagnetic activity, but our results indicate that new approaches that include natural variability may yield improved parameterizations. We suggest methods like stochastic parameterization of wave-particle interactions could use variability information to improve modeling of the outer radiation belt.},

Using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms waveform data collected by three probes over the past ~5 years, we investigate the correlation between Nh/Nt and wave amplitude/wave occurrence rate for rising tone, falling tone, and hiss-like emissions separately. Statistical results show that the rising and falling tones preferentially occur in the region with a limited Nh/Nt range, whereas both the occurrence rate and wave amplitudes of hiss-like emissions become larger for higher values of Nh/Nt. Our statistical results not only provide an important clue on the generation mechanism of hiss-like emissions, but also provide supporting experimental evidence for the nonlinear theory of generating rising tone chorus.},

abstract = {Whistler mode noise leads to electron pitch angle diffusion. Similarly, ion cyclotron noise couples to ions. This diffusion results in particle precipitation into the ionosphere and creates a pitch angle distributon of trapped particles that is unstable to further wave growth. Since excessive wave growth leads to rapid diffusion and particle loss, the requirement that the growth rate be limited to the rate at which wave energy is depleted by wave propagation permits an estimate of an upper limit to the trapped equatorial particle flux. Electron fluxes >40 kev and proton fluxes >120 kev observed on Explorers 14 and 12, respectively, obey this limit with occasional exceptions. Beyond L = 4, the fluxes are just below their limit, indicating that an unspecified acceleration source, sufficient to keep the trapped particles near their precipitation limit, exists. Limiting proton and electron fluxes are roughly equal, suggesting a partial explanation for the existence of larger densities of high-energy protons than of electrons. Observed electron pitch angle profiles correspond to a diffusion coefficient in agreement with observed lifetimes. The required equatorial whistler mode wide band noise intensity, 10−2γ, is not obviously inconsistent with observations and is consistent with the lifetime and with limiting trapped particle intensity.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {In the solar-wind plasma an excess of kinetic temperature along the background magnetic field stimulates proton firehose modes to grow if the parallel plasma beta parameter is sufficiently high, i.e., β  p∥ ≳ 1. This instability can prevent the expansion-driven anisotropy from increasing indefinitely and explain the observations. Moreover, such kinetic instabilities are expected to be even more effective in the presence of suprathermal Kappa-distributed populations, which are ubiquitous in the solar wind and are less affected by collisions than the core population but contribute with an additional free energy. In this work we use both linear and extended quasi-linear (QL) frameworks to characterize the unstable periodic proton firehose modes (propagating parallel to the magnetic field) under the influence of suprathermal protons. Linear theory predicts a systematic stimulation of the instability, suprathermals amplifying the growth rates and decreasing the instability thresholds to lower anisotropies and lower plasma betas (β  p∥ &lt; 1). In perfect agreement with these results, the QL approach reveals a significant enhancement of the resulting electromagnetic fluctuations up to saturation with a stronger back reaction on protons, leading also to a faster and more efficient relaxation of the temperature anisotropy.}

abstract = {We calculate, by a perturbation analysis, the energy and momentum changes both of a single particle and of a distribution of particles moving in a transverse electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to the direction of the average magnetic field. It is shown that energy and momentum conservation of the particles and of the electromagnetic field leads to the same dispersion relation as has been obtained by Stix (1962) from solution of the Vlasov equation. More importantly, we are able to discuss the transfer of energy and momentum between particles and fields, in the context of stability or instability of the plasma. We emphasize that it is generally not sufficient to attempt to deduce the stability properties of a plasma from considerations of the energy gained or lost by the resonant particles alone. In general, one must also consider the additional constraint of momentum conservation and the effects of the nonresonant particles; this conclusion persists even in the limit of zero growth rate, when the resonant particles would be expected to play the dominant role. Two illustrations are provided. The real part of the frequency of the fire-hose instability is shown to be determined by momentum conservation, whereas the growth rate follows from energy conservation. For the new proton-resonant modes (Hollweg and Völk, 1970b), on the other hand, we find that the growth rate follows from momentum conservation, whereas energy conservation yields the real part of the frequency. We show that the earlier classification of the proton-resonant modes in accord with the sign of (Ap±ωr/Ωp) is, in fact, a classification assigned in accord with the gain or loss of energy by the protons. The small-wavelength extension of the fire hose leads to absorption of energy by the protons, and this mode could simultaneously cool the electrons and heat the protons in the solar wind near 1 AU; the other two proton-resonant modes lead to loss of energy by the protons and would aggravate the discrepancy between the two-fluid solar-wind model and observation. Finally, it is shown that the small-wavelength extension of the fire hose tends to reduce solar-wind proton thermal anisotropies to the observed values only for frequencies less than about 4Ωp, whereas the other proton-resonant instabilities lead in all instances to reduction of the anisotropy.},

title = {TWO-STREAM-LIKE INSTABILITY IN DILUTE HOT RELATIVISTIC BEAMS AND ASTROPHYSICAL RELATIVISTIC SHOCKS},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Relativistic collisionless shocks are believed to be efficient particle accelerators. Nonlinear outcome of the interaction of accelerated particles that run ahead of the shock, the so-called precursor, with the unperturbed plasma of the shock upstream, is thought to facilitate additional acceleration of these particles and to possibly modify the hydrodynamic structure of the shock. We explore here the linear growth of kinetic modes appearing in the precursor–upstream interaction in relativistic shocks propagating in non- and weakly magnetized plasmas: electrostatic two-stream parallel mode and electrostatic oblique modes. The physics of the parallel and oblique modes is similar, and thus, we refer to the entire spectrum of electrostatic modes as “two-stream-like.” These modes are of particular interest because they are the fastest growing modes known in this type of system. Using a simplified distribution function for a dilute ultrarelativistic beam that is relativistically hot in its own rest frame, yet has momenta that are narrowly collimated in the frame of the cold upstream plasma into which it propagates, we identify the fastest growing mode in the full k-space and calculate its growth rate. We consider all types of plasma (pairs and ions–electrons) and beam (charged and charge–neutral). We find that unstable electrostatic modes are present in any type of plasma and for any shock parameters. We further find that two modes, one parallel (k⊥ = 0) and the other one oblique (), are competing for dominance and that either one may dominate the growth rate in different regions of the phase space. The dominant mode is determined mostly by the perpendicular spread of the accelerated particle momenta in the upstream frame, which reflects the shock Lorentz factor. The parallel mode becomes more dominant in shocks with lower Lorentz factors (i.e., with larger momentum spreads). We briefly discuss possible implications of our results for external shocks in gamma-ray burst sources.}

title = {The microphysics of collisionless shock waves},

abstract = {Collisionless shocks, that is shocks mediated by electromagnetic processes, are customary in space physics and in astrophysics. They are to be found in a great variety of objects and environments: magnetospheric and heliospheric shocks, supernova remnants, pulsar winds and their nebulæ, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts and clusters of galaxies shock waves. Collisionless shock microphysics enters at different stages of shock formation, shock dynamics and particle energization and/or acceleration. It turns out that the shock phenomenon is a multi-scale non-linear problem in time and space. It is complexified by the impact due to high-energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments. This review adresses the physics of shock formation, shock dynamics and particle acceleration based on a close examination of available multi-wavelength or in situ observations, analytical and numerical developments. A particular emphasis is made on the different instabilities triggered during the shock formation and in association with particle acceleration processes with regards to the properties of the background upstream medium. It appears that among the most important parameters the background magnetic field through the magnetization and its obliquity is the dominant one. The shock velocity that can reach relativistic speeds has also a strong impact over the development of the micro-instabilities and the fate of particle acceleration. Recent developments of laboratory shock experiments has started to bring some new insights in the physics of space plasma and astrophysical shock waves. A special section is dedicated to new laser plasma experiments probing shock physics.}

ABSTRACT={Turbulence in space plasmas usually exhibits two regimes separated by a spectral break that divides the so called inertial and kinetic ranges. Large scale magnetic fluctuations are dominated by non-linear MHD wave-wave interactions following a −5/3 or −2 slope power-law spectrum. After the break, at scales in which kinetic effects take place, the magnetic spectrum follows a steeper power-law k<sup>−α</sup> shape given by a spectral index α > 5/3. Despite its ubiquitousness, the possible effects of a turbulent background spectrum in the quasilinear relaxation of solar wind temperatures are usually not considered. In this work, a quasilinear kinetic theory is used to study the evolution of the proton temperatures in an initially turbulent collisionless plasma composed by cold electrons and bi-Maxwellian protons, in which electromagnetic waves propagate along a background magnetic field. Four wave spectrum shapes are compared with different levels of wave intensity. We show that a sufficient turbulent magnetic power can drive stable protons to transverse heating, resulting in an increase in the temperature anisotropy and the reduction of the parallel proton beta. Thus, stable proton velocity distribution can evolve in such a way as to develop kinetic instabilities. This may explain why the constituents of the solar wind can be observed far from thermodynamic equilibrium and near the instability thresholds.}

abstract = {Whistler waves are intermittently present in the solar wind, while their origin and effects are not entirely understood. We present a statistical analysis of magnetic field fluctuations in the whistler frequency range (above 16 Hz) based on about 801,500 magnetic field spectra measured over 3 yr aboard the Artemis spacecraft in the pristine solar wind. About 13,700 spectra (30 hr in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the interpretation in terms of quasi-parallel whistler waves. We provide estimates of the whistler wave occurrence probability, amplitudes, frequencies, and bandwidths. The occurrence probability of whistler waves is shown to strongly depend on the electron temperature anisotropy. The whistler wave amplitudes are in the range from about 0.01 to 0.1 nT and typically below 0.02 of the background magnetic field. The frequencies of the whistler waves are shown to be below an upper bound that is dependent on βe. The correlations established between the whistler wave properties and local macroscopic plasma parameters suggest that the observed whistler waves can be generated in local plasmas by the whistler heat flux instability. The whistler wave amplitudes are typically small, which questions the hypothesis that quasi-parallel whistler waves are capable to regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind. We show that the observed whistler waves have sufficiently wide bandwidths and small amplitudes, so that effects of the whistler waves on electrons can be addressed in the frame of the quasi-linear theory.}

abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of electron heat flux inhibition in the solar wind when a significant portion of the heat flux is carried by strahl electrons. We adopt core-strahl velocity distribution functions typical for the solar wind at 0.3–4 au to demonstrate that strahl electrons are capable of generating highly oblique whistler waves at wave numbers kρe ∼ 1, where ρe is typical thermal electron gyroradius. The whistler waves are driven by electrons in the anomalous cyclotron resonances (the fan instability) and propagate at typical angles of about 70°–80° to the strahl that is usually anti-sunward. The group velocity of the whistler waves is predominantly parallel to the strahl, thereby facilitating efficient scattering of strahl electrons. We suggest that the highly oblique whistler waves drive pitch-angle scattering of strahl electrons, resulting in halo formation and suppressing the heat flux of strahl electrons below a threshold that is shown to depend on βe. The proposed fan instability is fundamentally different from the whistler heat flux instability driven by the normal cyclotron resonance with halo electrons and being ineffective in suppressing the heat flux of the strahl.}

We develop a mathematical framework for the description of electron-driven microinstabilities and discuss the associated physical mechanisms. We find that an instability of the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) mode is the best candidate for a microinstability that scatters strahl electrons into the halo. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the FM/W instability threshold in two different βc regimes, where βc is the ratio of the core electrons’ thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure, and confirm the accuracy of these thresholds through comparison with numerical solutions to the hot-plasma dispersion relation. We find that the strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability creates copious FM/W waves under low-βc conditions when , where U0s is the strahl speed and wc is the thermal speed of the core electrons. These waves have a frequency of about half the local electron gyrofrequency. We also derive an analytic expression for the oblique FM/W instability for βc ∼ 1. The comparison of our theoretical results with data from the Wind spacecraft confirms the relevance of the oblique FM/W instability for the solar wind. The whistler heat-flux, ion-acoustic heat-flux, kinetic-Alfvén-wave heat-flux, and electrostatic electron-beam instabilities cannot fulfill the requirements for self-induced scattering of strahl electrons into the halo. We make predictions for the electron strahl close to the Sun, which will be tested by measurements from Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.}

The oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) instability has emerged in the literature as a key candidate mechanism for the effective scattering of the electron strahl into the electron halo population. Using data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Helios, we compare the measured strahl properties with the analytical thresholds for the oblique FM/W instability in the low- and high-β ∥c  regimes, where β ∥c  is the ratio of the core parallel thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure. Our PSP and Helios data show that the electron strahl is on average stable against the oblique FM/W instability in the inner heliosphere. Our analysis suggests that the instability, if at all, can only be excited sporadically and on short timescales. We discuss the caveats of our analysis and potential alternative explanations for the observed scattering of the electron strahl in the solar wind. Furthermore, we recommend the numerical evaluation of the stability of individual distributions in the future to account for any uncertainties in the validity of the analytical expressions for the instability thresholds.}

The plasma density calculated from the spacecraft potential, together with in situ magnetic field, is used to construct global maps of cyclotron and Landau resonant energies under quiet, moderate, and active geomagnetic conditions. Statistical results show that chorus intensity increases at higher AE index, with the strongest waves confined to regions where the ratio between the plasma frequency and gyrofrequency, fpe/fce, is less than 5. On the nightside, large electron anisotropies and intense chorus emissions indicate remarkable consistency with the confinement to 8 RE. Furthermore, as injected plasma sheet electrons drift from midnight through dawn toward the noon sector, their anisotropy increases and peaks on the dayside at 7 < L < 9, which is well correlated with intense chorus emissions observed in the prenoon sector. These statistical results are generally consistent with the generation of both lower-band and upper-band chorus through cyclotron resonant interactions with suprathermal electrons (1–100 keV). Two typical events on the nightside and dayside are studied in greater detail and additional interesting features are identified. Pancake distributions of electrons with energy below ∼2 keV, which could be responsible for the excitation of upper-band chorus, are observed at lower L shells (<7) on the nightside and at larger L shells (>6) on the dayside. In addition, very isotropic distributions at a few keV, which may be produced by Landau resonance and contribute to the formation of the typical gap in the chorus spectrum near 0.5 fce, are commonly observed on the dayside.},

Here, we show how the dynamics of these electrons are clearly separated by energy into two distinct populations which are governed by different storm time behavior. We reveal how self-limiting processes, described theoretically by Kennel and Petschek (1966), https://doi.org/10.1029/JZ071i001p00001, govern the energy-dependent dynamics of the electrons. For terrestrial magnetic storms, accelerated electrons with energies below 850 keV quickly reach a maximum energy-dependent differential flux level which is almost the same in every storm. Higher energy electrons typically do not reach a limiting flux and instead are governed by the differential impacts of competing acceleration and loss mechanisms. In general, electron fluxes saturate at the Kennel-Petschek limit first at lower energies, impacting higher energies later in the storm. For the most intense storms, the maximum energy at which the fluxes are capped can also increase.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {An ion beam can destabilize Alfvén/ion-cyclotron waves and magnetosonic/whistler waves if the beam speed is sufficiently large. Numerical solutions of the hot-plasma dispersion relation have previously shown that the minimum beam speed required to excite such instabilities is significantly smaller for oblique modes with k × B0 ≠ 0 than for parallel-propagating modes with k × B0 = 0, where k is the wavevector and B0 is the background magnetic field. In this paper, we explain this difference within the framework of quasilinear theory, focusing on low-β plasmas. We begin by deriving, in the cold-plasma approximation, the dispersion relation and polarization properties of both oblique and parallel-propagating waves in the presence of an ion beam. We then show how the instability thresholds of the different wave branches can be deduced from the wave–particle resonance condition, the conservation of particle energy in the wave frame, the sign (positive or negative) of the wave energy, and the wave polarization. We also provide a graphical description of the different conditions under which Landau resonance and cyclotron resonance destabilize Alfvén/ion-cyclotron waves in the presence of an ion beam. We draw upon our results to discuss the types of instabilities that may limit the differential flow of alpha particles in the solar wind.}

title = {Whistler Waves as a Signature of Converging Magnetic Holes in Space Plasmas},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Magnetic holes are plasma structures that trap a large number of particles in a magnetic field that is weaker than the field in its surroundings. The unprecedented high time-resolution observations by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission enable us to study the particle dynamics in magnetic holes in the Earth’s magnetosheath in great detail. We reveal the local generation mechanism of whistler waves by a combination of Landau-resonant and cyclotron-resonant wave–particle interactions of electrons in response to the large-scale evolution of a magnetic hole. As the magnetic hole converges, a pair of counter-streaming electron beams form near the hole’s center as a consequence of the combined action of betatron and Fermi effects. The beams trigger the generation of slightly oblique whistler waves. Our conceptual prediction is supported by a remarkable agreement between our observations and numerical predictions from the Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver. Our study shows that wave–particle interactions are fundamental to the evolution of magnetic holes in space and astrophysical plasmas.}

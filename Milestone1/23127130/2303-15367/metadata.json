    "abstract": "We analyse uniformly random proper $k$-colourings of sparse graphs with maximum degree $Δ$ in the regime $Δ< k\\ln k $. This regime corresponds to the lower side of the shattering threshold for random graph colouring, a paradigmatic example of the shattering threshold for random Constraint Satisfaction Problems. We prove a variety of results about the solution space geometry of colourings of fixed graphs, generalising work of Achlioptas, Coja-Oghlan, and Molloy on random graphs, and justifying the performance of stochastic local search algorithms in this regime. Our central proof relies only on elementary techniques, namely the first-moment method and a quantitative induction, yet it strengthens list-colouring results due to Vu, and more recently Davies, Kang, P., and Sereni, and generalises state-of-the-art bounds from Ramsey theory in the context of sparse graphs. It further yields an approximately tight lower bound on the number of colourings, also known as the partition function of the Potts model, with implications for efficient approximate counting.",

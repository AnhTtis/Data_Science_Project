    "abstract": "We compute the pressure, chiral condensate and strange quark number susceptibility from first principles within perturbative QCD at finite temperature and very high magnetic fields up to next-to-leading order and physical quark masses. The region of validity for our framework is given by $m_s \\ll T \\ll \\sqrt{eB}$, where $m_s$ is the strange quark mass, $e$ is the fundamental electric charge, $T$ is the temperature, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength. We study the convergence of the perturbative series for the pressure for different choices of renormalization scale in the running coupling, $α_s (T,B)$. Our results for the chiral condensate and strange quark number susceptibility can be directly compared to recent lattice QCD data away from the chiral transition. Even though current lattice results do not overlap with the region of validity above, perturbative results seem to be in the same ballpark.",

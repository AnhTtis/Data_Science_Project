    "abstract": "Let $p, q$ be distinct primes, with $p > 2$. In a previous paper we classified the Hopf-Galois structures on Galois extensions of degree $p^{2} q$, when the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the Galois group are cyclic. This is equivalent to classifying the skew braces of order $p^2q$, for which the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the multiplicative group is cyclic. In this paper we complete the classification by dealing with the case when the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the Galois group are elementary abelian.\n  According to Greither and Pareigis, and Byott, we will do this by classifying the regular subgroups of the holomorphs of the groups $(G, \\cdot)$ of order $p^{2} q$, in the case when the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are elementary abelian.\n  We rely on the use of certain gamma functions $γ:G\\to \\operatorname{Aut}(G)$. These functions are in one-to-one correspondence with the regular subgroups of the holomorph of $G$, and are characterised by the functional equation $γ(g^{γ(h)} \\cdot h) = γ(g) γ(h)$, for $g, h \\in G$. We develop methods to deal with these functions, with the aim of making their enumeration easier and more conceptual.",

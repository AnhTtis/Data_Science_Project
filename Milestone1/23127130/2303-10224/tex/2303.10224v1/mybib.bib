abstract = {Various developments have taken place in Garfield over the last 2 years: the limitation to analytic potentials and 2-dimensional geometries is being lifted via interfaces with finite element programs such as [1]; detailed calculations of the electrostatic wire movements have been added; cluster generation has been enhanced considerably thanks to an interface with the Heed program [2]and considerable effort has been put into the improvement of signal calculations. I will illustrate these points with calculations carried out by the researchers for whom these extensions were made.}

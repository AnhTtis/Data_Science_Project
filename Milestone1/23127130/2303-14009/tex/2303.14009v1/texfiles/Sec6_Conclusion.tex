\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we developed {\poisonedgnn} the first backdoor attack against GNNs processing digital circuits. 
An adversary can embed a crafted sub-circuit (backdoor trigger) to some training circuits and alter their labels to an attacker-chosen target label. 
As a result, the GNN trained on the backdoored dataset is forced to associate the backdoor trigger with the target label beneficial to the attacker. 
To demonstrate this alarming vulnerability of GNNs, we consider two case studies of (i)~hiding hardware Trojans (HTs) and (ii)~intellectual property (IP) piracy. 
Through {\poisonedgnn}, we show that backdoored GNNs can misclassify HT-infected circuits as HT-free and misclassify pirated designs as IP-piracy-free, with an attack success rate of $100\%$. 
This work sheds light on the vulnerabilities of GNNs and the importance of shielding the GNNs when employed in security-critical applications such as HT or piracy detection.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented a real-time algorithm, GAPSLAM, that precisely infers non-Gaussian/multi-modal marginal posteriors encountered in SLAM. Our experiments justified the efficacy of the adaptive modeling strategy for efficient full posterior inference, and the uncertainty-aware re-initialization technique for explicitly correcting linearization points in nonlinear optimization solvers. Future work includes inferring the joint posterior of multiple variables, \highlight{incorporating more complex likelihood of measurements (e.g., learned orientation distributions~\cite{pmlr-v139-murphy21a}, multi-modal data association~\cite{doherty2019multimodal})}, and applying GAPSLAM to realworld planning tasks that tackle the non-Gaussian belief of obstacle locations \cite{han2022non}.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented a real-time algorithm, GAPSLAM, that precisely infers non-Gaussian/multi-modal marginal posteriors encountered in SLAM. Our experiments justified the efficacy of the adaptive modeling strategy for efficient full posterior inference, and the uncertainty-aware re-initialization technique for explicitly correcting linearization points in nonlinear optimization solvers. Future work includes inferring the joint posterior of multiple variables and applying GAPSLAM to realworld planning tasks based on the non-Gaussian belief of obstacles \cite{han2022non}.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a non-minimally coupled varying speed of light and varying gravitational constant cosmological toy model. Using the Eisenhart-Duval lifting method, we extend the original minisuperspace of the model and depict the evolution of the system in the presence of the potential term as a geometrical flow associated with the lifted metric. We write the Dirac-Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which solution is a spinor wave function of the Universe. Then we find the solution of the Dirac-Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which describes the emergence of two early universe-antiuniverse pairs that differ with the conserved quantity, which is an analog of the spin.",

    "abstract": "Joint communication and sensing (JCAS) technology has been regarded as one of the innovations in the 6G network. With the channel modeling proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.901, this paper investigates the sensing capability using the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band with an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. Based on micro-Doppler (MD) analysis, we present two case studies, i.e., fan speed detection and human activity recognition, to demonstrate the target modeling with micro-motions, backscattering signal construction, and MD signature extraction using an OFDM waveform at 28 GHz. Simulated signatures demonstrate distinct fan rotation or human motion, and waveform parameters that affect the MD signature extraction are analyzed. Simulation results draw the validity of the proposed modeling and simulation methods, which also aim to facilitate the generation of data sets for various JCAS applications.",

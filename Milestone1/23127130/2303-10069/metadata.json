    "abstract": "The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds for any few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body operators include crucial quantities in statistical mechanics, such as the total magnetization, the momentum distribution, and their low-order thermal and quantum fluctuations. Here, we show the existence of upper and lower bounds on $m_{\\ast}$ such that all $m$-body operators with $m < m_{\\ast}$ satisfy the ETH. For $N$-particles systems, these bounds are given in the form $α_L \\leq m_{\\ast} / N \\leq α_U$, where $α_L$ and $α_U$ are $N$-independent positive numbers. We rigorously prove this statement for systems with Haar-distributed energy eigenstates and provide numerical evidence for generic systems with local and few-body interactions. Our results imply that generic systems satisfy the ETH for any few-body operators, including their thermal and quantum fluctuations.",

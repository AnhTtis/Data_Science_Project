    "abstract": "By generalizing a recent result of Rickard about relations between unbounded derived categories and finitistic dimension, we obtain several new characterizations of noetherian rings which satisfy the Gorenstein symmetry conjecture. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain the following foundational homological result: over a commutative noetherian ring $A$ with a dualizing complex, any bounded above cochain complex of injectives $A$-modules which is acyclic is null-homotopic. For noncommutative noetherian rings which have finite injective dimension on one side, this property on that side turns out to be equivalent to Gorenstein symmetry.",

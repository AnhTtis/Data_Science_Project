Moreover, a distinction is made between implicit and explicit time judgments in order to take account of the different types of temporal judgments that emerge across ages. On the basis of both the neurobiological model of the internal clock proposed by Matell and Meck (2000), and of results of imaging studies in human adults, we then try to identify which of the neural structures underlying this primitive sense of time mature faster and which mature more slowly in order to explain the age-related variance in time judgments. To this end, we also present the small number of timing studies conducted among typically and non-typically developing children that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as those that have assessed the cognitive capacities of such children on the basis of various neuropsychological tests.},

	abstract = {With an estimated market size of over \$6 billion in 2011, “social” games (games played over social networks such as Facebook or Google+) have become increasingly popular recently. Understanding gamer retention and churn is important for game developers, as retention rate is a key input to gamer lifetime value. However, as individual-level data on gaming behavior are not publicly available, developers generally rely on only aggregate statistics such as DAU (daily active users) and MAU (monthly active users), and compute ad hoc metrics such as the DAU/MAU ratio to assess retention rate, often resulting in very inaccurate estimates. I propose a Bayesian approach to estimate retention rates of social games using only aggregate DAU and MAU data. The proposed method is based on a BG/BB model (Fader et al. 2010) at the individual level in conjunction with a data augmentation approach to estimate the model parameters. After validating the performance of the proposed method through a simulation study, I apply the proposed approach to a sample of 379 social games. I find that the average 1-day and 7-day retention rates for new players across games are 59.0\% and 10.5\%, respectively. Further, my results suggest that the median break-even acquisition cost per gamer is about 13.1 cents. In addition, giving out a “daily bonus” or limiting the amount of time that gamers can play each day may increase 1-day retention rate by 6.3\% and 6.9\%, respectively.},

Play is often characterised as self-endorsed and freely chosen behaviour, and self-determination theory (SDT) proposes that this autonomous quality contributes to wellbeing restoration. However, prior research has produced only inconsistent support for this claim. In this study, 148 participants experienced an autonomy-satisfying or -frustrating puzzle before playing Spore, a videogame likely to satisfy autonomy. Need-frustrated participants showed comparatively greater improvement in autonomy, vitality, and intrinsic motivation when playing Spore, and in-game autonomy satisfaction was shown to index post-play wellbeing outcomes. However, further results were mixed, and only competence frustration was found to predict ill-being outcomes. These findings are contextualised by post-study interviews that investigate the ways that autonomy, wellbeing, and motivation emerge in and through play in daily life.},

Both concepts are used to describe a wide range of phenomena pertaining to sense-of-control, material independence, and identity. It is unclear to what degree these understandings are compatible, and how they support the development of research programs and practical interventions. We address this by reviewing 30 years of HCI research on autonomy and agency to identify current understandings, open issues, and future directions. From this analysis, we identify ethical issues, and outline key themes to guide future work. We also articulate avenues for advancing clarity and specificity around these concepts, and for coordinating integrative work across different HCI communities.},

We examined the utility of nine questions (Cronbach's α = 0.64), based directly on proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD, in capturing problems related to excess use of online video games. Regular video game users (n = 257) completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, symptoms of IGD, general psychopathology, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and impulsivity. Participants meeting criteria for IGD (8.7\%, n = 21) played video games significantly more often (p = 0.04) and for more hours at a time (p = 0.002), and experienced significantly greater subjective urges to use video games (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, those with IGD endorsed significantly more symptoms of depression (p {\textless} 0.001), anxiety (p {\textless} 0.001), and stress (p = 0.01), lower life satisfaction (p {\textless} 0.001), and elevated motor (p = 0.02) and attentional impulsivity (p = 0.01).

Using a narrative approach to game design based on informant design methods, the proposed approach aims to maximize the contribution of both children informants and adult designers. It comprises of three major phases, namely Narrative Design, Game Design and Design Moderation. A mobile phone game was developed based on this approach. User testing revealed that the children generally enjoyed the game and that the proposed approach has promising potential in empowering the child designers. Future work will focus on further evaluation of the approach for refinement.},

This might be a result of missing theoretical conceptualizations and adequate empirical operationalizations of game innovativeness. Addressing this research gap, this study provides the first conceptualization and operationalization of game innovativeness, shedding first light on its performance effects. Based on longitudinal data on 351 computer games, our findings confirm that innovations in the game’s presentation and principle enhance short-term success, whereas innovations in a game’s storyline can be more of a hindrance than a godsend for companies. However, our results also show that performance effects of game innovativeness diminish over time.},

Summary: Considerable overlap was found between theories and many theoretical aspects were confirmed in the interviews. However, the interviews reveal that current models insufficiently account for the dynamic nature of gaming over time (e.g., in-game asset ownership, notification systems, or in-game timers) and the crucial role of game-external context (e.g., parental regulation, weather conditions, game accessibility). Accounting for these dynamics in future work would help us to better understand and contribute to balanced, non-problematic video gaming behavior.},

Furthermore, four anagrams (prospective cue items) differed from the remaining anagrams in that the third letter of each item was underlined. Participants were instructed to decide whether a subsequently presented (target) anagram contained the same or a different third letter as the underlined letter of the cue item. The results of both experiments showed Zeigarnik-like effects in prospective memory, so that cue items that were associated with interruption in the anagram task were better reminders than were items that were associated with completion. These findings suggest that interruption of an ongoing activity facilitates subsequent prospective memory performance, possibly by increasing the level of activation of the underlying intention representation that, in turn, increases the individual's sensitivity to identify the target event.},

	abstract = {It is almost common sense that work stress leads to sleep impairment, but the question of how work-related stressors impair employee sleep remains open. This study focuses on the role of rumination as the underlying mechanism for sleep impairment. Specifically, the authors contribute to recent research differentiating affective rumination from problem-solving pondering and examine the impact of both forms of rumination on the stressor-sleep relationship. Following theories of rumination and the Zeigarnik effect, they focus on unfinished tasks as a key onset for rumination. Unfinished tasks have received much research attention in the memory context but have been neglected as a stressor that can impact recovery. Drawing on theory, differential indirect links between unfinished tasks and sleep through affective rumination versus problem-solving pondering are examined. Further, the number of unfinished tasks extending over a 3-month period may impair employee sleep more than unfinished tasks within the acute phase. In this study, intraindividual links in a diary study supplemented by depicting between-person effects of unfinished tasks over a period of 3 months are examined. The authors matched 357 Friday and Monday observations over a 12-week interval for 59 employees. The results of the multilevel analysis suggest that the within-person relationship between unfinished tasks and sleep is mediated by affective rumination. Although problem-solving pondering was negatively related to sleep impairment, the indirect effect was not significant. Finally, beyond the acute effect, the authors found higher levels of unfinished tasks over 3 months are related to increased sleep impairment on the weekend. (PsycINFO Database Record},

	abstract = {BEngagement{\textasciicircum} with digital behaviour change interventions (DBCIs) is considered important for their effectiveness. Evaluating engagement is therefore a priority; however, a shared understanding of how to usefully conceptualise engagement is lacking. This review aimed to synthesise literature on engagement to identify key conceptualisations and to develop an integrative conceptual framework involving potential direct and indirect influences on engagement and relationships between engagement and intervention effectiveness. Four electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect) were searched in November 2015. We identified 117 articles that met the inclusion criteria: studies employing experimental or nonexperimental designs with adult participants explicitly or implicitly referring to engagement with DBCIs, digital games or technology. Data were synthesised using principles from critical interpretive synthesis. Engagement with DBCIs is conceptualised in terms of both experiential and behavioural aspects. A conceptual framework is proposed in which engagement with a DBCI is influenced by the DBCI itself (content and delivery), the context (the setting in which the DBCI is used and the population using it) and the behaviour that the DBCI is targeting. The context and Bmechanisms of action{\textasciicircum} may moderate the influence of the DBCI on engagement. Engagement, in turn, moderates the influence of the DBCI on those mechanisms of action. In the research literature, engagement with DBCIs has been conceptualised in terms of both experience and behaviour and sits within a complex system involving the DBCI, the context of use, the mechanisms of action of the DBCI and the target behaviour.},

	shorttitle = {Engaging parents in technology-assisted interventions for childhood adversity},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Youth mental health problems are a major public health concern, and are strongly associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Technology-assisted parenting programs can intervene with ACEs that are within a parent’s capacity to modify. However, engagement with such programs is sub-optimal.

OBJECTIVE
This review aimed to describe and appraise the efficacy of strategies used to engage parents in technology-assisted parenting programs targeting ACEs, on behavioural and subjective outcomes of engagement.

METHODS
Using the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers which described the use of at least one engagement strategy in a technology-assisted parenting program targeting ACEs that are within a parent’s capacity to modify. Eight inter-disciplinary bibliographic databases and grey literature were searched. Use of engagement strategies and measures was narratively synthesised. Associations between specific engagement strategies and engagement outcomes were quantitatively synthesised using Stouffer’s method of combining p values.

RESULTS
We identified 156 articles that were eligible for inclusion, 29 of which were associated with another article, hence 127 studies were analysed. Preliminary evidence for a reliable association between five engagement strategies (involving parents in a program’s design, delivering a program online compared to face-to-face, the use of personalisation/tailoring features, user control features and provision of practical support) and greater engagement was found. Three engagement strategies (professional support features, use of videos and behaviour change techniques were not found to have a reliable association with engagement outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
This review provides a comprehensive assessment and description of the use of engagement strategies and engagement measures in technology-assisted parenting programs targeting parenting-related ACEs, and extends current evidence with preliminary quantitative findings. Heterogeneous definition and measurement of engagement, and insufficient engagement outcome data, were caveats to this synthesis. Future research can use integrated definitions and measures of engagement to support robust systematic evaluation of engagement in this context.

Past research suggests a growing gap between computer use in the home and the school. This study was conducted to find out how children perceive and enjoy computer use in these two environments. Using a sample of year 3 and 5 pupils in three primary schools, qualitative and quantitative data were gathered. The results suggest that children make more use of the computer at home than at school. The most popular activity on the home computer which all children enjoyed was playing games. The most frequent activity at the school computer was word processing which pupils considered boring. Interesting gender differences showed that boys spent more time playing computer games whereas girls spent more time on the Internet emailing friends. The study concludes that schools should learn from what works at home and enable children to work on activities they find valuable, motivational and worthwhile.},

	abstract = {This article questions existing approaches in designing parental controls and puts forward a hypothesis to reimagine technologies to mediate parent-child interactions. First, we present an overview of the current parental controls. Second, we explain the gradual shift away from the idea of ‘harmful’ digital media in parental mediation studies and introduce previous work in CSCW and HCI that has proposed solutions to support discussions about digital media between parents and children. Then, we hypothesize that an emphasis on collaboration and mutual learning might help researchers and designers to rethink and reimagine technologies that support parent-child interactions with and through digital media. Finally, we share our findings of two co-creation workshops with children and parents on ways to instill parental involvement in children’s digital media use. The workshop yielded insights on the differing views between parents and children about how technologies might instill long-term negotiations based on parents’ and children’s experiences, enriched by real-use data.},

In addition, explanations for why mediation is related to aggression were sought by exploring a number of intervening variables. It was found that parental active mediation and restrictive mediation were both negatively related to children's generalized and TV-induced aggressive inclinations, whereas parental coviewing was positively related to children's TV-induced aggressive tendencies. The data also revealed that parental mediation works by first influencing either how important children perceive violent TV to be or how much attention they grant this content, which, in turn, influences aggressive tendencies. Hence, parental mediation seems to socialize children into an orientation toward TV that makes them less vulnerable to negative effects.},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement—a term not defined consistently in past work—as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences.},

However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We find that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.},

While research has explored how autonomy is afforded by a game's design, little is known about the role of the social context of play. Particularly, engaging with serious games or gamified applications is often obligatory, which may thwart autonomy. To tease out contextual factors that affect autonomy, we conducted a qualitative interview study that compared game-play experience in leisure and work contexts. We found that leisure contexts, particularly solitary play, support autonomy through a time and space shielded from outer demands, the license to (dis)engage with and configure the situation to fit one's spontaneous interests, and a lack of social and material consequence. Thwarted autonomy occurs both in leisure and work contexts when players' spontaneous interests mismatch socially demanded gameplay. We discuss implications for entertainment and applied gaming.},

	abstract = {In the domain of computer games, research into the interaction between player and game has centred on 'enjoyment', often drawing in particular on optimal experience research and Csikszentmihalyi's 'Flow theory'. Flow is a well-established construct for examining experience in any setting and its application to game-play is intuitive. Nevertheless, it's not immediately obvious how to translate between the flow construct and an operative description of game-play. Previous research has attempted this translation through analogy. In this article we propose a practical, integrated approach for analysis of the mechanics and aesthetics of game-play, which helps develop deeper insights into the capacity for flow within games. The relationship between player and game, characterized by learning and enjoyment, is central to our analysis. We begin by framing that relationship within Cowley's user-system-experience (USE) model, and expand this into an information systems framework, which enables a practical mapping of flow onto game-play. We believe this approach enhances our understanding of a player's interaction with a game and provides useful insights for games' researchers seeking to devise mechanisms to adapt game-play to individual players.},

A survey of 147 eleven-year-old computer game players attending a summer camp revealed that their main reasons for playing were for fun, for a challenge, because there was nothing else to do, and because their friends did. Males played computer games significantly more regularly than did females and were significantly more likely to play sports simulation games and violent games. Females were found to play platform games and puzzlers significantly more than did males. It is suggested that computer game playing for most children is a fairly absorbing and harmless activity but that, for a small minority of children, it may be problematic.},

	abstract = {The role of digital gaming on parenthood and parent-child relationships is a common research interest in HCI and CHI PLAY. Yet, how technology co-use, such as co-playing digital games, affords and impacts parent-child relationships is still understudied. Using 20 in-depth interviews of adults who had co-played modern digital games with their parents and/or children, in this paper we investigate parent-child relationships mediated by co-playing modern digital games. We update prior HCI and CHI PLAY research on game-mediated parent-child relationships by suggesting a "democratized" family life and a fading digital divide for families with favorable digital game co-play experiences. We also contribute to HCI and CHI PLAY by providing new perspectives of technology co-use in the context of gaming, such as an important relational tool that parents can use to promote conversations with their child(ren). These insights can further inform the design of future play to better support parent-child interactions during digital game co-play.},

	abstract = {Tablet games are flooding the market and large numbers of these are designed for children. The expansion of quantity has not seen an associated expansion of quality. Studies of the usability of tablet games for children typically take place in laboratory settings and fail to understand the context of use. This paper describes a study of 'at home' use of tablet games with children and their families that sought to examine how such games were played and how parents managed such game play. The children who participated in the study had cognitive, sensory or physical needs and these multiple needs brought many difficulties to the surface for parents mediating tablet use. A thematic analysis using four codes was applied to bring findings from diaries and interviews. Challenges for general tablet game design have emerged around designing for family routines, designing for working together, and designing to scaffold children's understanding.},

Little is known, however, about the parental beliefs and mediation practices regarding children's facilitated play in hybrid (mixed digital/physical) environments and how one can account for this through design. Following a Value Sensitive Design approach, we performed: 1) a conceptual literature investigation, 2) an empirical survey with 1398 parents of child(ren) aged 4-6 years, and 3) a technical investigation on online customer reviews of hybrid playful products for children. Our findings reveal the role of parents' mediation and beliefs in shaping young children's play. We provide designers with guidance to be accountable of the way design properties can foster parental play beliefs and support adult-child interaction. We conclude that young children's facilitated play in hybrid environments is shaped by both the social context in which it is enacted and the affordances provided through design.},

	abstract = {The idea that video gaming is for the ‘whole family’, to be played in the communal space of the living room, has gained momentum since the release of Microsoft Xbox, Sony Playstation and Nintendo Wii. This article addresses the growing popularity in family-centred video gaming in the British context by examining the design, promotion, instatement and use of this new media technology in the home. Research on the domestication of media technology is drawn on to examine the social impulses and conditions under which family-centred video gaming is introduced in the home as a domestic leisure activity. In response to parental anxieties about children’s disengagement from family life through new media use, industry-led claims that video gaming can foster family harmony are appealing. Representations of family gaming in the Wii commercials are analysed in relation to the findings of recent independent surveys on emerging patterns of gaming between parents and children. Policy issues emerge about the potential social and educational benefits of family-centred gaming and assumptions about them made in surveys and government-commissioned reports. Important questions are raised about the family dynamics of video gaming and children’s potential to benefit from this family-centred media entertainment in diverse family contexts.},

	abstract = {Games allow players to fulfill the need for competence by providing well-designed, increasingly difficult challenges. To meet these challenges, players repeatedly attempt to achieve objectives---and through this repetition, they improve their game skills. Players are keenly aware of whether they are making progress during these attempts, and they want to get better as quickly as possible. Previous research suggests that one way of improving skill development is by taking breaks between periods of activity (called "spaced practice''). However, there is little knowledge about whether this idea works in games, what the optimal break length is, and whether the effects last. We carried out a study comparing spaced and continuous practice in a Super Hexagon clone, using five-minute play intervals and five break lengths (no break, two minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, one day). We found that spaced practice led to significant gains in performance, particularly for novices. This result shows that players can achieve an immediate improvement in skill development, simply by scheduling short breaks in their play session; designers can also make use of this result by building rest periods into the structure of their games. Our study also indicated that breaks are valuable both in the short and the longer term---in a retention test after one day, all of the groups performed similarly, suggesting that even if a player does not use spaced practice initially, taking a break after the play session can still lead to improvements. Our study provides new information that can aid in the design of practice schedules for perceptual-motor tasks in games.},

In contemporary times, video gaming occupations — namely game designers, professional gamers and YouTubers — have gained prominence, bolstered by the support of the media industry and government agencies. Yet, little remains known about the perceptions of these careers from the standpoint of parents and young gamers. This dearth of knowledge thus provides an impetus for research since parents’ perceptions could arguably influence the management of their children’s video gaming consumption. Results yielded through qualitative interviews with 35 respondents revealed that parental mediation was practiced via ‘distant mediation’. This is characterised by parents ostensibly withdrawing or remaining remotely detached from their children’s video gaming whilst monitoring them from afar. When perspectives of gaming careers were further scrutinised through a comparative scope, the findings also reflected that parents and children shared accommodating attitudes toward vocations in the video gaming sector.},

In the research, two data collection tools as a survey and a questionnaire were used. The data collection tools were developed by the researchers. Qualitative data of the research consist of parents’ opinions and the digital games their children play. Quantitative data were collected with the questionnaire form. As a consequence of combining quantitative and qualitative data and evaluating them as a meaningful whole, it was established that children of parents using a parental mediation consciously play digital games with educational content. Yet, this rate is below 10\%. It was determined that 90\% of the parents do not use a mediation strategy consciously. In fact, children who are not applied a mediation play digital games with violent and neutral content. According to the findings, it is another significant result that parents using a mediation strategy consciously choose digital games with educational content by taking expert opinions. The results of the research were discussed in consideration of the literature in terms of both parental mediation and educational content of digital games.},

In that, massively multiplayer online game is unbelievably widespread among everyone in the different age group who is a frequent visitor to the internet and the social media because they are the one who searches for different excitements in their life and relationship online. A massively multiplayer online game concept is getting thousand or even more into the same server and make them play simultaneously. More MMO categories like role-playing(MMORPG), real-time strategy (MMORTS), first-person shooter MMOFPS, social game(MMOSG) are available for the users. MMOSG is mainly focusing on socialization; it differs from other gaming concepts. Imagine if everyone has a virtual life; actually, it is possible. There are a lot of virtual reality world games allows the user to have a virtual life. One can live a virtual life as an avatar, in which one can do anything; making friends with other virtual users from all parts of the world, besides the user can virtually love, dance, sex with other avatars, Parents focus only on the timing or restrict the usage of computers to play games. It shows their lack of experience in mediation. Safeguarding and educating the children from identifying the safe game or how to be safe on online games are done only through Parental Mediation. The philosophy of MMOSG now and then aspects reproaches for an atmosphere that can encourage violence against women and children, cyberbullying, and chauvinism, gaming addiction, and public humiliation.},

Across media, parental mediation was largely predicted by the child’s age, parents’ attitudes about media effects, and levels of parent–child involvement and communication. More involved parents were more frequent mediators for television, video games, and the Internet. Parents who reported frequent talks with children more frequently mediated all four media.

Furthermore, we explored whether parental mediation was associated with child delinquency. Our results demonstrate that active mediation is generally negative or neutral in nature. Involved parents were more likely to use each mediation strategy than less involved parents; however, parental involvement did not predict negative mediation. Restrictive and negative mediation were significantly related to child delinquency. In sum, the findings show that parents are involved in monitoring their children’s use of this medium, just as they are with television.},

We surveyed parents of 6- to 14-year-olds in 8 European countries (N = 6,400). A factor analysis revealed 2 parental mediation strategies. Enabling mediation is associated with increased online opportunities but also risks. This strategy incorporates safety efforts, responds to child agency, and is employed when the parent or child is relatively digitally skilled, so may not support harm. Restrictive mediation is associated with fewer online risks but at the cost of opportunities, reflecting policy advice that regards media use as primarily problematic. It is favored when parent or child digital skills are lower, potentially keeping vulnerable children safe yet undermining their digital inclusion.},

We examine how aspects of game player experience are influenced by peak-end manipulations to the sequence of events in games that are otherwise objectively identical. A first experiment examines players’ retrospective assessments of two games (a pattern matching game based on Bejeweled and a point-and-click reaction game) when the sequence of difficulty is manipulated to induce positive, negative and neutral peakend effects. A second experiment examines assessments of a shootout game in which the balance between challenge and skill is similarly manipulated. Results across the games show that recollection of challenge was strongly influenced by peak-end effects; however, results for fun, enjoyment, and preference to repeat were varied – sometimes significantly in favour of the hypothesized effects, sometimes insignificant, but never against the hypothesis.},

We conducted an observational lab study to examine how 15 parent-child pairs (children age 4-6) respond to and play with tablet apps as compared to analog toys. We found that parents and children were less likely to engage with each other or to respond to each other’s bids for attention during play sessions with tablets versus play sessions with toys. We also observed that specific design features of tablet devices and children’s apps—such as one-sided interfaces, game paradigms that demand continual attention, and lack of support for parallel interaction—are the primary mechanism shaping these differences. We provide guidance suggesting how children’s apps might be re-designed to preserve the advantages of digital play experiences while also evolving to build in the advantages of traditional toys.},

We highlight this developmental period as 6- through 12-year olds comprise a large swath of the preadult population that plays and uses these media forms. Surprisingly, this age range remains understudied with regard to the impact of their interactive media use as compared to young children and adolescents. This gap in knowledge about middle childhood may reflect strong and widely held concerns about the effects of digital games and apps before and after this period. These concerns include concurrent and subsequent influences of game use on very young children's and adolescents’ cognitive and socioemotional functioning. We highlight here what is currently known about the impact of media on young children and adolescents and what is not known about this impact in middle childhood. We then offer recommendations for the types of research that developmental scientists can undertake to examine the efficacy of digital games within the rapidly changing media ecology in which children live. We conclude with a discussion of media policies that we believe can help children benefit from their media use. Our hope is that this review will foster greater investigation of the cognitive socialization, as raised over 20 years ago by developmental psychologist and early games researcher Patricia Greenfield, that digital games serve during the middle childhood period, and childhood more generally.},

However, based on the setting and design of a questionnaire participating can be boring or frustrating and consequently have a negative impact on results or disengage users. Literature reports negative findings in immersive simulations and learning games, where assessment and questionnaires are provided outside the learning experience. In this paper, we introduce an approach to integrate questionnaires into a game environment. Thereby, we want to provide learners with an engaging way to answer questions. To encourage them in participating, they receive rewards for completing questions. We performed two evaluations, an A/B study with 22 participants and an evaluation with 14 experts in subject-related fields. We could show that learners are more engaged in the in-game questionnaire and integrated questions make them more likely to respond. We could also identify strategies to obtain more reliable responses such as asking questions right after a task or including gamification elements. Findings can contribute to design more engaging applications or learning environments where evaluation and feedback have significance for both educators and learners.},

	abstract = {The importance of player versus player interaction in online multiplayer games has seen a tremendous growth within the last five years. Nowadays nearly every online game (genre-independent) features at least one opportunity for player versus player competition. However, as one can recognize at different examples, there are significant differences in player performance and in order to create a fair game and a challenging environment one must try to match players of equivalent gaming skill. One possible approach towards a skill-oriented match-up system is the creation of an online ladder mechanism. Although different types of match-making already exist, it is important to keep in mind that especially for games with highly distributed servers (like FPS) there is no common standard for online matching. This paper presents a game-independent framework approach, which allows an arbitrarily online game to implement a complete ladder system. Within the ladder system each player has the opportunity to find opponents on a similar skill level; the calculation is based on different aspects that are introduced in depth.},

Engagement is often defined through related concepts like immersion and positive emotions. However, this neglects the fact that applied games aim to provide more than an entertaining experience, and that engagement with the applied purpose can exist separately from engagement with the game’s systems. To make this differentiation more apparent, this article introduces the Applied Games Engagement Model (AGEM), a theoretical model that distinguishes between an applied game’s systems and its non-entertainment purpose. It poses that game systems and purpose can overlap in varying amounts, both from game to game, and from moment to moment within a single game. The value of the model is in the explicit acknowledgement that the attention necessary for engaging with content is a limited resource, and that measures for engagement in applied games need to consider that not all engagement is purposeful. The article lays the conceptual foundation for the study of engagement in applied games, and provides a framework for how to design for an applied purpose. It illustrates its use in analysing applied games and their designs through three case studies.},

An immersion focused study is described in which we evaluated users' experiences playing the game in all available modes: audio-only, visual-only and combined audio-visual. Our findings reveal that visual-only experiences are comparable to traditional multimodal interaction in terms of difficulty but struggle to create immersion, whereas audio only experiences are highly immersive, present a greater challenge and are generally preferred by users.

However, modern computer games use patches not only to ﬁx software but to change gameplay, as well. Despite the importance of changes in gameplay to both the players and the game designers, there is little or no published results nor 3rd party Websites that analyze game data along with patch data. We analyzed the eﬀect of patches on gameplay for what may be the most popular computer game in the world, Riot Games League of Legends (LoL). Our methods: 1) harvested all available patch data – over 160 patch ﬁles with over 7700 patch changes – and created a novel taxonomy to classifying the patch changes; 2) gathered game statistics from over 11,000 players and over 465,000 games; 3) analyzed game data and patch data separately and in combination to gather insights into the impact of patching; and 4) developed a publicly accessible Web site that allows for interactive exploration of game data and the corresponding patches. Analysis of the data shows that Riot Games applies patch changes to LoL gameplay twice each day on average, about 10x more often than Riot Games patches LoL bugs. Patches tend to keep player-chosen champions close to a win rate of 50\%. While most gameplay patch changes can be categorized and quantiﬁed, the eﬀects of patches are not straightforward and require interpretation of patch text in order to fully understand their impact.},

Surprisingly, we find that not all feature updates will have a positive effect on player engagement. Specifically, in the vast majority of cases, players will significantly be stimulated to engage in the game after major but infrequent updates (range from 11\% to 49\%). By contrast, minor but frequent updates may work ineffectually and even present a hazard to player engagement (range from −4.7\% to 5.9\%, 3 times is positive and 3 times is negative). Finally, player engagement has no obvious difference before and after irrelevant updates. Furthermore, we find that although players will have more leisure time after the outbreak of COVID-19 due to the mandatory quarantine policy, their intentions to play games will be reduced, which further void the effect of game updates. Also, updating the game during a big game event might not be a good opportunity as updating at this moment will make the benefits that should be brought less obvious. Our results offer theoretical and managerial implications to scholars and the game industry on how to improve player engagement by properly releasing game update patches.},

This understanding is important for the design of balanced physical games.

We found these adjustments enhanced player engagement compared to the no-adjustment condition.

	abstract = {This paper presents a supervised classification system for forecasting a potential user engagement breakdown in human-robot interaction. We define engagement breakdown as a failure to successfully complete a predefined interaction scenario, where the user leaves before the expected end. The goal is thus to detect as early as possible such a potential engagement breakdown during the interaction between a human and a humanoid robot. To this end, we exploit a dataset that we have collected in real-world conditions where a set of participants were left to spontaneously engage in an interaction with the robot. The dataset is labeled according to the presence/absence of engagement breakdown. This study investigates the use of a multimodal approach to this problem, where a set of non-verbal features is considered to characterize the users' behavior. The use of combined multimodal features is found to effectively improve the performance of the system. The optimal set of data streams useful for this task is the combination of the distance to the robot, gaze and head motion, as well as facial expressions and speech. We study the time extent over which a user's departure can be anticipated. We find that this ability to anticipate the departure depends on the window during which we observe the user behavior.},

	abstract = {Engagement is a concept of the utmost importance in human-computer interaction, not only for informing the design and implementation of interfaces, but also for enabling more sophisticated interfaces capable of adapting to users. While the notion of engagement is actively being studied in a diverse set of domains, the term has been used to refer to a number of related, but different concepts. In fact it has been referred to across different disciplines under different names and with different connotations in mind. Therefore, it can be quite difficult to understand what the meaning of engagement is and how one study relates to another one accordingly. Engagement has been studied not only in human-human, but also in human-agent interactions i.e., interactions with physical robots and embodied virtual agents. In this overview article we focus on different factors involved in engagement studies, distinguishing especially between those studies that address task and social engagement, involve children and adults, are conducted in a lab or aimed for long term interaction. We also present models for detecting engagement and for generating multimodal behaviors to show engagement.},

	abstract = {With proposals to include “gaming disorder” in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and International Compendium of Diseases (ICD), the concept of video game addiction has gained traction. However, many aspects of this concept remain controversial. At present, little clarity has been achieved regarding diagnostic criteria and appropriate symptoms. It is unclear if symptoms that involve problematic video gaming behavior should be reified as a new disorder, or are the expression of underlying mental conditions. Nonetheless, the recent proposals around gaming disorder from respected bodies such as the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association seem to lock much of the applied research into a confirmatory trajectory. Since the DSM–5 proposal, research is increasingly focused on the application of the proposed criteria, as opposed to broadly testing validity and necessity of the overarching construct. This raises multiple concerns. First, the current approaches to understanding “gaming addiction” are rooted in substance abuse research and approaches do not necessarily translate to media consumption. Second, some research has indicated that “video game addiction” is not a stable construct and clinical impairment might be low. Third, pathologizing gaming behavior has fallout beyond the therapeutic setting. In light of continuing controversies, it is argued that the currently proposed categories of video game addiction disorders are premature.

An important direction in this area is to construct a model to predict how long a player could be engaged with a game. This paper introduces a pure data driven method to foresee whether a player will quit the game given their previous activity within the game, by constructing decision trees from historical gameplay data of previous players. The method will be assessed on two popular commercial online games: I Am Playr and Lyroke. The former is a football game while the latter is a music game. The results indicate that the decision tree built by our method is valuable to predict the players’ disengagement and that its human-readable form allow us to search out further reasons about what in-game events made them quit.},

To gain a more detailed comprehension of this multifaceted concept, and in order to better understand what aspects can be used to evaluate engaging game play and to design engaging user experiences, this study investigates one dimension of player engagement by empirically identifying the components associated with the desire to continue playing. Based on a description of the characteristics of player engagement, a series of surveys were developed to discover the components, categories and triggers involved in this process. By applying grounded theory to the analysis of the responses, a process-oriented player engagement framework was developed and four main components consisting of objectives, activities, accomplishments and affects as well as the corresponding categories of engagement, disengagement and their triggers – were identified and rank-ordered.},

Work leading to the theory began with experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. During more than thirty years since the initial studies, we have developed five mini-theories to address different, though related, issues: the effects of social environments on intrinsic motivation; the development of autonomous extrinsic motivation and self-regulation through internalization and integration; individual differences in general motivational orientations; the functioning of fundamental universal psychological needs that are essential for growth, integrity, and wellness; and the effects of different goal contents on well-being and performance. We have subsequently used SDT and its mini-theories to guide and interpret research on many new issues, including motivation and wellness across cultures, close relationships, enhancement and depletion of energy and vitality, and the roles of both mindful awareness and nonconscious processes in behavioral regulation. Although much of SDT was developed through laboratory experiments, it is also supported by a great deal of applied research using both field studies and clinical trials to address significant social issues. We briefly mention some of that work, especially related to health behavior change, education, psychotherapy, work motivation, sport and exercise, and prosocial behaviors.

We identified five single-player game dynamics: Instant Rewards, Novelty, Mission Completion, Waiting, and Blocking. After situating them in theories of motivation, we developed a game in which game mechanics that foster each dynamic can be included individually, and conducted two studies to establish their relative efficacy in fostering the behavioural pattern of snacking, finding significant potential in Novelty and Waiting.

Results from linear regression analyses indicate across all four platforms that parents' own screen time was strongly associated with child screen time. Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental attitudes.

This paper overviews the small, but growing area of videogame addiction and then examines the treatment options available for those affected by excessive videogame playing. An overview of the available empirical literature appears to indicate that adverse effects are likely to affect only a relatively small subgroup of players and that frequent players are the most at-risk for developing problems. Worldwide, there are relatively few practitioners that specialise in the treatment of videogame addiction and this may be because there are so few players who are genuinely addicted to playing videogames. However, the Internet may be facilitating excessive online game playing as evidenced by the increasing number of specialist addiction treatment clinics for online videogame addiction. This paper overviews the various approaches that have been used as an intervention in treating videogame addicts, including online support groups, 12-step programmes, behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapies, and motivational interviewing. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement - a term not defined consistently in past work-as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences.},

Recentwork has been predominantly descriptive, documenting and categorizing objectionable user interfaces.

But the current literature lacks a conceptual foundation: What makes a user interface a dark pattern? Why are certain designs problematic for users or society? We review recent work on dark patterns and demonstrate that the literature does not reflect a singular concern or consistent definition, but rather, a set of thematically related considerations. Drawing from scholarship in psychology, economics, ethics, philosophy, and law, we articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing dark patterns and their effects on individuals and society. We then show how future research on dark patterns can go beyond subjective criticism of user interface designs and apply empirical methods grounded in normative perspectives.},

Further, there remains uncertainty in how to differentiate high engagement from what may be termed addiction in the context of video gaming. This study examined the mediating role of coping between one measure of video game addiction and engagement, and mental health. An international sample of 552 adult participants (M age 24.9 years, 52.3 \% Australian) completed an online survey including the Computer Addiction-Engagement Scale (CAES), Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Approach/Avoidance Coping Questionnaire (BACQ). Multiple mediation analysis showed that coping explained a significant portion of the relationship between video game addiction and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. However, even after accounting for coping, a direct relationship remained. Video game engagement, on the other hand, indicated full mediation with no direct connection to declined mental health, except in the case of anxiety. Less use of approach coping strategies and particularly more use of resignation and withdrawal coping strategies were related to poorer mental health. Gaming for distraction was unrelated to mental health. This study identified maladaptive coping as a partial explanation of the relationship between video game addiction and poorer mental health. Also, the findings provide validity for making a distinction between video gaming engagement and addiction. Highly engaged gamers with maladaptive coping styles may be more vulnerable to developing video game addiction.},

This paper argues that the proposed measures are unlikely to be widely adopted by the video game industry, given the industry’s economic interests in the continued unhindered implementation of predatory monetisation, their preference for continued ‘self-regulation’ and their past resistance against potential regulation. With reference to South Korean law, this paper explores the possibility of codifying and enforcing the proposed measures as law and argues that overly paternalistic regulations are insensible and impractical. This paper recommends the use of regulatory nudging to encourage video game companies through incentives, such as discretionary grants and tax relief schemes, to adopt the proposed social responsibility measures and develop towards an ethical game design framework.},

The present study investigated the role of structural characteristics in video game playing behaviour within a sample of 421 video game players aged between 14 and 57 years. Players were surveyed via an online questionnaire containing measures of video game playing behaviour, player interaction with structural characteristics of video games, and problematic involvement in video games. The results showed that the reward and punishment features, such as earning points, finding rare game items, and fast loading times, were rated among the most enjoyable and important aspects of video game playing. There was some evidence that certain structural characteristics were stronger predictors of problematic involvement in video games than factors such as gender, age, and time spent playing. This research supports the notion that some structural characteristics in video games may play a significant role in influencing problem playing behaviour.

Games' ubiquity fuels fears that they cause poor mental health, and major health bodies and national governments have made far-reaching policy decisions to address games' potential risks, despite lacking adequate supporting data. The concern-evidence mismatch underscores that we know too little about games' impacts on well-being. We addressed this disconnect by linking six weeks of 38 935 players' objective game-behaviour data, provided by seven global game publishers, with three waves of their self-reported well-being that we collected. We found little to no evidence for a causal connection between game play and well-being. However, results suggested that motivations play a role in players' well-being. For good or ill, the average effects of time spent playing video games on players' well-being are probably very small, and further industry data are required to determine potential risks and supportive factors to health.},

To explore the possibility that TSO might contribute to high life satisfaction or other underlying explanatory factors, we investigate the relationship between TSO and SRLS in Norway while also accounting for how individual, family, school, and broader social circumstances influence this relationship. Countering prevailing discourses, we find a positive relationship between TSO and SRLS, which remains positive and significant even after a wider range of variables are accounted for. By explaining the circumstances under which TSO has a positive effect on SRLS, this article provides evidence of the complex role that digital technology plays in the lives of children. It also provides a critique of the often simplistic arguments found in public discourses around children’s digital media use.},

Whereas previous research had to rely on self-reported play behaviour, we collaborated with two games companies, Electronic Arts and Nintendo of America, to obtain players' actual play behaviour. We surveyed players of Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville and Animal Crossing: New Horizons for their well-being, motivations and need satisfaction during play, and merged their responses with telemetry data (i.e. logged game play). Contrary to many fears that excessive play time will lead to addiction and poor mental health, we found a small positive relation between game play and affective well-being. Need satisfaction and motivations during play did not interact with play time but were instead independently related to well-being. Our results advance the field in two important ways. First, we show that collaborations with industry partners can be done to high academic standards in an ethical and transparent fashion.

	abstract = {Researchers and developers constantly seek novel ways to create engaging applications that are able to retain their users over the long term, make them desire to spend time using the application or go back to using it after a break. With this aim, video games can be an insightful source of inspiration, as they are specifically designed to maximise playing time, increase players' intentions of playing during the day or enhance their willingness to replay. In a gaming context, ‘time’ is an important factor for engagement because game designers can design the game time to retain players in the game environment. Drawing on social practice theory, which is increasingly used in Information Systems (IS) research, I conducted an ethnographic study in World of Warcraft (WoW) to understand how various temporalities are produced within a video game and the effects that they have on players' engagement. The findings show that game temporalities stem from the complex interaction between the design features of the game and the norms, routines and expectations that are part of the game practices. Moreover, these temporalities can engender temporal experiences that may stimulate engagement in various ways. The study contributes to IS literature by proposing a novel understanding of how time can be intentionally designed to sustain user engagement. Finally, it suggests that ‘time design’ in video games could inspire designs in broader IS contexts, such as in the gamification of online communities, crowdsourcing platforms and crowd working systems.},

Age-rating systems are arbitrary and only focus on explicit content that is considered harmful to preschool children. The paper proposes an alternative model of app analysis based on child development. The main objective of the research is to determine the developmental appropriateness of apps for young children and its effects on children's responses through a content analysis of 318 apps and a test of a subset of them (N=25) with a sample of 53 children aged 3–5. To this end, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis is used to extract a composite index of the apps’ developmental appropriateness, which was used to specify a path analysis. The results show that developmental appropriateness is associated with the highest positive ratings by children and, indirectly, with play time.},

It is argued that there is a shift from understanding time in an event-dependent way to an event-independent understanding of time. Early in development, very young children are unable to think about locations in time independently of the events that occur at those locations. It is only with development that children begin to have a proper grasp of the distinction between past, present, and future, and represent time as linear and unidirectional. The model assumes that although children aged two to three years may categorize events differently depending on whether they lie in the past or the future, they may not be able to understand that whether an event is in the future or in the past is something that changes as time passes and varies with temporal perspective. Around four to five years, children understand how causality operates in time, and can grasp the systematic relations that obtain between different locations in time, which provides the basis for acquiring the conventional clock and calendar system.},

This paper presents the results from a systematic literature review on how the game affects physical, mental, and social health and the players’ motivation for starting, keep on, and stop playing the game. The literature review identified fifty-nine studies related to the topic, which were accepted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the critical appraisal. The main conclusion is that Pokémon Go has an apparent positive effect on its player's physical, mental, and social health, although this effect only lasts as long as the player plays the game. Further, the motivation and motives for playing the game include having a fun and immersive experience, getting physical exercise, social reasons, and nostalgia related to the Pokémon universe. The reasons for why people stopped playing the game included technical challenges, slow progress in the game that required more effort increasingly, and lack of variation and content.},

Constructed as a positive and desirable outcome of users' interactions, more frequent and longer interactions are considered evidence of engagement. Disengagement, when discussed, is considered a best avoided outcome of technology use or a solution to problematic technology use. In the case of the former, disengagement may signal usability issues or user disinterest, while the latter emphasizes that some engaging interactions can result in negative consequences (e.g., addiction) for end-users. In this paper, we draw upon examples from HCI research and digital tools to present a more nuanced understanding of the symbiotic relationship between engagement and disengagement in order to propose a new definition and novel ways to model disengagement. Further, we challenge generalizations that dichotomize engagement (positive, continuous, accompanied by high interactivity and beneficial to end-users) and disengagement (negative, stopping use or detrimental use) and invite readers to interpret engagement in the context of desirability with respect to users' goals and perceived agency. We concluded with implications that invite the reader to make space for disengagement and move beyond usage data in the evaluation of engagement. This paper is a call to step away from the practice of engagement-for-engagement's sake, and to reflect on whether and when engagement is meaningful and desirable for end users.},

This case study aimed to determine specific strategies adopted by parents to mediate their children's video game playing and find out what their outcomes are. In-depth interviews with parents of children aged 7–14 revealed that they generally had negative perceptions of video games. These negative perceptions resulted to either restrictive or active mediation or a combination of both. Parents' time with their children and the place where their children played have been found as significant predictors of mediation. Moreover, the strategies informants used to manage their children's video game playing resulted in more positive than negative outcomes. Those who engaged in active mediation and co-playing established good parentchild relationship and led to children's obedience to rules. Restrictive mediation either had positive or negative outcomes. The most common negative outcomes were parent-child conflict and children's disobedience to the rules their parents laid out to limit their video game playing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While previous research has categorised and taken inventory of key features of popular parental control apps, they have not systematically analysed the ways such features were designed or realised in such apps, or in particular how aspects of such designs might relate to parents and children's experiences with such apps. In this work, we investigate this gap, asking specifically: how might children's and parents' perceptions be related to how parental control features were designed? To investigate this question, we conducted an analysis of 58 top Android parental control apps designed for the purpose of promoting children's online safety, finding three major axes of variation in how key restriction and monitoring features were realised: granularity, feedback/transparency, and parent-child communications support. To relate these axes to perceived benefits and problems, we then analysed 3264 app reviews to identify references to aspects of the each of the axes above, to understand children's and parents' views of how such dimensions related to their experiences with these apps. Our findings led towards 1) an understanding of how parental control apps realise their functionalities differently along three axes of variation, 2) an analysis of exactly the ways that such variation influences children's and parents' perceptions, respectively of the usefulness or effectiveness of these apps, and finally 3) an identification of design recommendations and opportunities for future apps by contextualising our findings within existing digital parenting theories.},

An online survey of 992 adult gamers (N = 221 problem gamers) yielded 1987 text responses to open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis of 53,458 words extracted 9 subcategories. Participants believed that some gaming activities were inherently riskier than others, particularly those with ‘predatory’ in-game spending features (microtransactions) that resemble or facilitate electronic gambling. Some participants supported the introduction of in-game features that might facilitate greater self-monitoring and awareness (e.g., education, playing time notifications, limit-setting). Some participants believed that the gaming industry should proactively support and/or fund prevention schemes and share its player data for the purpose of independent health-focused research. These results highlight some of the complexities in developing population-level approaches to problem gaming, and anticipate some of the practical barriers to gaining support from stakeholders, including the industry and the gaming community.

In its most serious form, problematic gaming is recognized as gaming disorder (GD) in the ICD-11. Research has tended to focus on the value of outpatient treatment for GD, but less attention has been paid to broader prevention strategies to address less serious but nevertheless harmful gaming behaviors. Another gap in this literature has been the lack of involvement of the gaming community as stakeholders to identify feasible prevention approaches. This study investigated: (1) regular and problematic gamers’ level of support for different prevention strategies within primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches; and, (2) whether self-efficacy is associated with greater support for prevention strategies, as predicted by the Health Belief Model. A total of 992 participants completed an online survey that evaluated support for problem gaming prevention strategies and included measures of self-efficacy, gaming involvement, and GD symptoms, psychological distress, and mental health help-seeking behaviors. Participants reported stronger support for primary prevention strategies, including education, screening, and warning labels, than for other prevention approaches. Overall, 61\% of participants expressed support for primary prevention as compared to secondary (39\%) and tertiary (36\%) approaches. There was stronger support for outpatient care (48\%) than inpatient services (25\%). In-game shutdown features received the lowest support (65\% disapproval). Contrary to the Health Belief Model, self-efficacy was not associated with prevention support. Younger, female, and less frequent gamers were more likely to support primary and secondary prevention strategies. These findings suggest that gamers may be more favorable toward prevention measures aligned with informed decision-making, autonomy, and self-directed actions. Gamers may be strongly opposed to modifications to the structure of gaming activities (e.g., shutdown features). Future research should evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of problem gaming prevention measures in different populations and regions.},

Tools: Three tools were used in this study: 1) A Structured Interviewing Questionnaire for children and their parents. 2) Game Addiction Screening Test. 3) Self-Regulation Questionnaire for Children. Results: The current study revealed that nearly one-tenth of parents and children had poor knowledge, which changed to slightly less than three-quarters and two-thirds of parents and children respectively having good knowledge after the intervention. As well, before the intervention, slightly less than three-quarters had high game addiction and nearly four-fifths had low self-regulation, while after intervention they changed to more than three-fifths had low game addiction and less than three-fifths of children had high self-regulation. A negative statistically significant correlation was detected between children's total knowledge scores and their total scores of the game addiction screening test as revealed by r =-0.132 and P{\textless}0.044. There was also a positive statistically significant correlation between children's total knowledge scores and their self-regulation (r = 0.316 at p = 0.047) after 3 months of module intervention. Conclusion: Implementation of the parent-based module had positive effects in improving knowledge scores of children and their parents. As well, children's game addiction scores were decreased and there was an improvement in children's self-regulation after the implementation of parent-based module. There were negative statistically significant correlations between children's game addiction with total knowledge and self-regulation scores. Recommendations: Parent-based module intervention guidelines on gaming disorder and self-regulation should be given to school-age children and their parents to prevent gaming disorder and improve their self-regulation, knowledge, and behaviors. Further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of video and internet gaming addiction and to explore effective preventative or intervention strategies for these children.},

We deepen understanding of idle games and their characteristics by developing a taxonomy and identifying game features. This paper examines 66 idle games using a grounded theory approach to analyze play, game mechanics, rewards, interactivity, progress rate, and user interface. To establish a clearly bounded definition of idle games, we analyzed 10 non-idle games with the same approach. We discuss how idle games move players from playing to planning, how they question dominant assumptions about gameplay, and their unusual use of resources such as player attention and computer cycles. Our work illuminates opportunities for the design of idle games, suggests design implications, and provides a framework for researchers to clearly articulate questions about this genre.},

Virtual characters that are not controlled by players, have become an integral part, which helps to advance narratives of RPGs. Believable characters can enhance game engagement and further improve player retention. However, game players easily find that most characters' behaviors are limited and improbable, resulting in a less meaningful game experience. In this work, we propose a framework to model game behaviors to learn behavior patterns of human players. Based on the learned behavior patterns, it generates human-like action sequences that can be used for the design of believable virtual characters in RPGs, so as to enhance game engagement. Specifically, considering the influence of game context in behavior patterns, we integrate game context (players' levels and game classes) with actions together to model behaviors. We propose a long-term memory cell on actions and game context to learn the hidden representations. We also introduce an attention mechanism to measure the contribution of the actions previously performed to the next action. Given only one action, our model can generate action sequences by predicting the succeeding action based on the previously generated actions. The model was evaluated on a real-world data set of over 22 000 players and more than 51 million action logs of an RPG game in 21 days. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.},

In this paper the researchers used of an educational game called Tahderiyyah Literacy App (TLA) with standard general framework which designers and developers created for children ages four to six years old. This platform has been the testing ground for the edutainment game in the field of user experience. The purpose of the paper is to observe the interactions, experience and adaptation of kindergarten pupil (learners) on a particular on the TLA based on game's user experience. TLA was design using their mother tongue which can be played on mobile devices. Focusing only to learners from Muslim Community. While the term User Experience encompasses both physical and digital experiences, the main focus for the framework is purely for digital services wherein only touch based devices are evaluated in greater detail. On the assessment process, students were observed and interviewed about the game and what they learned about numbers and letters from game they played. This process was done to help the kindergarten answers their questionnaires. Every learner that act as respondents were guided to answer the answer the questionnaires given to them. Results of using TLA to analyze an HCI factors in learning environment are described in the later part of this paper. Implications for using TLA as a design for pedagogical tool are also discussed.},

Only recently, companies like Apple, Google, and Instagram announced to fight smartphone addiction and integrated matching features in their systems. However, if and how these features really help is still an open question. At present, there is only a very rudimentary understanding of IT-triggered disorders and addictions in information systems. Even in clinical research, there is no consensus on the nature of these addictions yet. Nevertheless, the omnipresence of information technology in our daily lives and its unpredictable effects on our moods require this problem to be addressed in a profound manner. This paper links findings from psychology and neuroscience to the information systems terminology and derives the Four-Component Model for Non-addictive Information Systems (4-NAIS). The 4-NAIS allows locating how information technology interacts with the reinforcement cycle of addictions and provides a deeper understanding of where interventions and design decisions may really help tackle IT-triggered disorders.},

It is without a doubt that both hamper daily activities and ruins inter-personal relationships. This study looks at how the state of Flow affects Cyberbullying and Video Game Addiction in playing PC Games. When players experience Flow, they lose self-consciousness, and they tend to forget about their surroundings. Subsequently, they focus only on what they are doing, neglecting any change from their environment. Though studies exist that show a possible relationship between Flow and Video Game Addiction, the study goes further by determining which of the criteria of the Gaming Addiction Scale (GAS) is highly influenced by the state of Flow. Subsequently, the study aimed to know the relationship of Flow to Cyberbullying and Game Addiction to Cyberbullying. The existing survey questionnaire from the literature was prepared through Google Forms. A total of seventy-Three (73) respondents answered the survey through the snowballing sampling technique. The result revealed that out of the eight (8) criteria of GAS, Salience had the highest relationship followed by Mood Modification, Tolerance, Problems, and Conflict. The higher the state of Flow, the higher the tendency for gamers to experience addiction. However, the result further revealed that Flow is not a predictor for Cyberbullying (perpetrator and victimization). Other results are discussed in the paper.},

	abstract = {tHe art of ProPHeCy Does studying the past help us predict the future? Lao Tzu, 2500 years ago, was pessimistic: "Those who have knowledge don't predict. Those who predict don't have knowledge." With the Enlightenment and science came optimism: "It is far better to foresee even without certainty than not to foresee at all," wrote Henri Poincaré. But 20th century technology predictions often proved embarrassing. Edgar Fiedler observed, "He who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass" [1]. Early HCI predictions fared well. Influential figures envisioned a time when use wouldn't be restricted to computer professionals; computers would support people engaged in other pursuits. This came to pass, although it took longer than some expected [2]. But most subsequent HCI visions, preserved in the SIGCHI video series, did not fare well. Visions of the future were tied to specific dates that came and went. Most assumed that speech recognition and natural-language understanding would soon dominate interaction. Billions of dollars were spent on speech and language R\&D, constraining imaginative exploration of nonverbal interaction forms. Statistical analyses of vast online corpora will assist machine translation, improve searches, and find ingenious uses in education [3], but at the risk of a future serving of ground glass, I forecast that natural language will not become the key interaction modality for healthy individuals. We are headed elsewhere.},

We conducted a semi-structured interview, a think-aloud phone-use demonstration, and a sketching exercise with 39 smart-phone users (ages 14-64) to probe their experiences with compulsive phone checking. Their insights revealed a small taxonomy of common triggers that lead up to instances of compulsive phone use and a second set that end compulsive phone use sessions. Though participants expressed frustration with their lack of self-control, they also reported that the activities they engage in during these sessions can be meaningful, which they defined as transcending the current instance of use. Participants said they periodically reflect on their compulsive use and delete apps that drive compulsive checking without providing sufficient meaning. We use these findings to create a descriptive model of the cycle of compulsive checking, and we call on designers to craft experiences that meet users' definition of meaningfulness rather than creating lock-out mechanisms to help them police their own use.},

This study uncovers the mind's underlying physics via the analogy of motion (i.e., mass, velocity, etc.) using games as the source of information. This study also conjectures that the law of conservation in mind occurred in games where momentum and energy were conserved over time, where game-playing experience relative to the gambling psychology and perceptive force were identified from the objective and subjective perspectives. It was found that momentum conservation provides new engagement measures while energy conservation, considering several other factors, provides the necessary components of understanding the addiction mechanism in the game-playing context. This measurement is examined in various domains, such as popular boards and sports games, and public gambling, where its effectiveness is determined.},

	abstract = {Videogames' increasing cultural relevance and suffusion into everyday use contexts suggests they can no longer be considered novelties. Broadly speaking, games research at CHI has concerned two forms of peak experience-historically, research aimed to support flow, or maximise enjoyment and positive emotions; more recently, scholarship engages with more varied experiences of intense emotion, such as emotional challenge. In different ways, both approaches emphasise extra-ordinary player experience (PX). Conversely, videogame play and PX have become more routine-indeed, more ordinal-as the medium's cultural presence grows. In this paper, we argue that HCI games research is conceptually ill-equipped to investigate these increasingly common and often desirable experiences. We conceptualise "ordinary player experience"- as familiar, emotionally moderate, co-attentive, and abstractly memorable - articulating a phenomenon whose apparent mundanity has seen it elude description to date. We discuss opportunities to productively employ ordinary PX in HCI games research, alongside conceptual implications for PX and player wellbeing.},

Indeed, evidence suggests that gamers differ on the severity and way in which they express IGD symptoms, as well as their social engagement behaviours. The present study aimed to: a) profile gamers regarding their experience of IGD symptoms and; b) examine how different IGD profiles varied on social engagement behaviours. Methods: A sample consisting of 1032 gamers (18–72 years, Mage = 24) was assessed with the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale 9 Items Short Form (IGDS9-SF) and social engagement questions regarding their participation in employment, education, romantic relationships and living status. Results: Latent class analyses (LCA) resulted in 4 distinct IGD classes. These entailed ‘IGD aversive’ (11.5\%), ‘Normative’ (47.9\%), ‘Moderate IGD risk’ (31.2\%) and ‘High IGD risk’ (9.4\%) gamers. The high IGD risk profile linked with higher unemployment, lower level of education and tended to live with divorced parents, friends and/or had transient accommodation. Conclusion: Findings suggest that there are different IGD profiles driven by symptom severity, whilst gamers higher on IGD risk present with lower social engagement signs. Thus, social engagement and participation should be particularly targeted by IGD immunization and treatment protocols.},

They completed several scales assessing characteristics of Internet use and gaming behaviors as well as depression and self-esteem. The prevalence of Internet gaming disorder was nearly 2\% (n = 8). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that time spent on the Internet, gaming motives and depressive symptoms were significant predictors of Internet gaming disorder scores, with differences according to gender. Problematic gamers had higher mean scores of social, escape, coping and fantasy motives and psychopathology than non-problematic gamers. This study highlights the relationships between Internet gaming disorder, motives, game genres and psychopathological variables, as differences between gamers with and without Internet gaming disorder. Motives such escape appears as a highly important factor, highlighting why internet gaming disorder could be considered as a dysfunctional coping strategy.},

	abstract = {Online role-playing video games provide opportunities to connect socially and can enhance self-esteem. For some players, however, overuse fosters dependency leading to negative psychosocial and health consequences. Per the American Psychiatric Association, criteria for diagnosis of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) follow an addiction model, and include characteristics such as preoccupation, tolerance, and withdrawal. Though useful, this approach lacks a focus on underlying motivations that may partially explain vulnerability to IGD. This study explored relationships among IGD symptoms and two potential risk factors: social phobia and player-avatar identification. Participants (N = 394; 50\% female) were recruited from game-related internet forums and surveyed online. We tested a model in which a positive relationship between social phobia and IGD symptoms was partially mediated by stronger avatar identification. Social phobia, avatar identification, and IGD symptoms were strongly positively related, and we found modest support for mediation as proposed. Accordingly, we suggest that fundamental needs for social connection and approval are potent motivators to play, particularly for socially phobic players uncomfortable with face-to-face contact. Vicarious interactions through a gaming avatar may fulfill these needs, reinforcing stronger self-identification with the avatar, which in turn can offer players a stronger and more positive sense of self. Such influences may work synergistically to motivate increasing intensity of and preoccupation with gameplay, contributing to IGD. These results support the use of player-avatar identification in assessing risk for IGD, developing treatment options, and reaching a better understanding of how socialization and identity can be influenced by virtual interactions and accomplishments.},

Research suggests that a minority of Internet game players experience symptoms traditionally associated with substance-related addictions, including mood modification, tolerance and salience. Because the current scientific knowledge of Internet gaming addiction is copious in scope and appears relatively complex, this literature review attempts to reduce this confusion by providing an innovative framework by which all the studies to date can be categorized. A total of 58 empirical studies were included in this literature review. Using the current empirical knowledge, it is argued that Internet gaming addiction follows a continuum, with antecedents in etiology and risk factors, through to the development of a "full-blown" addiction, followed by ramifications in terms of negative consequences and potential treatment.

It is affecting the behavior of children and adolescents. This is the reason why we are carrying out this systematic review. The main objective of this article is to investigate literature that directly connects the continuous and undifferentiated use of video games with the emergence of behavioral disorders in children and young people. The PRISMA statement was followed in the process of this article. We used SCOPUS, Web of Science and PubMed as databases, moreover, we searched studies with a scoping review. The results indisputably supported six out of seven of our hypotheses. We find that the excessive use of video games causes addiction to technology, aggressive behaviors, sleep disorders, and poor school performance. In addition, it hinders social relationships and the development of emotional intelligence. To conclude, it is necessary to correctly use video games in particular, and technologies in general, adapting their content to children’s age, as well as the amount of time that they dedicate to use them.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite the popularity and economical impact of games, data-driven research in game design, or to be more precise, in-game mechanics - game elements and rules defining how a game works - is still scarce. As data on user interaction in games is hard to get by, we propose a way to analyze players' movement and action based on video streams of games. Utilizing this data we formulate four hypotheses focusing on player experience, enjoyment, and interaction patterns, as well as the interrelation thereof. Based on a user study for the popular game Fortnite, we discuss the interrelation between game mechanics, enjoyment of players, and different player skill levels in the observed data.},

The lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have further increased their use of video games and, consequently, the risk of gaming disorder (GD) symptoms. However, currently, we do not have exhaustive knowledge of this issue. To fill this gap, the current study aims to analyze video gaming habits in children and adolescents during the lockdown, starting in March 2020 in Italy, the first European country affected by the pandemic. Specifically, we aim to understand how variables related to parents—for instance, knowledge of their offspring’s life, the monitoring of their video gaming habits, and parental use of video games—are related to their offspring’s time spent on video games and GD symptoms. A web-based survey involving parents (n = 554, 79\% mothers, mean age = 45.39) of 554 children and adolescents (73\% males, mean age = 11.11) was utilized. The results showed that they were involved in video games, particularly boys and adolescents, with high rates of GD symptoms. The parents also spent a considerable amount of time playing video games. A path model that explained the mechanisms through which parental variables were related to their offspring’s time spent on video games and GD symptoms, controlling for gender and age, was verified. Overall, the findings indicate the importance of educating parents to behave effectively with respect to video games and monitor their offspring’s video gaming habits.},

	abstract = {Background: Gaming disorder (GD) has been recognized as an official diagnostic entity in the latest revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). However, the majority of previous studies used different instruments, which are not fully consistent with the concept of GD in ICD-11. The development of a screening assessment instrument based on ICD-11 for this new disease entity is very urgent and important. Methods: The ICD-11 Gaming Disorder Symptom Questionnaire (GDSQ), based on the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for GD, was developed by a team of GD experts. A total of 7,790 adolescents were included in this study. Criterion validity was assessed by GDSQ, Video Gaming Dependency Scale (VGDS), weekly game playing time, weekly game video viewing time, and monthly money spent on games. Item structure was measured by factorial analysis. Discrimination between GD and non-GD was examined based on the receiver characteristic curve (ROC). Results: The GDSQ was very well described by three symptoms of GD (i.e., impaired control, increasing priority to gaming, and continued use despite the occurrence of negative consequences). The internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's α = 0.964) with good criterion validity and good discriminatory power. The optimal cutoff point for determining the profile of gamers was found to be ≥62 points. The GDSQ revealed that the prevalence of GD was 2.27\% in this adolescent sample. Conclusion: The ICD-11–based GDSQ is a successfully validated measurement scale for GD among adolescents. This study provides a new tool (GDSQ) for us to effectively identify individuals with risk of GD in medical and non-medical settings.},

Problem: Despite their importance and validity, these approaches can affect the player experience by interrupting the interaction process. In addition, the literature reports a growing interest in the development of games capable of real-time self-adapting based on the player state. This type of game requires strategies and tools to allow an automatic and non-noticeable evaluation of the user's experience, which is a challenging and open research field. Solution: Game analytics, which embraces techniques that can automatically collect and analyze data, can contribute in this context by providing data that can be interpreted in order to establish eventual relation with players' experience. IS Theory: Flow theory. Methods: This study investigates whether there is a correlation between interaction logs with the self-assessed engagement. An experimental evaluation was performed with 37 volunteers interacting with two games. The correlations were analyzed considering each log individually and their classification in three categories: neutral, positive and negative. Results: The results of the experimental evaluation reveal that the correlation coefficients found are considered weak (about 0.44). On the other hand, it is interesting that the categorization of logs between neutral, positive and negative presented the main significant results in both games. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The experiment showed weak correlation between game logs and engagement in the most cases. However, they suggest that the categorization of logs in neutral, positive and negative logs can be an interesting approach.},

Data from 276 users of a mobile gamified app were analyzed using partial least squares regression. The results showed that gamification increases user engagement through satisfaction of the needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness. User engagement, in turn, leads to greater intention to use, disseminate WOM about, and to positively rate, the app. Finally, this study provides a number of theoretical and practical implications that can help developers design more effective gamified mobile apps.},

The goal was to understand how the increasingly challenged news media industry could benefit from the knowledge that has sustained the success of the game industry. Our findings indicate that the formal practice of game design offers three key foci that may likely prove useful to industries and practices concerned with improving their audience engagement strategies. These three foci are experience, agency and play. We suggest that these three elements are the key to engagement in non-game contexts and are a likely path to improving the struggles facing not only the news industry, but other domains like activism, social impact, and civic participation.},

	abstract = {Playing active video games can produce moderate levels of physical activity, but little is known about how these games motivate players to be active. Several psychological predictors, such as perceptions of competence, control, and engagement, may be associated with enjoyment of a game, which has in turn been hypothesized to predict energy expended during play. However, these relationships have yet to be tested in active video games. Method: Young adults aged 18 -35 (N = 97, 50 female) {\textless} 300 pounds played a Dance Dance Revolution game for 13 minutes while energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry. Self-reported measures of engagement, perceived competence, perceived control, and enjoyment were taken immediately afterward. Mediation was analyzed using path analysis. Results: A path model in which enjoyment mediated the effects of engagement, perceived competence, and perceived control on energy expenditure and BMI directly affected energy expenditure was an adequate fit to the data, X2(1, N = 97) = .199, p = .655; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA {\textless} .001; 90\% CI = .000-.206; p = .692. Enjoyment mediated the relationship between engagement and energy expenditure (indirect effect = .138, p = .028), but other mediated effects were not significant. Conclusion: Engagement, enjoyment, and BMI affect energy expended during active video game play. Games that are more enjoyable and engaging may produce greater intensity activity. Developers, practitioners, and researchers should consider characteristics that influence these predictors when creating or recommending active video games. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

We discuss physiological hypotheses concerning pacemaker rate and temperature or metabolic rate, along with cognitive hypotheses concerning duration units, memory processes, attentional resources, and impatience and waiting. At least two explanations are needed: Children have not yet accurately learned verbal labels for duration experiences, and they are impatient during relatively empty durations.

Questionnaire items were administered over the Internet to 442 game players. Factor-analysis of the data supported the previous findings for computing in general. An addiction factor loaded on items tapping previously identified core criteria (conflict, withdrawal symptoms, relapse and reinstatement and behavioral salience) and a (non-pathological) engagement factor loaded on items tapping previously identified peripheral criteria (cognitive salience, tolerance and euphoria). Analysis of response frequencies supported the existence of a developmental process whereby peripheral criteria are met before core criteria. Players who might be considered addicted using a monothetic classification system involving only the core criteria were shown to spend a significantly greater amount of time playing per week than those endorsing only the peripheral criteria. It is concluded that the study supports the idea that it is inappropriate to use some of the previously used criteria for addiction when researching or diagnosing computer-related addictions.

However, it is presently unclear how winning or losing might influence players' engagement. We hypothesized that users in a competitive game will increase their level of engagement when they are losing. To test this hypothesis, we created a game in virtual reality in which each user competed against a virtual opponent that was programmed to either underperform, tie with, or overperform the user. We conducted a series of experiments on 72 volunteers who played four rounds of the game, with three rounds against each of the potential virtual opponents and one round alone. We found that user engagement increased when the virtual opponent outperformed the user, compared to when they played alone. A similar increase in user engagement was not registered when the user played against an underperforming or equally performing virtual opponent. To further elucidate the effect of the virtual opponent on user engagement, we applied the information-theoretic notion of transfer entropy, which offers a model-free approach for the inference of causal relationships between dynamical systems. Our findings provide insight into technology-mediated competition and its impact on engagement, thereby opening the door for targeted system interventions to modulate human response.},

RESULTS.On a typical day, 75\% of children watched television and 32\% watched videos/DVDs, for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, on average. New media are also making inroads with young children: 27\% of 5- to 6-year-olds used a computer (for 50 minutes on average) on a typical day. Many young children (one fifth of 0- to 2-year-olds and more than one third of 3- to 6-year-olds) also have a television in their bedroom. The most common reason given was that it frees up other televisions in the house so that other family members can watch their own shows (54\%). The majority of children aged 3 to 6 fell within the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, but 70\% of 0- to 2-year-olds did not. CONCLUSIONS. This study is the first to provide comprehensive information regarding the extent of media use among young children in the United States. These children are growing up in a media-saturated environment with almost universal access to television, and a striking number have a television in their bedroom. Media and technology are here to stay and are virtually guaranteed to play an ever-increasing role in daily life, even among the very young. Additional research on their developmental impact is crucial to public health. Copyright © 2007 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

However, more common physical and psychosocial effects attributed to online video gaming are social isolation, increased aggression, and negative academic and occupational consequences. In consideration of the bias in reporting negative consequences of video gaming, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the evidence of the effects of MMOGs on those who play them. In the sixteen studies that met the inclusion criteria, analysis revealed that only those players who were classified as "addicted" or engaged in "problematic game play" experienced significant negative consequences, with many gamers finding positive aspects to video gaming such as enjoyment, feelings of achievement, friendship, and a sense of community. However, significant limitations in the studies point to the need for further research so that appropriate treatments and interventions can be developed for problematic game play. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the notion of digital addiction has become popular. Calls for solutions to combat it, especially in adolescents, are on the rise. Whilst there remains debate on the status of this phenomenon as a diagnosable mental health condition; there is a need for prevention and intervention approaches that encourage individuals to have more control over their digital usage. This narrative review examines digital addiction countermeasures proposed in the last ten years. By countermeasures, we mean strategies and techniques for prevention, harm reduction, and intervention towards addictive digital behaviours. We include studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and 2021 and based on empirical evidence. In total, 87 studies were included in the review. The findings show that the main countermeasures could be grouped under four categories: psycho-social, software mediated, pharmacological, and combined. Overall, it has been shown that the proposed countermeasures were effective in reducing addictive digital use. However, a general statement on the efficacy of proposed countermeasures cannot be made due to inconsistent conceptualisation of digital addiction and methodological weaknesses. Accordingly, this review highlights issues that need to be addressed in future studies.},

We discuss the projects using a research through design lens and reflect on user research data and design artifacts from the perspective of the involved game designers. The results are design considerations towards long-term engagement in games for health. These considerations present a body of intermediate-level knowledge [19] oriented towards maximising the potential of the design space in early stages of games for health projects. The considerations are structured into those relevant to gameplay, research design and application context.},

Even though playing video games for hours is not inherently negative, finding the boundaries between healthy and harmful habits is one of the challenges that must be addressed in our time, especially when the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is now officially accepted. Games are a leisure activity, but behind them we can find corporations that will go to great lengths to get players engaged at a all times, crossing ethical boundaries if necessary, to get to that end. Therefore, it is very important that players, and especially children, can recognize the psychological mechanisms used in the engagement process of a game and become critical of them. This paper presents the design of a group activity that aims at reflective learning about one's behavior when playing video games, but without demonizing them validated by psychologists and psychopedagogues.},

	abstract = {The relationships between video games and well-being have been the subject of empirical investigation for decades. However, this research has largely focused on younger samples, adverse outcomes, and limited measures of game engagement. The current study compared multiple game engagement measures (i.e., time spent playing, social context of play, content rating of favorite video game, and motivations for play) and their associations with psychosocial well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms, stress, loneliness, relationship satisfaction, and social support) in a community sample of 223 adult gamers. When examined separately, time spent playing, playing games for diversion, and more solo play were related to poorer individual well-being. When examining game engagement measures simultaneously, only diversion and fantasy motivations were related to poorer well-being, while more social play was related to lower loneliness. This suggests that gaming motivations and social context are more salient predictors of adult well-being than the often-examined measures of time spent playing or video game content. The results align with the Basic Psychological Needs theoretical approach to gaming, which states that adults play games to feel competent, autonomous, and socially related, and indicate that research and interventions may better serve adult gamers by focusing on motivations for play and social context.},

Special multimedia software was developed, using a high level language which simulated standard time perception tests. A random sample of 374 school and preschool age (4-11 years old) children was used in the comparative study divided into two balanced groups. Results indicated superiority in children's judgements when multimedia software was used. This superiority was most pronounced in experiments that involved motion or action. A positive correlation between age and comprehension was detected. The subject's sex or parents occupation did no seem to make an appreciable difference. The findings of this study are discussed in terms of the applicability of computer multimedia technology, in the area of assessing the concept of time in children. \#},

The study sample consisted of 630 Chinese adolescents (Mage = 15.43 years, SD = 1.40). Results showed that VVGE was positively associated with moral disengagement and adolescent aggression. Furthermore, when controlling for gender, moral disengagement played a partial mediating role between VVGE and adolescent aggression and physical aggression; anger and hostility played a partial mediating role between VVGE and physical aggression and a full mediating role between VVGE and verbal aggression. Father's preference and mother's denying of the parental rearing patterns moderated the relationship of moral disengagement on aggression. The findings suggest that moral disengagement, anger, hostility and parental rearing patterns may be the factors that increase in the risk of higher levels of adolescent aggression after repeated exposure violent video games.},

The importance of GPs was evident, given their key role in providing mental healthcare, especially to those referred to as “the missing middle”—consumers with mental health issues who fall through the gaps in care in other parts of the healthcare system. The study found that many respondents chose to engage with mental healthcare providers primarily due to accessibility and affordability, but also because of the relational qualities that they displayed as part of delivering care. These qualities fostered consumers’ sense of trust, feeling listened to, and not being stigmatized as part of help seeking and having their mental health needs met.

	abstract = {Online games have gained prominence in people's lives. While some studies have demonstrated that online games damage students’ cognitive flexibility, others have illustrated that they improve players’ cognitive flexibility. From the perspective of self-worth orientation theory, this study hypothesized that self-worth moderates the relationship between online game use and cognitive flexibility. To explore this hypothesis, 110 participants were recruited to report online game use, self-worth, and cognitive flexibility using E-prime software. The results showed that self-worth moderated the relationship between online game use and generalization, conceptual insight, cognitive focus, and conceptual plasticity. In the case of high self-worth, playing online puzzle games can improve students’ conceptual plasticity. In the case of low self-worth, playing online puzzle games reduces generalization, cognitive focus, and conceptual plasticity, while playing online shooter games reduces conceptual insight. These results indicate that self-worth moderates the impact of online games on cognitive flexibility, and high self-worth enhances this effect, while low self-worth weakens this effect, providing a basis for improving the cognitive flexibility of youths. This also provides a new perspective for teachers and parents to evaluate the influence of online games on children's cognitive flexibility development.},

These selected papers were then analysed to examine the use of the term 'engagement' in the serious games, the genres of the games studied, the various definitions of engagement and the methods used to measure different aspects of engagement. Three distinct types of engagement, related to behaviour, affect and cognition are found in the studies, along with a broad range of evaluation methods including interviews, questionnaires, physiological approaches, in game metrics, and time and performance on task.},

In this research, we investigated the Video Game Addiction Scale (VGAS) for Chinese children and adolescents. We aimed to examine children and adolescents’ prioritization on the VGAS criteria and comparative analysis of the trend of video game addiction among them. A cross-sectional paper questionnaire study was conducted on 1400 Chinese students from grade 3 (9 years old) to grade 12 (18 years old). The respondents had to complete the socio-demographic information and the VGAS test. The VGAS characteristic was prepared in 18 criteria, which was the combination of the Video Game Addiction Test (VAT), Gaming Addiction Scale (GAS), and Revised Chinese Internet Addiction (CIAS-R). Eventually, the VGAS criteria prioritization was ranked methodologically through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method for each grade separately. Additionally, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) weighting technique was utilized to analyze the video game addiction of each grade under the four alternatives, individually. The results indicate that 3rd-grade students with some levels of addiction were the youngest who felt their life would not be fun without video games. Students in 5th grade with some levels of addiction were the youngest students who disclosed that their willingness to play video games is for forgetting their problems or feeling down. Moreover, they played video games more than before, thus, they did not sleep enough. Pupils of grade 6 reported that they played video games more than last semester. In their opinion, it is fair to play video games this much and does not need to reduce playing hours. Not getting enough sleep because of playing video games was seen in 7th graders as their first preference. 10th-grade students were the first to neglect to do their important responsibilities for playing video games. None of the 7th and 12th graders were somehow safe from video game addiction. In conclusion, playing video games can negatively affect studying, sleeplessness, getting far from society, and skipping important responsibilities for school students. Furthermore, the symptoms of video game addiction had seen at younger ages. These data provided insights for decision-makers to target effective measures to prevent children and adolescents’ video game addiction.},

Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i.e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world.

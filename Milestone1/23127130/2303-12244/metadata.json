    "abstract": "We study the moduli space of meromorphic 1-forms on complex algebraic curves with at most simple poles and fixed residues. We interpret the Bergman tau function on this moduli space as a section of a line bundle and study its asymptotic behavior near the boundary. As an application, we decompose its pushforward to the moduli space of curves into a linear combination of standard generators of the rational Picard group with explicit coefficients that depend on the residues.",

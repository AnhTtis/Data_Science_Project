    "abstract": "In 1980, V. I. Arnold studied the classification problem for convex lattice polygons of given area. Since then, this problem and its analogues have been studied by many authors, including $\\mathrm{B\\acute{a}r\\acute{a}ny}$, Lagarias, Pach, Santos, Ziegler and Zong. Recently, Zong proposed two computer programs to prove Hadwiger's covering conjecture and Borsuk's partition problem, respectively, based on enumeration of the convex lattice polytopes contained in certain balls. For this purpose, similar to $\\mathrm{B\\acute{a}r\\acute{a}ny}$ and Pach's work on volume and Liu and Zong's work on cardinality, we obtain bounds on the number of non-equivalent convex lattice polygons in a given disc. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to enumerate these convex lattice polygons.",

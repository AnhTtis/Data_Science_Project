abstract  = {Over the past decade, topology has emerged as a major branch in broad areas of physics, from atomic lattices to condensed matter. In particular, topology has received significant attention in photonics because light waves can serve as a platform to investigate nontrivial bulk and edge physics with the aid of carefully engineered photonic crystals and metamaterials. Simultaneously, photonics provides enriched physics that arises from spin-1 vectorial electromagnetic fields. Here, we review recent progress in the growing field of topological photonics in three parts. The first part is dedicated to the basics of topological band theory and introduces various two-dimensional topological phases. The second part reviews three-dimensional topological phases and numerous approaches to achieve them in photonics. Last, we present recently emerging fields in topological photonics that have not yet been reviewed. This part includes topological degeneracies in nonzero dimensions, unidirectional Maxwellian spin waves, higher-order photonic topological phases, and stacking of photonic crystals to attain layer pseudospin. In addition to the various approaches for realizing photonic topological phases, we also discuss the interaction between light and topological matter and the efforts towards practical applications of topological photonics.},

abstract  ={ Weyl points are discrete locations in the three-dimensional momentum space where two bands cross linearly with each other. They serve as the monopoles of Berry curvature in the momentum space, and their existence requires breaking of either time-reversal or inversion symmetry1–16. Although various non-centrosymmetric Weyl systems have been reported15, demonstration of Weyl degeneracies due to breaking of the time-reversal symmetry remains scarce and is limited to electronic systems17,18. Here, we report the experimental observation of photonic Weyl degeneracies in a magnetized semiconductor—InSb, which behaves as a magnetized plasma19 for electromagnetic waves at the terahertz band. By varying the magnetic field strength, Weyl points and the corresponding photonic Fermi arcs have been demonstrated. Our observation establishes magnetized semiconductors as a reconfigurable20 terahertz Weyl system, which may prompt research on novel magnetic topological phenomena such as chiral Majorana-type edge states and zero modes in classic systems21,22.},

abstract ={The discovery of topological phases has introduced new perspectives and platforms for various interesting physics originally investigated in quantum contexts and then, on an equal footing, in classic wave systems. As a characteristic feature, nontrivial Fermi arcs, connecting between topologically distinct Fermi surfaces, play vital roles in the classification of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and have been observed in quantum materials very recently. However, in classical systems, no direct experimental observation of Fermi arcs in momentum space has been reported so far. Here, using near-field scanning measurements, we show the observation of photonic topological surface-state arcs connecting topologically distinct bulk states in a chiral hyperbolic metamaterial. To verify the topological nature of this system, we further observe backscattering-immune propagation of a nontrivial surface wave across a three-dimension physical step. Our results demonstrate a metamaterial approach towards topological photonics and offer a deeper understanding of topological phases in three-dimensional classical systems.},

abstract = { Weyl points and line nodes are three-dimensional linear point and line degeneracies between two bands. In contrast to two-dimensional Dirac points, which are their lower-dimensional analogues, Weyl points are stable in momentum space, and the associated surface states are predicted to be topologically non-trivial. However, Weyl points are yet to be discovered in nature. Here, we report photonic crystals based on double-gyroid structures, exhibiting frequency-isolated Weyl points with complete phase diagrams by breaking the parity and time-reversal symmetries. Gapless surface dispersions associated with non-zero Chern numbers are demonstrated. Line nodes are also found in similar geometries, the associated surface states forming flat dispersion bands. Our results are based on realistic ab initio calculations with true predictive power and should be readily realizable experimentally from microwave to optical frequencies.},

abstract = {A hallmark of the quantum Hall effect, and a consequence of nontrivial topology of the electronic properties of systems manifesting this phenomenon, is the existence of so-called chiral edge states. These are a class of unique electronic states through which two-dimensional electron systems subject to a large magnetic field propagate in a unidirectional fashion, essentially unimpeded by scattering. Recent theoretical studies predicted that analogues to such electron 'one-way' edge modes could be realized for electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals, materials with periodic variations of the refractive index. Zheng Wang and colleagues now experimentally realize such photonic chiral edge states in a designed magneto-optical photonic crystal and demonstrate their unidirectional and scattering-protected nature. The finding of such photonic chiral edge states may enable new classes of photonic devices as well as new experimental realizations of the quantum Hall phenomenon in classical and bosonic systems.},

journal  ={ Nature Communications},
SP ={ 4269},
volume ={ 12},
issue ={ 1},
abstract ={ The physical realization of Chern insulators is of fundamental and practical interest, as they are predicted to host the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and topologically protected chiral edge states which can carry dissipationless current. Current realizations of the QAH state often require complex heterostructures and sub-Kelvin temperatures, making the discovery of intrinsic, high temperature QAH systems of significant interest. In this work we show that time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl semimetals, being essentially stacks of Chern insulators with inter-layer coupling, may provide a new platform for the higher temperature realization of robust chiral edge states. We present combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy and theoretical investigations of the magnetic Weyl semimetal, Co3Sn2S2. Using modeling and numerical simulations we find that depending on the strength of the interlayer coupling, chiral edge states can be localized on partially exposed kagome planes on the surfaces of a Weyl semimetal. Correspondingly, our dI/dV maps on the kagome Co3Sn terraces show topological states confined to the edges which display linear dispersion. This work provides a new paradigm for realizing chiral edge modes and provides a pathway for the realization of higher temperature QAH effect in magnetic Weyl systems in the two-dimensional limit.},

abstract ={[A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp iγ(C) in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.]},

ABSTRACT = {Photonic topological materials with a broken time-reversal symmetry are characterized by nontrivial topological phases, such that they do not support propagation in the bulk region but forcibly support a nontrivial net number of unidirectional edge-states when enclosed by an opaque-type boundary, e.g., an electric wall. The Haldane model played a central role in the development of topological methods in condensed-matter systems, as it unveiled that a broken time-reversal symmetry is the essential ingredient to have a quantized electronic Hall phase. Recently, it was proved that the magnetic field of the Haldane model can be imitated in photonics with a spatially varying pseudo-Tellegen coupling. Here, we use Green&rsquo;s function method to determine from &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; the band diagram and the topological invariants of the photonic Haldane model, implemented as a Tellegen photonic crystal. Furthermore, the topological phase diagram of the system is found, and it is shown with first principles calculations that the granular structure of the photonic crystal can create nontrivial phase transitions controlled by the amplitude of the pseudo-Tellegen parameter.},

abstract = {We have investigated one-way surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) at the interface of a continuum magnetoplasma material and metal, in the presence of three-dimensional surface defects. Bulk electromagnetic modes of continuum materials have Chern numbers, analogous to those of photonic crystals. This can lead to the appearance of topologically-protected surface modes at material interfaces, propagating at frequencies inside the bandgap of the bulk materials. Previous studies considered two-dimensional structures; here we consider the effect of three-dimensional defects and show that, although backward propagation/reflection cannot occur, side scattering does take place and has significant effect on the propagation of the surface mode. Several different waveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the effects of side-scattering and we also consider the effects of metal loss.},

abstract = {Recent progress in understanding the topological properties of condensed matter has led to the discovery of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators. A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals—superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties—provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Such spin-polarized one-way transport enables exotic spin-cloaked photon sources that do not obscure each other.},

The nonreciprocal propagation is achieved by the breaking of time-reversal symmetry through the use of magnetically biased medium. The location and existence of the hotspots depends on the magnetic bias that results in the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry. This results in the intriguing possibility of switching and spatial control of the hotspots through the magnetic bias.},

abstract = {Abstract The field of topological photonics emerged as one of the most promising areas for applications in transformative technologies: possible applications are in topological lasers or quantum optics interfaces. Nevertheless, efficient and simple methods for diagnosing the topology of optical systems remain elusive for an important part of the community. Herein, a summary of numerical methods to calculate topological invariants emerging from the propagation of light in photonic crystals is provided. The fundamental properties of wave propagation in lattices with a space-dependent periodic electric permittivity is first described. Next, an introduction to topological invariants is provided, proposing an optimal strategy to calculate them through the numerical evaluation of Maxwell's equation in a discretized reciprocal space. Finally, the tutorial is complemented with a few practical examples of photonic crystal systems showing different topological properties, such as photonic valley-Chern insulators, photonic crystals presenting an “obstructed atomic limit”, photonic systems supporting fragile topology, and finally photonic Chern insulators, where the magnetic permeability is also periodically modulated.},

abstract = {The performance of an active system, whether it is optical, electrical, or mechanical, is often described by its quality (Q) factor. Typically, one learns the rule that the higher the Q factor, the sharper the resonance—that is, the bandwidth of the device is reduced. Tsakmakidis et al. show that this is indeed the case, but only for symmetric systems. However, for the case of asymmetric (or nonreciprocal) systems, the rule need not be obeyed. They show theoretically that the more asymmetric a system with high Q is, the wider the bandwidth can be. The effect raises the prospect of designing high-Q devices operating over large bandwidths. Science, this issue p. 1260 Asymmetric materials provide the prospect of designing high–quality-factor devices with high bandwidth. A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δt inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δt·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.}}

Recently, it has been argued that nonreciprocal cavities may overcome this constraint by breaking the strict equality of their incoupling and outcoupling coefficients. Here, we study the implications of nonreciprocity on resonant linear, time-invariant cavities and derive general relations, stemming from microscopic reversibility, that govern their dynamics. We show that nonreciprocal cavities do not provide specific advantages in terms of the time--bandwidth limit, but enable other attractive properties for nanophotonic systems.},

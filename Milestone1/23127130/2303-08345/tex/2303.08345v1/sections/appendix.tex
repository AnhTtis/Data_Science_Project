\section{Qualitative Grounding Results}

Recall that this work targets the temporal grounding in long videos. It proposes a tailored framework as well as training objectives, alleviating the inefficiency, insufficiency and inflexibility issues caused by the sliding window pipeline. 
%
We provide some qualitative results in \cref{fig:mad_success} and \cref{fig:ego4d_success} to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. They suggest, our method can achieve flexible boundary localization for various-length target segments.
%
Besides, thanks to the content-enhanced re-ranking, some inconspicuous objects which usually perturbed by other frames can be detected (\textit{e.g.}, the wooden ferry in the third sample of \cref{fig:mad_success}), hence facilitates accurate temporal localization.
%

Despite the effectiveness, due to the fact that the sentence feature is pre-extracted considering efficiency, some word-to-object alignment may get lost.
%
Here we provide some failure cases of our method in \cref{fig:failure}. We observe from top to bottom, our method misunderstands ``\textit{skids}'', ``\textit{a}'', ``\textit{kerosene lanterns}'', ``\textit{smoke}'', ``\textit{soup}'', ``\textit{carton}'' in turn.
%
They suggest that, the lack of explicit token-level semantic alignment learning leads to inadequate semantic analysis to some extent, which is left as our future work.

We propose an end-to-end framework, \method, for fast temporal grounding in long videos. It manages to model an hours-long video with one-time network execution, alleviating the inefficiency issue caused by the sliding window pipeline.
%
Besides, it integrates both inter-anchor context knowledge and intra-anchor content knowledge with carefully tailored network structure and training objectives, leading to accurate temporal boundary localization.
%
Extensive experiments on MAD and Ego4d datasets demonstrate the superiority of our \method regarding both accuracy and efficiency.

\begin{abstract} 
  More and more consumer devices implement the IEEE \ac{uwb} standard to perform distance measurements for sensitive tasks such as keyless entry and startup of modern cars, to find lost items using coin-sized trackers, and for smart payments. While \ac{uwb} promises the ability to perform time-of-flight centimeter-accurate distance measurements between two devices, the accuracy and reliability of the implementation in up-to-date consumer devices have not been evaluated so far. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of \ac{uwb} smartphones from Apple, Google, and Samsung, focusing on accuracy and reliability in passive keyless entry and smart home automation scenarios. To perform the measurements for our analysis, we build a custom-designed testbed based on a \ac{gwen}, which allows us to create reproducible measurements. All our results, including all measurement data and a manual to reconstruct a \ac{gwen} are published online. We find that the evaluated devices can measure the distance with an error of less than \SI{20}{\centi\meter}, but fail in producing reliable measurements in all scenarios. Finally, we give recommendations on how to handle measurement results when implementing a passive keyless entry system.

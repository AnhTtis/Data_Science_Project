    "abstract": "The non-commuting graph of a non-abelian group $G$ with center $Z(G)$ is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set is $G\\setminus Z(G)$ and two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent if $xy \\ne yx$. In this study, we compute Signless Laplacian spectrum and Signless Laplacian energy of non-commuting graphs of finite groups. We obtain several conditions such that the non-commuting graph of $G$ is Q-integral and observe relations between energy, Signless Laplacian energy and Laplacian energy. In addition, we look into the energetic hyper- and hypo-properties of non-commuting graphs of finite groups. We also assess whether the same graphs are Q-hyperenergetic and L-hyperenergetic.",

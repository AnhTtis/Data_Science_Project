\section{Supplementary}
The accuracy of our model compared with the naive classifier (based on the probability 
distribution of the training data), Shenoy et al~\cite{ref6_shenoy2018deepwound}, Aguirre et al~\cite{ref22_nilsson2018classification}, and Liu et al~\cite{ref11_liu2019end} on the test dataset. * indicates a significant difference (p values \textless 0.05). Our model is compact while exhibiting significantly better or comparable performance to those other methods.

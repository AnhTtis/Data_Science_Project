    "abstract": "For an elliptic, semilinear differential operator of the form $S(u) = A : D^2 u + b(x, u , Du)$, consider the functional $E_\\infty(u) = \\mathop{\\mathrm{ess \\, sup}}_Ω|S(u)|$. We study minimisers of $E_\\infty$ for prescribed boundary data. Because the functional is not differentiable, this problem does not give rise to a conventional Euler-Lagrange equation. Under certain conditions, we can nevertheless give a system of partial differential equations that all minimisers must satisfy. Moreover, the condition is equivalent to a weaker version of the variational problem.",

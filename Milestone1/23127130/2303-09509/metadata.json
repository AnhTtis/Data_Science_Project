    "abstract": "A generating set for a finite group $G$ is said to be minimal if no proper subset generates $G$, and $m(G)$ denotes the maximal size of a minimal generating set for $G$. We prove a conjecture of Lucchini, Moscatiello and Spiga by showing that there exist $a,b > 0$ such that any finite group $G$ satisfies $m(G) \\leq a \\cdot δ(G)^b$, for $δ(G) = \\sum_{\\text{$p$ prime}} m(G_p)$ where $G_p$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. To do this, we first bound $m(G)$ for all almost simple groups of Lie type (until now, no nontrivial bounds were known except for groups of rank $1$ or $2$). In particular, we prove that there exist $a,b > 0$ such that any finite simple group $G$ of Lie type of rank $r$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^f}$ satisfies $r + ω(f) \\leq m(G) \\leq a(r + ω(f))^b$, where $ω(f)$ denotes the number of distinct prime divisors of $f$. In the process, we confirm a conjecture of Gill and Liebeck that there exist $a,b > 0$ such that a minimal base for a faithful primitive action of an almost simple group of Lie type of rank $r$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^f}$ has size at most $ar^b + ω(f)$.",

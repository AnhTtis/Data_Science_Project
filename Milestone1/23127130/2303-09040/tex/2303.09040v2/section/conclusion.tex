\section{Conclusion}

We present HSDT, an effective and flexible transformer for hyperspectral image denoising. Built upon the hybrid hierarchical architecture, our HSDT is equipped with a novel S3Conv, GSSA, and SM-FFN module to effectively integrate the local spectral-spatial inductive bias and the long-range spectral dependency modeling.  Our S3Conv extracts highly correlated local spatial-spectral features without harming efficiency and flexibility, while the GSSA provides stronger capabilities for capturing global spectral correlations, guided by a set of learnable queries that encode the band-wise spectral signatures. With the SM-FFN to further strengthen the aggregated features of more informative regions, our model outperforms the existing SOTA methods on various datasets under simulated and real-world noise.

    "abstract": "We theoretically study the weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) effects in twisted bilayer graphene that placed in alignment on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate. The low-energy band of the top layer exhibits a Dirac cone with a negligible gap, while the bottom layer has a relatively large band gap. The system features a low concentration of impurities, and the quantum correction to the conductivity arises from the quantum interference between two time-reversed impurity scattering trajectories. Through bias voltage tuning, we find that inter-layer scattering significantly contributes to the conductivity correction when the Fermi surface areas of the two valleys at low energy are comparable. We observe a double crossover from WL to WAL and back to WL at a specific range of Fermi energy, which is a particularly intriguing phenomenon.",

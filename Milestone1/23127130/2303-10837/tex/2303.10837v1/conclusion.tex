\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an efficient Homomorphic-Encryption-based privacy-preserving federated learning system with a user/device-friendly deployment platform and a universal optimization scheme that can be practically deployed across distributed edge devices. To support realistic secure aggregation application deployment, our novel universal overhead optimization scheme is designed to largely reduce both computational and communicational overheads during deployment while providing a dynamic desired privacy guarantee. Future work includes quantitative and theoretical analysis of the trade-offs among privacy guarantee, system overheads and model performance compared to other approaches (including Difference Privacy and MPC approaches), and supporting decentralized serverless secure federated training using primitives like Threshold HE and Proxy Re-Encryption~\cite{ateniese2006improved}.

Federated Learning (FL) enables machine learning model training on distributed edge devices by aggregating local model updates rather than local data. However, privacy concerns arise as the FL server's access to local model updates can potentially reveal sensitive personal information by performing attacks like gradient inversion recovery. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving methods, such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE)-based approaches, have been proposed. Despite HE's post-quantum security advantages, its applications suffer from impractical overheads. In this paper, we present FedML-HE, \emph{the first practical system for efficient HE-based secure federated aggregation} that provides a user/device-friendly deployment platform. FedML-HE utilizes a novel universal overhead optimization scheme, significantly reducing both computation and communication overheads during deployment while providing customizable privacy guarantees. Our optimized system demonstrates considerable overhead reduction, particularly for large models (e.g., $\sim$10x reduction for HE-federated training of ResNet-50 and $\sim$40x reduction for BERT), demonstrating the potential for scalable HE-based FL deployment.

% Federated learning (FL) trains machine learning models across distributed edge devices by aggregating the local model updates instead of the local data. However, recent research indicates that the privacy guarantee from the simple federated aggregation algorithms can be easily broken when the aggregation server has direct access to the local model updates that can be used for recovering sensitive personal information in the local data. Several privacy-preserving solutions have been proposed including Homomorphic-Encryption-based approaches. However, despite Homomorphic Encryption (HE) being a post-quantum generic secure computation scheme, applications based on such a cryptographic foundation suffer from impractical overheads. 
% In this paper, we propose FL-HE, \emph{the first practical system for efficient HE-based secure federated aggregation}, which adopts a novel universal overhead optimization scheme designed to largely reduce both computational and communicational overheads during deployment while providing a dynamic desired privacy guarantee. With optimization, our system can achieve sizeable overhead reduction, especially on large models (e.g., $\sim$10x reduction for HE-federated training ResNet-50 and $\sim$40x reduction for BERT respectively), which shows the feasibility of further scalable HE-based FL deployments. %\carlee{in general, this abstract does not make the work seem related to mobile systems.

\section{Conclusion}
\noindent In this paper, we propose FedML-HE, the first practical Homomorphic Encryption-based privacy-preserving FL system that supports encryption key management, encrypted FL platform deployment, encryption optimizations to reduce overhead, and is designed to support efficient foundation model federated training. We design Selective Parameter Encryption that selectively encrypts the most privacy-sensitive parameters to minimize the size of encrypted model updates while providing customizable privacy preservation. 
Future work includes quantitative and theoretical analysis of the trade-offs among privacy guarantee, system overheads, and model performance compared to other approaches (including difference privacy and secure aggregation approaches), and improving threshold-HE's performance in the FL setting as well as supporting decentralized primitives such as Proxy Re-Encryption~\cite{ateniese2006improved}.

%paper about donating projects to OSS 
%\subsection{What does OSS mean for companies?}
%"So corporations have always been pretty much command and control with a little bit of marketplace dynamic. But OSS is about this network, the network effect. Why are corporations doing that? Like, that's this third modality of sharing information that's incredibly effective. Corporations are using this modality of hierarchical command control, which is incredibly ineffective. So maybe corporations need to learn and participate in OSS. And that's that sort of got me from anti-OSS to learning about network production models, to running an OSPO. And now being very involved in lots of things related to OSS. And then this conversation" [P10]
In this section, we describe our findings on what motivates companies to contribute to OSS and the different ways companies contribute to OSS.%, and some lessons learned. 
\subsection{RQ1: What motivates companies to contribute to OSS?}

According to our interviewees, company motivations to contribute to OSS fall under four top-level categories: \textit{Founder(s)' Vision, Reputation, Business Advantage, and Reciprocity} (see Table \ref{tab:motivationTable}). We will discuss what we found for each of these categories in the following sections.

\input{tables/motivationTable}

%---------Start of FOUNDERS VISION________________
\subsubsection{Founder(s)' Vision}
\label{sec:founders}
%The founder(s) vision is usually from the origin of smaller companies' participation in OSS (P1, P2, P7, P5, P9, P12).
Founder(s)' vision can stem from the founder(s)' ideology (P1, P2, P5, P7, P12) attributed to a \inlinequote{philosophical point of view at the very beginning (P2),} \inlinequote{the company culture (P5)} and to the fact that \inlinequote{all of the co-founders have a deep history in open source (P12).} 
%Founder(s)' vision stems from the founder(s)' ideology (P1, P2, P5), the nature of the problem the company is solving (P9), or a mix of both (P7, P12).

Still, the founder(s)' vision can also be attributed to the nature of the problem that the company is solving and its ties to OSS (P9, P7, P12). In some cases, the reason for founding the company is \inlinequote{to create an open source alternative to large enterprise resource planning software (P9)} which makes the ideology become part of the company's core. 

%the fact that the nature of the problem that the company is solving is tied to open source in its very essence. And the reason for founding the company in the first place is
%\inlinequote{to create an open source alternative to large enterprise resource planning software [P9]}. 

\MyBox{Companies contribute to OSS because of their \textbf{founder(s)' vision} and/or because the problem they are solving is tied to OSS in its very essence.}

%--------------------end of founders vision---------------

\subsubsection{Reputation} 
\label{sec:reputation}

Our findings show that investing in OSS can be compared to public relations. For example, P4 compares the motivation to participate in OSS to that of \inlinequote{tak[ing] bits and pieces of the engine room into the open... by like normal PR [Public Relations] conference talks or they could do it like by open sourcing some of these things.}

%`` to take bits and pieces of the engine room into the open and they can do this by like normal PR conference talks or they could do it like by open sourcing some of these things''. 

Our analysis revealed that companies focus on building \textit{reputation} in different ways, which we categorized as follows: \textsc{Visibility}, \textsc{Building verifiable trust}, \textsc{Networking}, \textsc{Attracting talent}, and \textsc{Fostering Adoption}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\boldification{no matter the size of the company, visibility is a driver to being in OSS.}
\textsc{Visibility.}
Our results show that participating in OSS brings visibility to companies of all sizes (P1, P2, P4-P9, P11, P13-P18). For instance, P2 explains \inlinequote{we wanted to be there [OSS project] in our case because this brings a lot of visibility.} Companies join OSS to cement their name to a domain, expand their brand, or receive credit as the creator of a technology that is an industry standard.

\boldification{This visibility helps companies build an understanding of what they do inside, which helps attach the company brand to the domain of expertise that it is known for.}

For example, visibility helps companies signal an understanding of  \inlinequote{what [is] actually going on inside (P4)} by showcasing their technical achievements (P1, P2, P4, P7), which helps cement the name of the company in their domain of expertise.

\boldification{While this is the case for some companies, the visibility capabilities of OSS can also help a companies transition to a different domain of expertise}

While this is the case for a number of companies, it does not end here. Companies can also leverage OSS to expand their brand beyond that for which they are known for (P4, P11). In particular, OSS can help companies expand their domain of expertise as explained by P11: \inlinequote{so people tend to think of [company name] as like the people who did [specific product]. And we've really moved beyond that.}

\boldification{Now visibility doesn't have to mean the same thing to all companies, it can mean becoming more international for growing companies and making an internal technology the \textit{de facto} technology and being seen as the founder}

{Visibility can also hold different meanings to different-sized companies. For small companies, visibility can mean \inlinequote{becom[ing] more international (P6).} Whereas, for large technology companies, standardizing a piece of technology is the ultimate visibility goal (P3, P4, P18) because \inlinequote{if you actually came up with this standard, then you also get a lot of exposure (P4).} A good example of this is how \inlinequote{[for example] open-sourcing React has provided more value for Facebook than leaving it to themselves ever could have. Because (a) they get contributions now on that library; and (b) they get the sort of street credit of the founders of React (P3--who does not work at Facebook).}}

 
%_________________________End visibility__________________

\textsc{Building verifiable trust.}
In our context, building verifiable trust was described as gaining users' trust and/ or gaining the communities' trust. OSS by virtue of its open character, enables companies to openly contribute to a project. Therefore, these companies--especially startups--see OSS as a place where they can showcase their expertise to their users to gain trust (P1, P2, P5, P7, P15, P18). In fact, openly contributing to a project allows users to see the companies’ contributions, their quality, and the rate at which they maintain the project. This differs from the proprietary software world, where users have to trust the company as to whether or not a product is being maintained. P15 explains these differences: \inlinequote{If we have a proprietary component..., you have to trust the vendor to know whether or not that's being maintained... Whereas if it's an open source project,  I can watch the contribution history and I can know whether or not it's being maintained (P15).} 

Gaining users' trust is particularly relevant when a company is at the forefront of a new technology or concept as explained by P2: \inlinequote{And they [users] say, well, I need someone, I need help with [name of concept]... So it's not that we know about [name of concept] it's that we are defining [name of concept] and for this, you can see that we have this pattern here about the maturity model.} This suggests that companies that are working on, or defining a new concept in the open, are more likely to be trusted and potentially hired by users, as users can directly see their contributions and decide on its quality.


While giving your users \inlinequote{open source value (P5)} builds verifiable trust, making it long-lasting requires going the extra mile--listening to and embracing users' feedback: \inlinequote{and what happens when you say, I'm giving you this, and then you deliver this, your users and your customers trust you. And they are more likely to stay with you (P5).}

It is not only startups who seek to build trust, we also found that for large technology companies (P14, P15, P17, P18) \inlinequote{the biggest benefit from contributing is building trust (P18).} However, this trust is specifically directed towards signaling a sense of \inlinequote{accountability to communities (P17)} and showing that \inlinequote{you are willing to sidestep what you think is best and make sure that decision makings include the community (P17).} That built trust is what then enables companies \inlinequote{to be at the table (P18)} and participate in shaping the direction of the projects that they depend on. 

In summary, different types of companies have different goals in creating trust; startups (mainly) contribute to OSS to gain users' trust and a user community, while larger technology companies contribute to OSS to gain the communities' trust.


\textsc{Networking.} Participants described networking as socializing with the OSS community, other companies, and/or being in the same space as big-name companies. This allows companies to open the lines of communication for collaborations and partnerships. Our analysis shows that networking can look different depending on the company's goal. Most small companies found networking to be a driver for OSS participation. 
Some of these companies saw networking as an opportunity to socialize with peer companies and organizations and get to know people in the same space. For instance, P5 depicted networking as being in \inlinequote{that same ecosystem as these other like-minded organizations and practitioners (P5)} and P7 described networking as \inlinequote{socializing on that level of getting to know people, talk to people (P7).}

Other companies saw networking as a way to be in the same space as big-name companies (P1, P2, P6). For example, P6 describes networking for their company as a way to \inlinequote{bring more people to pay attention...and engage our brand to be related with huge companies (P6).} Other companies emphasized networking as a way to ease collaborations. For example, P8 mentioned how networking made
\inlinequote{collaboration and partnerships become six orders of magnitude easier (P8).}

%as a motivation to contribute also looks different depending on the company's goal
%, with growing companies participating in OSS to be in the same space as big-name companies.


%which leads us to the next section, stay tuned ...

%\MyBox{\textbf{Networking:} Growing companies participate in OSS to be in the same space as big name companies, opening the lines of communications for collaboration and partnerships.}

%_________________ATTRACTING TALENT___________
\textsc{Attracting talent.}
Our results show that companies participate in OSS to be seen as a ``cool company'' to work at, hire talents that are familiar with their tech stack, and bypass the interview and onboarding process. Participant P3 shared that companies that contribute to OSS \inlinequote{get viewed as, like a cooler place to work (P3).} P4 explains that \inlinequote{open sourcing is one of the ways that can make it [company] much more interesting for outside candidates (P4)}
and signals to developers that, by joining such a company, they too can work on ``cool technology'' that has a lot of traction in the world (P3, P4, P8, P10, P13). 

Our findings suggest that such reputation is highly beneficial for companies, which can then hire some great people since, as P10 points out, \inlinequote{people who code in public are better coders (P10).} Not only that, but companies also \inlinequote{get an entire class of engineers, who are now familiar with the tech stack that [company] uses (P4)} thus bypassing the interview and training process (P3, P4, P6, P10). 

This is particularly relevant for large technology companies that have open-sourced a technology that has now become the industry standard. For instance, P4 (who does not work at Google) mentioned that \inlinequote{any engineer that Google hires now will know Kubernetes.} 

%So this mindset also, cause many companies that didn't go open source to lose talent and don't retain talent. So this works also as a way to retain talent, like, Hey, we are not just a boring company in the financial systems, I don't know, for instance, like, we are a tech company, and we are promoting open source and we really want you to create things and linear space to do so. Right? And also to like your Yeah, like your personal brand gets in the pilot for for your future career.[P19]

%Small companies also reap the benefits of open source contributions \inlinequote{to hire some of the very best in the field [P9]} even though they \inlinequote{don't have the ability to pay the same [P9]} as larger technology companies do. 


%\MyBox{\textbf{Attracting talent:} companies join OSS to be seen as a ``cool company'' to work, to hire talents familiar with their tech stack, and bypass the interview and onboarding process.}


\textsc{Fostering adoption} in our context refers to a company’s technology being widely adopted. Fostering adoption can be an integral part of building a company's reputation, so much so that the company \inlinequote{would rather focus on broader adoption than just you could say having our name on it (P4).} % its virtue of being open to anyone, OSS helps foster adoption. 

For smaller companies, and as described by P2, \inlinequote{the best way to get your technology adopted is by open-sourcing this (P2).} Our results suggest that open-sourcing technology not only provides a readily available alternative to proprietary software but levels the playing field for startups to compete with larger companies.

For larger companies, fostering adoption can look like, as described by P11, \inlinequote{not locking them [enterprise customers] into a proprietary technology} and giving them the option to deploy the same solution using a different vendor. Our findings show, that while
the open character of OSS helps foster adoption, some companies do not stop at the mere act of open-sourcing a product. Such companies \inlinequote{strategically give that [project] to a foundation to grow in public, so that more people use a technology (P10)} (P4, P11, P18). Our findings highlight that allowing a project to grow under neutral governing bodies gives additional impetus to wider adoption.

\MyBox{Contributing to OSS helps cement \textbf{reputation}. It gives visibility to smaller companies, allowing them to play in the same space as big-name companies. Larger companies benefit by developing  deeper trust with the community signaling good citizenship, which in turn helps in recruiting.}

%______________________START OF BUSINESS ADVANTAGE_______



%\textsc{Engineering need.} The business advantage journey starts with the engineering need: \inlinequote{thinking they don't use it, to realizing that they do... (P12).}

%OSS is home of \inlinequote{some of the greatest technologies, pieces of technology, around the world (P2).} With such realization companies start their OSS journey by \inlinequote{consum[ing] open source, that's the, the most obvious one, and like 99\% of the companies in the world do that (P7).} By consuming quality and readily available solutions, companies are able to \inlinequote{spin up this [product name] product line in a relatively short period of time (P11).} This--in addition to OSS's independence from licensing and certification needs (P7, P13, P15)--makes OSS solutions more attractive where companies \inlinequote{look to use open source whenever we can, for our own stuff, as well as open standards (P8).}

%\MyBox{\textbf{Engineering need}: companies consume OSS because it hosts high-quality software, it is independent of licensing/ certification needs and helps build quality software rapidly.} 

%---------------business depends on oss-------------------
\subsubsection{Business Advantage}
\label{sec:business}
Over the years, companies' mindset has shifted in a way that now sees OSS as an ecosystem of business opportunities rather than a risky endeavor that commoditizes their products \cite{robles2019twenty}: % This is clearly reported by one of our participants: 

\inlinequote{There's a journey that companies seem to go on from like...thinking they don't use it, to realizing that they do...to a point where companies start realizing they need to give back...Ultimately, they know at this point, that a healthy ecosystem means good business for them, too (P12).}

The Business Advantage motivation is divided into four different subcategories. While companies are driven by a direct business need to contribute to OSS, other motivations (Closer channels, Coopetition, and Innovation) also play a role when it comes to companies' involvement in OSS. We detail these motivations in the next subsections.

\textsc{Business dependency on OSS,} refers to cases where
throughout the companies' journey in OSS, their business becomes dependent on OSS \inlinequote{...to a point where companies start realizing they need to give back because they see that it actually helps them strategically (P12).}

Because the business depends on OSS projects, companies are motivated to contribute to keeping their dependencies healthy (P2-P5, P7, P9-P12, P14-P17). And just like an engine is critical to a car manufacturer: \inlinequote{if something happens to that engine...that works for Ford, right? Or, even worse, it makes it so that Ford can't use the engine the way they were using it before (P3).} Our results show that business dependency on OSS relates to ensuring that the OSS projects a company depends on remain healthy and that the leadership of these projects is not monopolized.

\boldification{Keep dependency healthy}
In fact, as described by P9, companies \inlinequote{want these projects [dependencies] to be healthy, alive and well maintained, and sustaining (P9).} To help with sustainability, companies contribute financially (P4) as well as upstream fixes (P17), which in return prevents carrying any technical debt internally (P11).
 
\boldification{software monopoly} 
The technical soundness of a project dependency is not the only aspect of its health. In fact, P7 explains that \inlinequote{part of the healthiness of the project is also making sure that there are different ideas, opinions, and points of view. It's really easy to fall to a kind of monopolistic way on the open source projects (P7).} Our findings suggest that participating in governance and leadership (P3, P7, P15, P11) helps ensure a shared roadmap. Our findings also highlight that, a shared leadership flows both ways. It cannot just thrive on companies' readiness to get involved in governance roles, it also relies on the project having an open leadership and governance that welcomes participation. When the project in question is led by a company and this company realizes that
 \inlinequote{we cannot be the only ones backing this thing up (P7),} they start seeking \inlinequote{a backing up of different companies (P7)} which in turn becomes a stepping stone for coopetition, which we detail in the next section.

%\MyBox{\textbf{Business dependency on OSS:} companies want to ensure that the OSS projects they depend on are healthy, and the leadership of these projects is not monopolized.} 


%___-----------------Coopetition_____________________
\textsc{Coopetition.}``Coopetition is the act of cooperation between competing companies''\cite{coopetitionDef}. Our findings suggest that in OSS companies can work together on the hard technical problem they all face and compete on other features around the problem. %\inlinequote{all these little things around the [problem] that make a [product] worth buying (P3).}

Our results suggest that coopetition yields more productivity where (1) workload is reduced and (2) products are of higher quality. The workload is reduced (P3, P8, P13-P15) as collaborating helps \inlinequote{do the hard work only once (P3)} and provides a form of resource sharing where \inlinequote{20 engineers will go further working on a project with 80 other engineers from four different companies (P3).}

We also found that the benefits of coopetition are not solely related to productivity. Such practice enables a bigger market share (P3, P15), which in return provides a much larger user base, one that is now empowered to migrate to different service providers that use the same core technology. 

Still, according to P3 and P11, the products end up having higher quality 
because \inlinequote{pulling in people who work from other companies who will use things differently...they'll have different skills...they'll have different ways of thinking (P11).}


%\MyBox{\textbf{Coopetition:} companies participate in open source to collaborate with other companies on the harder problems, share resources, build a better product, and have a bigger market share.} 


\textsc{Closer channels}
in our context, relates to more direct communications, such as direct user feedback and, engineer-to-engineer communication that promotes timely fixes.
OSS is, in fact, a no-middleman land that provides closer channels and engineer-to-engineer communication (P5, P7, P13-P15, P17). The closer channels can take the form of raw users' feedback or customers' collaborations (P5, P14) that is then, as described by P5, \inlinequote{ingest[ed] back into our product delivery process.} 

Closer channels also mean bypassing the company-to-company communication protocols %where \inlinequote{you cannot reach out to the developer directly (P14),} 
and making engineer-to-engineer communication the new norm (P13, P14). As described by P13, \inlinequote{it's fairly easy to waste a week on an incredibly dumb bug, that if you actually know everyone in the community... you're going to solve in like, 15 minutes (P13).}

%\MyBox{\textbf{Closer channels:} companies participate in OSS because it brings the channels of communication closer, such as readily user feedof mentori engineer-to-engineer communication that promotes timely fixes.} 


\textsc{Innovation.} OSS is, by virtue of its character, a space for innovation that provides a business advantage and drives companies' participation (P11, P13, P16, P17, P19). Our findings suggest that innovation takes the form of more perspectives, more user stories, and diverse ideas that shape the company's products (P11, P17, P19). This innovation boost then makes it more likely \inlinequote{that it [product] will solve problems for more people and not just those 12 extremely bright people in the room (P17).}

\boldification{Getting familiar with projects interesting in the future}
For \textit{avant-garde} companies, innovation can also take the form of getting familiar with projects that can be strategic in the future. For instance, P11 explains: \inlinequote{one of the things that we try to do is contribute to projects that we think are going to be strategic for [company name] in the future, but that aren't necessarily strategic for us right now (P11).}


%\MyBox{\textbf{Innovation:} companies participate in OSS because it fosters collaboration, yields new perspectives, and gives companies access to potential strategic projects in the future.} 

\MyBox{Companies start to use OSS as a \textbf{business advantage}, but then their journey evolves to contributing to maintain the tech they are dependent on, and they stay since participating in OSS allows them to cooperate with their competition and innovate quicker.} 


%-----------Start of RECIPROCITY____________________

\subsubsection{Reciprocity} Companies sometimes want to give back to the OSS ecosystem by contributing to the projects they use or other projects to share knowledge and experiences for the greater good of OSS (P2-P5, P7, P9-P12, P14-P17).
%
%\textcolor{red}{
%Reciprocity can take the form of simply giving back to the OSS ecosystem that has given so much}. 
Our findings suggest that reciprocity stems from the realization that companies have extensively used open source and need to give back. For instance, P7 shared \inlinequote{we took lots of things from open source.} P9 explains that if \inlinequote{there's no reciprocity in some ways, even small, then you're missing the point entirely.}

In contrast with the contribution driven by the business depending on OSS (see section \ref{sec:business}), reciprocal contributions are ones that do not necessarily have a direct impact on the company but are rather, as P9 puts it, \inlinequote{the right thing to do.}

%\inlinequote{benefit for us there. I mean, there's no direct benefits in having the [project name] cleaned up, it was more we thought it was the right thing to do [P9]}.

Reciprocity can take the form of mentoring (P1, P2, P9, P12, P14, P17, P20),  \inlinequote{sharing experiences between different groups (P7)} (P6, P13, P14) and advocating OSS by \inlinequote{spreading the word. And letting everybody know that contributing to open source is good. It's good for you and your company (P6).}

\MyBox{Companies want to \textbf{reciprocate} by contributing back to the projects they use and to other projects for the greater good of OSS.}



%so there is no direct benefit for us there. I mean, there's no direct benefits in having the Linux kernel cleaned up, it was more we thought it was the right thing to do. It was pure pro bono investments, syncing the work we do with these tools. In the end, we believe that if more people use open source, more people will notice the service and products we provide. And, and and that will be beneficial to everyone in the long run. [P9]


The four motivation themes (RQ1) are what drive company contributions. To further understand the companies' engagement, in the following section, we link these motivations to the multi-faceted ways companies contribute to OSS, highlighting the entities that benefit from such involvement (see Figure~\ref{fig:contribute}).

\subsection{RQ2: How do companies contribute to OSS?}

%\subsubsection{Contribute to open source}
When it comes to contributing to OSS, there is a number of ways to participate. We identified seven categories of contributions across companies: open sourcing \textsc{Tools \& Products}, \textsc{Developers' Time}, \textsc{Community 
Relations' Time},  \textsc{Advocacy \& Promotion Time}, \textsc{Time Addressing D\&I}, \textsc{Mentoring Time} and \textsc{Financial Support} (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.52\textwidth]{figures/contribute.png}
    \caption{Company contributions and their beneficiaries}
    \label{fig:contribute}
\end{figure}

%-------------SOFTWARE/tools and products----------------
\subsubsection{Tools \& Products} %Three of the four motivations that we identified as drivers for companies' participation in OSS (Founder(s)' vision, Business advantage, Reputation--Table \ref{tab:motivationTable}) point to open sourcing internal tools and products as a way to contribute to OSS (see Figure \ref{fig:motivation}).

In our interviews, we could observe that companies contribute by open sourcing \inlinequote{platforms and frameworks (P11),} \inlinequote{tools (P1),} \inlinequote{internal code (P4),} \inlinequote{[product name] community editions (P11),} \inlinequote{SDKs (P12)} and \inlinequote{those things in between, those connectors (P7).} Contributing internal products to OSS is a win-win for both the companies and the OSS ecosystem. 

Our results suggest that the internal tool, when open-sourced, benefits the whole OSS ecosystem (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}) by enriching it with active projects that are backed up by one or more companies. For the company, the open-sourced tools provide a business advantage. For example, P7 describes such business advantage as \inlinequote{mak[ing] things easier for everyone using [company product]} and  \inlinequote{connect[ing] services that [company] does.}

Companies also reap the reputation benefit of open sourcing a novel solution, \inlinequote{a thing that does not exist} as P7 explains. 
The reputation benefit is magnified when such open-sourced tool is successful and widely adopted. For example, P4 explains \inlinequote{So [product name] is the thing that has the most success, and it's been adopted by a lot of companies... it's very impressive.}

Our results also suggest that when the question becomes \inlinequote{how much adoption they can get on what they give away (P10),} companies strategically donate their projects to an OSS foundation, signaling neutral governance. This, in return, helps sustain OSS foundations and the OSS ecosystem as a whole (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}). 

Still, when the donated project becomes an industry standard, the company starts to be seen as the leader in that space which increases the company's visibility and reputation. For instance, P4 explains \inlinequote{because if it [OSS project] becomes an industry standard, then you gain all of the benefits from being part of the standards. And if you actually came up with this standard, then you also get a lot of exposure.}



%-----------------end of SOFTWARE------------------------------

%------------TIME and LEADERSHIP/GOVERNANCE---------------------


%\textsc{Time:} 90\% of companies depend on open source code \cite{openSourceUse} and the companies represented by our interviewees were no exception. 


When \inlinequote{the basis of everything is open source dependencies (P4)} contributing time is companies' first response. This takes the form of developers' time (P4, P6, P7-P20), community relations' time (P1, P5-P10, P11, P14, P15, P20), [time] on advocacy \& promotion (P1, P5-P9, P11-P16), [time] addressing D\&I (P5, P6, P13, P17, P19, P20) and [time] on mentoring (P1, P2, P9, P12, P14, P17, P20).

\subsubsection{Developers' Time}
\label{sec:developertime}
Our results show that contributing time often starts in an informal manner, led by developers. For instance, P8 explains:  \inlinequote {In the process of using, we tend to contribute to things we do use.} More specifically, developers' time can take the form of \textit{ad hoc} contributions such as fixing bugs (P9, P10, P12, P13) or adding a feature (P4, P8, P10, P11), where engineers \inlinequote{contribute where they see a need...[as a] scratching your own itch kind of thing (P4)}.% as a \inlinequote{(P4).}

When there are \inlinequote{300 things that depend on this specific dependency (P4),} contributing time in an \textit{ad hoc} way is no longer a viable option. Companies step to the next level, investing developers' time in a more systematic way. This can take the form of assigning employees to work on an OSS dependency. For example, P11 shares how in their company there are \inlinequote{dozens of people who contribute to [dependency name] on a pretty regular basis.} Similarly, P10 explains \inlinequote{I had about between 35 and 50, people whose full-time job  was to work on open source projects that the company used.}
%and engineers whose \inlinequote{full-time job was to work on open source projects (P10).}%that the company used [P10]}.

%With the time investment that companies put into their dependencies

With the time invested in OSS dependencies, companies aspire their \inlinequote{contributors to eventually try to move into maintainer positions, approver positions, leadership (P11)} (P3, P8, P13, P15) (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}). This is particularly relevant for critical dependencies where \inlinequote{getting elected to leadership positions in these communities is really important (P3)} and allows companies to \inlinequote{help shepherd these projects forward (P18).}
Our results show that by investing developers' time in OSS dependencies, companies are sustaining the very projects that they depend on. This in turn (1) provides a business advantage and increases the company's reputation as one that \inlinequote{believe[s] there's a contribution wheel (P8)} and (2) benefits the OSS dependencies by maintaining a consistent contribution flow (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}). 


\subsubsection{Community Relations' Time}

Participants revealed that companies realize that it is necessary to build a relationship with the community to work in line with OSS, as mentioned by P9: \inlinequote{there are no special benefits to things in the open...if you're not able to build in the community.} This realization is at the core of companies investing time in community relations in addition to investing developers' time.

In this context, our results show that companies connect with OSS communities by holding open discussions (P5-P8, P15) which benefit both parties. P5 reported that, by doing this, \inlinequote{[the communities] learn more about what we're doing} and P15 complements it by saying that \inlinequote{[the company learns] what is it that people want.} These discussions include \inlinequote{talking about problems (P5),} \inlinequote{answer[ing] questions (P6),} and %when conflicts arise,
being open to compromise by \inlinequote{explaining the benefits, try to reducing the risks or problems of that solution, and trying to reach a better one (P7).} 

Some companies (P1, P11, P20) go the extra mile to help
foster community dynamics by organizing \inlinequote{contributor summits (P11)} and \inlinequote{events, where people [contributors] can come together (P20).} According to P20, this helps contributors to \inlinequote{meet each other.}% In addition, P11 mentioned that these events help the community attend \inlinequote{various community facing functions (P11).} 

Our findings suggest that contributing time to OSS is not only about contributing developers' time, but also spending time to nurture the community. P20 summarizes this as: \inlinequote{not just people spending time on code, but also people spending time on people}  which further magnifies the benefit to the project community (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}).


%---------------ADVOCACY AND PROMOTION-----------------------
%Motivation: Reputation + recipro
\subsubsection{Advocacy \& Promotion Time} Our participants indicated that several OSS projects are tied to the software itself, making a lot of companies' contributions code related. But company participation does not stop at that. As our participants mentioned, they also \inlinequote{contribute to the overall ecosystem by doing advocacy work (P13)} and promote the prevalence of OSS (P5-P8, P11-P16).

%[general advocacy]
According to our respondents, companies advocate for OSS by encouraging participation internally and externally. Internally, companies encourage their employees to contribute to a project of their choice in their free time and compensate such contribution. P5 explains: \inlinequote{we encouraged our staff to contribute to an open source project that mattered to them, and then submit it for reimbursement.}
Externally, not only do companies \inlinequote{bring to the community, the awareness of how much this [open source] is important (P6)} but they also promote OSS to other companies. This takes the form of leading by example and as P6 describes:  \inlinequote{show to other companies in the ecosystem, that even if you're not a product company, you still may be able to invest money, time, people to contribute.}

%and explaining \inlinequote{how can they [companies] be part of the open source community (P14).} 

According to our participants, companies also encourage people to contribute by creating and sharing the resources to help them do so. During the interviews, they mentioned that the creation of resources takes the form of \inlinequote{blog posts (P6)} (P5, P7, P8, P16), \inlinequote{podcasts (P7)} (P5), \inlinequote{documentation (P15)} (P6-P9, P11), creating content for \inlinequote{open source month (P16),} creating and sharing survey results (P12), and participating in OSS working groups to codify best practices (P1, P18). 

%While capturing the attention of potential new contributors is about \inlinequote{letting everybody know that contributing to open source is good (P6),} \inlinequote{try[ing] to bring people to contribute (P6)} is all about creating and sharing the resources to help them do so. Creating resources takes the form of \inlinequote{blog posts (P6)} (P5, P7, P8, P16), \inlinequote{podcasts (P7)} (P5), \inlinequote{documentation (P15)} (P6-P9, P11), creating content for \inlinequote{open source month (P16),} creating and sharing survey results (P12), and participating in OSS working groups to \inlinequote{capture and codify best practices (P18)} (P1). 

%The natural next step to creating content is \inlinequote{sharing learning and pain points [P7]}. This could be as general as sharing \inlinequote{best practice that we are implementing that many others are not [P6]} or as specific as describing \inlinequote{the different type of OSPO [Open Source Project Office] because we are not the most common OSPO [P7]}.

%While sharing learning points enriches the overall OSS ecosystem and the different OSS foundations and events where they take place, some sharing practices directly benefit the OSS dependencies (see Figure \ref{fig:benefit}). 
%This happens when companies, for instance, use their \inlinequote{popular blogs and social media channels [P11]} to share dependency-related content such as \inlinequote{general [dependency] concepts... how you use it... pitfalls we found [P8]} thus \inlinequote{giv[ing] visibility to some of these projects [P11]} (see Figure \ref{fig:benefit}). 

%[creating event, hackathons and conferences]
We found that, while companies advocate OSS through attending existing conferences and events (P5, P7-P9, P11-P14), some take advocacy a step further by launching their own conferences, events, or hackathons (P1, P6, P7, P9, P11, P12, P20). These events help attract new OSS players by, for example, launching hackathons to help initiate newcomers to \inlinequote{solving some social issues (P6)} or promoting an OSS technology by \inlinequote{starting a conference... talking about open sourcing cloud (P7).}

%Companies also help nurture their existent contributor base by organizing \inlinequote{contributor summits [P11]} to help with contributors' experience and \inlinequote{various community facing functions [P11]} which further magnifies the benefit to the project community (see Figure \ref{fig:benefit}).

%---------------------ADDRESSING D\&I------------------------
\subsubsection{Time Addressing D\&I} 
The participants (P5, P6, P13, P17, P19, P20) mentioned that their companies invest time and effort in addressing OSS Diversity and Inclusion (D\&I) issues. 

We could observe that the companies the interviewees work for contribute to the overall welfare of the OSS ecosystem (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}) by investing effort in  \inlinequote{understanding how to be inclusive (P17),} understanding \inlinequote{diversity, equity inclusion initiatives (P20)} and understanding the ins and outs of the \inlinequote{code of conduct (P17).}

Once companies are well aware of the meaning and stakes of D\&I, they start thinking about different perspectives: \inlinequote{how to have these sorts of conversations (P20),} \inlinequote{how to support someone who is in, you know, feeling threatened, or unwelcome (P17)} and \inlinequote{how to have recognition and allyship (P20).}

%Who's missing? Why are they missing? Who's not talking? Why aren't they talking?[P17]

Only after building an understanding, do the companies start addressing D\&I issues. For some companies, this takes the form of \inlinequote{investing in more programs and initiatives that we hope will help just to improve that aspect of things [D\&I] (P20).} For other companies, it is more specific, focusing on geolocation diversity in OSS by contributing to OSS in their country of origin (P6). P5 shared that their company contributes to D\&I in OSS by partnering \inlinequote{with an organization that helps people learn how to develop. They come from an underserved population} and 
hiring \inlinequote{developers in countries that are less developed.} %and %, maybe they've never gone to college, or maybe they're doing a career transition [P5]}. 

%Interventions like these can help enrich the OSS ecosystem by bringing new faces in, and with that comes \inlinequote{more ideas from different cultures' perspectives and that also enrich[es] this innovation [P19]} thus closing the circle on the \inlinequote{virtuous cycle [P5]}.

%----------------END OF ADDRESSING D\&I------------------------



%--------------------MENTORING---------------------------
\subsubsection{Mentoring Time} Companies contribute to OSS by participating in mentoring initiatives, whether it be in a formal or informal capacity. By doing so, companies help attract and retain different OSS players, from individuals to other companies. This, in return, benefits the whole OSS ecosystem and ensures the continuity of different mentoring programs (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}).

When it comes to informal mentoring, our findings show that companies give back to OSS by \inlinequote{mentoring people and always inviting others to contribute (P1)} (P14, P17). This is not only limited to individual contributors (e.g., newcomers) but also extends to helping companies that are not necessarily in the technical industry (e.g., ``manufacturing organizations,'' ``hospitals'' (P14)). According to P14, this is important since these companies \inlinequote{are struggling trying to figure out how to do this [open source].}

Whereas in formal mentoring, some companies run internship programs both internally and externally such as Google Summer of Code or Google Season of Docs (a mentorship program that nurtures technical writers). Other companies mentor aspiring contributors through these very same mentorship programs (P2, P9, P12). For instance, P9 mentioned
 \inlinequote{working with specific programs, like Google Summer of Code programs.} 


At times, these programs can attract contributors and potential hires. For instance, P9's experience with mentorship programs resulted in \inlinequote{candidacies of folks that are willing to work with us.} Or, in the case of P2, \inlinequote{some contributors coming from Google Summer of Code (P2).} 

%and providing \inlinequote{overall positive force for the projects (P20).}
%-------------------END that donG---------------------

%---------------FINANCIAL SUPPORT-----------------------
\subsubsection{Financial Support} According to our interviewees, the companies participate in OSS by supporting one or multiple entities in the open source ecosystem. This can take the form of money set aside to support maintainers, foundations, patronage programs, and sponsoring events.

%Not only do companies \inlinequote{set aside time (P18)} but also \inlinequote{money to work with open source (P18)} (P16, P20).
Our participants mentioned that companies participate in OSS financially \inlinequote{maintaining the health of overall open source ecosystems (P15)} by: contributing money to dependencies (P4, P8, P5), hosting patronage programs (P4, P5), supporting maintainers (P5, P12), sponsoring events (P5, P11, P12, P15), foundations (P11, P12, P15, P16) and mentorship programs (P12) (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}). 

Similar to investing time on projects that companies depend on, companies are also \inlinequote{more likely to patron that project if we're using it (P5).} This takes the form of \inlinequote{set[ting] aside a certain amount (P5)} (P8) to help these projects \inlinequote{pay the bills, and just like dedicate time for coding (P4).} A more specific way that companies invest money in dependencies is by directly supporting the maintainers (P5, P12, P15) through, for instance, \inlinequote{hiring open source maintainers full time (P12).} 

While providing direct financial support to OSS dependencies helps ensure the health and dependability of specific projects, companies also believe in supporting OSS foundations. For instance, P12 explained that \inlinequote{if we don't also think about supporting the foundations that provide a home for those projects, then we're not really going to solve the problem in its entirety.} Our results show that companies \inlinequote{give a lot of money to foundations (P11)} (P12, P15) to \inlinequote{pay for infrastructure (P15)} and \inlinequote{to pay people to do all the things that they do...to support the open source projects (P11).} This opens the door for companies to be involved in \inlinequote{safety and security (P8)} conversations that are usually \inlinequote{exclusive to sponsored members (P8).}

\subsection{Tying it together: A summary}
Having described the motivations that lead companies to contribute to OSS and the different ways companies contribute to OSS, we now tie everything together, summarize our findings, and discuss lessons learned from our interviewees on OSS sportsmanship and being a good OSS citizen.

With 97\% of companies using and relying on OSS \cite{ossCompanyPercent}, profit aside, companies' well-being is now tied to OSS' well-being where the investment in OSS is not just linked to a short-term profit, but rather an investment in the future. Companies invest in reciprocal contributions such as mentoring and advocacy and promotion, as well as addressing D\&I issues, and go as far as archiving OSS code in the Arctic for future generations~\cite{githubArcticOSS}.

Companies are realizing that OSS is also about innovation, being part of the collective brain power, being a humble participant, and doing good for the community.
Company participation in the OSS ecosystem is multi-faceted, beneficial to different entities (see Figure \ref{fig:contribute}), and intertwined with different motivations (see Figure \ref{fig:motivation}). Figure \ref{fig:motivation} depicts how the different types of company contributions (right-hand side) flow from the different motivations (left-hand side).

Increasing reputation by contributing to OSS was one of the most prevalent motivations. Companies increase their reputation not only by open-sourcing tools and products and investing their developers' time but also gain visibility by investing in non-code related activities (e.g., advocacy \& promotion, mentoring).

While companies also contribute time (developers' and community relations), financial support, and software to maintain their business advantage, being a good OSS citizen is a pertinent driver for a variety of contributions. In fact, companies see the benefit in being a humble OSS participant where they do not just take from, but also give back to the community (see reciprocity, Figure \ref{fig:motivation}). One key aspect was taking the time to address issues of Diversity and Inclusion (D\&I). D\&I is an important topic in open source yet a challenging one to address. When companies, that have the tools, resources, and experience, take the initiative to champion D\&I in OSS, it is a significant step forward.

\end{figure}

%While companies recognize the impact of OSS on their business and profit, 
Being a good OSS citizen (see Table \ref{table:sportsmanshipTable}) was seen as key to healthy OSS participation. One way to do so is by \inlinequote{contribut[ing] in the way that makes sense to the project, which may or may not always be, again, what the company would want (P20).} This entails placing the community's needs first and helping out with maintenance tasks.
%, and to parts of the project that they are benefiting from. 

In order to participate in an OSS ecosystem, an open source program in a company needs to be \inlinequote{able to speak multiple languages (P10)}: risk management, engineering benefits, legal \& compliance, and sponsorship, to be able to advocate OSS to \inlinequote{different levels of leadership. And showing how open source helps the business (P18).} 

%Another, is by \inlinequote{tak[ing] that technical depth task that clean out things, that restructure things (P7)} and lessening maintainers burnout.
Finally, it is good to have an abandonware strategy. To create a sustainable project, companies need to open-source projects they use and care about internally. It is also important to have a contingency plan if the project does go out of sync internally by \inlinequote{transfer[ing] it to people who care about them [abandoned project] (P4).} Ensuring that the project does not become a company monopoly and has affiliation diversity is a good step in avoiding abandonment crisis.

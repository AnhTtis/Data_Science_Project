% \section{Appendix}
% Any low-level implementation details—rules and pre-/post-processing steps, features, hyperparameters, etc.—that would help the reader to replicate your system and experiments, but are not necessary to understand major design points of the system and experiments. Any figures or results that aren’t crucial to the main points in your paper but might help an interested reader delve deeper.

% If you feel like it, you might here show a picture of the person you chose for your TIRA code name and say a few words of who they are and what inspired you to pick their name from the list.

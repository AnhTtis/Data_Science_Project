\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present AVFormer, a lightweight method for adapting existing, frozen state-of-the-art ASR models for AV-ASR. Our approach is practical and achieves impressive zero-shot performance. 
As ASR models get larger and larger, tuning the entire parameter set of pre-trained models becomes impractical for different domains. Our method seamlessly allows both domain transfer and visual input mixing in the same, parameter efficient model. 

% and the public availability of large, pretrained audio only ASR models such as BEST-RQ~\cite{chiu2022self}, w2v-BERT~\cite{chung2021w2v} and HuBERT~\cite{hsu2021hubert}.

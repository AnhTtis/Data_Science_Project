In this section, we introduce FishDreamer -- a novel approach capable of simultaneously achieving reliable extrapolation of fisheye images and a full-FoV semantic segmentation for both visible and previously unseen areas within fisheye images. 
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview},  FishDreamer comprises four modules: the feature extraction backbone  based on the Swin Transformer~\cite{liu2021swin} (Sec.~\ref{sec:feature_extractor}), the outpainting module (Sec.~\ref{sec:outpainting}), the semantic decoder based on UPerNet~\cite{xiao2018unified} (Sec.~\ref{sec:segmentation}) and the Polar-aware Cross Attention (PCA) mechanism (Sec.~\ref{sec:polar_aware_cross_attention}).

Next, we will provide a comprehensive description of each module and their respective roles within the FishDreamer framework.

In this paper, we look into fisheye semantic completion, a novel task addressing the  extended field of view  perception in terms of simultaneous  image sensing and semantic understanding.
To tackle this challenge, we propose FishDreamer to intertwine image outpainting and segmentation via polar-aware cross attention, which guides outpainting with extended semantic contextual information in the annular dimension.
We establish Cityscapes-BF and KITTI360-BF benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of driving scene understanding beyond fisheye vision.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed polar-aware cross attention and FishDreamer over its counterparts.

In this future, we intend to introduce conditional diffusion models to enhance the completion and investigate the generalization of FishDreamer on real fisheye images.

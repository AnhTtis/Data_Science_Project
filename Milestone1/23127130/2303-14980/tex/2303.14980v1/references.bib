   abstract = {By the beginning of 1990, three third-generation synchrotron light sources had been successfully commissioned in Grenoble, Berkeley and Trieste (ESRF, ALS and ELETTRA). Each of these new machines reached their target specifications without any significant problems. In parallel, already at that time discussions were underway regarding the next generation, the `diffraction-limited light source (DLSR)', which featured sub-nm rad electron beam emittance, photon beam brilliance exceeding 10(22) and the potential to emit coherent radiation. Also, at about that time, a first design for a 3 GeV DLSR was developed, based on a modified multiple-bend achromat (MBA) design leading to a lattice with normalized emittance of x = 0.5 nm rad. The novel feature of the MBA lattice was the use of seven vertically focusing bend magnets with different bending angles throughout the achromat cell to keep the radiation integrals and resulting beam emittance low. The baseline design called for a 400 m ring circumference with 12 straight sections of 6 m length. The dynamic aperture behaviour of the DLSR lattice was estimated to produce > 5 h beam lifetime at 100 mA stored beam current.},

  abstract     = {{To reach the real diffraction-limited emittance, it is generally required to increase the number of bends in multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices that are used in the designs of fourth-generation synchrotron light sources. For an MBA lattice with distributed chromatic correction, more bends mean much tighter space and much stronger magnets. Inspired by the hybrid MBA lattice concept, in this paper we propose a new lattice concept called complex unit lattice cell, which can save space and reduce magnet strengths. A 17BA lattice based on the complex unit cell concept is designed for a 3 GeV synchrotron light source with a circumference of 537.6 m, which reaches a natural emittance of about 21 pm·rad. Comparison is also made between this 17BA lattice and the 17BA lattice with distributed chromatic correction to demonstrate the merit of the complex unit cell concept.}},

abstract = {On top of the genetic algorithm enhanced by machine learning for nonlinear lattice optimization, as proposed in Li et al. (2018), an improved repopulation technique has been developed. Different weight coefficients for defining the “elite cluster” were compared to discern the fastest convergence in two classic optimization test problems. The volume of the parameter space for generating potentially competitive candidates was further confined by repopulation in the vicinity of randomly selected “elite seeds”. The new repopulation technique significantly improves the quality of newly populated candidates by excluding the less competitive seeds introduced by the old repopulation algorithm. This technique has been validated, having a faster convergence for test problems first, and then applied to the nonlinear lattice optimization for the High Energy Photon Source storage ring.}

    "abstract": "Response functions of resonant circuits create ringing artefacts if their input changes rapidly. When physical limits of electromagnetic spectroscopies are explored, this creates two types of problems. Firstly, simulation: the system must be propagated accurately through every response transient, this may be computationally expensive. Secondly, optimal control: circuit response must be taken into account; it may be advantageous to design pulses that are resilient to such distortions. At the root of both problems is the popular piecewise-constant approximation for control sequences in the rotating frame; in magnetic resonance it has persisted since the earliest days and has become entrenched in the commercially available hardware. In this paper, we report an implementation and benchmarks of recent Lie-group methods that can efficiently simulate and optimise smooth control sequences.",

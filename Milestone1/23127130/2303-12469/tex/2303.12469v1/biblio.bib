A very general framework for the convergence study of finite volume methods is provided and then used to establish the convergence of the new method. Fairly general meshes are covered and a computable sufficient criterion for coercivity is provided. In order to guarantee consistency in the presence of heterogeneous diffusivity, we introduce a non-standard test space in $H_0^1$ and prove its density. Thorough assessment on a set of anisotropic heterogeneous problems as well as a comparison with classical multi-point Finite Volume methods is provided. },

  abstract  = {We are concerned with ow in a porous medium such as granite or sedimentary rock. Natural fractures occur in the rock and it is necessary to take them into account because they have a profound e ect on the transport of the uid. One can distinguish two types of fractures : numerous small fractures that can be treated with a double porosity model Arb90], KPL94], and more important fractures that one may wish to model individually using domain decomposition. The latter is the topic of this article. The fractures that we are concerned with are lled with debris so we consider them as porous media. The permeability in the fracture is large in comparison with that in the surrounding rock, so the uid circulates faster in the fracture. Thus we have a highly heterogeneous porous medium. One idea that has been used to take this into account is to treat the fracture as an interface and to assume that the uid that ows into the fracture stays in the fracture. In fact, in many models the contrast in permeabilities is of such an order that the ow outside of the fracture is neglected. However, here we are concerned with the situation in which the exchange between the fracture and the rest of the domain is signi cant. To deal with this case we need to model both what happens in the fracture and what happens outside the fracture. One idea is to use domain decomposition treating each fracture as a separate sub-domain.This approach however, leads to well known di culties due to the small width of a fracture in comparison with the size of the domain. The idea presented here is to use a domain decomposition model with the fractures as natural interfaces, and to model what happens in the interfaces. In this article, we shall consider only the simplest case with two sub-domains separated by one fracture. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we indicate how the model is derived, and in section 3, we show that the corresponding problem has a unique solution. In section 4, we de ne the mixed nite element formulation and reduce the problem to an interface problem. Numerical results are given in Section 5.},

  abstract  = {A new formulation is presented for the modeling of immiscible compressible two-phase flow in porous media taking into account gravity, capillary effects, and heterogeneity. The formulation is intended for the numerical simulation of multidimensional flows and is fully equivalent to the original equations, contrary to the one introduced in [G. Chavent and J. Jaffr{\'e}, Mathematical models and finite elements for reservoir simulation, Stud. Math. Appl., 17, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1986; Zbl 0603.76101]. The main feature of this formulation is the introduction of a global pressure. The resulting equations are written in a fractional flow formulation and lead to a coupled system which consists of a nonlinear parabolic equation (the global pressure equation) and a nonlinear diffusion-convection equation (the saturation equation) which can be efficiently solved numerically. A finite volume method is used to solve the global pressure equation and the saturation equation for the water and gas phase in the context of gas migration through engineered and geological barriers for a deep repository for radioactive waste. Numerical results for the one-dimensional problem are presented. The accuracy of the fully equivalent fractional flow model is demonstrated through comparison with the simplified model already developed in [op. cit.].},

  abstract  = {Modeling reactive transport in porous media, using a local chemical equilibrium assumption, leads to a system of advection-diffusion PDEs coupled with algebraic equations. When solving this coupled system, the algebraic equations have to be solved at each grid point for each chemical species and at each time step. This leads to a coupled non-linear system. In this paper, a global solution approach that enables to keep the software codes for transport and chemistry distinct is proposed. The method applies the Newton-Krylov framework to the formulation for reactive transport used in operator splitting. The method is formulated in terms of total mobile and total fixed concentrations and uses the chemical solver as a black box, as it only requires that one be able to solve chemical equilibrium problems (and compute derivatives) without having to know the solution method. An additional advantage of the Newton-Krylov method is that the Jacobian is only needed as an operator in a Jacobian matrix times vector product. The proposed method is tested on the MoMaS reactive transport benchmark.},

It is issued from a generalization to vector elliptic problems of a previous model stated for scalar problems with jump boundary conditions [2,3]. The proposed model is first proved to be well-posed in the whole fictitious domain and some sub-models are identified. A family of fictitious domain methods can be then derived within the same unified formulation which provides various interface or boundary conditions, e.g. a given stress of Neumann or Fourier type or a velocity Dirichlet condition. In particular, we prove the consistency of the given-traction E.B.C. method including the so-called do nothing outflow boundary condition.},

  abstract  = {This study concerns some asymptotic models used to compute the flow outside and inside fractures in a bidimensional porous medium. The flow is governed by the Darcy law both in the fractures and in the porous matrix with large discontinuities in the permeability tensor. These fractures are supposed to have a small thickness with respect to the macroscopic length scale, so that we can asymptotically reduce them to immersed polygonal fault interfaces and the model finally consists in a coupling between a 2D elliptic problem and a 1D equation on the sharp interfaces modelling the fractures. A cell-centered finite volume scheme on general polygonal meshes fitting the interfaces is derived to solve the set of equations with the additional differential transmission conditions linking both pressure and normal velocity jumps through the interfaces. We prove the convergence of the FV scheme for any set of data and parameters of the models and derive existence and uniqueness of the solution to the asymptotic models proposed. The models are then numerically experimented for highly or partially immersed fractures. Some numerical results are reported showing different kinds of flows in the case of impermeable or partially/highly permeable fractures. The influence of the variation of the aperture of the fractures is also investigated. The numerical solutions of the asymptotic models are validated by comparing them to the solutions of the global Darcy model or to some analytic solutions.},

Consequently, we propose a weighting that results in an estimate for the stabilization parameter such that the method remains well behaved in varied settings ranging from the configuration of embedded interfaces resulting in arbitrarily small elements to such cases where a large contrast in material properties exists. An important consequence of this weighting is that the bulk as well as the interfacial fields remain well behaved in the presence of (a) elements with arbitrarily small volume fractions, (b) large material heterogeneities and (c) both large heterogeneities as well as arbitrarily small elements. We then highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed formulation through numerical examples, focusing particular attention on interfacial quantities of interest.},

  abstract   = {It is shown that there exists a weak solution to a degenerate and singular elliptic-parabolic partial integro-differential system of equations. These equations model two-phase incompressible flow of immiscible fluids in either an ordinary porous medium or in a naturally fractured porous medium. The full model is of dual-porosity type, though the single porosity case is covered by setting the matrix-to-fracture flow terms to zero. This matrix-to-fracture flow is modeled simply in terms of fracture quantities; that is, no distinct matrix equations arise. The equations are considered in a global pressure formulation that is justified by appealing to a physical relation between the degeneracy of the wetting fluid's mobility and the singularity of the capillary pressure function. In this formulation, the elliptic and parabolic parts of the system are separated; hence, it is natural to consider various boundary conditions, including mixed nonhomogeneous, saturation dependent ones of the first three types. A weak solution is obtained as a limit of solutions to discrete time problems. The proof makes no use of the corresponding regularized system. The hypotheses required for various earlier results on single-porosity systems are weakened so that only physically relevant assumptions are made. In particular, the results cover the cases of a singular capillary pressure function, a pure Neumann boundary condition, and an arbitrary initial condition.},

  abstract   = {We consider the approximation properties of quadrilateral finite element spaces of vector fields defined by the Piola transform, extending results previously obtained for scalar approximation. The finite element spaces are constructed starting with a given finite dimensional space of vector fields on a square reference element, which is then transformed to a space of vector fields on each convex quadrilateral element via the Piola transform associated to a bilinear isomorphism of the square onto the element. For affine isomorphisms, a necessary and sufficient condition for approximation of order r + 1 in L2 is that each component of the given space of functions on the reference element contain all polynomial functions of total degree at most r . In the case of bilinear isomorphisms, the situation is more complicated and we give a precise characterization of what is needed for optimal order L2 -approximation of the function and of its divergence. As applications, we demonstrate degradation of the convergence order on quadrilateral meshes as compared to rectangular meshes for some standard finite element approximations of H (div). We also derive new estimates for approximation by quadrilateral Raviart--Thomas elements (requiring less regularity) and propose a new quadrilateral finite element space which provides optimal order approximation in H (div). Finally, we demonstrate the theory with numerical computations of mixed and least squares finite element approximations of the solution of Poisson's equation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we construct new finite element methods for the approximation of the equations of linear elasticity in three space dimensions that produce direct approximations to both stresses and displacements. The methods are based on a modified form of the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle that only weakly imposes the symmetry condition on the stresses. Although this approach has been previously used by a number of authors, a key new ingredient here is a constructive derivation of the elasticity complex starting from the de Rham complex. By mimicking this construction in the discrete case, we derive new mixed finite elements for elasticity in a systematic manner from known discretizations of the de Rham complex. These elements appear to be simpler than the ones previously derived. For example, we construct stable discretizations which use only piecewise linear elements to approximate the stress field and piecewise constant functions to approximate the displacement field.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the major difficulties of modelling fluid flow processes in hard-rock geologies is the complex nature of the porosity systems. Hydraulic behaviour in these rock masses is characterized by both porous and fractured interflow zones. Traditionally, fractured-porous rocks have been modelled as an equivalent porous medium or as a system of fractures separated by impermeable blocks. A new method is proposed that unifies these two approaches for modelling fluid flow processes in fractured-porous media. The basic idea is to use a combination of isoparametric elements for the porous zones and line elements for the fractures. The coupling between the governing equations for each element type is achieved using the superposition principle. The effectiveness of the new approach is demonstrated by comparing numerical solutions with known solutions for problems of flow and solute transport in fractured-porous media.},

  abstract  = {The numerical approximation of the Laplace equation with inhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions in 2D with lowest-order Raviart-Thomas mixed finite elements is realized in three flexible and short MATLAB programs. The first, hybrid, implementation ({\tt LMmfem}) assumes that the discrete function $p\_h(x)$ equals $a+bx$ for $x$ with unknowns $a\in\Bbb R^2$ and $b\in\Bbb R$ on each element and then enforces $p\_h\in H({\rm div},\Omega)$ through Lagrange multipliers. The second, direct, approach ({\tt EBmfem}) utilizes edge-basis functions $(\psi\_E\colon E\in\scr E)$ as an explicit basis of $RT\_0$ with the edgewise constant flux normal $p\_h\cdot\nu\_E$ as a degree of freedom. The third ansatz ({\tt CRmfem}) utilizes the $P1$ nonconforming finite element method due to Crouzeix and Raviart and then postprocesses the discrete flux via a technique due to Marini. It is the aim of this paper to derive, document, illustrate, and validate the three MATLAB implementations {\tt EBmfem}, {\tt LMmfem}, and {\tt CRmfem} for further use and modification in education and research. A posteriori error control with a reliable and efficient averaging technique is included to monitor the discretization error. Emphasis is on the correct treatment of mixed boundary conditions. Numerical examples illustrate some applications of the provided software and the quality of the error estimation.},

If a finite element approximation is used with a mesh that is fitted isoparametrically to $\Gamma$ with elements of degree $k-1$, with $k\ge2$, the standard Galerkin method achieves the optimal rate of convergence in the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms.

  abstract = {In this note we propose a finite element method for incompressible (or compressible) elasticity problems with discontinuous modulus of elasticity (or, if compressible, Poisson's ratio). The problem is written in mixed form using $P^1$-continuous displacements and elementwise $P^0$ pressures, leading to the possibility of eliminating the pressure beforehand in the compressible case. In the incompressible case, the method is augmented by a stabilization term, penalizing the pressure jumps. We show a priori error estimates under a certain regularity hypothesis. In particular we prove that if the exact solution is sufficiently smooth in each subdomain then the convergence order is optimal.},

  abstract = {We study the numerical approximation to the solution of the steady convection-diffusion equation. The diffusion term is discretized by using the hybrid mimetic method (HMM), which is the unified formulation for the hybrid finite-volume (FV) method, the mixed FV method and the mimetic finite-difference method recently proposed in Droniou et al. (2010, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 20, 265-295). In such a setting we discuss several techniques to discretize the convection term that are mainly adapted from the literature on FV or FV schemes. For this family of schemes we provide a full proof of convergence under very general regularity conditions of the solution field and derive an error estimate when the scalar solution is in H2($\Omega$). Finally, we compare the performance of these schemes on a set of test cases selected from the literature in order to document the accuracy of the numerical approximation in both diffusion- and convection-dominated regimes. Moreover, we numerically investigate the behaviour of these methods in the approximation of solutions with boundary layers or internal regions with strong gradients.},

After setting the problem in the frequency domain, we deal with the state equation, which is a Helmholtz partial differential equation. We show the existence of a unique solution and analyze a finite element approximation when the source term is a Dirac delta measure. Two optimization problems are successively considered. The first one concerns the choice of phases and amplitudes of the actuators to minimize the noise at the sensors' location. The second oneconsists of determining the optimal actuators' placement. Both problems are then numerically solved. Error estimates are settled and numerical results for some tests are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In recent papers [1,2] the authors introduced a new method for simulating subsurface flow in a system of fractures based on a PDE-constrained optimization reformulation, removing all difficulties related to mesh generation and providing an easily parallel approach to the problem. In this paper we further improve the method removing the constraint of having on each fracture a non-empty portion of the boundary with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This way, Dirichlet boundary conditions are prescribed only on a possibly small portion of \{DFN\} boundary. The proposed generalization of the method in [1,2] relies on a modified definition of control variables ensuring the non-singularity of the operator on each fracture. A conjugate gradient method is also introduced in order to speed up the minimization process. },

  Abstract                 = {A novel framework for solving variational problems and partial differential equations for scalar and vector-valued data defined on surfaces is introduced in this paper. The key idea is to implicitly represent the surface as the level set of a higher dimensional function and to solve the surface equations in a fixed Cartesian coordinate system using this new embedding function. The equations are then both intrinsic to the surface and defined in the embedding space. This approach thereby eliminates the need for performing complicated and inaccurate computations on triangulated surfaces, as is commonly done in the literature. We describe the framework and present examples in computer graphics and image processing applications, including texture synthesis, flow field visualization, and image and vector field intrinsic regularization for data defined on 3D surfaces. },

  abstract  = {Fractional flow formulations of the multi-phase flow equations exhibit several attractive attributes for numerical simulations. The governing equations are a saturation equation having an advection diffusion form, for which characteristic methods are suited, and a global pressure equation whose form is elliptic. The fractional flow approach to the governing equations is compared with other approaches and the implication of equation form for numerical methods discussed. The fractional flow equations are solved with a modified method of characteristics for the saturation equation and a finite element method for the pressure equation. An iterative algorithm for determination of the general boundary conditions is implemented. Comparisons are made with a numerical method based on the two-pressure formulation of the governing equations. While the fractional flow approach is attractive for model problems, the performance of numerical methods based on these equations is relatively poor when the method is applied to general boundary conditions. We expect similar difficulties with the fractional flow approach for more general problems involving heterogenous material properties and multiple spatial dimensions.},

The basic idea is to consider the structure as a part of the fluid where additional forces are applied and additional mass is localized. The forces exerted by the structure on the fluid are taken into account as a source term in the Navier-Stokes equations and are mathematically described as a Dirac delta function lying along the immersed structure. In this paper we first review on various ways of modeling the elastic forces in different physical situations. Then we focus on the discretization of the immersed boundary method by means of finite elements which can handle the Dirac delta function variationally avoiding the introduction of its regolarization. Practical computational aspects are described and some preliminary numerical experiment in two dimensions are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a mass conservative finite element approach of second order accuracy for the numerical approximation of reactive solute transport in porous media modeled by a coupled system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The lowest order Brezzi--Douglas--Marini (BDM1) mixed finite element method is used. A modification based on the hybrid form of the approach is suggested for the discretiza tion of the advective term. It is demonstrated numerically that this leads to optimal second order convergence of the flux variable. The modification improves the convergence behavior of the classical BDM1 scheme, which is known to be suboptimal of first order accuracy only for advection--diffusion problems; cf. [8]. Moreover, the new scheme shows more robustness for high P{\'e}clet numbers than the classical approach. A comparison with the Raviart--Thomas element (RT1) of second order accuracy for the approximation of the flux variable is also presented. For the case of strongly advection-dominated problems we propose a full upwind scheme. Various numerical studies, including also a nonlinear test problem, are presented to illustrate the numerical performance properties of the considered numerical methods}

  abstract  = {Although multicomponent reactive transport modeling is gaining wider application in various geoscience fields, it continues to present significant mathematical and computational challenges. There is a need to solve and compare the solutions to complex benchmark problems, using a variety of codes, because such intercomparisons can reveal promising numerical solution approaches and increase confidence in the application of reactive transport codes. In this contribution, the results and performance of five current reactive transport codes are compared for the 1D and 2D subproblems of the so-called easy test case of the MoMaS benchmark (Carrayrou et al., Comput Geosci, 2009, this issue). This benchmark presents a simple fictitious reactive transport problem that highlights the main numerical difficulties encountered in real reactive transport problems. As a group, the codes include iterative and noniterative operator splitting and global implicit solution approaches. The 1D easy advective and 1D easy diffusive scenarios were solved using all codes, and, in general, there was a good agreement, with solution discrepancies limited to regions with rapid concentration changes. Computational demands were typically consistent with what was expected for the various solution approaches. The differences between solutions given by the three codes solving the 2D problem are more important. The very high computing effort required by the 2D problem illustrates the importance of parallel computations. The most important outcome of the benchmark exercise is that all codes are able to generate comparable results for problems of significant complexity and computational difficulty.},

Chavent and J. Jaffr{\'e}, Mathematical models and finite elements for reservoir simulation, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1986; Zbl 0603.76101]. In this formulation, the total volumetric flow of the three fluids and the global pressure follow a classical Darcy law, which simplifies the resolution of the pressure equation. However, this global pressure formulation exists only for total differential (TD) three-phase data, which depend only on two functions of saturation and global pressure: the global capillary pressure and the global mobility. Hence we introduce the class of interpolation which constructs such TD-three-phase data from any set of three two-phase data (for each pair of fluids) which satisfy a TD-compatibility condition.},

  abstract   = {A new resolution of parabolic and elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) based on the mixed finite element approximation on triangles has been recently developed [24,25]. This new approach reduces the number of unknowns from fluxes or Lagrange multiplier defined on edges to a single unknown per element. In this paper, we analyze this transformation mathematically, and describe in details how to handle singular elements and singular edges. For these singular elements, the standard mixed method on triangles can always be made equivalent to a finite volume formulation, where the finite volumes are obtained by aggregation of finite elements across singular edges. The positive definiteness of the system matrix obtained with the new formulation is analyzed in details. A criterion is given concerning the property of this matrix which show that its conditioning is related to the shape of the triangle and the contrast in parameters from one element to the adjacent ones. Numerical experiments are performed for elliptic and parabolic PDEs. The comparisons between an iterative solver (PCG) and a direct solver (unifrontal/multifrontal) show that the direct solver is more efficient. Moreover, its performance is not correlated with the system matrix conditioning. It appears that the new formulation requires significantly less CPU time for elliptic PDEs and is competitive for parabolic PDEs. The new formulation remains also accurate enough even in nearly singular situations.},

The nonlinear system is written in a fractional flow formulation, i.e., in terms of a saturation and a global pressure. The saturation equation is approximated by a finite element method, while the pressure equation is treated by a mixed finite element method. The analysis is carried out first for the case where the capillary diffusion coefficient is assumed to be uniformly positive, and is then extended to a degenerate case where the diffusion coefficient can be zero. It is shown that error estimates of optimal order in the $L^2$-norm and almost optimal order in the $L^\infty$-norm can be obtained in the nondegenerate case. In the degenerate case we consider a regularization of the saturation equation by perturbing the diffusion coefficient. The norm of error estimates depends on the severity of the degeneracy in diffusivity, with almost optimal order convergence for nonsevere degeneracy. Implementation of the fractional flow formulation with various nonhomogeneous boundary conditions is also discussed. Results of numerical experiments using the present approach for modeling groundwater flow in porous media are reported.},

This global formulation is preferred since it reduces the couplingbetween the pressure and saturation equations, compared to phase or weighted formulations. It simplifies the numerical analysis of the problem and boosts its computational efficiency. However, this global pressure approach exists only for three-phase data (relative permeabilities, capillary pressures) which satisfy a TD condition. Such TD three-phase data are determined by the choice of a global capillary pressure function and a global mobility function, which take both saturations and global pressure level as argument. Boundary conditions for global capillary pressure and global mobility are given such that the corre sponding three-phase data are consistent with a given set of three two-phase data. Thenumerical construction of global capillary pressure and global mobility functions by C1 and C0 finite element is then performed using bi-Laplacian and Laplacian interpolation. Examples of the corresponding TD three-phase data are given for a compressible and an incompressible case.},

The methods fitting in the framework are a general class of mixed-dual finite element methods including hybridized mixed, continuous Galerkin, nonconforming, and a new, wide class of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. The distinctive feature of the methods in this framework is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the solution defined only on the boundaries of the elements. Since the associated matrix is sparse, symmetric, and positive definite, these methods can be effciently implemented. Moreover, the framework allows, in a single implementation, the use of different methods in different elements or subdomains of the computational domain, which are then automatically coupled. Finally, theframework brings about a new point of view, thanks to which it is possible to see how to devise novel methods displaying very localized and simple mortaring techniques, as well as methods permitting an even further reduction of the number of globally coupled degreesof freedom.},

These robust and accurate methods have made their way into the main stream of computational fluid dynamics and are quickly finding use in a wide variety of applications. They combine a special class of Runge-Kutta time discretizations that allows the method to be non-linearly stable regardless of its accuracy, with a finite element space discretization by discontinuous approximations, and that incorporates the ideas of numerical fluxes and slope limiters coined during the remarkable development of high-resolution finite difference and finite volume schemes. The resulting RKDG methods are stable, high-order accurate, and highly parallelizable schemes that can easily handle complicated geometries and boundary conditions. We review the theoretical and algorithmic apsects of these methods and show several applications including nonlinear conservation laws, the compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and Hamilton-Jacobi equations.},

Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods.

  abstract  = {We investigate a degenerate, linear, periodic advection-diffusion equation in one dimension. The problem is hyperbolic in a subinterval and parabolic in the complement with boundary conditions that impose periodicity of the advective-diffusive flux to ensure mass conservation. To select the `physically acceptable' solution as the limit of vanishing viscosity solutions, continuity of the solution at the parabolic to hyperbolic interface is imposed, following F. Gastaldi and A. Quarteroni [Appl. Numer. Math. 6 (1989/90), no. 1-2, 3--31; MR1045016 (91d:65200)]. Using this condition, we establish the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the framework of the evolution linear semi-groups theory. We also discuss the regularity of the solution when the initial condition is too rough to be in the domain of the evolution operator. We then present reference solutions obtained using this additional interface condition. These solutions can be used to test the robustness of numerical schemes. Finally, we discuss the numerical results of an upwind scheme, a finite volume box-scheme, and a local discontinuous Galerkin method. These three schemes, which do not explicitly enforce the additional interface condition, automatically select the physically acceptable solution, with the latter two schemes being more accurate.},

  abstract  = {We consider an incompressible flow problem in a N -dimensional fractured porous domain (Darcy's problem). The fracture is represented by a (N - 1)-dimensional interface, exchanging fluid with the surrounding media. In this paper we consider the lowest-order (RT0 , P0 ) Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element method for the approximation of the coupled Darcy's flows in the porous media and within the fracture, with independent meshes for the respective domains. This is achieved thanks to an enrichment with discontinuous basis functions on triangles crossed by the fracture and a weak imposition of interface conditions. First, we study the stability and convergence properties of the resulting numerical scheme in theuncoupled case, when the known solution of the fracture problem provides an immersed boundary condition. We detail the implementation issues and discuss the algebraic properties of the associated linear system. Next, we focus on the coupled problem and propose an iterative porous domain/fracture domain iterative method to solve for fluid flow in both the porous media and the fracture and compare the results with those of a traditional monolithic approach. Numerical results are provided confirming convergence rates and algebraic properties predicted by the theory. In particular, we discuss preconditioning and equilibration techniques to make the condition number of the discrete problem independent of the position of the immersed interface. Finally, two and three dimensional simulations of Darcy's flow in different configurations (highly and poorly permeable fracture) are analyzed and discussed.},

The model is based on shear transformation zone (STZ) theory, a microscopic model for plastic deformation. STZ theory ties fault weakening to the evolution of an effective temperature, which quantifies configurational disorder and captures the spontaneous formation and growth of narrow shear bands in the fault gouge. },

In this method, a higher-order Godunov procedure approximates advection and a mixed finite element procedure approximates diffusion. Several variations on the basic scheme are formulated for solving one-dimensional, quasilinear, parabolic problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A maximum principle for one variant of the scheme is demonstrated, and L^\infty (L^2 ) and L^2 (L^2 ) error estimates for the approximate solution and the diffusive flux, respectively, are derived. These estimates indicate that one variant of the scheme is L^\infty -stable in certain situations, but possibly suboptimal in error, while another variant is optimal and L^2 -stable.},

Not only do the aqueous components move due to physical advection and dispersion processes, but they also react together and with fixed components. Therefore, the mass balance couples transport and chemistry, and reactive transport models are partial differential equations coupled with nonlinear algebraic equations. In this paper, we present a global method based on the method of lines and differential algebraic system (DAE) solvers. At each time step, nonlinear systems are solved by a Newton-LU method. We use this method to carry out numerical simulations for the reactive transport benchmark proposed by the MoMas research group. Although we study only 1D computations with a specific geochemical system, several difficulties arise. Numerical experiments show that our method can solve quite difficult problems, get accurate results and capture sharp fronts.},

In particular, we focus attention on problems where the underlying mesh is not explicitly {\grqq}fitted to the geometry of the interface. The residual-free bubble problem is derived for a simple case and extensions are discussed. We show that under certain conditions, stabilization only requires knowledge of the residual-free bubble on the interface. We then examine methods to approximate the residual-free bubble. A series of benchmark tests are used to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method. Comparisons are made to Nitsche's method employing an eigenvalue estimate for the global stability parameter. Particular emphasis is placed on the accuracy of flux evaluations on the interface. Finally, we employ the method to simulate an evolving interface problem motivated by resin transfer molding.},

  abstract  = {This paper discusses the migration of petroleum from its formation in a source rock to its subsequent possible entrapment in a reservoir. The chemical and physical properties of petroleum gases and liquids are stressed, particularly their phase behaviour under subsurface conditions which is shown to be a very important factor in determining migration behaviour. Engineering correlations are presented for estimating the properties of petroleum fluids under geologically realistic conditions. The directions and magnitudes of the forces acting on migrating petroleum are deduced from the combined effects of buoyancy and water flow in compacting sediments. These forces are combined, using a fluid potential description. This procedure allows the direction of migration to be denned. The rate of migration is then estimated from the properties of the sediments involved, allowing a distinction to be made between lateral and vertical carrier beds. This simplified approach is suitable for rapid predictive calculations in petroleum exploration. It is compared with the more complex 3-D computer modelling approaches which are currently becoming available. Migration losses are related to the cumulative pore volume employed by the petroleum in establishing a migration pathway. The petroleum migration mechanism is shown to be predominantly by bulk flow, with a small diffusive contribution for light hydrocarbons over distances less than c. 100 m. The loss factors involved in secondary migration are estimated from field evidence. The mechanism of reservoir filling is presented as a logical extension to those described for migration. This, together with the inefficiency of in-reservoir mixing by diffusion or convection, is shown to tend to cause significant lateral compostional gradients in reservoirs over and above the gravitationally induced vertical gradients described by other workers.},

A multialgorithmic approach is proposed in which a different approximation method is used locally depending on the mathematical nature of the problem. Our analysis focuses on stability and a priori error estimates of coupled continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods, achieving a global $h^{p+\frac{1}{2}}$ estimate. Both the mathematical analysis and the numerical results demonstrate that careful consideration is necessary when defining appropriate interface conditions between the hyperbolic and parabolic regions.},

The originality of the method consists in the use of diffusivity-dependent weighted averages to better cope with locally small diffusivity (or equivalently with locally high P{\'e}clet numbers) on fitted meshes. The analysis yields convergence results for the natural energy norm that are optimal with respect to mesh size and robust with respect to diffusivity. The convergence results for the advective derivative are optimal with respect to mesh size and robust for isotropic diffusivity, as well as for anisotropic diffusivity if the cell P{\'e}clet numbers evaluated with the largest eigenvalue of the diffusivity tensor are large enough. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract  = {During recent years the authors and their collaborators have beeninvolved in an activity related to the construction and analysisof large time step operator splitting algorithms for the numerical simulation of multi-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media. Thepurpose of these lecture notes is to review some of this activity. We illustrate the main ideas behind these novel operator splittingalgorithms for a basic two-phase flow model. Special emphasis is given to the numerical solution algorithms for the saturation equation,which is a convection dominated, degenerate convection-diffusionequation. Both theory and applications are discussed. The general background for the reservoir flow model is reviewed, and the main features of the numerical algorithms are presented. The basic mathematical results supporting the numerical algorithms are also given. In addition, we present some results from the bounded variation (entropy) solution theory for quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations, which providesthe correct mathematical framework in which to analyse our numerical algorithms. Two- and three-dimensional numerical test cases are presented and discussed. The main conclusion drawn from the numerical experiments is that the operator splitting algorithms indeed exhibit the property of resolving accurately internal layers with steep gradients, give very little numerical diffusion, and, at the same time, permit the use of large time steps. In addition, these algorithms seem to capture all potential combinations of convection and diffusion forces, ranging from convection dominated problems (including the pure hyperbolic case) to more diffusion dominated problems.},

The unknowns of this scheme are the values at the centre of the control volumes and at some internal interfaces that may, for instance, be chosen at the diffusion tensor discontinuities. The scheme is therefore completely cell centred if no edge unknown is kept. It is shown to be accurate for several numerical examples. The convergence of the approximate solution to the continuous solution is proved for general (possibly discontinuous) tensors and general (possibly nonconforming) meshes and with no regularity assumption on the solution. An error estimate is then deduced under suitable regularity assumptions on the solution.},

  abstract    = {Subsurface flows are influenced by the presence of faults and large fractures which act as preferential paths or barriers for the flow. In literature models were proposed to handle fractures in a porous medium as objects of codimension 1. In this work we consider the case of a network of intersecting fractures, with the aim of deriving physically consistent and effective interface conditions to impose at the intersection between fractures. This new model accounts for the angle between fractures at the intersections and allows for jumps of pressure across the intersection. This latter property permits to describe more accurately the flow when fractures are characterised by different properties, than other models that impose pressure continuity. The main mathematical properties of the model, derived in the two-dimensional setting, are analysed. As concerns the numerical discretization we allow the grids of the fractures to be independent, thus in general non-matching at the intersection, by means of the extended finite element method (XFEM), to increase the flexibility of the method in the case of complex geometries characterized by a high number of fractures.},

We show that despite this non-conformity, first order convergence is preserved with the lowest order Raviart-Thomas(-Nedelec) mixed finite elements. Numerical simulations confirm this result.},

In particular we are interested in the case in which the flow rate in the fractures is large enough to make it appropriate to use Forchheimer's law for modeling the flow in the fractures even though the flow in the surrounding domain is such that Darcy's law is adequate. We describe a model in which the fractures are treated as interfaces. We also consider the case of intersecting fractures and the case of nonconforming meshes.},

The fractures are treated as possibly non-planar interfaces. Our iterative scheme is an adaptation due to the presence of fractures of a classical fixed stress-splitting scheme. We prove that the iterative scheme is a contraction in an appropriate norm. Moreover, the solution converges to the unique weak solution of the coupled problem.},

The coupling preserves in a weak sense the continuity of the solution at the interface without imposing the overall conservativity of the coupled model. In order to analyze the convergence of the coupled numerical scheme, we first revisit the approximation of the boundary value problems. We then prove the convergence and characterize the limit solution of the coupled schemes in a few simple but significative coupling situations.

Ship-board physical property measurements were obtained from cores over the same intervals, and petrophysical wireline logs were run. New algorithms are demonstrated relating thermal conductivity to matrix grain type and porosity, derived only from wireline log data. Comparison with heat flows calculated using high-resolution temperature measurements at Site 765 suggest that thermal conductivities predicted from wireline logs can be used to estimate heat flow. This implies that existing exploration and production wells in which high resolution temperature measurements and thermal conductivities have not been measured could still be used to prepare regional maps of heat flow variation.},

By this concept and by operator overloading in C++, numerical algorithms can be implemented in a mathematical notation without decreasing the performance in comparison to optimized C or FORTRAN codes. In this paper, we present new Expression Template techniques. First, we explain the concept of Easy Expression Templates, which are easier to implement than classical ET. Then, we explain Fast Expression Templates. This concept leads to an optimal performance even on special architectures like vector machines. Furthermore, concepts for storing expressions and code optimizing are presented. In order to verify the usability of these programming techniques in real applications, we discuss a template library which calculates local stiffness matrices arising from Finite Element discretizations.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulations of flow for a discrete-fracture model in fractured porous rocks have gradually become more practical, as a consequence of increased computer power and improved simulation and characterization techniques. Discrete-fracture models can be formulated in a lower-dimensional framework, where the fractures are modeled in a lower dimension than the matrix, or in an equi-dimensional form, where the fractures and the matrix have the same dimension. When the velocity of the flow field is needed explicitly, as in streamline simulation of advective transport, only the equi-dimensional approach can be used directly. The velocity field for the lower-dimensional model can then be recovered by post processing which involves expansion of the lower-dimensional fractures to equi-dimensional ones. In this paper, we propose a technique for expanding lower-dimensional fractures and we compare two different discretization methods for the pressure equation; one vertex-centered approach which can be implemented as either a lower- or an equi-dimensional method, and a cell-centered method using the equi-dimensional formulation. The methods are compared with respect to accuracy, convergence, condition number, and computer efficiency. },

  abstract  = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In this article, we investigate two strategies for coarsening fractured geological models. The first approach, which generates grids that resolve the fractures, is referred to as explicit fracture-matrix separation (EFMS). The second approach is based on a non-uniform coarsening strategy introduced in Aarnes et al. (Adv Water Resour 30(11):2177{\^a}2193, 2007a). A series of two-phase flow simulations where the saturation is modeled on the respective coarse grids are performed. The accuracy of the resulting solutions is examined, and the robustness of the two strategies is assessed with respect to number of fractures, degree of coarsening, well locations, phase viscosities, and fracture permeability. The numerical results show that saturation solutions obtained on the non-uniform coarse grids are consistently more accurate than the corresponding saturation solutions obtained on the EFMS grids.

Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software. \par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking. \par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.},

  abstract  = {In this article, an approach for the efficient numerical solution of multi-species reactive transport problems in porous media is described. The objective of this approach is to reformulate the given system of partial and ordinary differential equations (PDEs, ODEs) and algebraic equations (AEs), describing local equilibrium, in such a way that the couplings and nonlinearities are concentrated in a rather small number of equations, leading to the decoupling of some linear partial differential equations from the nonlinear system. Thus, the system is handled in the spirit of a global implicit approach (one step method) avoiding operator splitting techniques, solved by Newton{\^a}'s method as the basic algorithmic ingredient. The reduction of the problem size helps to limit the large computational costs of numerical simulations of such problems. If the model contains equilibrium precipitation-dissolution reactions of minerals, then these are considered as complementarity conditions and rewritten as semismooth equations, and the whole nonlinear system is solved by the semismooth Newton method.},

The nonlinear convective part is solved using front tracking and dimensional splitting, while the nonlinear diffusion equation is solved by a suitable difference scheme. We verify $L^1$ compactness of the corresponding set of approximate solutions and derive precise entropy estimates. In particular, these results allow us to pass to the limit in our approximations and recover an entropy solution of the problem in question. The theory presented covers a large class of equations. Important subclasses are hyperbolic conservation laws, porous-medium-type equations, two-phase reservoir flow equations, and strongly degenerate equations coming from the recent theory of sedimentation-consolidation processes.

The nonlinear, convective part is solved using front tracking and dimensional splitting, while the nonlinear diffusion part is solved by an implicit--explicit finite difference scheme. In addition, one version of theimplemented operator splitting method has a mechanism built in for detecting and correcting unphysical entropy loss, which may occur when the time step is large. This mechanism helps us gain a large time step ability for practical computations. A detailed convergence analysis of the operator splitting method was given in Part I. Here we present numerical experiments with the method for examples modelling secondary oil recovery and sedimentation--consolidation processes. We demonstrate that the splitting method resolves sharp gradients accurately, may use large time steps, has first order convergence, exhibits small grid orientation effects, hassmall mass balance errors, and is rather efficient.},

Equilateral triangles are beneficial for a finite volume discretization, as fluid flow between elements of very different size is only possible at small timesteps. The mesh generator is compared with the well-regarded Triangle programme, where both element quality and simulation performance are checked. It is shown that our mesh generator consistently delivers better meshes.},

  abstract  = {Various numerical methods have been used in the literature to simulate single and multiphase flow in fractured media. A promising approach is the use of the discrete-fracture model where the fracture entities in the permeable media are described explicitly in the computational grid. In this work, we present a critical review of the main conventional methods for multiphase flow in fractured media including the finite difference (FD), finite volume (FV), and finite element (FE) methods, that are coupled with the discrete-fracture model. All the conventional methods have inherent limitations in accuracy and applications. The FD method, for example, is restricted to horizontal and vertical fractures. The accuracy of the vertex-centered FV method depends on the size of the matrix gridcells next to the fractures; for an acceptable accuracy the matrix gridcells next to the fractures should be small. The FE method cannot describe properly the saturation discontinuity at the matrix-fracture interface. In this work, we introduce a new approach that is free from the limitations of the conventional methods. Our proposed approach is applicable in 2D and 3D unstructured griddings with low mesh orientation effect; it captures the saturation discontinuity from the contrast in capillary pressure between the rock matrix and fractures. The matrix-fracture and fracture-fracture fluxes are calculated based on powerful features of the mixed finite element (MFE) method which provides, in addition to the gridcell pressures, the pressures at the gridcell interfaces and can readily model the pressure discontinuities at impermeable faults in a simple way. To reduce the numerical dispersion, we use the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to approximate the saturation equation. We take advantage of a hybrid time scheme to alleviate the restrictions on the size of the time step in the fracture network. Several numerical examples in 2D and 3D demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. Results show the significance of capillary pressure and orders of magnitude increase in computational speed compared to previous works.},

  Abstract                 = {A discrete fracture model for the flow of compressible, multicomponent fluids in homogeneous, heterogeneous, and fractured media is presented in single phase. In the numerical model we combine the mixed finite element (MFE) and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. We use the cross-flow equilibrium concept to approximate the fractured matrix mass transfer. The discrete fracture model is numerically superior to the single-porosity model and overcomes limitations of the dual-porosity models including the use of a shape factor. The MFE method provides a direct and accurate approximation for the velocity field, which is crucial for the convective terms in the flow equations. The DG method associated with a slope limiter is used to approximate the species balance equations. This method can capture the sharp moving fronts. The calculation of the fracture-fracture flux across three and higher intersecting fracture branches is a challenge. In this work, we provide an accurate approximation of these fluxes by using the MFE formulation. Numerical examples in unfractured and fractured media illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed numerical model.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is introduced to discretize irregular and complex two-dimensional fractured media. The geometry of the fractured media is first analysed by searching and treating the complex configurations. Based on that, the method generated a good mesh quality and allows for including finer grids. An incompressible two-phase flow problem is solved to compare the developed method and a public method based on the approximation of a 1D fracture by the edges of a 2D finite element grid of the porous media. The comparison showed that the developed method (i) represents better the fractured domain by maintaining the geometric integrity of input surfaces and geologic data, (ii) provides, for sample and complex fractured domains, excellent and more accurate results, and (iii) is much less sensitive to the grid sizes. Furthermore, the method has to be more efficient than the other methods for transport problems and has to provide better predictable results; this is mainly based on point (ii) and because the method produces optimal triangular grids.},

The model is an extension to the case of two-phase flow of the model for single phase flow described in [1]. The model is a discrete fracture model in which the fractures are treated as interfaces of dimension n - 1 but in which there is fluid exchange between the fracture and the surrounding rock matrix. The matrix domain is effected by the fracture flow through a Robin type boundary condition along both sides of the fracture, while the fracture takes into account the flow in the matrix by means of a source term representing the discontinuity across the fracture of the flux. Twophase flow is modeled using the global pressure formulation in which the unknowns are the global pressure and the wetting phase saturation; see [2]. The case of different rock types in the (n - 1)-dimensional fracture domain and in the n-dimensional matrix rock domain is considered.},

To that aim, we couple finite element (FE) kinematics enhancements (strong discontinuities) representing fine scale cracks to the fine scale permeability tensor. The latter may be split into two parts: the first one is isotropic and corresponds to flows within the porosity of the material; the second one, based upon a set of cracks with different orientations and openings, is anisotropic. For the latter, each crack is a path for mass flow according to the Poiseuille law considering two infinite planes. We show how the upscaling procedure leads both to the definition of macroscopic permeability tensors as well as the flow rate evaluation for components of concrete structures.},

The model leads to a nonlinear advection--diffusion equation, where the diffusive term is due to buoyancy forces, not physical diffusion. For the case of interest in geological CO 2 storage, in which the mobility ratio is very unfavorable, the mathematical model can be simplified to a hyperbolic equation. We present a complete analytical solution to the hyperbolic model. The main outcome is a closed-form expression that predicts the ultimate footprint on the CO 2 plume, and the time scale required for complete trapping. The capillary trapping coefficient and the mobility ratio between CO 2 and brine emerge as the key parameters in the assessment of CO 2 storage in saline aquifers. Despite the many approximations, the model captures the essence of the flow dynamics and therefore reflects proper dependencies on the mobility ratio and the capillary trapping coefficient, which are basin-specific. The expressions derived here have applicability to capacity estimates by capillary trapping at the basin scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Active set strategies for two-dimensional and three-dimensional, unilateral and bilateral obstacle problems are described. Emphasis is given to algorithms resulting from the augmented Lagrangian (i.e., primal-dual formulation of the discretized obstacle problems), for which convergence and rate of convergence are considered. For the bilateral case, modifications of the basic primal-dual algorithm are also introduced and analyzed. Finally, efficient computer realizations that are based on multigrid and multilevel methods are suggested and different aspects of the proposed techniques are investigated through numerical experiments.},

The model handles both 2- and 3D systems and includes fracture-fracture, matrix-fracture, and matrix-matrix connections. The formulation applies an unstructured control volume finite-difference technique with a two-point flux approximation. The implementation is generally compatible with any simulator that represents grid connections by a connectivity list. A specialized treatment based on a ''star-delta'' transformation is introduced to eliminate control volumes at fracture intersections. These control volumes would otherwise act to reduce numerical stability and timestep size. The performance of the method is demonstrated for several oil/water flow cases including a simple 2D system, a more complex 3D fracture network, a localized fractured region with strong capillary pressure effects, and a model of a strike-slip fault zone. The discrete-fracture model is shown to provide results in close agreement with those of a reference finite-difference simulator in cases in which direct comparisons are possible.},

  abstract = {A procedure for developing coarse-scale continuum models from detailed fracture descriptions is developed and applied. The coarse models are in the form of a generalized dual-porosity representation, in which matrix rock and fractures exchange fluid locally while large-scale flow occurs through the fracture network. The methodology developed here introduces local subgrids to resolve dynamics within the matrix and provides appropriate coarse-scale parameters describing fracture-fracture, matrix-fracture, and matrix-matrix flow. The geometry of the local subgrids, as well as the required parameters for the coarse-scale model, are determined from local flow solutions using the underlying discrete fracture model. The method is applied to two- and three-dimensional single-phase and two-phase flow problems, and the accuracy of the coarse models is assessed relative to fully resolved discrete fracture simulations. For the cases considered, it is shown that the technique is capable of generating highly accurate coarse models with many fewer unknowns than the detailed characterizations, and speedups of about a factor of 100 are achieved.},

  abstract  = {Many numerical methods for systems of convection-diffusion equations are based on an operator splitting formulation, where convective and diffusive forces are accounted for in separate substeps. We describe the nonlinear mechanism of the splitting error in such numerical methods in the one-dimensional case, a mechanism that is intimately linked to the local linearizations introduced implicitly in the (hyperbolic) convection steps by the use of an entropy condition. For convection-dominated flows, we demonstrate that operator splitting methods typically generate a numerical widening of viscous fronts, unless the splitting step is of the same magnitude as the diffusion scale. To compensate for the potentially damaging splitting error, we propose a corrected operator splitting (COS) method for general systems of convection-diffusion equations with the ability of correctly resolving the nonlinear balance between the convective and diffusive forces. In particular, COS produces viscous shocks with a correct structure also when the splitting step is large. A front tracking method for systems of conservation laws, which in turn relies heavily on a Riemann solver, constitutes an important part of our COS strategy. The proposed COS method is successfully applied to a system modeling two-phase, multicomponent flow in porous media and a triangular system modeling three-phase flow.},

  abstract   = {We present a corrected operator splitting (COS) method for solving nonlinear parabolic equations of a convection-diffusion type. The main feature of this method is the ability to correctly resolve nonlinear shock fronts for large time steps, as opposed to a standard operator splitting (OS) which fails to do so. COS is based on solving a conservation law for modeling convection, a heat-type equation for modeling diffusion and finally a certain {\grqq}residual conservation law for necessary correction. The residual equation represents the entropyloss generated in the hyperbolic (convection) step. In OS the entropy loss manifests itself in the form of too wide shock fronts. The purpose of the correction step in COS is to counterbalance the entropy loss so that correct width of nonlinear shock fronts is ensured. The polygonal method of Dafermos[J. Math. Anal. Appl., 38 (1972), pp. 33--41] constitutes an important part of our solution strategy. It is shown that COS generates a compact sequence of approximate solutions which converges to the solution of the problem. Finally, some numerical examples are presented where we compare OS and COS methods with respect to accuracy.},

  abstract  = {This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating their solution, including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation laws. These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

  abstract  = {This study investigates algebraic multilevel domain decomposition preconditioners of the Schwarz type for solving linear systems associated with Newton-Krylov methods. The key component of the preconditioner is a coarse approximation based on algebraic multigrid ideas to approximate the global behaviour of the linear system. The algebraic multilevel preconditioner is based on an aggressive coarsening graph partitioning of the non-zero block structure of the Jacobian matrix. The scalability of the preconditioner is presented as well as comparisons with a two-level Schwarz preconditioner using a geometric coarse grid operator. These comparisons are obtained on large--scale distributed-memory parallel machines for systems arising from incompressible flow and transport using a stabilized finite element formulation. The results demonstrate the influence of the smoothers and coarse level solvers for a set of 3D example problems. For preconditioners with more than one level, careful attention needs to be given to the balance of robustness and convergence rate for the smoothers and the cost of applying these methods. For properly chosen parameters, the two- and three-level preconditioners are demonstrated to be scalable to 1024 processors. Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper we present a model for simulating the dynamic of three-dimensional stratified sedimentary basins. This kind of problem contains several numerical complexities such as the presence of high viscosity jumps, or the necessity of tracking multiple surfaces of interface (horizons) independently. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a new preconditioner, that reduces significantly the amount of time required to solve the finite element linear system resulting from the Stokes problem, and a new tracking method. Using a coupled level set-volume tracking method, indeed, an unlimited number of layers can be tracked with good mass conservation properties. Finally, to prove the efficiency of these new techniques we present the results and the computation performances obtained in simulations of a realistic case with four horizons, together with a complete description of the main physical quantities involved.},

To evaluate injection scenarios, estimate reservoir capacity and assess leakage risks, an accurate understanding of the subsurface spreading and migration of the plume of mobile CO2 is essential. Here, we present a complete solution to a theoretical model for the subsurface migration of a plume of CO2 due to natural groundwater flow and aquifer slope, and subject to residual trapping. The results show that the interplay of these effects leads to non-trivial behaviour in terms of trapping efficiency. The analytical nature of the solution others insight into the physics of CO2 migration, and allows for rapid, basin-specific capacity estimation. We use the solution to explore the parameter space via the storage efficiency, a macroscopic measure of plume migration. In a future study, we shall incorporate CO2 dissolution into the migration model and study the importance of dissolution relative to capillary trapping and the impact of dissolution on the storage efficiency.},

Sediments and evaporites are modeled as non--Newtonian fluids and the thermal effects induced by the presence of salt are taken into account. The computational strategy is based on a Lagrangian methodologywith intensive grid adaptivity, together with a kinematic modeling of faults and different kinds of boundary conditions representing sedimentation, erosion, basement evolution, lithospheric compression and extension. The proposed methodology is applied to simple test cases as well as to a realistic geological reconstruction of industrial interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Many naturally fractured reservoirs around the world have depletedsignificantly, and improved-oil-recovery (IOR) processes are necessary forfurther development. Hence, the modeling of fractured reservoirs has receivedincreased attention recently. Accurate modeling and simulation of naturallyfractured reservoirs (NFRs) is still challenging because of permeabilityanisotropies and contrasts. Nonphysical abstractions inherent in conventionaldual-porosity and dual-permeability models make them inadequate for solvingdifferent fluid-flow problems in fractured reservoirs. Also, recenttechnologies for discrete fracture modeling may suffer from large simulationrun times, and the industry has not used such approaches widely, even thoughthey give more-accurate representations of fractured reservoirs thandual-continuum models. We developed an embedded discrete fracture model (DFM)for an in-house compositional reservoir simulator that borrows the dual-mediumconcept from conventional dual-continuum models and also incorporates theeffect of each fracture explicitly. The model is compatible with existingfinite-difference reservoir simulators. In contrast to dual-continuum models,fractures have arbitrary orientations and can be oblique or vertical, honoringthe complexity of a typical NFR. The accuracy of the embedded DFM is confirmedby comparing the results with the fine-grid, explicit-fracture simulations fora case study including orthogonal fractures and a case with a nonalignedfracture. We also perform a grid-sensitivity study to show the convergence ofthe method as the grid is refined. Our simulations indicate that to achieveaccurate results, the embedded discrete fracture model may only requiremoderate mesh refinement around the fractures and hence offers acomputationally efficient approach. Furthermore, examples of waterflooding, gasinjection, and primary depletion are presented to demonstrate the performanceand applicability of the developed method for simulating fluid flow inNFRs.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide a numerical procedure for the simulation of two-phase immiscible and incompressible flow in two- and three-dimensional discrete-fractured media. The concept of cross-flow equilibrium is used to reduce the fracture dimension from n to (n-1) in the calculation of flow in the fractures. This concept, which is often referred to as the discrete-fracture model, has a significant effect on the reduction of computational time. The spatial discretization is performed with the control-volume method. This method is locally conservative and allows the use of unstructured grids to represent complex geometries, such as discrete-fracture configurations. The relative permeability is upwinded with a criterion based on the evaluation of the flux direction at the boundaries of the control volumes, which is consistent with the physics of fluid flow. The system of partial differential equations is decoupled and solved using the implicit-pressure, explicit-saturation (IMPES) approach. The algorithm has been successfully tested in two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of wetting phase fluid injection (such as water) in discrete-fractured media saturated by a nonwetting phase (such as nonaqueous phase liquid or oil) with mild to high nonlinearity in relative permeability and capillary pressure. To the best of our knowledge, results for simulations of two-phase immiscible and incompressible flow in three-dimensional discrete-fractured media, including capillary and gravity effects, are the first to appear in the literature.},

  abstract  = {We present results of a recent study investigating geomechanical and hydrogeological consequences of large-scale deployment of CO2 sequestration within a region spanning tens of kilometres. This initial study considered a faulted aquifer bounded above and below by impermeable rock. We performed a parameter study of fault activation due to elevated pore pressures and addressed several combinations of injection scenarios and in situ stress orientations. The simulations were performed using iteratively coupled flow and geomechanical capabilities. For each scenario, multiple fluid injectors were simulated using a non-steady reservoir flow model while geomechanical analysis predicted the evolving potential for fault reactivation within the reservoir and concomitant permeability evolution. It is observed that the initially considered scenario leads to a loss of containment of fluid from the storage domain. However, alternative scenarios involving either different in situ stress conditions, or modified injection scenarios resulted in successful containment. The results highlight the importance of site selection, site characterization and in situ stress determination when pressure waves from multiple wells and multiple faults interact, and demonstrate the ability of existing tools to help resolve these issues. The results also emphasize that site-specific injection scenarios will be required to manage permitting, deployment, and operations in such a way as to avoid unintended negative consequences, such as large-scale fault activation, related to large-scale deployment.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural fractured media are highly unpredictable because of existing complex structures at the fracture and at the network levels. Fractures are by themselves heterogeneous objects of broadly distributed sizes, shapes, and orientations that are interconnected in large correlated networks. With little field data and evidence, numerical modeling can provide important information on the underground hydraulic phenomena. However, it must overcome several barriers. First, the complex network structure produces a structure difficult to mesh. Second, the absence of a priori homogenization scale, along with the double fracture and network heterogeneity levels, requires the calculation of large but finely resolved fracture networks resulting in very large simulation domains. To tackle these two related issues, we reduce the highly complex geometry of the fractures by applying a local transformation that suppresses the cumbersome meshing configurations while keeping the networks fundamental, geological, and geometrical characteristics. We show that the flow properties are marginally affected while the problem complexity (i.e., memory capacity and resolution time) can be divided by orders of magnitude. The goal of this article is to propose a method of resolution which takes into account the geometrical complexity met in the networks and which makes it possible to treat a few thousand fractures. The principal aim of this article is to present a tool to slowly modify the structures of the fracture networks to have a good quality mesh with a marginal loss in precision. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

The polygonal domain is mapped conformally to the unit disk using Schwarz--Christoffel mapping and a midpoint quadrature rule defined on this unit disk is used. This method eliminates the need for a two-level isoparametric mapping usually required. Moreover, the positivity of the Jacobian is guaranteed. Numerical results presented for a few benchmark problems in the context of polygonal finite elements show that the proposed method yields accurate results.},

An unstructured simplex mesh requires a choice of meshpoints (vertex nodes) and a triangulation. We offer a short and simple MATLAB code, described in more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add to the code) knowing the underlying principles. We find the node locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using piecewise linear force-displacement relations) and reset the topology by the Delaunay algorithm. The geometry is described implicitly by its distance function. In addition to being much shorter and simpler than other meshing techniques, our algorithm typically produces meshes of very high quality. We discuss ways to improve the robustness and the performance, but our aim here is simplicity. Readers can download (and edit) the codes from \url{http://math.mit.edu/ persson/mesh}.},

Equations of acoustics are written as a first-order linear hyperbolic system. Apart from interfaces, a standard scheme (Lax-Wendroff, TVD, and WENO) is used in a classical way. Near interfaces, the same scheme is used, but it is applied on a set of modified values deduced from numerical values and jump conditions at interfaces. It amounts to modifying the scheme so that its order of accuracy is maintained at irregular points, despite the nonsmoothness of the solution. This easy-to-implement interface method requires only a few additional computational resources, and it can be applied to other partial differential equations.},

We consider the classical elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic linear equations, but also the diffusion, transport, and Navier-Stokes equations, as well as equations representing conservation laws, saddle-point problems and optimal control problems. Furthermore, we provide numerous physical examples which underline such equations. We then analyze numerical solution methods based on finite elements, finite differences, finite volumes, spectral methods and domain decomposition methods, and reduced basis methods. In particular, we discuss the algorithmic and computer implementation aspects and provide a number of easy-to-use programs. The text does not require any previous advanced mathematical knowledge of partial differential equations: the absolutely essential concepts are reported in a preliminary chapter. It is therefore suitable for students of bachelor and master courses in scientific disciplines, and recommendable to those researchers in the academic and extra-academic domain who want to approach this interesting branch of applied mathematics.},

  Abstract                 = { In this paper we analyze an Euler implicit-mixed finite element scheme for a porous media solute transport model. The transporting flux is not assumed given, but obtained by solving numerically the Richards equation, a model for sub-surface fluid flow. We prove the convergence of the scheme by estimating the error in terms of the discretization parameters. In doing so we take into account the numerical error occurring in the approximation of the fluid flow. The paper is concluded by numerical experiments, which are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates.}

  abstract  = {This work deals with a comparison of different numerical schemes for the simulation of contaminant transport in heterogeneous porous media. The numerical methods under consideration are Galerkin finite element (GFE), finite volume (FV), and mixed hybrid finite element (MHFE). Concerning the GFE we use linear and quadratic finite elements with and without upwind stabilization. Besides the classical MHFE a new and an upwind scheme are tested. We consider higher order finite volume schemes as well as two time discretization methods: backward Euler (BE) and the second order backward differentiation formula BDF (2). It is well known that numerical (or artificial) diffusion may cause large errors. Moreover, when the P{\'e}clet number is large, a numerical code without some stabilising techniques produces oscillating solutions. Upwind schemes increase the stability but show more numerical diffusion. In this paper we quantify the numerical diffusion for the different discretization schemes and its dependency on the P{\'e}clet number. We consider an academic example and a realistic simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous aquifer. In the latter case, the stochastic estimates used as reference were obtained with global random walk (GRW) simulations, free of numerical diffusion. The results presented can be used by researchers to test their numerical schemes and stabilization techniques for simulation of contaminant transport in groundwater.},

  abstract   = {The Barzilai and Borwein gradient method for the solution of large-scale unconstrained minimization problems is considered. This method requires few storage locations and very inexpensive computations. Furthermore, it does not guarantee descent in the objective function and no line search is required. Recently, the global convergence for the convex quadratic case has been established. However, for the nonquadratic case, the method needs to be incorporated into a globalization scheme. In this work, a nonmonotone line search strategy that guarantees global convergence is combined with the Barzilai and Borwein method. This strategy is based on the nonmonotone line search technique proposed by L. Grippo, F. Lampariello and S. Lucidi [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 23 (1986), no. 4, 707--716; MR0849278 (87g:90105)]. Numerical results to compare the behavior of this method with recent implementations of the conjugate gradient method are presented. These results indicate that the global Barzilai and Borwein method may allow some significant reduction in the number of line searches and also in the number of gradient evaluations.},

  abstract  = {Immiscible two-phase flow in porous media, which results from the downward injection of a heavier fluid or upward injection of a lighter fluid, is characterized by two shocks, one at each end of a rarefaction wave. The specific details of the saturation profile, such as the shock speeds and the shock saturations, are determined by the fractional flow function for given values of the mobility ratio and the gravity number. We employ a normal mode, matched asymptotic expansion analysis to obtain analytical expressions governing the stability behavior of such flows. Instability occurs at both ends of the one-dimensional base saturation profile with unique characteristics such that the maximum growth rate decreases both when the mobility ratio is increased at the front end and decreased at the back end. This unusual behavior is explained in terms of vorticity eigenfunctions related to nonmonotonic mobility profiles. Analysis of stability behavior as a function of fractional flow profile shows that although the fundamental mechanisms are qualitatively similar, they are associated with different parameter values in view of particular mobility profiles. Growth rates and wavenumbers predicted by the linear stability analysis are observed at the onset of the nonlinear displacement process, which is followed by the fully developed nonlinear flow with large-scale unstable structures.},

  Abstract                 = {This work evaluates and improves upon existing effective medium methods for permeability upscaling in fractured media. Specifically, we are concerned with the asymmetric self-consistent, symmetric self-consistent, and differential methods. In effective medium theory, inhomogeneity is modeled as ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in the rock matrix. Fractured media correspond to the limiting case of flat ellipsoids, for which we derive a novel set of simplified formulas. The new formulas have improved numerical stability properties, and require a smaller number of input parameters. To assess their accuracy, we compare the analytical permeability predictions with three-dimensional finite-element simulations. We also compare the results with a semi-analytical method based on percolation theory and curve-fitting, which represents an alternative upscaling approach. A large number of cases is considered, with varying fracture aperture, density, matrix/fracture permeability contrast, orientation, shape, and number of fracture sets. The differential method is seen to be the best choice for sealed fractures and thin open fractures. For high-permeable, connected fractures, the semi-analytical method provides the best fit to the numerical data, whereas the differential method breaks down. The two self-consistent methods can be used for both unconnected and connected fractures, although the asymmetric method is somewhat unreliable for sealed fractures. For open fractures, the symmetric method is generally the more accurate for moderate fracture densities, but only the asymmetric method is seen to have correct asymptotic behavior. The asymmetric method is also surprisingly accurate at predicting percolation thresholds.},

  abstract  = {We present an improved immersed boundary method for simulating incompressible viscous flow around an arbitrarily moving body on a fixed computational grid. To achieve a large Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number and to transfer quantities between Eulerian and Lagrangian domains effectively, we combine the feedback forcing scheme of the virtual boundary method with Peskin's regularized delta function approach. Stability analysis of the proposed method is carried out for various types of regularized delta functions. The stability regime of the 4-point regularized delta function is much wider than that of the 2-point delta function. An optimum regime of the feedback forcing is suggested on the basis of the analysis of stability limits and feedback forcing gains. The proposed method is implemented in a finite-difference and fractional-step context. The proposed method was tested on several flow problems, including the flow past a stationary cylinder, inline oscillation of a cylinder in a quiescent fluid, and transverse oscillation of a circular cylinder in a free-stream. The findings are in excellent agreement with previous numerical and experimental results.},

  abstract  = {To evaluate the uncertain hydrocarbon potential of single exploration prospects, use is made of a computer model to simulate the processes of hydrocarbon generation, expulsion and migration (leading to "hydrocarbon charge"), trapping and retention, and finally recovery. Simulation of the charge and retention processes is based on the results of various "calibration studies". Such studies imply the statistical analysis of extensive data sets, which represent worldwide exploration experience. The statistically highly significant results of these studies are built into the simulation model. For the estimation of the probability of charge, worldwide prior probabilities are updated in two steps: firstly, on the basis of prior observations of charge in the area of the prospect; and secondly, on the basis of the generation and migration parameters specific to the prospect in question. The latter update is made in line with the results of the statistical analysis of the charge calibration file, which is a representative collection of numerous case histories. This learning set also forms the basis for the estimation of the charge volumes. In the simulation of the complex process of trapping and retention, the sealing capacity plays a role. Based on the analytical results of another calibration file, the seal properties as described by the appraiser can be used to estimate the retention potential of the seal (i.e., the maximum differential pressure, or hydrocarbon column, the seal can withstand). The conceptual models followed in the calibration studies mentioned above are deliberately simple, so that the parameters needed for the description of the model can be readily estimated during actual prospect appraisal. This simplicity, and the implicit incompleteness of the models, contributes to uncertainties in the resulting formulas. The residual errors, however, are taken into consideration when the formulas are applied in the simulation model, the less significant parameters receiving less weight in the end result.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes the application of the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to linear elasticity problems. The method has three significant features. The first is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the displacement defined solely on the faces of the elements. The corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric, positive definite, and possesses a block-wise sparse structure that allows for a very efficient implementation of the method. The second feature is that, when polynomials of degree k are used to approximate the displacement and the stress, both variables converge with the optimal order of $k+1$ for any $k\geq0$. The third feature is that, by using an element-by-element post-processing, a new approximate displacement can be obtained that converges at the order of $k+2$, whenever $k\geq2$. Numerical experiments are provided to compare the performance of the HDG method with that of the continuous Galerkin (CG) method for problems with smooth solutions, and to assess its performance in situations where the CG method is not adequate, that is, when the material is nearly incompressible and when there is a crack.},

  Abstract                 = {Prior works have discussed the appearance of a ceiling flux for the generalized Darcy model, but there has been no such discussion on the Forchheimer model. Moreover, the earlier results were obtained through numerical computations. Here we employ a semi-inverse solution to get analytical expressions for the solution and the volumetric flux, and we demonstrate, by direct comparison, that for the flux computation, the semi-inverse approximation is as accurate as a numerical solution to the problem. It is shown that neither model (Darcy or Forchheimer) has the desirable property of attaining a limiting flux for large driving pressures. However, when the pressure-dependence of viscosity is incorporated suitably to generalize the classical models, the generalized Darcy and Forchheimer models show the desirable behaviour of a ceiling flux for large pressures. Moreover, the volumetric flux obtained from the generalized models is always lesser than that obtained from the classical models. Such generalized models are most appropriate to model the flow in applications involving large pressure gradients, like enhanced oil recovery and carbon sequestration.},

  abstract  = {In engineering calculations it happens that one has a region consisting of subdomains with independent finite element meshes that do not match at the interfaces. A natural idea (cf. e.g. [4, 5, 8, 1, 11]) is to introduce Lagrange multipliers to ``mortar'' the subregions, i.e. to approximatively enforce the interface conditions. In order that this method should work, rather restrictive stability conditions are required. Hence, the different finite element meshes cannot be completely arbitrary. Since a decade it is well known that much more freedom in designing a method for a saddle point problem is obtained by using so called stabilizing technique, cf. [7, 6] and the references therein. Recently, this approach has been proposed in connection with interface and boundary conditions [2, 13, 3]. In a previous paper [12] we discussed the technique of stabilizing boundary conditions as proposed by Barbosa--Hughes [2] and Verfurth [13], and we showed that it is closely related to a classical method of Nitsche [9]. It appears that Nitsches method is easily implemented and robust and hence it deserves to be revived. In this communcation we show how it can be used for mortaring.},

  Abstract                 = {Exploration success relies on properly risking the hydrocarbon system relevant for each prospect. Accurate risking of secondary migration efficiencies has been difficult due to lack of simple procedures that relate rock properties such as permeability and entry pressures to migration velocities, oil stringer heights and saturations. In order to achieve improved estimates of charge probabilities, equations for the secondary migration process are formulated based upon the Darcy flow and buoyancy conditions. An analytical solution of the formulated equations is shown, making it possible to construct charts for efficiently assessing the column height of secondary migration hydrocarbon stringers. The average oil (hydrocarbon) saturation of the migrating stringer can be computed, making it easy to compute the permeability related, secondary migration losses. Inputs to the chart are hydrocarbon flow-rates and flow-path width, hydrocarbon viscosity and density, carrier bed dip, permeability and entry pressures. Outputs are stringer heights, hydrocarbon saturation, relative permeability, migration velocities and migration losses. A procedure for including the new equations into existing basin scale fluid flow simulators is outlined and a Java applet for calculating the properties is described. The Java applet is useful for sensitivity studies, and can also be used to test results from basin simulators with the new migration efficiency equations. The analytical solution suggests that many published methods for calculating hydrocarbon migration in fluid flow simulators will over-estimate hydrocarbon saturations and therefore losses. Calculated migration velocities will also be too low.},

  abstract  = {Faulting is typically a two timescale process, that is, rapid failure and slow (chemical) healing. Once failed, a rock has a long memory until slow chemical processes have time to re-establish the grain-grain contacts underlying rock competency. The memory of rock failure can be captured by a sufficiently rich textural model, and the texture must be coevolved with rock stress and deformation to yield a self-consistent model of strain hardening/weakening, fault narrowing, and earthquake cyclicity. A model based on incremental stress rheology and rock texture dynamics is introduced that emphasizes the interplay of rock competency, porosity, and other texture variables with stress and strain. The deformation mechanisms taken into consideration are poroelasticity and viscosity. The rheology equations are strongly coupled to the evolution equations of rock texture and pore fluid flow. The model is used to gain an understanding of several oscillatory modes of fault movement. The roles of rock competency, fluid pressure, and continuous deformation in these oscillations is illustrated for various conditions. The approach is shown to be a natural starting point for a theory of the three-dimensional, multiprocess dynamics of fault nucleation, growth, morphology, reactivation, and continuous versus seismic behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding hydrocarbon migration and accumulation mechanisms is one of the key scientific problems that should be solved for effective hydrocarbon exploration in the superimposed basins developed in northwest China. The northwest striking No.1 slope break zone, which is a representative of superimposed basins in the Tarim Basin, can be divided into five parts due to the intersection of the northeast strike-slip faults. Controlled by the tectonic framework, the types and properties of reservoirs and the hydrocarbon compositions can also be divided into five parts from east to west. Anomalies of all the parameters were found on the fault intersection zone and weakened up-dip along the structural ridge away from it. Thus, it can be inferred that the intersection zone is the hydrocarbon charging position. This new conclusion differs greatly from the traditional viewpoint, which believes that the hydrocarbon migrates and accumulates along the whole plane of the No.1 slope break zone. The viewpoint is further supported by the evidence from the theory of main pathway systems, obvious improvement of the reservoir quality (2--3 orders of magnitude at the intersection zone) and the formation mechanisms of the fault intersection zone. Differential hydrocarbon migration and entrapment exists in and around the strikeslip faults. This is controlled by the internal structure of faults. It is concluded that the more complicated the fault structure is, the more significant the effects will be. If there is a deformation band, it will hinder the cross fault migration due to the common feature of two to four orders of magnitude reduction in permeability. Otherwise, hydrocarbons tend to accumulate in the up-dip structure under the control of buoyancy. Further research on the internal fault structure should be emphasized.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-Darcy behavior is important for describing fluid flow in porous media in situations where high velocity occurs. A criterion to identify the beginning of non-Darcy flow is needed. Two types of criteria, the Reynolds number and the Forchheimer number, have been used in the past for identifying the beginning of non-Darcy flow. Because each of these criteria has different versions of definitions, consistent results cannot be achieved. Based on a review of previous work, the Forchheimer number is revised and recommended here as a criterion for identifying non-Darcy flow in porous media. Physically, this revised Forchheimer number has the advantage of clear meaning and wide applicability. It equals the ratio of pressure drop caused by liquid--solid interactions to that by viscous resistance. It is directly related to the non-Darcy effect. Forchheimer numbers are experimentally determined for nitrogen flow in Dakota sandstone, Indiana limestone and Berea sandstone at flowrates varying four orders of magnitude. These results indicate that superficial velocity in the rocks increases non-linearly with the Forchheimer number. The critical Forchheimer number for non-Darcy flow is expressed in terms of the critical non-Darcy effect. Considering a 10{\%} non-Darcy effect, the critical Forchheimer number would be 0.11.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the immersed finite element method (IFEM) is proposed for the solution of complex fluid and deformable structure interaction problems encountered in many physical models. In IFEM, a Lagrangian solid mesh moves on top of a background Eulerian fluid mesh which spans over the entire computational domain. Hence, the mesh generation is greatly simplified. Moreover, both fluid and solid domains are modeled with the finite element methods and the continuity between the fluid and solid sub-domains are enforced via the interpolation of the velocities and the distribution of the forces with the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) delta function. In comparison with the immersed boundary (IB) method, the higher-ordered RKPM delta function enables the fluid domain to have non-uniform spatial meshes with arbitrary geometries and boundary conditions. The use of such kernel functions may eventually open doors to multi-scale and multi-resolution modelings of complex fluid--structure interaction problems. Rigid and deformable spheres dropping in channels are simulated to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the proposed method. The results compare well with the experimental data. To the authors knowledge, these are the first solutions that deal with particulate flows with very flexible solids.},

  Abstract                 = {Lubrication theory is used to study the permeability of rough-walled rock fractures. In this approximation, which is valid for low Reynolds numbers and under certain restrictions on the magnitude of the roughness, the Navier-Stokes equations that govern fluid flow are reduced to the more tractable Reynolds equation. An idealized model of a fracture, in which the roughness follows a sinusoidal variation, is studied in detail. This fracture is considered to consist of a random mixture of elements in which the fluid flows either parallel or transverse to the sinusoidal bumps. The overall permeability is then found by a suitable averaging procedure. The results are similar to those found by other researchers from numerical analysis of the Reynolds equation, in that the ratio of the hydraulic aperture to the mean aperture correlates well with the ratio of the mean aperture to the standard deviation of the aperture. Higher-order approximations to the Navier-Stokes equations for flow between sinusoidal walls are then studied, and it is concluded that in order for the lubrication approximation to be valid, the fracture walls must be smooth over lengths on the order of one standard deviation of the aperture, which is much less restrictive a condition than had previously been thought to apply.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, finite-volume discretisations for flow in porous media have been extended to handle situations where fractures dominate the flow. Successful discretisations have been based on the discrete fracture-matrix models to yield mass conservative methods capable of explicitly incorporating the impact of fractures and their geometry. When combined with a hybrid-dimensional formulation, two central concerns are the restrictions arising from small cell sizes at fracture intersections and the coupling between fractures and matrix. Focusing on these aspects, we demonstrate how finite-volume methods can be efficiently extended to handle fractures, providing generalisations of previous work. We address the finite-volume methods applying a general hierarchical formulation, facilitating implementation with extensive code reuse and providing a natural framework for coupling of different subdomains. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a Schur complement technique may be used to obtain a robust and versatile method for fracture intersection cell elimination. We investigate the accuracy of the proposed elimination method through a series of numerical simulations in 3D and 2D. The simulations, performed on fractured domains containing permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy, also demonstrate the flexibility of the hierarchical framework.},

In the model the dependence of the fluid viscosity on the velocity is replaced by a dependence on a smoothed (locally averaged) velocity. With appropriate assumptions on the smoothed velocity, existence of a solution to the model is shown. Two examples of smoothing operators are presented in the appendices. A numerical approximation scheme is presented and an a priori error estimate derived. A numerical example is given illustrating the approximation scheme and the a priori error estimate.},

  abstract = {Simulating the deformation of fractured media requires the coupling of different models for the deformation of fractures and the formation surrounding them. We consider a cell-centered finite-volume approach, termed the multi-point stress approximation (MPSA) method, which is developed in order to discretize coupled flow and mechanical deformation in the subsurface. Within the MPSA framework, we consider fractures as co-dimension one inclusions in the domain, with the fracture surfaces represented as line pairs in 2D (face pairs in 3D) that displace relative to each other. Fracture deformation is coupled to that of the surrounding domain through internal boundary conditions. This approach is natural within the finite-volume framework, where tractions are defined on surfaces of the grid. The MPSA method is capable of modeling deformation, considering open and closed fractures with complex and nonlinear relationships governing the displacements and tractions at the fracture surfaces. We validate our proposed approach using both problems, for which analytical solutions are available, and more complex benchmark problems, including comparison with a finite-element discretization.},

Fractures are essential pathways in the underground which allow fast circulation of the fluids present in the rock matrix, often characterized by low permeability. However, due to infilling processes fractures may change their hydraulic properties and become barriers for the flow and creating impervious blocks in the underground. The geometrical as well as the physical properties of the fractures require a special treatment to allow the subsequent numerical discretization to be affordable and accurate. The aim of this work is to introduce a simple yet complete mathematical model to account for such diagenetic effects where chemical reactions will occlude or empty portions of the porous media and, in particular, fractures.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This paper presents the results of the Tenth SPE Comparative Solution Project on Upscaling. Two problems were chosen. The first problem was a small 2D gas injection problem, chosen so that the fine grid could be computed easily, and both upscaling and pseudoisation methods could be used. The second problem was a waterflood of a large geostatistical model chosen so that it was hard (though not impossible) to compute the true fine grid solution. Nine participants provided results for one or both problems.Introduction The SPE Comparative Solution Projects provide a vehicle for independent comparison of methods and a recognized suite of test datasets for specific problems. The previous nine comparative solution projects1-9 have focussed on black-oil, compositional, dual porosity, thermal or miscible simulations, as well as horizontal wells and gridding techniques.The aim of the tenth comparative solution project was to compare upgridding and upscaling approaches for two problems. Full details of the project, and data files available for downloading can be found on the project web site10.The first problem was a simple 2000 cell 2D vertical cross section. The tasks specified were to apply upscaling or pseudoization methods and obtain solutions for a specified coarse grid, and a coarse grid selected by the participant.The second problem was a 3D waterflood of a 1.1 million cell geostatistical model. This model was chosen to be sufficiently detailed that it would be hard, though not impossible, to run the fine grid solution and use classical pseudoisation methods.We will not review the large number of upscaling approaches here. For a detailed description of these methods see any of the reviews of upscaling and pseudoisation techniques, for example11-14.Description of Problems Model 1The model is a 2-phase (oil and gas) model that has a simple 2D vertical cross-sectional geometry with no dipping or faults. The dimensions of the model are 762 meters long by 7.62 meters wide by 15.24 meters thick. The fine scale grid is 100{\texttimes}1{\texttimes}20 with uniform size for each of the grid blocks. The top of the model is at 0.0 metres with initial pressure at this point of 100 psia. Initially the model is fully saturated with oil (no connate water).The permeability distribution is a correlated geostatistically generated field, shown in Fig 1. The fluids are assumed to be incompressible and immiscible. The fine grid relative permeabilities are shown in Fig 2. Capillary pressure was assumed to be negligible in this case. Gas was injected from an injector located at the left of the model and dead oil was produced from a well on the right of the model. Both wells have a well internal diameter of 1.0 ft and are completed vertically throughout the model. The injection rate was set to give a frontal velocity of 0.3 m/d (about 1 foot/day or 6.97 m3 per day), and the producer is set to produce at a constant bottom pressure limit of 95 psia. The reference depth for the bottom hole pressure is at 0.0 meters (top of the model).The tasks specified were to apply upscaling or pseudoization method in the following scenarios:2D - 2D uniform 5{\texttimes}1{\texttimes}5 coarse grid model2D - 2D nonuniform coarsening. Max 100 cells.Directional pseudo relative permeabilities were allowed if necessary.Model 2This model has a sufficiently fine grid to make use of any method that relies on having the full fine grid solution almost impossible. The model has a simple geometry, with no top structure or faults. The reason for this choice is to provide maximum flexibility in selection of upscaled grids.},

  abstract = {Intensity and localization of flows in fractured media have promoted the development of a large range of different modeling approaches including Discrete Fracture Networks, pipe networks and equivalent continuous media. While benchmarked usually within site studies, we propose an alternative numerical benchmark based on highly-resolved Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) and on a stochastic approach. Test cases are built on fractures of different lengths, orientations, aspect ratios and hydraulic apertures, issuing the broad ranges of topological structures and hydraulic properties classically observed. We present 18 DFN cases, with 10 random simulations by case. These 180 DFN structures are provided and fully documented. They display a representative variety of the configurations that challenge the numerical methods at the different stages of discretization, mesh generation and system solving. Using a previously assessed mixed hybrid finite element method (Erhel et al., 2009a), we systematically provide reference flow and head solutions. Because CPU and memory requirements stem mainly from system solving, we study direct and iterative sparse linear solvers. We show that the most cpu-time efficient method is a direct multifrontal method for small systems, while conjugate gradient preconditioned by algebraic multrigrid is more relevant at larger sizes. Available results can be used further as references for building up alternative numerical and physical models in both directions of improving accuracy and efficiency.},

High-accuracy simulations are therefore required for validating these simplified models and their domain of validity. The present paper proposes an efficient workflow based on open-source software to obtain transport simulations. High-quality computational meshes for DFNs are first generated using the conforming meshing approach FraC. Then, a tracer transport model implemented in the open-source code DuMux is used for simulating tracer transport driven by the advection-dispersion equation. We adopt the box method, a vertex-centered finite volume scheme for spatial discretization, which ensures concentration continuity and mass conservation at intersections between fractures. Numerical results on simple networks for validation purposes and on complex realistic DFNs are presented. An a-posteriori convergence study of the discretization method shows an order of convergence O(h) for tracer concentration with h the mesh size.},

We present an iterative splitting scheme that allows solving the set of governing equations efficiently in a sequential manner. We assess the performances of this strategy in terms of convergence and mass conservation.

  abstract = {Summary A fractured poroelastic body is considered where the opening of the fractures is governed by a nonpenetration law, whereas slip is described by a Coulomb-type friction law. This physical model results in a nonlinear variational inequality problem. The variational inequality is rewritten as a complementary function, and a semismooth Newton method is used to solve the system of equations. For the discretization, we use a hybrid scheme where the displacements are given in terms of degrees of freedom per element, and an additional Lagrange multiplier representing the traction is added on the fracture faces. The novelty of our method comes from combining the Lagrange multiplier from the hybrid scheme with a finite volume discretization of the poroelastic Biot equation, which allows us to directly impose the inequality constraints on each subface. The convergence of the method is studied for several challenging geometries in 2D and 3D, showing that the convergence rates of the finite volume scheme do not deteriorate when it is coupled to the Lagrange multipliers. Our method is especially attractive for the poroelastic problem because it allows for a straightforward coupling between the matrix deformation, contact conditions, and fluid pressure.},

  abstract  = {Fluid-induced slip of fractures is characterized by strong multiphysics couplings. Three physical processes are considered: Flow, rock deformation and fracture deformation. The fractures are represented as lower-dimensional objects embedded in a three-dimensional domain. Fluid is modeled as slightly compressible, and flow in both fractures and matrix is accounted for. The deformation of rock is inherently different from the deformation of fractures; thus, two different models are needed to describe the mechanical deformation of the rock. The medium surrounding the fractures is modeled as a linear elastic material, while the slip of fractures is modeled as a contact problem, governed by a static-dynamic friction model. We present an iterative scheme for solving the non-linear set of equations that arise from the models, and suggest how the step parameter in this scheme should depend on the shear modulus and mesh size.},

  abstract = {Abstract Shear-dilation-based hydraulic stimulations can enable commercial exploitation of geothermal energy from reservoirs with inadequate initial permeability. While contributing to enhancing the reservoir's permeability, hydraulic stimulation processes may also lead to undesired seismic activity. Here we present a three-dimensional numerical model aiming to aid increased understanding of shear-dilation based hydraulic stimulation and its consequences. The fractured reservoir is modeled as a network of explicitly represented large-scale fractures immersed in a permeable rock matrix. The numerical formulation is constructed by coupling three physical processes: fluid flow, fracture deformation, and rock matrix deformation. For flow simulations, the discrete fracture-matrix model is used, which allows fluid transport from high-permeable conductive fractures to rock matrix and vice versa. The mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled with reversible and irreversible deformations corresponding to elastic deformation and slip. Linear elasticity is assumed for mechanical deformation and stress alteration of the rock matrix. Fractures are modeled as lower-dimensional surfaces embodied in the domain, subjected to specific governing equations for their deformation along the tangential and normal directions. Both the fluid flow and momentum balance equations are approximated by finite volume discretizations. The new numerical model is demonstrated considering a three-dimensional fractured formation with a network of 20 explicitly represented fractures. The effects of fluid exchange between fractures and rock matrix on the permeability evolution and the generated seismicity are examined for test cases resembling realistic reservoir conditions.},

The aim of the work is to develop a numerical scheme suitable to model the interplay among several fractures subject to fluid injection in different geometric configurations, in view of the application of this technique to hydraulic fracturing. The eXtended Finite Element Method, here employed for both the mechanical and fluid-dynamic problems, is particularly useful to analyze different configurations without remeshing. In particular, we adopt an ad hoc enrichment for the displacement at the fracture tip and a hybrid dimensional approach for the fluid. After the presentation of the model and discretization details we discuss some test cases to assess the impact of fracture spacing on aperture during injection.},

We consider a cell-centered finite-volume approach, termed the multi-point stress approximation (MPSA) method, which is developed in order to discretize coupled flow and mechanical deformation in the subsurface. Within the MPSA framework, we consider fractures as co-dimension one inclusions in the domain, with the fracture surfaces represented as line pairs in 2D (face pairs in 3D) that displace relative to each other. Fracture deformation is coupled to that of the surrounding domain through internal boundary conditions. This approach is natural within the finite-volume framework, where tractions are defined on surfaces of the grid. The MPSA method is capable of modeling deformation, considering open and closed fractures with complex and nonlinear relationships governing the displacements and tractions at the fracture surfaces. We validate our proposed approach using both problems, for which analytical solutions are available, and more complex benchmark problems, including comparison with a finite-element discretization.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the controlling mechanisms underlying injection-induced seismicity is important for optimizing reservoir productivity and addressing seismicity-related concerns related to hydraulic stimulation in Enhanced Geothermal Systems. Hydraulic stimulation enhances permeability through elevated pressures, which cause normal deformations and the shear slip of preexisting fractures. Previous experiments indicate that fracture deformation in the normal direction reverses as the pressure decreases, e.g., at the end of stimulation. We hypothesize that this normal closure of fractures enhances pressure propagation away from the injection region and significantly increases the potential for postinjection seismicity. To test this hypothesis, hydraulic stimulation is modeled by numerically coupling flow in the fractures and matrix, fracture deformation, and matrix deformation for a synthetic reservoir in which the flow and mechanics are strongly affected by a complex three-dimensional fracture network. The role of the normal closure of fractures is verified by comparing simulations conducted with and without the normal closure effect.},

To perform an accurate numerical study of the correlation among fluid injection, seismicity rates and maximum earthquake magnitude, it is necessary to characterize the model with two fundamental features: first, the presence of a system of faults possibly intersecting among each other; second, the variability of the hydro-mechanical properties across the region surrounding each fault plane (fault zone). The novelty of this work is to account for these two aspects combining together two different numerical techniques that have been proposed in literature for the fault's modelling: for the first feature, interface elements are used to describe the frictional contacts occurring on the fault surfaces; for the second feature, solid elements are adopted to describe the heterogeneous hydro-mechanical behavior across the fault zone. Moreover, we account for a spatial variation of the permeability in the fault zone both along the dip and the normal direction with respect to the fault plane. We compute the numerical solution for six models among which we vary the permeability contrasts between protolith rocks and damage zone and between damage zone and fault core. We demonstrate that the anisotropy of permeability of the fault zone has a strong impact both on the timing and on the magnitude of triggered earthquakes. We suggest that a similar approach, which includes the entire architecture of the fault zone, shall be included in fluid-flow-geomechanical simulations to improve fault stability analysis during fluid injection.},

Here, we discuss monotonicity for a simplified problem of single-phase flow, but where the simulation grids and media are allowed to be general, posing challenges to control-volume methods. We discuss discrete formulations of the maximum principle and derive sufficient criteria for discrete monotonicity for arbitrary nine-point control-volume discretizations for conforming quadrilateral grids in 2D. These criteria are less restrictive than the M-matrix property. It is shown that it is impossible to construct nine-point methods which unconditionally satisfy the monotonicity criteria when the discretization satisfies local conservation and exact reproduction of linear potential fields. Numerical examples are presented which show the validity of the criteria for monotonicity. Further, the impact of nonmonotonicity is studied. Different behavior for different discretization methods is illuminated, and simple ideas are presented for improvement in terms of monotonicity.},

  abstract = {Multiscale simulation is a promising approach to facilitate direct simulation of large and complex grid models for highly heterogeneous petroleum reservoirs. Unlike traditional simulation, approaches based on upscaling/downscaling, multiscale methods seek to solve the full flow problem by incorporating subscale heterogeneities into local discrete approximation spaces. We consider a multiscale formulation based on a hierarchical grid approach, where basis functions with subgrid resolution are computed numerically to correctly and accurately account for subscale variations from an underlying (fine-scale) geomodel when solving the global flow equations on a coarse grid. By using multiscale basis functions to discretise the global flow equations on a (moderately sized) coarse grid, one can retain the efficiency of an upscaling method and, at the same time, produce detailed and conservative velocity fields on the underlying fine grid. For pressure equations, the multiscale mixed finite-element method (MsMFEM) has been shown to be a particularly versatile approach. In this paper, we extend the method to corner-point grids, which is the industry standard for modelling complex reservoir geology. To implement MsMFEM, one needs a discretisation method for solving local flow problems on the underlying fine grids. In principle, any stable and conservative method can be used. Here, we use a mimetic discretisation, which is a generalisation of mixed finite elements that gives a discrete inner product, allows for polyhedral elements, and can (easily) be extended to curved grid faces. The coarse grid can, in principle, be any partition of the subgrid, where each coarse block is a connected collection of subgrid cells. However, we argue that, when generating coarse grids, one should follow certain simple guidelines to achieve improved accuracy. We discuss partitioning in both index space and physical space and suggest simple processing techniques. The versatility and accuracy of the new multiscale mixed methodology is demonstrated on two corner-point models: a small Y-shaped sector model and a complex model of a layered sedimentary bed. A variety of coarse grids, both violating and obeying the above mentioned guidelines, are employed. The MsMFEM solutions are compared with a reference solution obtained by direct simulation on the subgrid.},

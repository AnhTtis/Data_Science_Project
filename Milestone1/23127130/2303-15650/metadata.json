    "abstract": "A knot K is the resultant of a knot H if there exists a minimal crossing diagram D of K such that some crossings of D can be altered to produce H. K is fertile if every prime knot H with crossing number less than c(K) is a resultant of K. K is n-fertile if every prime knot H with crossing number less than n is a resultant of K. We classify the fertility and fertility number of all rational links. This requires the introduction of the analogous concept of link fertility.",

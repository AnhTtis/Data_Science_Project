    "abstract": "A deep autoencoder (DAE)-based end-to-end communication over the two-user Z-interference channel (ZIC) with finite-alphabet inputs is designed in this paper. The design is for imperfect channel state information (CSI) where both estimation and quantization errors exist. The proposed structure jointly optimizes the encoders and decoders to generate interferenceaware constellations that adapt their shape to the interference intensity in order to minimize the bit error rate. A normalization layer is designed to guarantee an average power constraint in the DAE while allowing the architecture to generate constellations with nonuniform shapes. This brings further shaping gain compared to standard uniform constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation. The performance of the DAE-ZIC is compared with two conventional methods, i.e., standard and rotated constellations. The proposed structure significantly enhances the performance of the ZIC. Simulation results confirm bit error rate reduction in all interference regimes (weak, moderate, and strong). At a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, the improvements reach about two orders of magnitude when only quantization error exists, indicating that the DAE-ZIC is highly robust to the interference compared to the conventional methods.",

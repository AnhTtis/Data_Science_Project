    "abstract": "Due to large reflection and diffraction losses in the THz band, it is arguable to achieve reliable links in the none-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases. Intelligent reflecting surfaces, although are expected to solve the blockage problem and enhance the system connectivity, suffer from power consumption and operation complexity. In this work, non-intelligent reflecting surface (NIRS), which are simply made of costless metal foils and have no signal configuration capability, are adopted to enhance the signal strength and coverage in the THz band. Channel measurements are conducted in typical indoor scenarios at 300 GHz band to validate the effectiveness of the NIRS. Based on the measurement results, the positive influences of the NIRS are studied, including the improvement of path power and coverage. Numerical results show that by invoking the NIRS, the power of reflected/scattering paths can be increased by more than 10 dB. Moreover, with the NIRS, over half area in the measured scenario has doubled received power and the coverage ratio for a 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio threshold is increased by up to 39%.",

    "abstract": "The Matrix Bochner Problem aims to classify which weight matrices have their sequence of orthogonal polynomials as eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator. Casper and Yakimov, in [2], demonstrated that, under certain hypotheses, all solutions to the Matrix Bochner Problem are noncommutative bispectral Darboux transformations of a direct sum of classical scalar weights. This paper aims to provide the first proof that there are solutions to the Matrix Bochner Problem that do not arise through a noncommutative bispectral Darboux transformation of any direct sum of classical scalar weights. This initial example could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the general solution to the Matrix Bochner Problem.",

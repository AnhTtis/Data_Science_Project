\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
We have presented RICO, a novel approach for compositional reconstruction in indoor scenes. 
Our key motivation is to regularize the unobservable regions for the objects with partial observations in indoor scenes. 
We exploit the geometry smoothness for the occluded background, and then adopt the improved background as the prior to regularize the objects' geometry. Our experimental results prove that our method achieves compositional reconstruction with fewer artifacts and watertight object geometry, which further facilitates applicable applications like object manipulation.

\boldparagraph{Future work} Currently, each object's pose is baked with its geometry. We identify learning the shape and pose separately as potential direction for more flexible applications.

 \section{Conclusion}

 In this paper, we presented our innovative perspective on enhancing semantic interoperability in data spaces through the use of machine learning. Our focus was on six crucial aspects of interoperability within the International Data Spaces architecture, and we highlighted the significance of each of these aspects and how machine learning can improve their impact on successful data exchange.

As a follow-up to this work, we plan to test some of the concepts and solutions presented in this paper by integrating them into real-world data exchange scenarios in both the International Data Spaces and Gaia-X architectures. This will provide valuable insights into the practical implementation and effectiveness of our proposed approach, and help to further advance the state of the art in data interoperability and exchange.

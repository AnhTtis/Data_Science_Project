\subsection{Computation Complexity}
\label{sec:complexity}

Here we analyze the time complexity of different query reasoning models categorized by different operations, including relation projection, intersection, union, negation and answer retrieval after obtaining the representation of the query. We list the asymptotic complexity in \autoref{tab:complexity-stepwise} for methods that perform stepwise encoding of the query graph, and \autoref{tab:complexity-together} for methods (mostly GNN-based) that encode the whole query graph simultaneously including projection and other logic operations.

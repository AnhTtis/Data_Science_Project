    "abstract": "We investigate the flavor dependence of jet quenching, by performing a systematic analysis of medium modifications on the inclusive jet, $γ$+jet, and $b$-jet in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Our results from MadGraph+PYTHIA and LBT exhibit excellent agreement with experimental measurements of the inclusive jet, $γ$+jet and $b$-jet simultaneously both in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions. We then utilize a Bayesian data-driven method to extract systematically the flavor-dependent jet energy loss distributions from experimental data, where the gluon, light quark and $b$-quark initiated energy loss distributions are well constrained. It is shown that the quark-initiated jet energy loss distribution shows weaker centrality and $p_T$ dependence than the gluon-initiated one. We demonstrate the impacts of the slope of initial spectra,color-charge as well as parton mass dependent jet energy attenuation on the $γ/b$-jet suppression observed in heavy-ion collisions.",

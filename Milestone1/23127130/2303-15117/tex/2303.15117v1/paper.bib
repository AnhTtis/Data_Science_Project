	abstract = {We present new nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models of RR Lyrae stars computed assuming a constant helium-to-metal enrichment ratio and a broad range in metal abundances (Z = 0.0001–0.02). The stellar masses and luminosities adopted to construct the pulsation models were fixed according to detailed central He-burning horizontal-branch evolutionary models. The pulsation models cover a broad range in stellar luminosity and effective temperatures and the modal stability is investigated for both fundamental (FU) and first overtone polsators (FOs). We predict the topology of the instability strip (IS) as a function of the metal content and new analytical relations for the edges of the IS in the observational plane. Moreover, a new analytical relation to constrain the pulsation mass of double pulsators as a function of the period ratio and the metal content is provided. We derive new Period–Radius–Metallicity relations for FU and FO pulsators. They agree quite well with similar empirical and theoretical relations in the literature. From the predicted bolometric light curves, transformed into optical (UBVRI) and near-infrared (NIR; JHK) bands, we compute the intensity-averaged mean magnitudes along the entire pulsation cycle and in turn new and homogenous metal-dependent (RIJHK) Period–Luminosity relations. Moreover, we compute new dual and triple-band optical, optical–NIR, and NIR Period–Wesenheit–Metallicity relations. Interestingly, we find that the optical Period-W(V, B–V) is independent of the metal content and that the accuracy of individual distances is a balance between the adopted diagnostics and the precision of photometric and spectroscopic data sets.}

The time-series data for RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic bulge and the Magellanic Clouds are taken from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment survey while the infrared light curves are compiled from the literature. We also analyse the multiband theoretical light curves that are generated from the stellar pulsation models of RR Lyrae stars for a wide range of metal abundances. We find that the theoretical light-curve parameters with different metal abundances are consistent with observed parameters in most period bins at both optical and infrared wavelengths. The theoretical and observed Fourier amplitude parameters decrease with increase in wavelength while the Fourier phase parameters increase with wavelength at a given period. We use absolute magnitudes for a subset of theoretical models that fit the observed optical RR Lyrae light curves in the Large Magellanic Cloud to estimate a distance modulus, μLMC = 18.51 ± 0.07, independent of the metallicity. We also use Fourier analysis to study the period–colour and amplitude–colour relations for RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic Clouds using optical data and find that the slope of period–colour relation at minimum light is very shallow or flat and becomes increasingly significant at the maximum light for RRab stars. We also find that the metallicity dependence of the period–colour relations increases as we go from minimum to maximum light, suggesting that the mean light results are indeed an average of the various pulsational phases. We summarize that the average variation in these relations is consistent between theory and observations and supports the theory of the interaction of the stellar photosphere and the hydrogen ionization front.}",

	abstract = {We determine the dependence of the initial helium abundance and the present-day helium abundance in the convective envelope of solar models (Yini and Ysurf, respectively) on the parameters that are used to construct the models. We do so by using reference standard solar models (SSMs) to compute the power-law coefficients of the dependence of Yini and Ysurf on the input parameters. We use these dependencies to determine the correlation between Yini and Ysurf and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in Yini from all solar model input parameters except the microscopic diffusion rate. We find an expression for Yini that depends only on Ysurf and the diffusion rate. By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium abundance, Ysurf☉ = 0.2485 ± 0.0035, and an uncertainty of 20\% for the diffusion rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, Yini☉, is 0.278 ± 0.006 independently of the reference SSMs (and particularly on the adopted solar abundances) used in the derivation of the correlation between Yini and Ysurf. When non-SSMs with extra mixing are used, then we derive Yini☉ = 0.273 ± 0.006. In both cases, the derived Yini☉ value is higher than that directly derived from solar model calibrations when the low-metallicity solar abundances (e.g., by Asplund et al.) are adopted in the models.}

	title = {Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud: The {RR} Lyrae Stars},
	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {New photometry and spectroscopy for more than a hundred RR Lyrae stars in two fields located close to the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are used to derive new accurate estimates of the average magnitude, the local reddening, the luminosity-metallicity relation, and the distance to the LMC. The average apparent luminosity of the RR Lyraes with complete V and B light curves is ⟨V(RR)⟩ = 19.412 ± 0.019 (σ = 0.153), ⟨B(RR)⟩ = 19.807 ± 0.022 (σ = 0.172) in our field A (62 stars) and ⟨V(RR)⟩ = 19.320 ± 0.023 (σ = 0.159), ⟨B(RR)⟩ = 19.680 ± 0.024 (σ = 0.163) in our field B (46 stars). The average V apparent luminosity of the clump stars in the same areas is 0.108 and 0.029 mag brighter than the RR Lyrae level (⟨Vclump⟩ = 19.304 ± 0.002 and 19.291 ± 0.003, in field A: 6728 stars, and B: 3851 stars, respectively). Metallicities from low-resolution spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope have been derived for 101 RR Lyrae stars, finding an average value of [Fe/H] = -1.48 ± 0.03 (σ = 0.29, on the Harris metallicity scale). An estimate of the reddening within the two fields was obtained (1) from the Sturch method applied to the fundamental-mode pulsators (RRab's) with known metal abundance and (2) from the colors of the edges of the instability strip defined by the full sample of RR Lyrae variable stars. We obtained E(B-V) = 0.116 ± 0.017 and 0.086 ± 0.017 mag in fields A and B, respectively, with a clear-cut indication of a 0.03 mag differential reddening between the two fields. We find that reddening in field A is 0.028 mag smaller than derived by OGLE-II in the same area. On average, the new reddenings are also 0.035 mag larger than derived from Cepheids with projected distances within 2° from the centers of our fields. The new metallicities were combined with the apparent average V0 luminosities to determine the slope of the luminosity-metallicity relation for the RR Lyrae stars. We derived ΔMV(RR)/Δ [Fe/H] = 0.214 ± 0.047, with no clear evidence for the change in slope at [Fe/H] = -1.5, as recently suggested by evolutionary/pulsation and horizontal-branch models.

The dereddened apparent average luminosity of the RR Lyraes defined by the present photometry is ⟨V(RR)⟩0 = 19.064 ± 0.064 at [Fe/H] = -1.5. When coupled with the absolute magnitude derived from the Baade-Wesselink and the statistical parallaxes methods (MV(RR) = 0.68 ± 0.15 and 0.76 ± 0.13 mag at [Fe/H] = -1.5), both methods known to favor the short distance scale, this value leads to distance moduli for the LMC of μLMC = 18.38 ± 0.16 and μLMC = 18.30 ± 0.14, respectively. If we use instead the absolute magnitude from the new main-sequence fitting of Galactic globular clusters from Gratton et al. [MV(RR) = 0.61 ± 0.07 mag at [Fe/H] = -1.5], we derive μLMC = 18.45 ± 0.09.

The average I apparent luminosity of the clump stars derived by the present photometry is ⟨Iclump⟩ = 18.319 ± 0.002 and 18.307 ± 0.003, in field A (σ = 0.190, 6728 stars) and B (σ = 0.184, 3851 stars), respectively. These values, once corrected for our new reddening estimates, lead to ⟨I⟩0 = 18.12 ± 0.06 mag and move the clump distance modulus to the LMC to 18.42 ± 0.07 and 18.45 ± 0.07 when Udalski or Popowski metallicity-I luminosity relations for the clump stars are adopted.

All these values are only 1 σ shorter than provided by the Population I distance indicators and make it possible to reconcile the short- and long-distance scale on a common value for the distance modulus of the LMC of μLMC = 18.515 ± 0.085 mag.}

In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity.

@article{marquardt63,
  abstract = {Most algorithms for the least-squares estimation of non-linear parameters
	have centered about either of two approaches. On the one hand, the
	model may be expanded as a Taylor series and corrections to the several
	parameters calculated at each iteration on the assumption of local
	linearity. On the other hand, various modifications of the method
	of steepest-descent have been used. Both methods not infrequently
	run aground, the Taylor series method because of divergence of the
	successive iterates, the steepest-descent (or gradient) methods because
	of agonizingly slow convergence after the first few iterations. In
	this paper a maximum neighborhood method is developed which, in effect,
	performs an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method
	and the gradient method, the interpolation being based upon the maximum
	neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate
	representation of the nonlinear model. The results are extended to
	the problem of solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

abstract = "A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed."

This paper presents a novel heuristics approach for neural networks global learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based upon the least-squares (LS) method to maintain the fast convergence speed and a Penalty (PEN) approach to solve the problem of local minima. The penalty term superimposes into the error surface, which likely to provide a way of escape from the local minima when the convergence stalls. The choice and adjustment for the penalty factor are also derived to demonstrate the effect of the penalty term and to ensure the convergence of the algorithm. The developed learning algorithm is applied to several problems of classification application. In all the tested problems, the proposed algorithm outperforms other conventional algorithms in terms of convergence speed and the ability of escaping from the local minima."

abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

    abstract = { The present paper embodies an attempt towards a physical explanation of the ordered gradation in the spectra of stars—a subject in which pioneering work was done by the late Sir Norman Lockyer, but which was worked up with systematic thoroughness at the Harvard College Observatory, under the lead of the late Prof. E. C. Pickering and Miss A. J. Cannon. During this interval the spectra of more than 100,000 stars have been photographed, classified, and published with full details in the Henry Draper Memorial Catalogue. The most noteworthy facts which have been brought to light from these monumental studies have thus been summarised by H. N. Russell. "The spectra of the stars show remarkably few radical differences in type. More than 99 per cent. of them fall into one or the other of the six great groups which during the classic work of the Harvard College Observatory were recognised as of fundamental importance, and received as designations, by the process of the survival of the fittest, the rather arbitrary letters B, A, F, G, K, M. That there should be so few types is noteworthy, but much more remarkable is the fact that they form a continuous series. Every degree of gradation between the typical spectra denoted by B and A may be found in different stars, and the same is true to the end of the series, a fact recognised in the familiar decimal classification, in which B5A, for example, denotes a spectrum half-way between the typical examples B and A. The series is not merely continuous, it is linear. There exists slight difference between the spectra of different stars of the same spectral class, such as Ao, but these relate to minor details. Almost all the stars of the small outstanding minority fall into three other classes (or rather four), denoted by the letters P, O, N, R. Of these, O undoubtedly precedes B at the head of the series, while R and N, which grade one into the other, come probably at its other end, though in this case the transition stages are not clearly worked out.” }

        low- to high-order radial oscillations (0 {\ensuremath{\leq}} n
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 16). The instability boundaries are a strong
        function of both composition and radial order (n). With
        decreasing hydrogen abundance we find that (I) the classical
        blue edge of the Cepheid instability strip shifts to higher
        effective temperature and luminosity, and (II) high-order modes
        are more easily excited and small islands of high radial-order
        instability develop, some of which correspond with real stars.
        Driving in all cases is by the classical
        {\ensuremath{\kappa}}-mechanism and/or strange modes. We
        identify regions of parameter space where new classes of
        pulsating variable may, in future, be discovered. The majority

  abstract = "Important time scales considered include the pulsation period,
              the 'free-fall' time, the Kelvin time, and the 'nuclear' time.
              Some observational and basic theoretical considerations are
              discussed, taking into account classical Cepheids and the
              period-luminosity relation, more recently recognized types of
              variable stars, the empirical determination of radii of pulsating
              stars, limb darkening and radial velocity, Eulerian and
              Lagrangian descriptions, the gravitational field, and the energy
              conservation theorem for a self-gravitating system. Radial
              oscillations of stars are described, giving attention to
              spherically symmetric radial motion, linearized equations, linear
              adiabatic radial oscillations, the pulsational stability of
              actual stars, the phase lag, and simple models of stellar
              pulsation. Nonradial oscillations of stars are studied, taking
              into account the general nonlinear partial differential equation,
              the hermiticity of the linear adiabatic wave equation, the growth
              or decay of small nonradial oscillations, and linear nonradial
              oscillations of spherical stars.",

    abstract = "{Period–colour and amplitude–colour (PCAC) relations can be used to probe both the hydrodynamics of outer envelope structure and evolutionary status of Cepheids and RR Lyraes. In this work, we incorporate the PCAC relations for RR Lyraes, BL Her, W Vir, and classical Cepheids in a single unifying theory that involves the interaction of the hydrogen ionization front (HIF) and stellar photosphere and the theory of stellar evolution. PC relations for RR Lyraes and classical Cepheids using the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV) data are found to be consistent with this theory: RR Lyraes have shallow/sloped relations at minimum/maximum light, whilst long-period (P \\&gt; 10 d) Cepheids exhibit sloped/flat PC relations at minimum/maximum light. The differences in the PC relations for Cepheids and RR Lyraes can be explained based on the relative location of the HIF and stellar photosphere which changes depending on their position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. We also extend our analysis of PCAC relations for type II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds using OGLE-IV data. We find that BL Her stars have sloped PC relations at maximum and minimum light similar to short-period (P \\&lt; 10 d) classical Cepheids. W Vir stars exhibit sloped/flat PC relation at minimum/maximum light similar to long-period classical Cepheids. We also compute state-of-the-art 1D radiation hydrodynamic models of RR Lyraes, BL Her and classical Cepheids using the radial stellar pulsation code in mesa to further test these ideas theoretically and find that the models are generally consistent with this picture. We are thus able to explain PC relations at maximum and minimum light across a broad spectrum of variable star types.}",

	abstract = {We present new nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models of RR Lyrae stars computed assuming a constant helium-to-metal enrichment ratio and a broad range in metal abundances (Z = 0.0001–0.02). The stellar masses and luminosities adopted to construct the pulsation models were fixed according to detailed central He-burning horizontal-branch evolutionary models. The pulsation models cover a broad range in stellar luminosity and effective temperatures and the modal stability is investigated for both fundamental (FU) and first overtone polsators (FOs). We predict the topology of the instability strip (IS) as a function of the metal content and new analytical relations for the edges of the IS in the observational plane. Moreover, a new analytical relation to constrain the pulsation mass of double pulsators as a function of the period ratio and the metal content is provided. We derive new Period–Radius–Metallicity relations for FU and FO pulsators. They agree quite well with similar empirical and theoretical relations in the literature. From the predicted bolometric light curves, transformed into optical (UBVRI) and near-infrared (NIR; JHK) bands, we compute the intensity-averaged mean magnitudes along the entire pulsation cycle and in turn new and homogenous metal-dependent (RIJHK) Period–Luminosity relations. Moreover, we compute new dual and triple-band optical, optical–NIR, and NIR Period–Wesenheit–Metallicity relations. Interestingly, we find that the optical Period-W(V, B–V) is independent of the metal content and that the accuracy of individual distances is a balance between the adopted diagnostics and the precision of photometric and spectroscopic data sets.},

The time-series data for RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic bulge and the Magellanic Clouds are taken from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment survey while the infrared light curves are compiled from the literature. We also analyse the multiband theoretical light curves that are generated from the stellar pulsation models of RR Lyrae stars for a wide range of metal abundances. We find that the theoretical light-curve parameters with different metal abundances are consistent with observed parameters in most period bins at both optical and infrared wavelengths. The theoretical and observed Fourier amplitude parameters decrease with increase in wavelength while the Fourier phase parameters increase with wavelength at a given period. We use absolute magnitudes for a subset of theoretical models that fit the observed optical RR Lyrae light curves in the Large Magellanic Cloud to estimate a distance modulus, μLMC = 18.51 ± 0.07, independent of the metallicity. We also use Fourier analysis to study the period–colour and amplitude–colour relations for RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic Clouds using optical data and find that the slope of period–colour relation at minimum light is very shallow or flat and becomes increasingly significant at the maximum light for RRab stars. We also find that the metallicity dependence of the period–colour relations increases as we go from minimum to maximum light, suggesting that the mean light results are indeed an average of the various pulsational phases. We summarize that the average variation in these relations is consistent between theory and observations and supports the theory of the interaction of the stellar photosphere and the hydrogen ionization front.},

	abstract = {We determine the dependence of the initial helium abundance and the present-day helium abundance in the convective envelope of solar models (Yini and Ysurf, respectively) on the parameters that are used to construct the models. We do so by using reference standard solar models (SSMs) to compute the power-law coefficients of the dependence of Yini and Ysurf on the input parameters. We use these dependencies to determine the correlation between Yini and Ysurf and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in Yini from all solar model input parameters except the microscopic diffusion rate. We find an expression for Yini that depends only on Ysurf and the diffusion rate. By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium abundance, Ysurf☉ = 0.2485 ± 0.0035, and an uncertainty of 20\% for the diffusion rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, Yini☉, is 0.278 ± 0.006 independently of the reference SSMs (and particularly on the adopted solar abundances) used in the derivation of the correlation between Yini and Ysurf. When non-SSMs with extra mixing are used, then we derive Yini☉ = 0.273 ± 0.006. In both cases, the derived Yini☉ value is higher than that directly derived from solar model calibrations when the low-metallicity solar abundances (e.g., by Asplund et al.) are adopted in the models.},

	abstract = {New photometry and spectroscopy for more than a hundred RR Lyrae stars in two fields located close to the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are used to derive new accurate estimates of the average magnitude, the local reddening, the luminosity-metallicity relation, and the distance to the LMC. The average apparent luminosity of the RR Lyraes with complete V and B light curves is ⟨V(RR)⟩ = 19.412 ± 0.019 (σ = 0.153), ⟨B(RR)⟩ = 19.807 ± 0.022 (σ = 0.172) in our field A (62 stars) and ⟨V(RR)⟩ = 19.320 ± 0.023 (σ = 0.159), ⟨B(RR)⟩ = 19.680 ± 0.024 (σ = 0.163) in our field B (46 stars). The average V apparent luminosity of the clump stars in the same areas is 0.108 and 0.029 mag brighter than the RR Lyrae level (⟨Vclump⟩ = 19.304 ± 0.002 and 19.291 ± 0.003, in field A: 6728 stars, and B: 3851 stars, respectively). Metallicities from low-resolution spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope have been derived for 101 RR Lyrae stars, finding an average value of [Fe/H] = -1.48 ± 0.03 (σ = 0.29, on the Harris metallicity scale). An estimate of the reddening within the two fields was obtained (1) from the Sturch method applied to the fundamental-mode pulsators (RRab's) with known metal abundance and (2) from the colors of the edges of the instability strip defined by the full sample of RR Lyrae variable stars. We obtained E(B-V) = 0.116 ± 0.017 and 0.086 ± 0.017 mag in fields A and B, respectively, with a clear-cut indication of a 0.03 mag differential reddening between the two fields. We find that reddening in field A is 0.028 mag smaller than derived by OGLE-II in the same area. On average, the new reddenings are also 0.035 mag larger than derived from Cepheids with projected distances within 2° from the centers of our fields. The new metallicities were combined with the apparent average V0 luminosities to determine the slope of the luminosity-metallicity relation for the RR Lyrae stars. We derived ΔMV(RR)/Δ [Fe/H] = 0.214 ± 0.047, with no clear evidence for the change in slope at [Fe/H] = -1.5, as recently suggested by evolutionary/pulsation and horizontal-branch models. The dereddened apparent average luminosity of the RR Lyraes defined by the present photometry is ⟨V(RR)⟩0 = 19.064 ± 0.064 at [Fe/H] = -1.5. When coupled with the absolute magnitude derived from the Baade-Wesselink and the statistical parallaxes methods (MV(RR) = 0.68 ± 0.15 and 0.76 ± 0.13 mag at [Fe/H] = -1.5), both methods known to favor the short distance scale, this value leads to distance moduli for the LMC of μLMC = 18.38 ± 0.16 and μLMC = 18.30 ± 0.14, respectively. If we use instead the absolute magnitude from the new main-sequence fitting of Galactic globular clusters from Gratton et al. [MV(RR) = 0.61 ± 0.07 mag at [Fe/H] = -1.5], we derive μLMC = 18.45 ± 0.09. The average I apparent luminosity of the clump stars derived by the present photometry is ⟨Iclump⟩ = 18.319 ± 0.002 and 18.307 ± 0.003, in field A (σ = 0.190, 6728 stars) and B (σ = 0.184, 3851 stars), respectively. These values, once corrected for our new reddening estimates, lead to ⟨I⟩0 = 18.12 ± 0.06 mag and move the clump distance modulus to the LMC to 18.42 ± 0.07 and 18.45 ± 0.07 when Udalski or Popowski metallicity-I luminosity relations for the clump stars are adopted. All these values are only 1 σ shorter than provided by the Population I distance indicators and make it possible to reconcile the short- and long-distance scale on a common value for the distance modulus of the LMC of μLMC = 18.515 ± 0.085 mag.},

	abstract = {Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

On the one hand, the model may be expanded as a Taylor series and corrections to the several parameters calculated at each iteration on the assumption of local linearity. On the other hand, various modifications of the method of steepest-descent have been used. Both methods not infrequently run aground, the Taylor series method because of divergence of the successive iterates, the steepest-descent (or gradient) methods because of agonizingly slow convergence after the first few iterations. In this paper a maximum neighborhood method is developed which, in effect, performs an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method and the gradient method, the interpolation being based upon the maximum neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate representation of the nonlinear model. The results are extended to the problem of solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

	abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

This paper presents a novel heuristics approach for neural networks global learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based upon the least-squares (LS) method to maintain the fast convergence speed and a Penalty (PEN) approach to solve the problem of local minima. The penalty term superimposes into the error surface, which likely to provide a way of escape from the local minima when the convergence stalls. The choice and adjustment for the penalty factor are also derived to demonstrate the effect of the penalty term and to ensure the convergence of the algorithm. The developed learning algorithm is applied to several problems of classification application. In all the tested problems, the proposed algorithm outperforms other conventional algorithms in terms of convergence speed and the ability of escaping from the local minima.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

	abstract = {The present paper embodies an attempt towards a physical explanation of the ordered gradation in the spectra of stars—a subject in which pioneering work was done by the late Sir Norman Lockyer, but which was worked up with systematic thoroughness at the Harvard College Observatory, under the lead of the late Prof. E. C. Pickering and Miss A. J. Cannon. During this interval the spectra of more than 100,000 stars have been photographed, classified, and published with full details in the Henry Draper Memorial Catalogue. The most noteworthy facts which have been brought to light from these monumental studies have thus been summarised by H. N. Russell. "The spectra of the stars show remarkably few radical differences in type. More than 99 per cent. of them fall into one or the other of the six great groups which during the classic work of the Harvard College Observatory were recognised as of fundamental importance, and received as designations, by the process of the survival of the fittest, the rather arbitrary letters B, A, F, G, K, M. That there should be so few types is noteworthy, but much more remarkable is the fact that they form a continuous series. Every degree of gradation between the typical spectra denoted by B and A may be found in different stars, and the same is true to the end of the series, a fact recognised in the familiar decimal classification, in which B5A, for example, denotes a spectrum half-way between the typical examples B and A. The series is not merely continuous, it is linear. There exists slight difference between the spectra of different stars of the same spectral class, such as Ao, but these relate to minor details. Almost all the stars of the small outstanding minority fall into three other classes (or rather four), denoted by the letters P, O, N, R. Of these, O undoubtedly precedes B at the head of the series, while R and N, which grade one into the other, come probably at its other end, though in this case the transition stages are not clearly worked out.”},

	volume = {458},
	doi = {10.1093/mnras/stw388},
	abstract = {Using linear non-adiabatic pulsation analysis, we explore the radial- mode (p-mode) stability of stars across a wide range of mass (0.2 \ensuremath\leq M \ensuremath\leq 50\{ M\_\{\{\ensuremathødot\}\}\}), composition (0 \ensuremath\leq X \ensuremath\leq 0.7, Z = 0.001, 0.02), effective temperature (3000 \ensuremath\leq T$_{\textrm{eff}}$\$ \ensuremath\leq 40 000 K), and luminosity (0.01 \ensuremath\leq L/M \ensuremath\leq 100 000 solar units). We identify the instability boundaries associated with low- to high-order radial oscillations (0 \ensuremath\leq n \ensuremath\leq 16). The instability boundaries are a strong function of both composition and radial order (n). With decreasing hydrogen abundance we find that (I) the classical blue edge of the Cepheid instability strip shifts to higher effective temperature and luminosity, and (II) high-order modes are more easily excited and small islands of high radial-order instability develop, some of which correspond with real stars. Driving in all cases is by the classical \ensuremath\kappa-mechanism and/or strange modes. We identify regions of parameter space where new classes of pulsating variable may, in future, be discovered. The majority of these are associated with reduced hydrogen abundance in the envelope; one has not been identified previously.},

	abstract = {Important time scales considered include the pulsation period, the 'free-fall' time, the Kelvin time, and the 'nuclear' time. Some observational and basic theoretical considerations are discussed, taking into account classical Cepheids and the period-luminosity relation, more recently recognized types of variable stars, the empirical determination of radii of pulsating stars, limb darkening and radial velocity, Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions, the gravitational field, and the energy conservation theorem for a self-gravitating system. Radial oscillations of stars are described, giving attention to spherically symmetric radial motion, linearized equations, linear adiabatic radial oscillations, the pulsational stability of actual stars, the phase lag, and simple models of stellar pulsation. Nonradial oscillations of stars are studied, taking into account the general nonlinear partial differential equation, the hermiticity of the linear adiabatic wave equation, the growth or decay of small nonradial oscillations, and linear nonradial oscillations of spherical stars.},

	abstract = {Period–colour and amplitude–colour (PCAC) relations can be used to probe both the hydrodynamics of outer envelope structure and evolutionary status of Cepheids and RR Lyraes. In this work, we incorporate the PCAC relations for RR Lyraes, BL Her, W Vir, and classical Cepheids in a single unifying theory that involves the interaction of the hydrogen ionization front (HIF) and stellar photosphere and the theory of stellar evolution. PC relations for RR Lyraes and classical Cepheids using the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV) data are found to be consistent with this theory: RR Lyraes have shallow/sloped relations at minimum/maximum light, whilst long-period (P \&gt; 10 d) Cepheids exhibit sloped/flat PC relations at minimum/maximum light. The differences in the PC relations for Cepheids and RR Lyraes can be explained based on the relative location of the HIF and stellar photosphere which changes depending on their position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. We also extend our analysis of PCAC relations for type II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds using OGLE-IV data. We find that BL Her stars have sloped PC relations at maximum and minimum light similar to short-period (P \&lt; 10 d) classical Cepheids. W Vir stars exhibit sloped/flat PC relation at minimum/maximum light similar to long-period classical Cepheids. We also compute state-of-the-art 1D radiation hydrodynamic models of RR Lyraes, BL Her and classical Cepheids using the radial stellar pulsation code in mesa to further test these ideas theoretically and find that the models are generally consistent with this picture. We are thus able to explain PC relations at maximum and minimum light across a broad spectrum of variable star types.},

	abstract = {The Large sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) general survey is a spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover approximately half of the celestial sphere and collect 10 million spectra of stars, galaxies and QSOs. Objects in both the pilot survey and the first year regular survey are included in the LAMOST DR1. The pilot survey started in October 2011 and ended in June 2012, and the data have been released to the public as the LAMOST Pilot Data Release in August 2012. The regular survey started in September 2012, and completed its first year of operation in June 2013. The LAMOST DR1 includes a total of 1202 plates containing 2 955 336 spectra, of which 1 790 879 spectra have observed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 10. All data with SNR ≥ 2 are formally released as LAMOST DR1 under the LAMOST data policy. This data release contains a total of 2 204 696 spectra, of which 1 944 329 are stellar spectra, 12 082 are galaxy spectra and 5017 are quasars. The DR1 not only includes spectra, but also three stellar catalogs with measured parameters: late A,FGK-type stars with high quality spectra (1061 918 entries), A-type stars (100 073 entries), and M-type stars (121 522 entries). This paper introduces the survey design, the observational and instrumental limitations, data reduction and analysis, and some caveats. A description of the FITS structure of spectral files and parameter catalogs is also provided.},

	abstract = {Owing to the current and upcoming extensive surveys studying the stellar variability, accurate and quicker methods are required for the astronomers to automate the classification of variable stars. The traditional approach of classification requires the calculation of the period of the observed light curve and assigning different variability patterns of phase folded light curves to different classes. However, applying these methods becomes difficult if the light curves are sparse or contain temporal gaps. Also, period finding algorithms start slowing down and become redundant in such scenarios. In this work, we present a new automated method, 1D CNN-LSTM, for classifying variable stars using a hybrid neural network of one-dimensional CNN and LSTM network which employs the raw time-series data from the variable stars. We apply the network to classify the time-series data obtained from the OGLE and the CRTS survey. We report the best average accuracy of 85\% and F1 score of 0.71 for classifying five classes from the OGLE survey. We simultaneously apply other existing classification methods to our dataset and compare the results.},

We describe how to homogenize the information gleaned from light curves by selection and computation of real-numbered metrics (features), detail methods to robustly estimate periodic features, introduce tree-ensemble methods for accurate variable-star classification, and show how to rigorously evaluate a classifier using cross validation. On a 25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable stars, we achieve a 22.8\% error rate using the random forest (RF) classifier; this represents a 24\% improvement over the best previous classifier on these data. This methodology is effective for identifying samples of specific science classes: for pulsational variables used in Milky Way tomography we obtain a discovery efficiency of 98.2\% and for eclipsing systems we find an efficiency of 99.1\%, both at 95\% purity. The RF classifier is superior to other methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and relative immunity to irrelevant features; the RF can also be used to estimate the importance of each feature in classification. Additionally, we present the first astronomical use of hierarchical classification methods to incorporate a known class taxonomy in the classifier, which reduces the catastrophic error rate from 8\% to 7.8\%. Excluding low-amplitude sources, the overall error rate improves to 14\%, with a catastrophic error rate of 3.5\%.},

	abstract = {Photometric variability detection is often considered as a hypothesis testing problem: an object is variable if the null hypothesis that its brightness is constant can be ruled out given the measurements and their uncertainties. The practical applicability of this approach is limited by uncorrected systematic errors. We propose a new variability detection technique sensitive to a wide range of variability types while being robust to outliers and underestimated measurement uncertainties. We consider variability detection as a classification problem that can be approached with machine learning. Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Neural Nets (NN), Random Forests (RF), and Stochastic Gradient Boosting classifier (SGB) are applied to 18 features (variability indices) quantifying scatter and/or correlation between points in a light curve. We use a subset of Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment phase two (OGLE-II) Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) photometry (30 265 light curves) that was searched for variability using traditional methods (168 known variable objects) as the training set and then apply the NN to a new test set of 31 798 OGLE-II LMC light curves. Among 205 candidates selected in the test set, 178 are real variables, while 13 low-amplitude variables are new discoveries. The machine learning classifiers considered are found to be more efficient (select more variables and fewer false candidates) compared to traditional techniques using individual variability indices or their linear combination. The NN, SGB, SVM, and RF show a higher efficiency compared to LR and kNN.},

Significant discrepancies between Sun and meteorites occur only for Fe, Mn, Ge, Pb, and W; other well-determined elements agree to ±9\% on the average. There is no evidence for group fractionations in Cl chondrites of cosmochemically similar elements (refractories, siderophiles, volatiles, etc.), but a selective fractionation of Fe cannot be ruled out. Abundances of odd- A nuclides between A = 65 and 209 show a generally smooth trend, with elemental abundances conforming to the slope defined by isotopic abundances. Significant irregularities occur in the NdSmEu region, however, suggesting that the abundance curve is dependably smooth only down to the ∼20\% level.},

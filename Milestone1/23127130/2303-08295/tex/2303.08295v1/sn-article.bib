abstract = {Ultra-wide band radar systems have gained even more popularity as an emerging technology in health-related research and particularly in the context of ambient intelligence for activity recognition inside smart environments. Indeed, recent technological advances have facilitated their implementation on smaller SoC at lower cost. However, observed practical behaviors not always meet theoretical prediction. Therefore, this paper presents an empirical evaluation of Novelda XeThru X4-based IR-UWB radars behavior. To this end, several experiments were conducted to provide insightful analyses to consider while exploiting such recent technology. We believe that these assessments will benefit to academic researchers by guiding their implementation choices to design new robust activity recognition systems.}

abstract = {Monitoring human vital signs is fundamental to assess a person's general health and detect events such as respiratory distress or heart attacks. As vehicle driving occupies a considerable part of daily lives, monitoring vital signs of a driver is necessary for early detecting potential health issues during driving. However, it is also important to ensure that the driver is neither distracted nor uncomfortable while monitoring. It is thus a challenge to develop contactless and ubiquitous vital sign monitoring. This paper presents contactless breathing rate monitoring for drivers using an impulse ultra-wide band (UWB) radar. We demonstrate that UWB frequency reflects signals from human body and validate a UWB radar for detecting the minute chest movement. Two signal processing methods are designed and evaluated for online and off-line analysis. We investigate 16 different radar positions in a vehicle for robust breathing rate monitoring under the circumstance of body motions during driving. We also perform on-road experiments at a local city and achieve a mean of 1.06 breathing rate estimation error per minute.},

abstract = {Given the significant amount of time people spend in vehicles, health issues under driving condition have become a major concern. Such issues may vary from fatigue, asthma, stroke, to even heart attack, yet they can be adequately indicated by vital signs and abnormal activities. Therefore, in-vehicle vital sign monitoring can help us predict and hence prevent these issues. Whereas existing sensor-based (including camera) methods could be used to detect these indicators, privacy concern and system complexity both call for a convenient yet effective and robust alternative. This paper aims to develop V2iFi, an intelligent system performing monitoring tasks using a COTS impulse radio mounted on the windshield. V2iFi is capable of reliably detecting driver's vital signs under driving condition and with the presence of passengers, thus allowing for potentially inferring corresponding health issues. Compared with prior work based on Wi-Fi CSI, V2iFi is able to distinguish reflected signals from multiple users, and hence provide finer-grained measurements under more realistic settings. We evaluate V2iFi both in lab environments and during real-life road tests; the results demonstrate that respiratory rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability can all be estimated accurately. Based on these estimation results, we further discuss how machine learning models can be applied on top of V2iFi so as to improve both physiological and psychological wellbeing in driving environments.},

This article provides a review of data drawn from a series of related experiments to demonstrate how frequency change (Δf0) is accomplished in the modal register. The research cited involves studies of (1) laryngeal size, (2) vocal fold length, (3) vocal fold thickness, and (4) subglottic pressure; new data describe their effect on vocal fold mass. It was found that changes in these dimensions (1) explain how the shifts in frequency are accomplished, (2) establish the way vocal fold mass can be measured, and (3) strongly support the aerodynamic-myoelastic theory of phonation.}

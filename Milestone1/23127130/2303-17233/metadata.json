    "abstract": "We analyze the amplitudes of one highly excited string (HES) state with two or three tachyons in open bosonic string theory. We argue that these processes are chaotic by showing that the spacing ratios of successive peaks in the angular dependence of the amplitudes are distributed as predicted by the $β$-ensemble of random matrix theory (RMT). We show how the continuous parameter $β$ depends on the level and helicity of the scattered HES state. We derive the scattering amplitude of an HES and three tachyons and show that it takes the form of the Veneziano amplitude times a dressing factor, and that the dressing is chaotic as a function of the scattering angle, in the sense that its spacing ratios match with RMT predictions.",

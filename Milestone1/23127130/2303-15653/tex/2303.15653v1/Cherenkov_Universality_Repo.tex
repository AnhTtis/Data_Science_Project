\section{Cherenkov Universality Repository}\label{CherenkovUniversality}

The numerical methods used to calculate integrals \ref{gg_int2} and \ref{stage_yield} are presented in the Cherenkov Universality python code repository \cite{CherenkovUniversality}. The actual integration is performed in the repository's Cherenkov photon module. It takes on the order of several hours to tabulate Cherenkov distributions for 176 values of $\delta$ and 321 values of $\theta$ at one stage of shower development. Implementations of the charged particle distributions $g_e(\theta_e;l_e)$ and $f_e(E_e;t)$ from \cite{Giller} and \cite{Lafebre} respectively are defined in the repository's charged particle module. Interfaces for these distributions were defined so users could use custom implementations to generate Cherenkov light distributions. These interfaces were made using python's abstract base class support \cite{ABC}.

\section{CHASM (CHerenkov Air Shower Model)}\label{CHASM}
CHASM is a python module which allows users to input shower parameters and counter locations, and a Cherenkov signal is generated using the methods described in this article. It uses methods which account for the curvature of the atmosphere for showers with large zenith angles. By default, the U.S.\ Standard Atmosphere of 1976 is used, however any atmospheric model can be used using the atmosphere interface. Tables generated by the Cherenkov Universality repository \ref{CherenkovUniversality} are included in the CHASM repository as a compressed NumPy file. Users can also use their own table by simply replacing this file as long as the included arrays have the same names and ranks. Compared to CORSIKA IACT, which may take up to many hours to generate a single high-energy air shower from which Cherenkov signals are extracted, CHASM can produce the signals from the same shower in seconds.

The goal of CHASM is to apply Cherenkov universality to a wide range of air shower observation scenarios. The first iteration of CHASM is being tested for implementation in nuSpaceSim, a comprehensive neutrino simulation package for space-based and suborbital experiments \cite{NuSpaceSim}. Tau neutrinos skimming the Earth may interact via the charged-current interaction in the Earth’s crust. The resulting tau particle leaves the Earth and decays, serving as the primary particle in an upward going air shower. As direct simulation of upward going Cherenkov light becomes available in CORSIKA 8 \cite{CORSIKA8}, further development and comparisons will be possible.

The module is available for use at \cite{CHASM}. There are examples which describe how to use it to generate EAS signals, and even EAS libraries. We include an example comparing the signal generated by CHASM directly to that of CORSIKA IACT. It also contains the methods needed to generate unique yield and angular distribution tables with different parameterizations for both the particle energy and angular distributions.

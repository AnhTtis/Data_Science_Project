    "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of Landau-Zener transitions in an anisotropic, dissipative three-level model (3-LZM) using the numerically accurate multiple Davydov D2 Ansatz in the framework of time-dependent variation. It is demonstrated that a non-monotonic relationship exists between the Landau-Zener transition probability and the phonon coupling strength when the 3-LZM is driven by a linear external field. Under the influence of a periodic driving field, phonon coupling may induce peaks in contour plots of the transition probability when the magnitude of the system anisotropy matches the phonon frequency. Dynamics of the 3-LZM have also been probed in the presence of a super-ohmic phonon bath when driven by a periodic driving field. It is found that both the period and the amplitude of the Rabi cycle decay exponentially with the increasing bath coupling strength.",

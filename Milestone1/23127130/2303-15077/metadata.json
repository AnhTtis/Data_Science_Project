    "abstract": "The effect of proximity of the magnetism of the Pr-based manganite (Pr0.6Sr0.4MnO3) on the superconductivity of Bi-based high-temperature superconductor (Bi1.75Pb0.25Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d) was studied based on the results obtained from the magnetotransport and magnetization measurements. Decrease in the values of the upper critical field (HC2(0)) and an increase in the width of the superconducting transition (Delta TC) of Bi1.75Pb0.25Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d were observed in proximity with the manganite. The combined effect of magnetic exchange interaction arising from the manganite, the leakage of Cooper-pairs from the superconductor into the manganite, and the diffusion and transport of spin-polarized electrons from the manganite into the superconductor were found to modify the superconducting properties of Bi1.75Pb0.25Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d. The stacking sequence of the individual layers in these heterostructures was found to dictate the ground state properties of the heterostructure. As a consequence of the proximity effect, the colossal-magnetoresistance (CMR) ratio as high as ~ 99 % observed in the heterostructure makes the thin film heterostructures promising candidates for potential technological applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we mainly study the large time behavior to a 2D micro-macro model for compressible polymeric fluids with small initial data. This model is a coupling of isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. Firstly the Fourier splitting method yields that the logarithmic decay rate. By virtue of the time weighted energy estimate, we can improve the decay rate to $(1 + t)^{-\\frac{1}{4}}$. Under the low-frequency condition and by the Littlewood-Paley theory, we show that the solutions belong to some Besov spaces with negative index and obtain the optimal $L^2$ decay rate. Finally, we obtain the $\\dot{H}^s$ decay rate by establishing a new Fourier splitting estimate.",

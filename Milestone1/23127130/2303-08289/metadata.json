    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) methods have been found to be effective against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. Many variants of AT have been proposed to improve its performance. Pang et al. [1] have recently shown that incorporating hypersphere embedding (HE) into the existing AT procedures enhances robustness. We observe that the existing AT procedures are not designed for the HE framework, and thus fail to adequately learn the angular discriminative information available in the HE framework. In this paper, we propose integrating HE into AT with regularization terms that exploit the rich angular information available in the HE framework. Specifically, our method, termed angular-AT, adds regularization terms to AT that explicitly enforce weight-feature compactness and inter-class separation; all expressed in terms of angular features. Experimental results show that angular-AT further improves adversarial robustness.",

abstract = {In the current research, we investigate the concept of spontaneously nonequilibrium dimension (SND), and show that a SND-based system can break the second law of thermodynamics. The main characteristic of the SND is the inherent nonequilibrium particle crossing ratio. A locally nonchaotic energy barrier is employed to form the model system. On the one hand, when the barrier width is much smaller than the mean free path of the particles, the system cannot reach thermodynamic equilibrium; on the other hand, the nonequilibrium particle distribution allows for production of useful work in a cycle by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir. Such system performance is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo simulation. It should be attributed to the unbalanced cross-influence of the thermally correlated thermodynamic forces, incompatible with the conventional framework of statistical mechanics. No Maxwell’s demon is involved. Similar effects may be achieved by a number of variants, e.g., when the barrier is switchable or there are distributed nonchaotic traps.}

abstract={Many important cell-cycle regulatory proteins are regulated post-translationally by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. These include both positive and negative regulators of the cell cycle.One central role of regulated proteolysis in the context of cell-cycle control is to enforce irreversible cell-cycle phase transitions. This is often accomplished by the rapid and concerted turnover of a negative regulatory protein that impedes a cell-cycle phase transition.Another important role of regulated proteolysis is to restrict the window of accumulation of a cell-cycle regulatory protein to the specific time when the function of that protein is required. Such a strategy prevents significant cell-cycle events occurring out of context.There are two general classes of protein ubiquitin ligase that target cell-cycle regulatory proteins for destruction: APC/C and SCF. Whereas cell-cycle regulation of APC/C activity is intrinsic to the ligase itself, cell-cycle regulation of SCF activity is usually mediated by substrate phosphorylation.SCF protein ubiquitin ligases consist of three core invariant subunits plus one of several variable specificity factors known as F-box proteins. SCFCdc4, which is conserved from yeast to humans, is the SCF protein ubiquitin ligase designated by the F-box-protein Cdc4.In yeast, SCFCdc4 targets a cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor Sic1, thereby promoting a timely and irreversible transition from G1 to S-phase. In mammalian cells, the homologous protein ubiquitin ligase targets the positive cell-cycle-regulator cyclin E. Mutations in the human CDC4 gene are linked to cancer, presumably because they lead to deregulation of cyclin E through the cell cycle.},

Unlike standard ratchet effect for Brownian particles requiring external forcing, in the case of active particles asymmetric potential alone produces a net drift speed (active ratchet effect). By using theoretical models and numerical simulations we demonstrate the emergence of the rectification process in the presence of an asymmetric piecewise periodic potential. The broken spatial symmetry (external potential) and time symmetry (active particles) are sufficient ingredients to sustain unidirectional transport. Our findings open the way to new mechanisms to move in directional manner motile organisms by using external periodic static fields.}

ABSTRACT = {Contrary to microbial taxis, where a tactic response to external stimuli is controlled by complex chemical pathways acting like sensor-actuator loops, taxis of artificial microswimmers is a purely stochastic effect associated with a non-uniform activation of the particles’ self-propulsion. We study the tactic response of such swimmers in a spatio-temporally modulated activating medium by means of both numerical and analytical techniques. In the opposite limits of very fast and very slow rotational particle dynamics, we obtain analytic approximations that closely reproduce the numerical description. A swimmer drifts on average either parallel or anti-parallel to the propagation direction of the activating pulses, depending on their speed and width. The drift in line with the pulses is solely determined by the finite persistence length of the active Brownian motion performed by the swimmer, whereas the drift in the opposite direction results from the combination of the ballistic and diffusive properties of the swimmer’s dynamics.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamical properties of an active particle subject to a swimming speed explicitly depending on the particle position. The oscillating spatial profile of the swim velocity considered in this paper takes inspiration from experimental studies based on Janus particles whose speed can be modulated by an external source of light. We suggest and apply an appropriate model of an active Ornstein Uhlenbeck particle to the present case. This allows us to predict the stationary properties, by finding the exact solution of the steady-state probability distribution of particle position and velocity. From this, we obtain the spatial density profile and show that its form is consistent with the one found in the framework of other popular models. The reduced velocity distribution highlights the emergence of non-Gaussianity in our generalized AOUP model which becomes more evident as the spatial dependence of the velocity profile becomes more pronounced. Then, we focus on the time-dependent properties of the system. Velocity autocorrelation functions are studied in the steady-state combining numerical and analytical methods derived under suitable approximations. We observe a non-monotonic decay in the temporal shape of the velocity autocorrelation function which depends on the ratio between the persistence length and the spatial period of the swim velocity. Finally, we numerically and analytically study the mean square displacement and the long-time diffusion coefficient. The ballistic regime, observed in the small-time region, is deeply affected by the properties of the swim velocity landscape which induces also a crossover to a sub-ballistic but superdiffusive regime for intermediate times. Finally, the long-time diffusion coefficient decreases as the amplitude of the swim velocity oscillations increases because the diffusion is determined by those regions where the particles are slow.},

This rectification process makes it possible to accumulate swimmers in a region of space or to sort different swimmers. Here we study numerically how the separation process depends on the specific motility strategies of the microorganisms involved. Crucial properties such as the separation efficiency and the separation time for two bacterial strains are precisely defined and evaluated. In particular, the sorting of two bacterial populations inoculated in a box consisting of a series of chambers separated by columns of asymmetric obstacles is investigated. We show how the sorting efficiency is enhanced by these obstacles and conclude that this kind of sorting can be efficiently used even when the involved populations differ only in one aspect of their swimming strategy.},

	abstract = {Micron-sized objects having asymmetric boundaries can rectify the chaotic motions of an active bacterial suspension and perform geometrically biased random walks. Using numerical simulations in a planar geometry, we show that arrow-shaped micro-shuttles, constrained to move in one dimension (1D) in a bath of self-propelled micro-organisms, spontaneously perform unidirectional translational motions with a strongly shape-dependent speed. Relaxing the 1D constraint, a random motion in the whole plane sets in at long times, due to random changes in shuttle orientation caused by bacterial collisions. The complex dynamics arising from the mechanical interactions between bacteria and the object boundaries can be described by a Gaussian stochastic force with a shape-dependent mean and a self-correlation decaying exponentially on the timescale of seconds.},

	abstract = {Suspensions of motile active particles with space dependent activity form characteristic polarization and density patterns. Recent single-particle studies for planar activity landscapes identified several quantities associated with emergent density-polarization patterns, including swim pressure, that are solely determined by bulk variables and thus constitute state functions. We show that for radially symmetric activity steps these variables depend on the curvature of the active-passive interface. In the specific case of total polarization and swim pressure, we generalize this result for arbitrary radially symmetric activity landscapes. Our exact as well as approximate analytical results agree with exact numerical calculations. We expect qualitatively the same results to hold for arbitrarily curved activity landscapes.},

	abstract = {Active-particle suspensions exhibit distinct polarization-density patterns in activity landscapes, even without anisotropic particle interactions. Such polarization without alignment forces is at work in motility-induced phase separation and betrays intrinsic microscopic activity to mesoscale observers. Using stable long-term confinement of a single thermophoretic microswimmer in a dedicated force-free particle trap, we examine the polarized interfacial layer at a motility step and confirm that it does not exert pressure onto the bulk. Our observations are quantitatively explained by an analytical theory that can also guide the analysis of more complex geometries and many-body effects.},

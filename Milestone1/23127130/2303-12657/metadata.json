    "abstract": "We describe the \\proglang{R} package \\pkg{glmmrBase} and an extension \\pkg{glmmrOptim}. \\pkg{glmmrBase} provides a flexible approach to specifying, fitting, and analysing generalised linear mixed models. We use an object-orientated class system within \\proglang{R} to provide methods for a wide range of covariance and mean functions, including specification of non-linear functions of data and parameters, relevant to multiple applications including cluster randomised trials, cohort studies, spatial and spatio-temporal modelling, and split-plot designs. The class generates relevant matrices and statistics and a wide range of methods including full likelihood estimation of generalised linear mixed models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood, Laplace approximation, power calculation, and access to relevant calculations. The class also includes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation of random effects, sparse matrix methods, and other functionality to support efficient estimation. The \\pkg{glmmrOptim} package implements a set of algorithms to identify c-optimal experimental designs where observations are correlated and can be specified using the generalised linear mixed model classes. Several examples and comparisons to existing packages are provided to illustrate use of the packages.",

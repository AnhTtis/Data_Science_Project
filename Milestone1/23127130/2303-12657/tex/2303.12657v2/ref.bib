@article{Nelder1965,
abstract = {Nearly all the experimental designs so far proposed assume that the experimental units are or can be grouped together in blocks in ways that can be described in terms of nested and cross-classifications. When every nesting classification employed has equal numbers of subunits nested in each unit, then the experimental units are said to have a simple block structure . Every simple block structure has a complete randomization theory. Any permutation of the labelling of the units is permissible which preserves the block structure, and this defines a valid randomization procedure. In a null experiment all units receive the same treatment, and the population of all possible vectors of yields generated by the randomization procedure gives the null randomization distribution. The covariance matrix of this distribution, the null analysis of variance, and the expectations of the various mean squares in it are all derivable from the initial description of the block structure. All simple block structures can be characterized by a set of mutually orthogonal idempotent matrices C i . Such sets of matrices may also exist for non-simple block structures (e. g. those having unequal numbers of plots in a block), and the existence of such a set defines an orthogonal block structure. Non-simple orthogonal block structures do not have a complete randomization theory and inferences from them require further assumptions.},

@article{Li2021,
abstract = {The stepped wedge cluster randomized design has received increasing attention in pragmatic clinical trials and implementation science research. The key feature of the design is the unidirectional crossover of clusters from the control to intervention conditions on a staggered schedule, which induces confounding of the intervention effect by time. The stepped wedge design first appeared in the Gambia hepatitis study in the 1980s. However, the statistical model used for the design and analysis was not formally introduced until 2007 in an article by Hussey and Hughes. Since then, a variety of mixed-effects model extensions have been proposed for the design and analysis of these trials. In this article, we explore these extensions under a unified perspective. We provide a general model representation and regard various model extensions as alternative ways to characterize the secular trend, intervention effect, as well as sources of heterogeneity. We review the key model ingredients and clarify their implications for the design and analysis. The article serves as an entry point to the evolving statistical literatures on stepped wedge designs.},

abstract = {We review the use of combinatorial optimisation algorithms to identify approximate c-optimal experimental designs when the assumed data generating process is a generalised linear mixed model and there is correlation both between and within experimental conditions. We show how the optimisation problem can be posed as a supermodular function minimisation problem for which algorithms have theoretical guarantees on their solutions. We compare the performance of four variants of these algorithms for a set of example design problems and also against multiplicative methods in the case where experimental conditions are uncorrelated. We show that a local search starting from either a random design or the output of a greedy algorithm provides good performance with the worst outputs having variance {\$}{\textless}10\backslash{\%}{\$} larger than the best output, and frequently better than {\$}{\textless}1\backslash{\%}{\$}. We extend the algorithms to robust optimality and Bayesian c-optimality problems.},

@article{Diggle1998,
   abstract = {Conventional geostatistical methodology solves the problem of predicting the realized value of a linear functional of a Gaussian spatial stochastic process S(x) based on observations Yi = S(xi) + Zi at sampling locations xi, where the Zi are mutually independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables. We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(xi) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of S(x), making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

@article{Watson2023,
abstract = {There are multiple cluster randomised trial designs that vary in when the clusters cross between control and intervention states, when observations are made within clusters, and how many observations are made at that time point. Identifying the most efficient study design is complex though, owing to the correlation between observations within clusters and over time. In this article, we present a review of statistical and computational methods for identifying optimal cluster randomised trial designs. We also adapt methods from the experimental design literature for experimental designs with correlated observations to the cluster trial context. We identify three broad classes of methods: using exact formulae for the treatment effect estimator variance for specific models to derive algorithms or weights for cluster sequences; generalised methods for estimating weights for experimental units; and, combinatorial optimisation algorithms to select an optimal subset of experimental units. We also discuss methods for rounding weights to whole numbers of clusters and extensions to non-Gaussian models. We present results from multiple cluster trial examples that compare the different methods, including problems involving determining optimal allocation of clusters across a set of cluster sequences, and selecting the optimal number of single observations to make in each cluster-period for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models, and including exchangeable and exponential decay covariance structures.},

@article{Watson2021b,
abstract = {In this article, we describe and compare methods to derive $\backslash$textit{\{}p{\}}-values and sets of confidence intervals with strong control of the family-wise error rates and coverage for estimates of treatment effects in cluster randomised trials with multiple outcomes. While the need for corrections for multiple testing is debated, the justification for doing so is that, without correction, the probability of rejecting at least one of a set of null hypotheses is greater than the nominal rate of any single test, and hence the coverage of a confidence set is lower than the nominal rate of any single interval. There are few methods $\backslash$textit{\{}p{\}}-value corrections in this context and none for deriving confidence intervals, limiting their application in this setting. We discuss the methods of Bonferroni, Holm, and Romano $\backslash${\&} Wolf (2005) and their adaptation to cluster randomised trials using permutational inference using efficient quasi-score test statistics and weighted generalised residuals. We develop a search procedure for confidence interval limits using permutation tests to produce a set of confidence intervals under each method of correction. We conduct a simulation-based study to compare family-wise error rates, coverage of confidence sets, and the efficiency of each procedure in comparison to no correction using both model-based standard errors and permutation tests. We show that the Romano-Wolf type procedure has nominal error rates and coverage under non-independent correlation structures and is more efficient than the other methods in a simulation-based study. We also compare results from the analysis of a real-world trial.},

@article{Hemming2020,
abstract = {It has long been recognized that sample size calculations for cluster randomized trials require consideration of the correlation between multiple observations within the same cluster. When measurements are taken at anything other than a single point in time, these correlations depend not only on the cluster but also on the time separation between measurements and additionally, on whether different participants (cross-sectional designs) or the same participants (cohort designs) are repeatedly measured. This is particularly relevant in trials with multiple periods of measurement, such as the cluster cross-over and stepped-wedge designs, but also to some degree in parallel designs. Several papers describing sample size methodology for these designs have been published, but this methodology might not be accessible to all researchers. In this article we provide a tutorial on sample size calculation for cluster randomized designs with particular emphasis on designs with multiple periods of measurement and provide a web-based tool, the Shiny CRT Calculator, to allow researchers to easily conduct these sample size calculations. We consider both cross-sectional and cohort designs and allow for a variety of assumed within-cluster correlation structures. We consider cluster heterogeneity in treatment effects (for designs where treatment is crossed with cluster), as well as individually randomized group-treatment trials with differential clustering between arms, for example designs where clustering arises from interventions being delivered in groups. The calculator will compute power or precision, as a function of cluster size or number of clusters, for a wide variety of designs and correlation structures. We illustrate the methodology and the flexibility of the Shiny CRT Calculator using a range of examples.},

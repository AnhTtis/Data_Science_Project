\section{Conclusion and outlook}
\label{outlook}

A dual-phase xenon TPC is being prepared for installation in Xenoscope, where the proportional scintillation light will be collected by an array of SiPMs in the gas phase. This work reports on the design and first results of the characterisation of the VUV4 MPPCs from Hamamatsu chosen as photosensors, their summed readout, and the developed toy-MC based signal simulation framework to inform future design choices and physics reach.

The measured gain dependence on the bias voltage is similar to the previous generation of VUV sensitive photosensors from Hamamatsu and comparable to other available photosensors. The SPE resolution was measured to be $\sim5\%$ for a gain of $3\times10^6$ in a fully loaded tile. The DCR and CTP measured are on par and improve upon the previous generation of VUV-sensitive photosensors from Hamamatsu, respectively. A shoulder-like structure was observed on the peaks of the charge spectrum, populated by events with similar shape and duration as SPE or 2 PE signals but with higher integrated charge. The results of the characterisation of the full set of 48 MPPCs and fully loaded array are in preparation and will be reported in a future publication.

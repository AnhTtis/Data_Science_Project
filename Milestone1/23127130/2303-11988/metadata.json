    "abstract": "In our previous work [R. Fantoni, Int. J. Mod. Phys. C, {\\bf 29}, 1850064 (2018)] we studied, through a computer experiment, a one-component fermion plasma on a sphere at finite, non-zero, temperature. We extracted thermodynamic properties like the kinetic and internal energy per particle and structural properties like the radial distribution function, and produced some snapshots of the paths to study their shapes. Here we revisit such a study giving some more theoretical details explaining the paths shape anisotropic conformation due to the inhomogeneity in the polar angle of the variance of the random walk diffusion from the kinetic action.",

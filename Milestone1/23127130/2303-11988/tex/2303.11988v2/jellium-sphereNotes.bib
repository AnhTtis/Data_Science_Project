@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="For a space of constant curvature there is clearly no effect, as the term due to the curvature just leads to a constant multiplicative factor that has no influence on the measure of the various observables. One might have hoped that certain constrained coordinates, perhaps a relative coordinate in a molecule, would effectively live in a space of variable curvature. Perhaps gravitation will give us the system on which the effect of curvature can be seen, but at present the effect is purely in the realm of theory."}

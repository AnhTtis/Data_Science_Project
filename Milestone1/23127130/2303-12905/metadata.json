    "abstract": "We study the structure of a graded $3$-Lie-Rinehart algebra $\\mathcal{L}$ over an associative and commutative graded algebra $A.$ For $G$ an abelian group, we show that if $(L, A)$ is a tight $G$-graded 3-Lie-Rinehart algebra, then $\\mathcal{L}$ and $A$ decompose as $\\mathcal{L} =\\bigoplus_{i\\in I}\\mathcal{L}_i$ and $A =\\bigoplus_{j\\in J}A_j,$ where any $\\mathcal{L}_i$ is a non-zero graded ideal of $\\mathcal{L}$ satisfying $[\\mathcal{L}_{i_1}, \\mathcal{L}_{i_2}, \\mathcal{L}_{i_3}]=0$ for any $i_1, i_2, i_3\\in I$ different from each other, and any $A_j$ is a non-zero graded ideal of $A$ satisfying $A_j A_l=0$ for any $l, j\\in J$ such that $j\\neq l,$ and both decompositions satisfy that for any $i\\in I$ there exists a unique $j\\in J$ such that $A_j \\mathcal{L}_i\\neq 0.$ Furthermore, any $(\\mathcal{L}_i, A_j)$ is a graded 3-Lie-Rinehart algebra. Also, under certain conditions, it is shown that the above decompositions of $\\mathcal{L}$ and $A$ are by means of the family of their, respective, graded simple ideals.",

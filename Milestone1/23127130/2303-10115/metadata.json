    "abstract": "Supermassive stars are Population III stars with masses exceeding $10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$ that could be the progenitors of the first supermassive black holes. Their interiors are in a regime where radiation pressure dominates the equation of state. In this work, we use the explicit gas dynamics code PPMstar to simulate the hydrogen-burning core of a $10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$ supermassive main-sequence star. These are the first 3D hydrodynamics simulations of core convection in supermassive stars. We perform a series of ten simulations at different heating rates and on Cartesian grids with resolutions of $768^3$, $1152^3$ and $1728^3$. We examine different properties of the convective flow, including its large-scale morphology, its velocity spectrum and its mixing properties. We conclude that the radiation pressure-dominated nature of the interior does not noticeably affect the behaviour of convection compared to the case of core convection in a massive main-sequence star where gas pressure dominates. Our simulations also offer support for the use of mixing-length theory in 1D models of supermassive stars.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we provide a top-down review of Intel \ac{TDX}, covering its security principles, threat model, underpinning technologies, system architecture, and future features. We then dive deeper into the design of the \ac{TDX} Module, memory protection mechanisms, and remote attestation. Additionally, we compare \ac{TDX} with similar technologies from other vendors. The review is based on publicly available documentation and source code. As confidential computing is a fast-evolving field, we highlight ongoing challenges and efforts, including the need to support live migration, secure I/O, and extension of trust to peripheral devices and hardware accelerators. We will continue to conduct in-depth security analysis as the technology progresses.

    "abstract": "In this paper we study non-selfadjoint operators using the methods of the spectral theory. The main challenge is to represent a complete description of an operator belonging to the Schatten-von Neumann class having used the order of the Hermitian real component. The latter fundamental result is advantageous since many theoretical statements based upon it and one of them is a concept on the root series expansion to say nothing on a wide spectrum of applications in the theory of evolution equations. In this regard the evolution equations of fractional order with the operator function in the term not containing the time variable are involved. Constructing the operator class satisfying the asymptotic more subtle than one of the power type, we show convexly the relevance of the obtained fundamental results.",

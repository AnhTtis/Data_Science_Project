    "abstract": "We propose a new three-dimensional formulation based on the mixed Tangential-Displacement Normal-Normal-Stress (TDNNS) method for elasticity. In elastic TDNNS elements, the tangential component of the displacement field and the normal component of the stress vector are degrees of freedom and continuous across inter-element interfaces. TDNNS finite elements have been shown to be locking-free with respect to shear locking in thin elements, which makes them suitable for the discretization of laminates or macro-fibre composites. In the current paper, we extend the formulation to piezoelectric materials by adding the electric potential as degree of freedom.",

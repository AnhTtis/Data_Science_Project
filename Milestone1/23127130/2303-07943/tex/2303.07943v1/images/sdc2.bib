We show that a framework of automatic feature selection can construct a simple model with a small set of features that yields better performance over previous results. Secondly, because of the small sample size of the training/test sets of certain classes in gamma-ray, nested re-sampling and cross-validations are suggested for quantifying the statistical fluctuations of the quoted accuracy. We have also constructed a test set by cross-matching the identified active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the pulsars (PSRs) in the Fermi-LAT 8-yr point source catalogue (4FGL) with those unidentified sources in the previous 3rd Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (3FGL). Using this cross-matched set, we show that some features used for building classification model with the identified source can suffer from the problem of covariate shift, which can be a result of various observational effects. This can possibly hamper the actual performance when one applies such model in classifying unidentified sources. Using our framework, both AGN/PSR and young pulsar (YNG)/millisecond pulsar (MSP) classifiers are automatically updated with the new features and the enlarged training samples in 4FGL catalogue incorporated. Using a two-layer model with these updated classifiers, we have selected 20 promising MSP candidates with confidence scores \\$\\gt 98\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ from the unidentified sources in 4FGL catalogue that can provide inputs for a multiwavelength identification campaign.}",

In this paper, we present a novel meta-classification framework that combines and fully exploits different techniques to produce a more robust star‚Äìgalaxy classification. To demonstrate this hybrid, ensemble approach, we combine a purely morphological classifier, a supervised machine learning method based on random forest, an unsupervised machine learning method based on self-organizing maps, and a hierarchical Bayesian template-fitting method. Using data from the CFHTLenS survey (Canada‚ÄìFrance‚ÄìHawaii Telescope Lensing Survey), we consider different scenarios: when a high-quality training set is available with spectroscopic labels from DEEP2 (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe Phase 2 ), SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), VIPERS (VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey), and VVDS (VIMOS VLT Deep Survey), and when the demographics of sources in a low-quality training set do not match the demographics of objects in the test data set. We demonstrate that our Bayesian combination technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method in these scenarios. Thus, strategies that combine the predictions of different classifiers may prove to be optimal in currently ongoing and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.}",

abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.}

This paper describes in detail the completeness and reliability of HICAT, which are calculated from the recovery rate of synthetic sources and follow-up observations, respectively. HICAT is found to be 99 per cent complete at a peak flux of 84 mJy and an integrated flux of 9.4 Jy km s ‚àí1. The overall reliability is 95 per cent, but rises to 99 per cent for sources with peak fluxes \\&gt;58 mJy or integrated flux \\&gt;8.2 Jy km s ‚àí1. Expressions are derived for the uncertainties on the most important HICAT parameters: peak flux, integrated flux, velocity width and recessional velocity. The errors on HICAT parameters are dominated by the noise in the HIPASS data, rather than by the parametrization procedure.}",

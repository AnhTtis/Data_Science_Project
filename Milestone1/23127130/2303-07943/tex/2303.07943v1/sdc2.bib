abstract = {Future deep HI surveys will be essential for understanding the nature of galaxies and the content of the Universe. However, the large volume of these data will require distributed and automated processing techniques. We introduce LiSA, a set of python modules for the denoising, detection and characterization of HI sources in 3D spectral data. LiSA was developed and tested on the Square Kilometer Array Science Data Challenge 2 dataset, and contains modules and pipelines for easy domain decomposition and parallel execution. LiSA contains algorithms for 2D-1D wavelet denoising using the starlet transform and flexible source finding using null-hypothesis testing. These algorithms are lightweight and portable, needing only a few user-defined parameters reflecting the resolution of the data. LiSA also includes two convolutional neural networks developed to analyze data cubes which separate HI sources from artifacts and predict the HI source properties. All of these components are designed to be as modular as possible, allowing users to mix and match different components to create their ideal pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the different components of LiSA on the SDC2 dataset, which is able to find 95% of HI sources with SNR >3 and accurately predict their properties.}

This was done by stacking the H i 21 cm emission and the rest-frame 1.4 GHz radio continuum from 445 blue star-forming galaxies with MB ≤ −17 at zmean ≈ 0.34. The stacked H i 21 cm emission signal is detected at ≈7σ significance, implying an average H i mass of . We also stacked the rest-frame 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission of the same galaxies to obtain a median SFR of (0.54 ± 0.06) M⊙ yr−1; this implies an atomic gas depletion timescale of ΔtH i = (≈9) Gyr, consistent with values in star-forming galaxies in the local universe. This indicates that the star formation efficiency does not change significantly over the redshift range 0–0.4. We used the detection of the stacked H i 21 cm emission signal to infer the normalized cosmic H i mass density (ρH i/ρc,0) in star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 0.34. Assuming the local relation between H i mass and absolute B-magnitude, we obtain ρH i/ρc,0 = (4.81 ± 0.75) × 10−4, implying no significant evolution in ρH i/ρc,0 from z ≈ 0.4 to the present epoch.}

The question of whether these trained algorithms have cross-survey identification ability or can be adapted to develop classification networks for future surveys is still unclear. One possible solution to address this issue is transfer learning, which reuses elements of existing machine learning models for different applications. Here we present radio galaxy classification based on a 13-layer Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) using transfer learning methods between different radio surveys. We find that our machine learning models trained from a random initialization achieve accuracies comparable to those found elsewhere in the literature. When using transfer learning methods, we find that inheriting model weights pre-trained on FIRST images can boost model performance when retraining on lower resolution NVSS data, but that inheriting pre-trained model weights from NVSS and retraining on FIRST data impairs the performance of the classifier. We consider the implication of these results in the context of future radio surveys planned for next-generation radio telescopes such as ASKAP, MeerKAT, and SKA1-MID.}",

abstract = {Scene understanding of high resolution aerial images is of great importance for the task of automated monitoring in various remote sensing applications. Due to the large within-class and small between-class variance in pixel values of objects of interest, this remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have started being used in remote sensing applications and demonstrate state of the art performance for pixel level classification of objects. Here we propose a reliable framework for performant results for the task of semantic segmentation of monotemporal very high resolution aerial images. Our framework consists of a novel deep learning architecture, ResUNet-a, and a novel loss function based on the Dice loss. ResUNet-a uses a UNet encoder/decoder backbone, in combination with residual connections, atrous convolutions, pyramid scene parsing pooling and multi-tasking inference. ResUNet-a infers sequentially the boundary of the objects, the distance transform of the segmentation mask, the segmentation mask and a colored reconstruction of the input. Each of the tasks is conditioned on the inference of the previous ones, thus establishing a conditioned relationship between the various tasks, as this is described through the architecture’s computation graph. We analyse the performance of several flavours of the Generalized Dice loss for semantic segmentation, and we introduce a novel variant loss function for semantic segmentation of objects that has excellent convergence properties and behaves well even under the presence of highly imbalanced classes. The performance of our modeling framework is evaluated on the ISPRS 2D Potsdam dataset. Results show state-of-the-art performance with an average F1 score of 92.9% over all classes for our best model.}

We show that a framework of automatic feature selection can construct a simple model with a small set of features that yields better performance over previous results. Secondly, because of the small sample size of the training/test sets of certain classes in gamma-ray, nested re-sampling and cross-validations are suggested for quantifying the statistical fluctuations of the quoted accuracy. We have also constructed a test set by cross-matching the identified active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the pulsars (PSRs) in the Fermi-LAT 8-yr point source catalogue (4FGL) with those unidentified sources in the previous 3rd Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (3FGL). Using this cross-matched set, we show that some features used for building classification model with the identified source can suffer from the problem of covariate shift, which can be a result of various observational effects. This can possibly hamper the actual performance when one applies such model in classifying unidentified sources. Using our framework, both AGN/PSR and young pulsar (YNG)/millisecond pulsar (MSP) classifiers are automatically updated with the new features and the enlarged training samples in 4FGL catalogue incorporated. Using a two-layer model with these updated classifiers, we have selected 20 promising MSP candidates with confidence scores \\$\\gt 98\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ from the unidentified sources in 4FGL catalogue that can provide inputs for a multiwavelength identification campaign.}",

In this paper, we present a novel meta-classification framework that combines and fully exploits different techniques to produce a more robust star‚Äìgalaxy classification. To demonstrate this hybrid, ensemble approach, we combine a purely morphological classifier, a supervised machine learning method based on random forest, an unsupervised machine learning method based on self-organizing maps, and a hierarchical Bayesian template-fitting method. Using data from the CFHTLenS survey (Canada‚ÄìFrance‚ÄìHawaii Telescope Lensing Survey), we consider different scenarios: when a high-quality training set is available with spectroscopic labels from DEEP2 (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe Phase 2 ), SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), VIPERS (VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey), and VVDS (VIMOS VLT Deep Survey), and when the demographics of sources in a low-quality training set do not match the demographics of objects in the test data set. We demonstrate that our Bayesian combination technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method in these scenarios. Thus, strategies that combine the predictions of different classifiers may prove to be optimal in currently ongoing and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.}",

abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.}

    abstract = "{The H i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) is a blind extragalactic H i 21-cm emission-line survey covering the whole southern sky from declination ‚àí90¬∞ to +25¬∞. The HIPASS catalogue (HICAT), containing 4315 H i-selected galaxies from the region south of declination +2¬∞, is presented in Meyer et al. (Paper I). This paper describes in detail the completeness and reliability of HICAT, which are calculated from the recovery rate of synthetic sources and follow-up observations, respectively. HICAT is found to be 99 per cent complete at a peak flux of 84 mJy and an integrated flux of 9.4 Jy km s ‚àí1. The overall reliability is 95 per cent, but rises to 99 per cent for sources with peak fluxes \\&gt;58 mJy or integrated flux \\&gt;8.2 Jy km s ‚àí1. Expressions are derived for the uncertainties on the most important HICAT parameters: peak flux, integrated flux, velocity width and recessional velocity. The errors on HICAT parameters are dominated by the noise in the HIPASS data, rather than by the parametrization procedure.}",

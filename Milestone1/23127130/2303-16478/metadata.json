    "abstract": "Let $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ act on a finite CW-complex $X$ having mod 2 cohomology isomorphic to the product of projective space and sphere $\\mathbb{F}P^n\\times \\mathbb{S}^m,$ where $\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}.$ In this paper, we have determined the connected fixed point sets and the orbit spaces of free involutions on $X.$ As an application, we derive the Borsuk-Ulam type results.",

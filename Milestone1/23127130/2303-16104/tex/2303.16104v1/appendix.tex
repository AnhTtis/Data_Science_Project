\section{Dataset Statistics}
\label{app:datasets}

\paragraph{\textsc{Flores}.}  The \textsc{Flores} benchmark~\citep{goyal-etal-2022-flores} consists of a multi-parallel dataset in 101 languages with sentences extracted from Wikipedia. The sentences in the dataset are translated from original English sentences. We join the \texttt{dev} and \texttt{devtest} splits for a total of 2009 parallel sentences for each translation direction.

\paragraph{TICO.} The TICO benchmark~\citep{anastasopoulos-etal-2020-tico} is a multilingual dataset specialized in the medical domain obtained by combining English open-source data from various sources, such as scientific articles, government health announcements, and others. We join the \texttt{dev} and \texttt{test} set for a total of 2100 parallel sentences for each translation direction.

\paragraph{WMT benchmarks.} We selected the same English-centric WMT benchmarks that were used as evaluation sets in the original M2M paper~\citep{fanetal2020_m2m}. Additionally, we selected recent WMT test sets from the WMT21 and WMT22 campaigns as they were released after the models were trained. A summary of the datasets used for each translation direction can be found in Table~\ref{app:wmtbenchmarks_ref}.

\section{Hallucinations under Perturbation}
\subsection{Data.}
\label{app:data_for_halls_under_perturbation}

\paragraph{Perturbations.} We randomly misspell words by changing the characters with a probability of 0.01;\footnote{We use the \texttt{ButterFingersPerturbation} from the NL-Augmenter framework~\citep{dhole2022nlaugmenter}.} insert a token chosen randomly from the 50 most frequent tokens or punctuation in the test set; and, randomly title-case words with a probability of 0.1, guaranteeing that at least one word's capitalization is perturbed.

\paragraph{Languages.} We pair the following languages with English: \texttt{af}, \texttt{ar}, \texttt{ast}, \texttt{bn}, \texttt{cs}, \texttt{cy}, \texttt{de}, \texttt{el}, \texttt{es}, \texttt{fa}, \texttt{fi}, \texttt{fr}, \texttt{he}, \texttt{hi}, \texttt{hr}, \texttt{hu}, \texttt{id}, \texttt{ja}, \texttt{ko}, \texttt{lt}, \texttt{nl}, \texttt{oc}, \texttt{pl}, \texttt{pt}, \texttt{ru}, \texttt{sv}, \texttt{sw}, \texttt{tl}, \texttt{tr}, \texttt{vi}, \texttt{zh}. We selected all bridge languages~(see Table~\ref{tab:app:full_list_of_languages}) and additional low-resource languages, as they are underrepresented among the bridge languages. Although Tamil is a bridge language, we did not include it in our analysis, as we could not find enough candidates with reasonable quality for hallucinations under perturbation after applying rule (i) of the detection approach~(see Section~\ref{subsec:halls_under_perturb_eval_setting}). 

\subsection{Supplementary Results}
\label{app:supp_results_for_hall_under_perturbation}
\paragraph{Correlation between original translation quality and hallucination under perturbation.} We present the statistics in Table~\ref{app:halls_under_perturb_correlation}. As mentioned in the main text, the Pearson correlation between the original translation quality and the detection outputs of hallucinations under perturbation is very weak across all models.

\label{app:halls_under_perturb_correlation}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Discussion on hallucinations under perturbation and natural hallucinations.} As we have mentioned in the main text, hallucinations under perturbation, in contrast to natural hallucinations, explicitly reveal the lack of robustness of translation systems. Put simply, hallucinations under perturbation are cases where the model is not robust and, as a result, undergoes significant negative shifts in translation quality \textit{due to perturbations}. This means that they do not necessarily entail detachment from the source. Hallucinations under perturbation have been studied as such in previous work, and detection of these translations with the 2-step method that we adopted in our work~(see Section~\ref{subsec:halls_under_perturb_eval_setting}) has been consistently used in all of previous research. We decided to keep the same designations, definitions and detection approach so as to be consistent with previous work. Nevertheless, we assess here whether the detected hallucinations under perturbation are, in fact, detached or oscillatory hallucinations. We found that more than 85\% of hallucinations under perturbation would be detected with our detection approach for natural hallucinations. Inspection of the non-detected translations revealed that they usually contain critical mistranslation errors, but do not necessarily exhibit detachment from the source content (e.g., off-target translations or copies of the source).

\paragraph{Examples of hallucinations under perturbation generated by \texttt{ChatGPT}.} We provide examples of hallucinations under perturbation in Figure~\ref{fig:app:chatgpt_halls}.

\section{Natural Hallucinations}
Hereinafter, we will use the terms natural hallucinations and hallucinations interchangeably.
\subsection{Translation directions.}

\paragraph{English-Centric setup.} We pair the following languages with English: \texttt{ar}, \texttt{ast}, \texttt{az}, \texttt{bn}, \texttt{cs}, \texttt{cy}, \texttt{de}, \texttt{el}, \texttt{es}, \texttt{fa}, \texttt{fi}, \texttt{fr}, \texttt{he}, \texttt{hi}, \texttt{hr}, \texttt{hu}, \texttt{id}, \texttt{ja}, \texttt{ko}, \texttt{lt}, \texttt{nl}, \texttt{oc}, \texttt{pl}, \texttt{ps}, \texttt{pt}, \texttt{ru}, \texttt{sv}, \texttt{sw}, \texttt{ta}, \texttt{tr}, \texttt{vi}, \texttt{zh}. Similarly to the choice for the experiments on hallucinations under perturbation, we selected all the bridge languages and additional low-resource languages.

\paragraph{Non-English-Centric setup.} We analyzed the following translation directions: \texttt{hi-bn}, \texttt{it-fr}, \texttt{de-hu}, \texttt{it-de}, \texttt{cs-sk}, \texttt{nl-fr}, \texttt{fr-sw}, \texttt{ro-ru}, \texttt{ro-uk}, \texttt{de-hr}, \texttt{hr-sr}, \texttt{be-ru}, \texttt{hr-hu}, \texttt{hr-cs}, \texttt{el-tr}, \texttt{hr-sk}, \texttt{nl-de}, \texttt{af-zu}, \texttt{ro-hu}, \texttt{hi-mr}, \texttt{ro-tr}, \texttt{uk-ru}, \texttt{ro-hy}, \texttt{ar-fr}, \texttt{ro-de}. We selected language pairs that were used in the analysis from the original M2M paper on real-world settings for many-to-many translation~\citep{fanetal2020_m2m}. They represent translation directions that are commonly used in countries that have official and regional languages that do not include English.

\paragraph{Specialized Domains setup.} We pair the following languages with English: \texttt{ar}, \texttt{fr}, \texttt{hi}, \texttt{id}, \texttt{ps}, \texttt{pt}, \texttt{ru}, \texttt{sw}, \texttt{zh}. We selected languages from the TICO benchmark that are supported by the M2M models.

\label{app:subsec_translation_directions}

\subsection{English-Centric Translation}
\label{app:subsec:engcentric}
\subsubsection{Evaluation with \textsc{Flores}}
\paragraph{Evaluation scores.} We present spBLEU and COMET-22 corpus-level scores for the \textsc{Flores} setup in Table~\ref{app:tab:quality_flores_setup_engcentric}.

\paragraph{ALTI+ scores.} We present the distribution of ALTI+ scores for all translation directions in Figure~\ref{fig:alti_flores_engcentric}. For the M2M models, we find the same trends presented in~\citet{ferrando-etal-2022-towards}: smaller source contributions when translating out of English and for low-resource language pairs. Remarkably, it is also clear from the distributions that ALTI+ scores for \texttt{SMaLL100} are not only significantly higher than those of the M2M models, but they are also more consistent across different resource levels.

\paragraph{Correlation between COMET-22 scores and hallucination rates.} We present the statistics in Table~\ref{app:tab:correlations_comet22_halls_rates}. As we have remarked in the main text, \texttt{SMaLL100}'s reduced hallucination rates for low-resource language pairs do not necessarily equate to superior translation quality compared to the other M2M models. We observed a strong correlation between M2M models' corpus-level COMET-22 scores and their respective hallucination rates for low-resource languages, whereas, contrastingly, for \texttt{SMaLL100} the correlation is weak. This indicates that despite detaching less from the source content, \texttt{SMaLL100}'s translations are not necessarily of higher quality to those of other M2M models. Interestingly, the correlations for the M2M models are significantly weakened on high-resource language pairs, mirroring observations from previous work~\citep{Lee2018HallucinationsIN}.

\section{Fallback System Analysis}
\label{app:fallbacksystemanalysis}

\end{sidewaysfigure}

\paragraph{Non-English-Centric directions.} We present the results on employing external models as fallback systems in Figure~\ref{fig:flores_nonengcentric_reversal_quality_osc}, and COMET-22 scores on the original model hallucinated translations for each translation direction in the non-English-centric setup in Figure~\ref{fig:fallback_nonengcentric_lpspecific_comet22}. Importantly, the trends analyzed in-depth in the main text largely hold in this setup as well. In contrast with the analysis for the English-centric setup, \texttt{ChatGPT} struggles to outperform all other models in Non-English-Centric directions, especially in low and mid-resource levels. This is expected: as \texttt{ChatGPT} was trained on a non-parallel heavily English-centric corpus, it is likely that it struggles more with translation directions that do not include English.

    "abstract": "The determination of distance is fundamental in astrophysics. Gamma-ray\nsources are poorly characterized in this sense, as the limited angular\nresolution and poor photon-count statistics in gamma-ray astronomy makes it\ndifficult to associate them to a multiwavelength object with known redshift.\nTaking the 1794 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with known redshift from the\nFermi-LAT latest AGN catalog, 4LAC-DR3, we employ machine learning techniques\nto predict the distance of the rest of AGNs based on their spectral and spatial\nproperties. The state-of-the-art CatBoost algorithm reaches an average 0.56 R2\nscore with 0.46 root-mean-squared error (RMSE), predicting an average redshift\nvalue of $z_{avg}=0.63$, with a maximum $z_{max}=1.97$. We use the SHAP\nexplainer package to gain insights into the variables influence on the outcome,\nand also study the extragalactic bakground light (EBL) implications. In a\nsecond part, we use this regression model to predict the redshift of the\nunassociated sample of the latest LAT point-source catalog, 4FGL-DR3, using the\nresults of a previous paper to determine the possible AGNs within them.",

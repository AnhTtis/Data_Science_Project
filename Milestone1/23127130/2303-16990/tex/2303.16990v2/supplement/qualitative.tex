% \section{More Qualitative Results}

% We include visualization using the tool provided by \cite{mettes2017spatial}  \footnote{https://github.com/psmmettes/spatial-aware-object-embeddings.} shown in Figure \ref{fig:visual}. We found that our result achieves the best performance by combining the ability to predict the action description label and the spatial localization correctly.

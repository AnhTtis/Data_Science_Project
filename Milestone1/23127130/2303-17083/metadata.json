    "abstract": "A continuous-time average consensus system is a linear dynamical system defined over a graph, where each node has its own state value that evolves according to a simultaneous linear differential equation. A node is allowed to interact with neighboring nodes. Average consensus is a phenomenon that the all the state values converge to the average of the initial state values. In this paper, we assume that a node can communicate with neighboring nodes through an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We first formulate the noisy average consensus system by using a stochastic differential equation (SDE), which allows us to use the Euler-Maruyama method, a numerical technique for solving SDEs. By studying the stochastic behavior of the residual error of the Euler-Maruyama method, we arrive at the covariance evolution equation. The analysis of the residual error leads to a compact formula for mean squared error (MSE), which shows that the sum of the inverse eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix is the most dominant factor influencing the MSE. Furthermore, we propose optimization problems aimed at minimizing the MSE at a given target time, and introduce a deep unfolding-based optimization method to solve these problems. The quality of the solution is validated by numerical experiments.",

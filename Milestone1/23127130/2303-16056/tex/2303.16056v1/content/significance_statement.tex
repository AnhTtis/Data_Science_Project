Neuromorphic systems draw inspiration from the biological brain to discover efficient computing algorithms and architectures.
\Acrlong{bss2} is a neuromorphic system that implements the dynamics of biological neuron models in analog circuits.
Replicating biological observations on the \acrlong{bss2} system requires finding a set of suitable model parameters.

Recent advances in machine learning led to a class of algorithms that employ neural networks to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters.
The main advantages of these algorithms are that they do not require access to gradients, allow access to the posterior distribution, and offer higher computational efficiency than comparable algorithms.

Our work shows for the first time that this class of algorithms can infer suitable parameters for complex neuron models on analog neuromorphic hardware.

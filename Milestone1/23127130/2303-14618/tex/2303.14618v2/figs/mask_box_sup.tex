\caption{The relationship between the number of box annotations and segmentation performance. The three makers represent the different number of training samples. $\bigstar$ indicate the isolated training on YTVIS21 or OVIS dataset respectively, $\blacktriangleright$ means the joint training on YTVIS21 and OVIS datasets, and $\blacklozenge$ is the joint training on our proposed JVIS dataset. }

\caption{(a) Architecture of our proposed BoxVIS, where the Teacher and Student Nets follow the Mask2Former-VIS \cite{cheng2021mask2former-video} framework. The Teacher Net produces high-quality object masks, which are assigned as the pseudo instance masks of the ground-truth bounding boxes by Hungarian matching. 
The predicted masks from the Student Net will be matched with the ground-truth boxes and the generated pseudo masks by taking the assigned pseudo masks into account.
%The Teacher Net is progressively updated via exponential moving average (EMA) without back-propagating gradients. 
(b) Schematic diagram of the proposed spatial-temporal pairwise affinity (STPA) loss, which uses box-center guided shifting to generate temporally paired pixels and employs the color similarity $S_{lab}$ and patch correlation $S_{corr}$ to compute pairwise affinity.} 
%The markers, $\checkmark$ and $\times$, represent above or below than the threshold respectively.}

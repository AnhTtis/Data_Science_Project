\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we systematically reviewed the current state of educational research on LLMs and identified several practical and ethical challenges that need to be addressed in order for LLMs-based innovations to become beneficial and impactful. Based on the findings, we proposed three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models, embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. These recommendations could potentially support future studies to develop practical and ethical innovations that can be implemented in authentic contexts to automate a wide range of educational tasks.

	abstract={Twisted Edwards curves over finite fields have attracted great interest for their efficient and unified addition formula. In this paper, we consider twisted Edwards curves over local fields and introduce a cryptosystem based on quotient groups of twisted Edwards curves over local fields. From the study of formal groups of twisted Edwards curves and twisted Edwards curves over local fields, we give the choice of cryptographic groups. An element in these groups can be uniformly represented by two n digit p-adic numbers, whereas an element in the elliptic curves in Weierstrass form over local fields is represented by a 3n − 2 digit p-adic number and a 4n−3 digit p-adic number. In the cryptography on elliptic curves in Weierstrass form over local fields, five cases for different input point pairs in computing points addition have to be considered and sometimes points have to be lifted. In the cryptography on twisted Edwards curves over local fields, the addition formula is simple, unified, and complete, which is efficient, does not need lifting points, and is against the side channel analysis. Finally, a speedy point multiplication algorithm and some concrete instances are given.},

We then show how our general technique leads to a new algorithm which is about twice as fast as the Duursma--Lee method. These ideas are applied to elliptic and hyperelliptic curves in characteristic 2 with very efficient results. In particular, the hyperelliptic case is faster than all previously known pairing algorithms.},

	abstract="The difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) underlies the attractiveness of elliptic curves for use in cryptography. The index calculus is a lifting algorithm that solves the classical finite field discrete logarithm problem in subexponential time, but no such algorithm is known in general for elliptic curves. It turns out that there are four distinct lifting scenarios that one can use in attempting to solve the ECDLP; the lifting field may be a local field or a global field, and the lifted points may be torsion points or nontorsion points. These choices lead to four quite different ways to try to solve the ECDLP via lifting. None of these approaches has led to a solution to the ECDLP, but each method has its own reasons for failing to work. In this article I survey the four ways of lifting the ECDLP, explain their similarities and their differences, and describe the distinct roadblocks that arise in each case.",

	This paper proposes new explicit formulas for the doubling and addition steps in Miller's algorithm to compute the Tate pairing on elliptic curves in Weierstrass and in Edwards form. For Edwards curves the formulas come from a new way of seeing the arithmetic. We state the first geometric interpretation of the group law on Edwards curves by presenting the functions which arise in addition and doubling. The Tate pairing on Edwards curves can be computed by using these functions in Miller's algorithm. Computing the sum of two points or the double of a point and the coefficients of the corresponding functions is faster with our formulas than with all previously proposed formulas for pairings on Edwards curves. They are even competitive with all published formulas for pairing computation on Weierstrass curves. We also improve the formulas for Tate pairing computation on Weierstrass curves in Jacobian coordinates. Finally, we present several examples of pairing-friendly Edwards curves.

Most notably, the best speeds are obtained from Jacobi quartic curves which provide the fastest timings for most scalar multiplication strategies benefiting from the proposed 2M + 5S + 1D point doubling and 7M + 3S + 1D point addition algorithms.

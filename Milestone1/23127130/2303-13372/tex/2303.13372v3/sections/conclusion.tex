\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we tried to find a solution for the `accuracy vs. robustness' double-edged sword in the malware field. We showed that certified defense is also possible in the executable malware domain, hoping that it will open up a new paradigm of research. Besides theory, we equally emphasized the empirical robustness of our proposed DRSM. 
Nevertheless, we must acknowledge the reality that no model can provide absolute defense, and as researchers, our intent was to raise the bar for potential attackers. 
We would like to conclude by highlighting some areas and future directions our work identifies. 
Firstly, there is room for improving the standard accuracy of DRSM by introducing an additional classification layer, albeit at the expense of challenging the fundamental non-differentiable nature of the smoothing scheme, which we chose not to explore in this study. 
Secondly, recent defenses from vision, besides de-randomized smoothing, hold promise for future exploration.
Malware detection is inherently an arms race and we hope our work can facilitate future research in developing more practical defenses with our defense and dataset.

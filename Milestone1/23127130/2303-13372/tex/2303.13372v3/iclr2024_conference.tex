\begin{abstract}
% What is the problem?
Machine Learning (ML) models have been utilized for malware detection for over two decades. Consequently, this ignited an ongoing arms race between malware authors and antivirus systems, compelling researchers to propose defenses for malware-detection models against evasion attacks. 
%
% Why is the problem a problem?
However, most if not all existing defenses against evasion attacks suffer from sizable performance degradation and/or can defend against only specific attacks, which makes them less practical in real-world settings.
%compromise the standard accuracy of the model to some extent that they become impractical in real-life setting. 
%Moreover, some defenses provide robustness against a few selective attacks.
%
% What is our secret sauce? 
In this work, we develop a certified defense, DRSM (De-Randomized Smoothed MalConv), by redesigning the \textit{de-randomized smoothing} technique for the domain of malware detection. 
%The benefit of our proposed \textit{window ablation smoothing} scheme is -- the impact of adversarial byte perturbation is mitigated while the malicious features of a malware file can still be learned. 
Specifically, we propose a \textit{window ablation} scheme to provably limit the impact of adversarial bytes while maximally preserving local structures of the executables.
%
% What did we do?
%We analyze how different window ablations in DRSM can impact its standard and certified accuracy, and compare it to the base classifier.
After showing how DRSM is theoretically robust against attacks with contiguous adversarial bytes, we verify its performance and certified robustness experimentally, where we observe only marginal accuracy drops as the cost of robustness.
%demonstrating its adaptability to various use-case scenarios.
To our knowledge, we are the first to offer certified robustness in the realm of static detection of malware executables. 
%Beyond our theoretical formulations, we extensively evaluate our DRSM models against $9$ different attacks in both white-box and black-box settings.
More surprisingly, through evaluating DRSM against $9$ empirical attacks of different types, we observe that the proposed defense is empirically robust to some extent against a diverse set of attacks, some of which even fall out of the scope of its original threat model.
%
% What are the implications?
%We deliberately include some practical attacks that fall outside of our threat model to showcase the applicability of our proposed method. We then discuss some insights gained from our results.
In addition, we collected $15.5K$ recent benign raw executables from diverse sources, which will be made public as a dataset called PACE (Publicly Accessible Collection(s) of Executables) to alleviate the scarcity of publicly available benign datasets for studying malware detection and provide future research with more representative data of the time.
%to allow future researchers to curate a diverse set of benign programs for experiments that are more representative of the real-world.
%Moreover, to solve the scarcity of publicly available benign datasets in the malware domain, we are releasing our diverse benign dataset containing $15.5K$ programs collected from different sources throughout this work. 
%To facilitate the reproducibility of our findings, we build our framework on top of \texttt{secml-malware} Python library and open-source the implementation.

\section{Submission of conference papers to ICLR 2024}

ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by
\url{https://openreview.net/}. See ICLR's website for more instructions.

If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement {\tt
  {\textbackslash}iclrfinalcopy} should be inserted to adjust the
format to the camera ready requirements.

The format for the submissions is a variant of the NeurIPS format.
Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them
faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to ICLR 2024 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here.

%% Please note that we have introduced automatic line number generation
%% into the style file for \LaTeXe. This is to help reviewers
%% refer to specific lines of the paper when they make their comments. Please do
%% NOT refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will be removed from the
%% style file for the final version of accepted papers.

Authors are required to use the ICLR \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
ICLR website. Please make sure you use the current files and
not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for ICLR and other conference information are available online at:
\begin{center}
   \url{http://www.iclr.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+iclr2024_conference.pdf+ contains these
instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your ICLR paper must satisfy.
Submissions must be made using \LaTeX{} and the style files
\verb+iclr2024_conference.sty+ and \verb+iclr2024_conference.bst+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file
\verb+iclr2024_conference.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your paper. All you
have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with
your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
with no indentation.

Paper title is 17~point, in small caps and left-aligned.
All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

Authors' names are
set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding
address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and
the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the
same address can be on the same line.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


There will be a strict upper limit of 9 pages for the main text of the initial submission, with unlimited additional pages for citations. 

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

First level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of
authors, in the \textsc{References} section. As to the format of the
references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
consistently.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.

You may use color figures.
However, it is best for the
figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
either in black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
%\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
\end{center}
\caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
(except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Sample table title}
\label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}
\\ \hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textsc{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}

Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.

Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
(especially if you are a MiKTeX user).
PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.

Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+
from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
or % Apr 2009 addition
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
for .pdf graphics.
See section~4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps})

A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.

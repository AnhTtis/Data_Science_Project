    "abstract": "In [arXiv:2207.03377] the first closed formula of a faithful entanglement measure applicable to realistic electron systems has been derived. In the present work, we build on this key achievement with the ultimate goal of guiding the development of quantum technologies. For this, we first elucidate the process of entanglement swapping in electron systems such as atoms, molecules or solid bodies. This clearly demonstrates the necessity of both the reference to localized few-orbital subsystems and the implementation of the number-parity superselection rule. Accordingly, in virtue of Wick's theorem, we then provide a fully analytical study of the true physical entanglement between sites in free electron chains. In that sense, we break the common paradigm of restricting such analytical analyses to unitarily invariant settings, i.e. bipartitions of the chain into rather impractical, macroscopically large subsystems. We then upgrade this model to a hydrogen ring of interacting electrons and construct the sought-after localized orbitals. For both systems, we confirm the presence of long-distance entanglement, provided the filling fractions are sufficiently low/high.",

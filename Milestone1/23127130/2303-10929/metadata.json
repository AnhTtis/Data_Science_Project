    "abstract": "We describe all possible topological structures of codimension one gradient vector fields on the shpere with at most ten singular points. To describe structures, we use a graph whose edges are one-dimensional stable manifolds. The saddle-node singularity is specified by selecting a pair of vertices-edge or edge-face, and the saddle connection is specified by a T-vertex.",

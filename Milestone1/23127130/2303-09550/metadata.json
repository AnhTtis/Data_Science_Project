    "abstract": "In this note, for each odd prime $p$, we show that the orders of the $KU$-local homotopy groups of the mod $p$ Moore spectrum are equal to denominators of special values of certain quotients of Dedekind zeta-functions of totally real number fields. With this observation in hand, we give a cute topological proof of the Leopoldt conjecture for those number fields, by showing that it is a consequence of periodicity properties of $KU$-local stable homotopy groups.",

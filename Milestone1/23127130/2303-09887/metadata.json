    "abstract": "A class of rate-adaptive protograph MacKay-Neal (MN) codes is introduced and analyzed. The code construction employs an outer distribution matcher (DM) to adapt the rate of the scheme. The DM is coupled with an inner protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, whose base matrix is optimized via density evolution analysis to approach the Shannon limit of the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (biAWGN) channel over a given range of code rates. The density evolution analysis is complemented by finite-length simulations, and by a study of the error floor performance.",

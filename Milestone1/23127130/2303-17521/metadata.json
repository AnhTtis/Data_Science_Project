    "abstract": "We consider an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random dynamical system of simple linear transformations on the unit interval $T_β(x)=βx$ (mod $1$), $x\\in[0,1]$, $β>0$, which are the so-called beta-transformations. For such a random dynamical system, including the case that it is generated by uncountably many maps, we give an explicit formula for the density function of a unique stationary measure under the assumption that the random dynamics is expanding in mean. As an application, in the case that the random dynamics is generated by finitely many maps and the maps are chosen according to a Bernoulli measure, we show that the density function is analytic as a function of parameter in the Bernoulli measure and give its derivative explicitly. Furthermore, for a non-i.i.d. random dynamical system of beta-transformations, we also give an explicit formula for the random densities of a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure under a certain strong expanding condition or under the assumption that the maps randomly chosen are close to the beta-transformation for a non-simple number in the sense of parameter $β$.",

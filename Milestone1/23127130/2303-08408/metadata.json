    "abstract": "We study a first passage time of a Lévy process over a positive constant level. In the spectrally negative case we give conditions for absolutely continuity of the distributions of the first passage times. The tail asymptotics of their densities are also clarified, where the asymptotics depend on tail behaviour of the corresponding Lévy measures. We apply our results to the mathematical finance, in particular, the credit default swap pricing.",

    "abstract": "Biometrics plays a significant role in vision-based surveillance applications. Soft biometrics such as gait is widely used with face in surveillance tasks like person recognition and re-identification. Nevertheless, in practical scenarios, classical fusion techniques respond poorly to changes in individual users and in the external environment. To this end, we propose a novel adaptive multi-biometric fusion strategy for the dynamic incorporation of gait and face biometric cues by leveraging keyless attention deep neural networks. Various external factors such as viewpoint and distance to the camera, are investigated in this study. Extensive experiments have shown superior performanceof the proposed model compared with the state-of-the-art model.",

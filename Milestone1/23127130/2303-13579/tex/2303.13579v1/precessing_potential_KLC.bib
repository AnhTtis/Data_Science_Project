title = {Shrinking Binary and Planetary Orbits by Kozai Cycles with Tidal Friction*},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within ~0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many "hot Jupiters" are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of ~2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to ~105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40° and 140°. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.}

title = {Was GW190412 Born from a Hierarchical 3 + 1 Quadruple Configuration?},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The gravitational wave source GW190412 is a binary black hole (BBH) merger with three unique properties: (i) its mass ratio is about 0.28, the lowest found so far, (ii) it has a relatively high positive effective spin parameter , and (iii) it is observed to be precessing due to in-plane projected spin of the binary with an in-plane precession parameter . The two main formation channels of BBH formation fail to account for GW190412: field formation scenarios cannot explain the observed precession unless by invoking large natal kicks, and dynamical assembly in dense stellar systems is inefficient in producing such low-mass-ratio BBH mergers. Here, we investigate whether “double mergers” in wide hierarchical quadruple systems in the “3 + 1” configuration could explain the unique properties of GW190412. In this scenario, a compact object quadruple system experiences two mergers: first, two compact objects in the innermost orbit merge due to secular chaotic evolution. At a later time, the merged compact object coalesces with another compact object due to secular Lidov–Kozai oscillations. We find that our scenario is consistent with GW190412. In particular, we find a preferential projected spin around . However, the likelihood of a double merger is small and the formation efficiency of these systems is uncertain. If GW190412 originated from a double merger in a 3 + 1 quadruple, we find a strong constraint that the first merger likely occurred between roughly equal-mass BHs in the innermost orbit, since the recoil velocity from unequal-mass BHs would otherwise have disrupted the system.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {We investigate secular evolution in hierarchical quadruple systems as a formation channel of mass-gap black holes (with masses of about 3–5M⊙) in systems that will eventually lead to binary black hole mergers detectable by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors (LIGO/Virgo). We show that in a 3 + 1 hierarchical system, two episodes of induced mergers would first cause two neutron stars to merge and form a mass-gap black hole, which will subsequently merge with another (more massive) black hole through a second induced merger. We demonstrate that such systems are stable to flybys, and their formation would predict a high mass ratio and eccentric merger of a mass-gap black hole with a more massive black hole companion. Such a formation channel may explain observed gravitational-wave events such as the recently discovered LIGO/Virgo events S190814bv and S190924h.}

  abstract = {{Hierarchical quadruple systems arise naturally in stellar binaries and triples that harbour planets. Examples are hot Jupiters (HJs) in stellar triple systems, and planetary companions to HJs in stellar binaries. The secular dynamical evolution of these systems is generally complex, with secular chaotic motion possible in certain parameter regimes. The latter can lead to extremely high eccentricities and, therefore, strong interactions such as efficient tidal evolution. These interactions are believed to play an important role in the formation of HJs through high-eccentricity migration. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the secular dynamics of these systems is still lacking. Here, we study in detail the secular dynamics of a special case of hierarchical quadruple systems in either the ‘2+2' or ‘3+1' configurations. We show how the equations of motion can be cast in a form representing a perturbed hierarchical three-body system, in which the outer orbital angular-momentum vector is precessing steadily around a fixed axis. In this case, we show that eccentricity excitation can be significantly enhanced when the precession period is comparable to the Lidov–Kozai oscillation time-scale of the inner orbit. This arises from an induced large mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits driven by the precession of the outer orbit, even if the initial mutual inclination is small. We present a simplified semi-analytic model that describes the latter phenomenon.}},

The host system’s overall architecture is a hierarchical quadruple in the ‘2 + 2’ configuration, owing to the presence of a tertiary companion system of two M-dwarfs. We show that a secular inclination resonance in 2 + 2 systems can significantly broaden the LK window for extreme eccentricity excitation (e ≳ 0.999), allowing the giant planet to migrate for a wide range of initial orbital inclinations. Octupole effects can also contribute to the broadening of this ‘extreme’ LK window. By requiring that perturbations from the companion stars be able to overcome short-range forces and excite the planet’s eccentricity to e ≃ 1, we obtain an absolute limit of \\$a\_\\{1\\} \\gtrsim 8 \\, \\mathrm\\{au\\}\\, (a\_\\{3\\} / 1500 \\, \\mathrm\\{au\\})^\\{6/7\\}\\$ for the planet’s semimajor axis just before migration (where a3 is the semimajor axis of the ‘outer’ orbit).

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {The Jovian-sized object WD 1856 b transits a white dwarf (WD) in a compact 1.4 day orbit. Unlikely to have endured stellar evolution in its current orbit, WD 1856 b is thought to have migrated from much wider separations. Because the WD is old, and a member of a well-characterized hierarchical multiple, the well-known Kozai mechanism provides an effective migration channel for WD 1856 b. The tidal dissipation that makes this mechanism possible is sensitive to the mass of WD 1856 b, which remains unconstrained by observations. Moreover, the lack of tides in the star allows us to directly connect the current semimajor axis to the pre-migration one, from which we can infer the initial conditions of the system. By further requiring that planets must survive all previous phases of stellar evolution before migrating, we are able to constrain the main-sequence semimajor axis of WD 1856 b to have been ∼2.5 au, and its mass to be ≃0.7–3M J. These mass limits put WD 1856 b firmly within the planet category. Furthermore, our inferred values imply that WD 1856 b was born a typical gas giant. We further estimate the occurrence rate of Kozai-migrated planets around WDs to be , suggesting that WD 1856 b is the only one in the TESS sample, but implying  future detections by the LSST survey. In a sense, WD 1856 b was an ordinary Jovian planet that underwent an extraordinary dynamical history.}

The evolution of mutual inclination is described, a priori, by two dimensionless parameters, \\$\\mathcal \\{R\\}\_0\\$, the ratio between the inner and outer LK time-scales and εSRF, the ratio between the SRF precession and the inner LK precession rates.

For typical BH binaries with masses \\$m\_\\{1,2\\}\\simeq 20\\!-\\!30\\, \\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot\\$ and initial semimajor axis a0 ∼ 100 au (such that the binaries have no chance of merging by themselves within ∼1010 yr), we show that binary–binary interactions can significantly increase the LK window for mergers (the range of companion inclinations that allows the BH binary to merge within 10 Gyr). This increase arises from a secular resonance between the LK oscillation of the BH binary and the nodal precession of the outer (binary–binary) orbit driven by the tertiary binary. Therefore, in the presence of tertiary binary, the BH merger fraction is increased to \\$10\\!-\\!30\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$, an order of magnitude larger than the merger fraction found in similar triple systems. Our analysis (with appropriate scalings) can be easily adapted to other configurations of systems, such as relatively compact BH binaries and moderately hierarchical triples, which may generate even higher merger fractions. Since the occurrence rate of stellar quadruples in the galactic fields is not much smaller than that of stellar triples, our result suggests that dynamically induced BH mergers in quadruple systems may be an important channel of producing BH mergers observed by LIGO/VIRGO.}",

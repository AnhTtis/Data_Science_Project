\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
P2P is a fundamental component in many decentralized applications. Our work addresses improvement on broadcast latency and exploration convergence by bringing idea from matrix completion and streaming algorithm to synthesize a general view about the network. When the number of publisher is equal or less than the number of exploitation connections, the $\GF$ can find and retain the global optimal connections. When the network is dynamic and complex, $\GF$ saves $14.5\%$ time than its baseline.

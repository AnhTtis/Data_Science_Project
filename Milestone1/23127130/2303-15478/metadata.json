    "abstract": "Let $(a_n)_{n\\geq 0}$ be an arbitrary sequence and $(a_{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor})_{n\\geq 0}$ its dual floor sequence. We study infinite series and finite generalized binomial sums involving $(a_{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor})_{n\\geq 0}$. As applications we prove a range of new closed form expressions for Fibonacci (Lucas) series and binomial sum identities as particular cases.",

\begin{abstract}
Pretrained language models often generate outputs that are not in line with human preferences, such as harmful text or factually incorrect summaries. Recent work approaches the above issues by learning from a simple form of human feedback: comparisons between pairs of model-generated outputs. However, comparison feedback only conveys limited information about human preferences. In this paper, we introduce Imitation learning from Language Feedback (ILF), a new approach that utilizes more informative language feedback. ILF consists of three steps that are applied iteratively: first, conditioning the language model on the input, an initial LM output, and feedback to generate refinements. Second, selecting the refinement incorporating the most feedback. Third, finetuning the language model to maximize the likelihood of the chosen refinement given the input. We show theoretically that ILF can be viewed as Bayesian Inference, similar to Reinforcement Learning from human feedback. We evaluate ILF's effectiveness on a carefully-controlled toy task and a realistic summarization task.
Our experiments demonstrate that large language models accurately incorporate feedback and that finetuning with ILF scales well with the dataset size, even outperforming finetuning on human summaries. Learning from both language and comparison feedback outperforms learning from each alone, achieving human-level summarization performance.

%Pretrained language models often do not perform tasks in ways that are in line with our preferences, e.g., they generate harmful text or factually incorrect summaries. Recent work approaches the above issue by learning from a simple form of human evaluation: comparisons between pairs of model-generated task outputs. However, comparison feedback can only convey limited information about human preferences. Here, we propose \textbf{i}mitation learning from \textbf{l}anguage \textbf{f}eedback (ILF), a new approach that utilises more informative language feedback.
%ILF consists of three steps that we iteratively apply: first, we condition the language model on the initial output and feedback to generate many refinements.
%Second, we choose the refinement incorporating most of the feedback.
%Third, we finetune a language model to maximize the likelihood of the chosen refinement given the input.
%We formally demonstrate that ILF can be viewed as Bayesian Inference, and we evaluate its effectiveness on synthetic data and a new preference learning dataset called SLF-5K. Our experiments show that large language models are able to accurately incorporate feedback to generate refinements and that finetuning with ILF scales well with the size of the dataset, even outperforming finetuning on human summaries. Additionally, we find that while learning from binary comparisons is more sample efficient than learning from language feedback, combining ILF with a reward model trained on binary comparisons produces the best results and achieves roughly human-level summarization ability.

%Alternative abstarct
%Language models have the potential to significantly improve our ability to perform a wide range of tasks, but they often do not align with our preferences. For example, they may generate harmful text or factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we propose Imitation Learning from Language Feedback (ILF) as a solution to this problem. ILF allows language models to learn from more informative language feedback, rather than just simple comparisons between pairs of outputs. By iteratively applying three steps - generating refinements using the initial output and feedback, choosing the refinement that best incorporates the feedback, and finetuning the language model on the chosen refinement - we can effectively teach language models to align with our preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ILF on synthetic data and a new preference learning dataset called SLF-5K, and show that it scales well with the size of the dataset. In fact, ILF outperforms finetuning on human summaries in some cases. Additionally, we find that combining ILF with a reward model trained on binary comparisons produces the best results, achieving roughly human-level summarization ability. Our work represents a major step forward in the ability of language models to learn from human preferences.

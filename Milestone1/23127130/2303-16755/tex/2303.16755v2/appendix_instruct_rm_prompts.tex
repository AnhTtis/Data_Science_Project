We instructed one of the authors of this paper (who at the time had not been involved in the research project) to write 5 prompts that would achieve the goal of selecting high-quality summaries, i.e., refinements. The author did not have any domain knowledge or prior information on what kinds of prompts would work. The instructions provided to the author can be viewed \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J1wb7JJLDHS1eu2n20t5CQtw7HBKy7jf6N2tN9nUJKU/edit?usp=sharing}{here}. We report all 5 prompt templates in Table~\ref{tab:instruct_rm_prompts}.

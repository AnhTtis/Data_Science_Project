    "abstract": "To benefit the complementary information between heterogeneous data, we introduce a new Multimodal Transformer (MMFormer) for Remote Sensing (RS) image classification using Hyperspectral Image (HSI) accompanied by another source of data such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Compared with traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) lacking inductive biases of convolutions, we first introduce convolutional layers to our MMFormer to tokenize patches from multimodal data of HSI and LiDAR. Then we propose a Multi-scale Multi-head Self-Attention (MSMHSA) module to address the problem of compatibility which often limits to fuse HSI with high spectral resolution and LiDAR with relatively low spatial resolution. The proposed MSMHSA module can incorporate HSI to LiDAR data in a coarse-to-fine manner enabling us to learn a fine-grained representation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks (e.g., Trento and MUUFL) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed MMFormer for RS image classification.",

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we propose a novel approach to OOD detection which uses a generic
pre-trained representation instead of training a discriminative classifier on
the ID classes.
%In initial experiments, two low-complexity classifiers already significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods on most considered OOD benchmarks, confirming the applicability of the used representation for the OOD detection.

We model the classification scores of the LP and NM classifiers
for the ID classes as a multivariate Guassian and show that this permits
addressing OOD detection as a formally defined two-class Neyman-Pearson
task. Compared to traditional logit (or distance) thresholding, the solution to this task
leads to naturally calibrated OOD detection score connected directly to the
same false negative rate on all ID classes. Moreover, the resulting \grood
method leverages the strengths of both used classifiers leading to
consistent performance over all considered benchmarks.

The proposed \grood method was compared to the state-of-the-art methods on
a wide and diverse range of OOD problems with various types and strengths of semantic
and domain shifts. It effectively solves the mixed semantic and distribution
shift benchmarks and achieves the best performance on most of the other
considered problems.

The only observed limitations are related to the interaction of the annotation in
SVHN dataset with the CLIP representation, and very fine-grained classification of airplanes which goes beyond visual attributes.

The simplicity of the adaptation of the \grood method to a novel problem --
only a multi-class logistic regression and finding the mean of each class is needed for training -- makes the process fast.

We suggest that the proposed method combined with a generic representation is
suitable for most OOD tasks based on natural images;
with \grood many of the standard benchmarks are saturated and no longer
stimulate further progress. A recently introduced NINCO dataset~\cite{bitterwolf2023ninco} may be a possible direction, but is left as a future work.

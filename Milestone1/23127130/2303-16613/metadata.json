    "abstract": "This study introduces an approach to estimate the uncertainty in bibliometric indicator values that is caused by data errors. This approach utilizes Bayesian regression models, estimated from empirical data samples, which are used to predict error-free data. Through direct Monte Carlo simulation -- drawing predicted data from the estimated regression models a large number of times for the same input data -- probability distributions for indicator values can be obtained, which provide the information on their uncertainty due to data errors. It is demonstrated how uncertainty in base quantities, such as the number of publications of a unit of certain document types and the number of citations of a publication, can be propagated along a measurement model into final indicator values. This method can be used to estimate the uncertainty of indicator values due to sources of errors with known error distributions. The approach is demonstrated with simple synthetic examples for instructive purposes and real bibliometric research evaluation data to show its possible application in practice.",

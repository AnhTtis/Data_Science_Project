In this paper, we propose a novel Structured Epipolar Matcher (SEM) for local feature matching utilizing the geometry priors.
To make features more discriminating, we design a Structured Feature Extractor to complement the appearance features.
To exclude the regions of interference as much as possible, we propose Epipolar Attention and Matching in 
 the iterable coarse matching stage.
Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we systematically study the interference when multiple applications co-run on the same machine. We empirically investigate 25 modern programs from various application domains, such as data mining, machine learning, standard benchmarks, HPC, and real-world parallel applications, among others. We conduct 625 pairs of co-running settings to obtain deep insights of understanding execution interference and identify its root causes in both hardware and software. Our findings help understand the characteristics (e.g., harmony, victim-offender, or both-victim) of individual applications to execution interference. Moreover, the root cause analysis associates the interference sensitivity with source code regions. The insights provided by this paper will benefit both hardware and software design for throughput-oriented computing systems. Due to the page limit, some interesting findings are omitted. Hence, a repository that contains all the experiment results will be provided after acceptance of the paper.

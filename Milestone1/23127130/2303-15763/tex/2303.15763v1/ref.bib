  abstract = {The ratio of cpu speed to memory speed in current high-performance
	computers is growing rapidly, with significant implications for the
	design and implementation of algorithms in scientific computing.
	I present the results of a broad survey of memory bandwidth and machine
	balance for a large variety of current computers, including uniprocessors,
	vector processors, shared-memory systems, and districuted-memory
	systems. The results are analyzed in terms of the sustainable data
	transfer rates for uncached unit-stride vector operation for each
	machine, and for each class.},

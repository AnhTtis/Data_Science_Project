    "abstract": "We present a universal concept for the Value of Information (VoI) based on Claude Shannon's information and work of Ruslan Stratonovich that has desirable properties for Bayesian decision theory and demand analysis. The Shannon/Stratonovich VoI concept is compared to the concept of Hartley VoI and applied to an epitome economic application of a circular setting generalizing an example of Ruslan Stratonovich and allowing for a network structure and an investigation of various economic transport costs.",

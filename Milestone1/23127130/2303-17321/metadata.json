    "abstract": "We propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the synchronization of $N$ identical single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, connected through a directed graph. We consider both the continuous-time and the discrete-time case, and we provide conditions that do not require any assumption on the graph and ensure the uniform global exponential stability of the closed attractor that corresponds to the synchronization set, with guaranteed convergence rate.",

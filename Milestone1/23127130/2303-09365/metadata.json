    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a graph and $k$ be a positive integer, and let $Kc(G, k)$ denote the number of Kempe equivalence classes for the $k$-colorings of $G$. In 2006, Mohar noted that $Kc(G, k) = 1$ if $G$ is bipartite. As a generalization, we show that $Kc(G, k) = 1$ if $G$ is formed from a bipartite graph by adding any number of edges less than $\\binom{\\lceil k/2\\rceil}2+\\binom{\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor}2$. We show that our result is tight (up to lower order terms) by constructing, for each $k \\geq 8$, a graph $G$ formed from a bipartite graph by adding $(k^2+8k-45+1)/4$ edges such that $Kc(G, k) \\geq 2$. This refutes a recent conjecture of Higashitani--Matsumoto.",

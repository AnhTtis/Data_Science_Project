\begin{abstract}
An array of large observational programs using ground-based and space-borne telescopes 
is planned in the next decade. The forthcoming wide-field sky surveys are expected to deliver a sheer
volume of data exceeding an exabyte. Processing the large amount of multiplex astronomical data is technically challenging, and fully
automated technologies based on machine learning and artificial intelligence are urgently needed.
Maximizing scientific returns from the big data requires community-wide efforts.  
We summarize recent progress in machine learning applications in observational cosmology. 
We also address crucial issues in high-performance computing that are
needed for the data processing and statistical analysis.

\section{Concluding Remarks}
Brand-new telescopes will be in operation soon
and will explore the Universe with a broad range of wavelength. The amount of data delivered by the next generation observations is unprecedented.
It is urgently needed to develop efficient ML applications to process and analyze the sheer volume of data. This review article provides an overview of the ongoing effort in cosmology to make the best use of ML methods. 
Research in ML itself is developing rapidly,
where new approaches are proposed on a literally daily basis, not only for use in scientific research but also
for practical problems in our society.
Hopefully, astronomy can offer invaluable data sets for the ML/AI researchers to test and improve their methods by using multiplex data with a large volume
and of high quality.

Recent effort in observational cosmology largely focused on performing big-data analysis efficiently, and it is often left behind to address the overall reliability and interpretability of the machine-generated results. 
Developing explainable AI and gaining 
fundamental physics insights from data science approaches
will be important goals in the future \cite{Lundberg17,Mothilal20}.
Obviously, just bigger data from upcoming surveys do not automatically help improving theory predictions nor enhance modeling \cite{Hosni17}. 
Spurious correlations or even unphysical artifacts can be learned by sophisticated machines \cite{Laps19}.
It is already known that there are some certain limitations of currently popular generative models \cite{Konstantin22}.
In order to maximize the scientific returns
from future observations, another big leap would
be needed in ML/AI research so that the results -- often just numerics -- are understood in terms of physics and rigorous statistics.
Reasonable scientific implications can then be 
derived from ML approaches, which 
should ultimately lead to the development of a fully automated science research.

Admittedly, there are many topics that we have not been able to cover in this review. Most of the methods discussed here are successful examples adopted in astronomy and cosmology, but there is a much larger domain of ML applications other than basic science.
Completely new approaches may well be proposed from 
yet immature research areas. 
As we have emphasized repeatedly,
ML/AI is a hot research topic and is rapidly advancing in virtually all 
science research domains.
Frequent checks and updates 
will be necessary for the readers to catch up with the state-of-the-art. 
Thankfully, many of the papers introduced in this review offer their computer programs publicly available. The interested
readers should be able to find them easily in the respective papers,
and are encouraged to use for their own research or further code development.

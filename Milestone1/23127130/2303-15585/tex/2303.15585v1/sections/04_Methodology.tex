\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
Next, we delineate our methodology for conducting this systematic review (\S\ref{conducting} and \S\ref{limitations}) and provide our positionality statement (\S\ref{positionality}).

Note that for readability purposes, we present a simplified version of our query and data extraction. Our query retrieves $\sim55\%$ of all IMWUT publications, while our eligibility assessment filtering ends up with 49 papers ($\sim9\%$ of retrieved papers). We notice that only a very small fraction of all IMWUT papers looks at fairness issues, with only a small deviation across years.  \label{fig:methodology}}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Conducting the Literature Review\label{conducting}}
We followed an established protocol for conducting systematic reviews introduced by \citet{kitchenham2007guidelines} to ensure the quality of included works and limit the initial retrieved papers. At least three authors were involved at each step to minimize the effects of bias and priming. In accordance with this protocol, we initially identified the need for a systematic review, as discussed in Section~\ref{introduction}, namely to explore where UbiComp fairness overlaps with traditional fairness definitions and, more importantly, where it lags behind. Figure~\ref{fig:methodology} provides a high-level overview of the process.
\smallskip 

\noindent\textbf{Paper Identification \& Screening.} 
UbiComp is a relatively new area in Information and Computer Science that crosses several fields, ranging from HCI, Hardware and Software Systems, and Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. For the scope of this review, we focused on the Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT), a premier journal in the UbiComp community, also placed among the top-3 publications in HCI.
For the search process, we utilized the ACM Digital Library, focusing on papers that were published in the last five years (between 2018 and 2022) to capture emerging trends in fairness and UbiComp research. We also considered a broader search on Google Scholar but opted not to include it due to scale concerns (e.g.,  the query ``machine learning fairness''  returns approximately 279,000 results on Google Scholar) and the fact that indexed papers may not have undergone peer review. Apart from year filtering, for the most part, we did not limit our search to meta-data, such as titles, keywords, and abstracts, but rather we expanded it to any searchable field, including full text. That excludes the first part of the query, which tries to match terms such as wearable(s) or mobile(s) only in the papers' meta-data, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:query}. 
\smallskip


\noindent\textbf{Query Definition.} For the definition of our query, we followed similar terminology with relevant review papers in the fairness literature \cite{le2022survey,caton2020fairness}. Additionally, according to Fjeld et al.'s analysis of prominent AI principles documents, \cite{fjeld2020principled}, ``the fairness and non-discrimination theme is the most highly represented theme in our dataset, with every document referencing at least one of its six principles: ``non-discrimination and the prevention of bias'', ``representative and high-quality data'', ``fairness'', ``equality'', ``inclusiveness in impact'', and ``inclusiveness in design'', mostly included in our query's coverage. To capture the industrial perspective, we consulted the Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) white papers issued by large tech companies. Specifically, Google's\footnote{\url{https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/?category=fairness}} and Meta's\footnote{\url{https://ai.facebook.com/blog/facebooks-five-pillars-of-responsible-ai/}} RAI principles talk about ``fairness and inclusion'', Amazon's\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/}} RAI principles promote ``diversity, equity, and inclusion'' through ``detecting bias''. Similarly, Nokia's\footnote{\url{https://www.bell-labs.com/institute/blog/introducing-nokias-6-pillars-of-responsible-ai/}} RAI fairness pillar talks about ``fairness, non-discrimination, accessibility, and inclusivity'', and Intel's RAI pillars mention ``enabling ethical and equitable AI''. Thus, an iterative refinement process resulted in the query shown in Figure~\ref{fig:query}.

\end{figure}
\smallskip 

\noindent\textbf{Eligibility Assessment.} To further validate our query, we manually inspected all publications from the latest IMWUT proceedings (Volume 6, Issue 4, published in January 2023) ($N=56$) to identify eligible papers for inclusion (see inclusion and exclusion criteria below). In total, we identified seven relevant publications, all of which were also returned by our query. This process was irrelevant to our final paper retrieval (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) \cite{moher2009preferred} flow diagram is pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:prisma}) and served validation purposes only. To ensure the high quality and relevance of the included papers, we defined appropriate exclusion criteria that helped us determine the included papers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Papers that do not provide a quantitative assessment of at least one empirical or artifact contribution in ubiquitous computing (UBI);
    \item Papers that do not include a quantitative assessment of bias or performance discrepancy in their evaluation with regard to sensitive attributes, such as age, gender, race, disability, religion, and sexual orientation, among others (FAIR);
    \item Papers that discuss different domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision without incorporating a UbiComp component (DOM);
    \item Papers that refer to bias in a different context, such as the bias-variance trade-off or the bias parameter in neural networks (CON). 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[tb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{figures/prismaNew2.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{PRISMA flow diagram for paper inclusion}. Out of the 611 papers retrieved by our query after the screening, only 9\% ($N=49$) did not check any exclusion criterion and thus were included in the literature review.  The majority of the retrieved papers were false positives, highlighting the importance of the eligibility assessment.  \label{fig:prisma}}
\end{figure}
\noindent\textbf{Inclusion \& PRISMA Statement.} Finally, the sequential execution of the steps above, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:prisma}, led to our review's included papers. Overall, we screened 523 papers after date filtering and duplicate elimination. After carefully screening these papers, we excluded 474 based on our exclusion criteria. In detail, 31 papers did not provide any quantitative assessment of a UbiComp contribution (UBI: 6.5\%), 394 papers did not provide any fairness assessment (FAIR: 83.1\%), 2 papers did not discuss a UbiComp component (DOM: <0.5\%), 42 papers referred to bias in a different context (CON: 8.9\%), and finally, 5 papers were excluded for other reasons (OTHER: 1.1\%). Hence, we included 49 papers in our review\footnote{To foster reproducibility, upon acceptance, we intend to release the review data and codebooks}. 


\subsection{Methodological Limitations}
\label{limitations}
While we have made every effort to ensure broad coverage of papers relevant to fairness in UbiComp studies, our search for literature might not be comprehensive and exhaustive. However, covering IMWUT as a prominent academic venue for ubiquitous computing research allowed us to capture emerging trends. Besides, we intended to provide insights and research directions to the IMWUT community; therefore, we narrowed down our research to IMWUT proceedings as opposed to the broader community by including the proceedings of, for example, PerCom, SenSys, MobiSys, or medical journals such as JMIR. We also acknowledge that despite our best efforts to pick literature-driven keywords and manually validate the retrieved results, the output might well have produced both false positives and false negative results. 



\subsection{Positionality Statement\label{positionality}}
Understanding researcher positionality is essential to demystifying our lens on data collection and analysis~\cite{frluckaj2022gender, havens2020situated}. We situate this review paper in a Western country (REDACTED FOR REVIEW) in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, writing as authors who primarily work as academic and industry researchers. We identify as two females and four males, and our shared backgrounds include HCI, ML, and ubiquitous computing.

\rev{\section{Alternative Search Queries\label{ap:queries}}}

\rev{In an effort to widen our scope, we assessed multiple alternative queries. Two indicative alternative options are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:alt}. Specifically, we added the terms ``device'', ``system'', and ``ubiquitous'' in the query shown in~\ref{fig:alt1} to try and capture literature beyond mobile and wearable computing. Yet, the query retrieved 523 articles, the same as the original query excluding these terms, showcasing the wide coverage of our initial query. Additionally, to capture literature across learning paradigms (beyond the frequently encountered paradigms of classification and regression), we added the terms ``reinforcement learning'', ``representation learning'', and ``anomaly detection''. This query returned four additional results, none of which complied with our screening and eligibility criteria. This is not surprising, given that our query was optimized for coverage, despite the large number of false positives returned. Overall, these efforts confirm the wide scope of our query, which was further validated by manual inspection, as described in Section~\ref{conducting}.}

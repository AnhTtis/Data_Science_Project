\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The field of \rev{mobile and wearable computing} faces significant challenges in ensuring fairness in the development of ML-based UbiComp technologies. Although efforts have been made to address biases, only a small percentage of \rev{IMWUT} publications focus on fairness reporting and enhancement mechanisms. Sensitive attributes such as race, nationality, and language are often overlooked, while it is evident that there is a need for more diverse sample recruitment. UbiComp researchers must be explicit and transparent about their fairness priorities, definitions, and assumptions, making trade-offs between competing priorities, ethical risks, and opportunities. Despite these challenges, the UbiComp community strives for ``fairer'' models by conducting and reporting ablation studies, in-the-wild vs. in-the-lab experiments, and personalized model development. Ultimately, the UbiComp community must continue to prioritize fairness to ensure that the development of these technologies leads to just and equitable outcomes.

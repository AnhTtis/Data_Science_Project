abstract = {DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets, and how the resulting information is published on the Web for human-andmachine-consumption. We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website authors can facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data.},

abstract = {Searching in a domain-specific corpus of structured documents (e.g., e-commerce, media streaming services, job-seeking platforms) is often managed as a traditional retrieval task or through faceted search. Semantic Query Labeling --- the task of locating the constituent parts of a query and assigning domain-specific predefined semantic labels to each of them --- allows leveraging the structure of documents during retrieval while leaving unaltered the keyword-based query formulation. Due to both the lack of a publicly available dataset and the high cost of producing one, there have been few published works in this regard. In this paper, basing on the assumption that a corpus already contains the information the users search, we propose a method for the automatic generation of semantically labeled queries and show that a semantic tagger --- based on BERT, gazetteers-based features, and Conditional Random Fields --- trained on our synthetic queries achieves results comparable to those obtained by the same model trained on real-world data. We also provide a large dataset of manually annotated queries in the movie domain suitable for studying Semantic Query Labeling. We hope that the public availability of this dataset will stimulate future research in this area.},

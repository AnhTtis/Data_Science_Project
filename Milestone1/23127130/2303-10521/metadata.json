    "abstract": "Radio applications are increasingly being used in urban environments for cellular radio systems and safety applications that use vehicle-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure. We present a novel ray tracing-based radio propagation algorithm that can handle large urban scenes with hundreds or thousands of dynamic objects and receivers. Our approach is based on the use of coherence-based techniques that exploit spatial and temporal coherence for efficient wireless propagation and radio network planning. Our formulation also utilizes channel coherence which is used to determine the effectiveness of the propagation model within a certain time in dynamically generated paths; and spatial consistency which is used to estimate the similarity and accuracy of changes in a dynamic environment with varying propagation models and blocking obstacles. We highlight the performance of our simulator in large urban traffic scenes with an area of 2*2 km^2 and more than 10,000 users and devices. We evaluate the accuracy by comparing the results with discrete model simulations performed using WinProp. In practice, our approach scales linearly with the area of the urban environment and the number of dynamic obstacles or receivers.",

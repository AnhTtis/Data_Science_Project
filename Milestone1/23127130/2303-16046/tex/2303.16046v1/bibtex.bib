@article{Huang2018,
	abstract = {We present high-resolution observations of a magnetic reconnection event in the solar atmosphere taken with the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The reconnection event occurred between the threads of a twisted arch filament system (AFS) and coronal loops. Our observations reveal that the relaxation of the twisted AFS drives some of its threads to encounter the coronal loops, providing inflows of the reconnection. The reconnection is evidenced by flared X-shape features in the AIA images, a current-sheet-like feature apparently connecting post-reconnection loops in the Hα + 1 {\AA} images, small-scale magnetic cancelation in the HMI magnetograms and flows with speeds of 40--80 km s−1 along the coronal loops. The post-reconnection coronal loops seen in the AIA 94 {\AA} passband appear to remain bright for a relatively long time, suggesting that they have been heated and/or filled up by dense plasmas previously stored in the AFS threads. Our observations suggest that the twisted magnetic system could release its free magnetic energy into the upper solar atmosphere through reconnection processes. While the plasma pressure in the reconnecting flux tubes are significantly different, the reconfiguration of field lines could result in transferring of mass among them and induce heating therein.},

@article{Savage2011,
	abstract = {Sunward-flowing voids above post-coronal mass ejection flare arcades were first discovered using the soft X-ray telescope aboard Yohkoh and have since been observed with TRACE (extreme ultraviolet (EUV)), SOHO/LASCO (white light), SOHO/SUMER (EUV spectra), and Hinode/XRT (soft X-rays). Supra-arcade downflow (SAD) observations suggest that they are the cross-sections of thin flux tubes retracting from a reconnection site high in the corona. Supra-arcade downflowing loops (SADLs) have also been observed under similar circumstances and are theorized to be SADs viewed from a perpendicular angle. Although previous studies have focused on dark flows because they are easier to detect and complementary spectral data analysis reveals their magnetic nature, the signal intensity of the flows actually ranges from dark to bright. This implies that newly reconnected coronal loops can contain a range of hot plasma density. Previous studies have presented detailed SAD observations for a small number of flares. In this paper, we present a substantial SADs and SADLs flare catalog. We have applied semi-automatic detection software to several of these events to detect and track individual downflows thereby providing statistically significant samples of parameters such as velocity, acceleration, area, magnetic flux, shrinkage energy, and reconnection rate. We discuss these measurements (particularly the unexpected result of the speeds being an order of magnitude slower than the assumed Alfv{\'e}n speed), how they were obtained, and potential impact on reconnection models.},

@article{Kumar2018,
	abstract = {Small, impulsive jets commonly occur throughout the solar corona, but are especially visible in coronal holes. Evidence is mounting that jets are part of a continuum of eruptions that extends to much larger coronal mass ejections and eruptive flares. Because coronal-hole jets originate in relatively simple magnetic structures, they offer an ideal testbed for theories of energy buildup and release in the full range of solar eruptions. We analyzed an equatorial coronal-hole jet observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA on 2014 January 9 in which the magnetic-field structure was consistent with the embedded-bipole topology that we identified and modeled previously as an origin of coronal jets. In addition, this event contained a mini-filament, which led to important insights into the energy storage and release mechanisms. SDO/HMI magnetograms revealed footpoint motions in the primary minority-polarity region at the eruption site, but show negligible flux emergence or cancellation for at least 16 hr before the eruption. Therefore, the free energy powering this jet probably came from magnetic shear concentrated at the polarity inversion line within the embedded bipole. We find that the observed activity sequence and its interpretation closely match the predictions of the breakout jet model, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the breakout model can explain solar eruptions on a wide range of scales.},

@article{Hong2019,
	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that solar jets involving minifilament eruptions may be initiated under the well-known magnetic-breakout mechanism. Before or just at the onset of those jets, there should be a current sheet, where breakout magnetic reconnection takes place, between open fields and the outside of the jet-base arcade carrying a minifilament in its core. In this paper we present a jet produced by the eruption of two minifilaments lying at the jet base. A current sheet is directly detected near the jet base before the onset of the eruption, suggesting the magnetic-breakout mechanism. However, we further find that the current sheet undergoes a transition. The current sheet first shortens to zero in length, but then lengthens toward an orthogonal direction relative to its initial orientation. The change of the current sheet gives rise to a reversal of the breakout reconnection, as the inflow and outflow regions before the transition become the outflow and inflow regions after the transition, respectively. We therefore propose that this observation provides evidence for the so-called oscillatory reconnection that is defined by a series of reconnection reversals but not yet proven to exist in the real plasma environment of the solar atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Microflares, one of the small-scale solar activities, are believed to be caused by magnetic reconnection. Nevertheless, their three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structures, thermodynamic structures, and physical links to reconnection are unclear. In this Letter, based on a high-resolution 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the quiet Sun spanning from the upper convection zone to the corona, we investigate the 3D magnetic and thermodynamic structures of three homologous microflares. It is found that they originate from localized hot plasma embedded in the chromospheric environment at the height of 2--10 Mm above the photosphere and last for 3--10 minutes with released magnetic energy in the range of 1027--1028 erg. The heated plasma is almost cospatial with the regions where the heating rate per particle is maximal. The 3D velocity field reveals a pair of converging flows with velocities of tens of km s−1 moving toward and outflows with velocities of about 100 km s−1 moving away from the hot plasma. These features support magnetic reconnection playing a critical role in heating the localized chromospheric plasma to coronal temperature, giving rise to the observed microflares. The magnetic topology analysis further discloses that the reconnection region is located near quasi-separators where both current density and squashing factors are maximal although the specific topology may vary from a tether-cutting to fan-spine-like structure.},

	abstract = {We investigate the initiation and early evolution of 12 solar eruptions, including six active-region hot channel and six quiescent filament eruptions, which were well observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory for the latter. The sample includes one failed eruption and 11 coronal mass ejections, with velocities ranging from 493 to 2140 km s−1. A detailed analysis of the eruption kinematics yields the following main results. (1) The early evolution of all events consists of a slow-rise phase followed by a main-acceleration phase, the height--time profiles of which differ markedly and can be best fit, respectively, by a linear and an exponential function. This indicates that different physical processes dominate in these phases, which is at variance with models that involve a single process. (2) The kinematic evolution of the eruptions tends to be synchronized with the flare light curve in both phases. The synchronization is often but not always close. A delayed onset of the impulsive flare phase is found in the majority of the filament eruptions (five out of six). This delay and its trend to be larger for slower eruptions favor ideal MHD instability models. (3) The average decay index at the onset heights of the main acceleration is close to the threshold of the torus instability for both groups of events (although, it is based on a tentative coronal field model for the hot channels), suggesting that this instability initiates and possibly drives the main acceleration.},

@article{Ni2017,
	abstract = {We perform 2D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of coronal jets driven by flux emergence along the lower boundary. The reconnection layers are susceptible to the formation of blobs that are ejected in the jet. Our simulation with low plasma β (Case I) shows that magnetic islands form easily and propagate upward in the jet. These islands are multithermal and thus are predicted to show up in hot channels (335 {\AA} and 211 {\AA}) and the cool channel (304 {\AA}) in observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The islands have maximum temperatures of 8 MK, lifetimes of 120 s, diameters of 6 Mm, and velocities of 200 km s−1. These parameters are similar to the properties of blobs observed in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets by AIA. The Kelvin--Helmholtz instability develops in our simulation with moderately high plasma β (Case II) and leads to the formation of bright vortex-like blobs above the multiple high magnetosonic Mach number regions that appear along the jet. These vortex-like blobs can also be identified in the AIA channels. However, they eventually move downward and disappear after the high magnetosonic Mach number regions disappear. In the lower plasma β case, the lifetime for the jet is shorter, the jet and magnetic islands are formed with higher velocities and temperatures, the current-sheet fragments are more chaotic, and more magnetic islands are generated. Our results show that the plasmoid instability and Kelvin--Helmholtz instability along the jet are both possible causes of the formation of blobs observed at EUV wavelengths.},

	abstract = {We examine 21 solar polar coronal jets that we identify in soft X-ray images obtained from the Hinode/X-ray telescope (XRT). We identify 11 of these as blowout jets and four as standard jets (with six uncertain), based on their X-ray-spire widths being respectively wide or narrow (compared to the jet's base) in the XRT images. From corresponding extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), essentially all (at least 20 of 21) of the jets are made by minifilament eruptions, consistent with other recent studies. Here, we examine the detailed nature of the erupting minifilaments (EMFs) in the jet bases. Wide-spire (``blowout'') jets often have ejective EMFs, but sometimes they instead have an EMF that is mostly confined to the jet's base rather than ejected. We also demonstrate that narrow-spire (``standard'') jets can have either a confined EMF, or a partially confined EMF where some of the cool minifilament leaks into the jet's spire. Regarding EMF visibility: we find that in some cases the minifilament is apparent in as few as one of the four EUV channels we examined, being essentially invisible in the other channels; thus, it is necessary to examine images from multiple EUV channels before concluding that a jet does not have an EMF at its base. The sizes of the EMFs, measured projected against the sky and early in their eruption, is 14″ $\pm$ 7″, which is within a factor of 2 of other measured sizes of coronal-jet EMFs.},

@article{Moore2018,
	abstract = {We follow up on the Sterling et al. discovery that nearly all polar coronal X-ray jets are made by an explosive eruption of a closed magnetic field carrying a miniature filament in its core. In the same X-ray and EUV movies used by Sterling et al., we examine the onset and growth of the driving magnetic explosion in 15 of the 20 jets that they studied. We find evidence that (1) in a large majority of polar X-ray jets, the runaway internal/tether-cutting reconnection under the erupting minifilament flux rope starts after both the minifilament's rise and the spire-producing external/breakout reconnection have started; and (2) in a large minority, (a) before the eruption starts, there is a current sheet between the explosive closed field and the ambient open field, and (b) the eruption starts with breakout reconnection at that current sheet. The variety of event sequences in the eruptions supports the idea that the magnetic explosions that make polar X-ray jets work the same way as the much larger magnetic explosions that make a flare and coronal mass ejection (CME). That idea and recent observations indicating that magnetic flux cancellation is the fundamental process that builds the field in and around the pre-jet minifilament and triggers that field's jet-driving explosion together suggest that flux cancellation inside the magnetic arcade that explodes in a flare/CME eruption is usually the fundamental process that builds the explosive field in the core of the arcade and triggers that field's explosion.},

@article{Baikie2022,
	abstract = {We examine a sampling of 23 polar-coronal-hole jets. We first identified the jets in soft X-ray (SXR) images from the X-ray telescope (XRT) on the Hinode spacecraft, over 2014--2016. During this period, frequently the polar holes were small or largely obscured by foreground coronal haze, often making jets difficult to see. We selected 23 jets among those adequately visible during this period, and examined them further using Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171, 193, 211, and 304 {\AA} images. In SXRs, we track the lateral drift of the jet spire relative to the jet base's jet bright point (JBP). In 22 of 23 jets, the spire either moves away from (18 cases) or is stationary relative to (4 cases) the JBP. The one exception where the spire moved toward the JBP may be a consequence of line-of-sight projection effects at the limb. From the AIA images, we clearly identify an erupting minifilament in 20 of the 23 jets, while the remainder are consistent with such an eruption having taken place. We also confirm that some jets can trigger the onset of nearby ``sympathetic'' jets, likely because eruption of the minifilament field of the first jet removes magnetic constraints on the base-field region of the second jet. The propensity for spire drift away from the JBP, the identification of the erupting minifilament in the majority of jets, and the magnetic-field topological changes that lead to sympathetic jets, all support or are consistent with the minifilament-eruption model for jets.},

	abstract = {The coronal blowout jet is a peculiar category among various jet phenomena, in which the sheared base arch, often carrying a small filament, experiences a miniature version of blowout eruption that produces large-scale coronal mass ejection (CME). In this paper, we report such a coronal blowout jet with high-resolution multi-wavelength and multi-angle observations taken from Solar Dynamics Observatory, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and Big Bear Solar Observatory. For the first time, we find that simultaneous bubble-like and jet-like CMEs were dynamically related to the blowout jet that showed cool and hot components next to each other. Our observational results indicate that (1) the cool component resulted from the eruption of the filament contained within the jet's base arch, and it further caused the bubble-like CME; (2) the jet-like CME was associated with the hot component, which was the outward moving heated plasma generated by the reconnection of the base arch and its ambient open field lines. On the other hand, bifurcation of the jet's cool component was also observed, which resulted from the uncoupling of the erupting filament's two legs that were highly twisted at the very beginning. Based on these results, we propose a model to interpret the coronal blowout jet, in which the external reconnection not only produces the jet-like CME, but also leads to the rising of the filament. Subsequently, internal reconnection starts underneath the rising filament and thereby causes the bubble-like CME.},

	abstract = {We follow two small, magnetically isolated coronal mass ejection (CME)-producing solar active regions (ARs) from the time of their emergence until several days later, when their core regions erupt to produce the CMEs. In both cases, magnetograms show: (a) following an initial period where the poles of the emerging regions separate from each other, the poles then reverse direction and start to retract inward; (b) during the retraction period, flux cancelation occurs along the main neutral line of the regions; (c) this cancelation builds the sheared core field/flux rope that eventually erupts to make the CME. In the two cases, respectively 30% and 50% of the maximum flux of the region cancels prior to the eruption. Recent studies indicate that solar coronal jets frequently result from small-scale filament eruptions, with those ``minifilament'' eruptions also being built up and triggered by cancelation of magnetic flux. Together, the small-AR eruptions here and the coronal jet results suggest that isolated bipolar regions tend to erupt when some threshold fraction, perhaps in the range of 50%, of the region's maximum flux has canceled. Our observed erupting filaments/flux ropes form at sites of flux cancelation, in agreement with previous observations. Thus, the recent finding that minifilaments that erupt to form jets also form via flux cancelation is further evidence that minifilaments are small-scale versions of the long-studied full-sized filaments.},

	abstract = {We report observations of 10 random on-disk solar quiet-region coronal jets found in high-resolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and having good coverage in magnetograms from the SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Recent studies show that coronal jets are driven by the eruption of a small-scale filament (called a minifilament). However, the trigger of these eruptions is still unknown. In the present study, we address the question: what leads to the jet-driving minifilament eruptions? The EUV observations show that there is a cool-transition-region-plasma minifilament present prior to each jet event and the minifilament eruption drives the jet. By examining pre-jet evolutionary changes in the line of sight photospheric magnetic field, we observe that each pre-jet minifilament resides over the neutral line between majority-polarity and minority-polarity patches of magnetic flux. In each of the 10 cases, the opposite-polarity patches approach and merge with each other (flux reduction between 21% and 57%). After several hours, continuous flux cancelation at the neutral line apparently destabilizes the field holding the cool-plasma minifilament to erupt and undergo internal reconnection, and external reconnection with the surrounding coronal field. The external reconnection opens the minifilament field allowing the minifilament material to escape outward, forming part of the jet spire. Thus, we found that each of the 10 jets resulted from eruption of a minifilament following flux cancelation at the neutral line under the minifilament. These observations establish that magnetic flux cancelation is usually the trigger of quiet-region coronal jet eruptions.},

	abstract = {We analyzed simultaneous EUV data from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and Hα data from Big Bear Solar Observatory. In the active region studied, we found several EUV jets that repeatedly occurred where pre-existing magnetic flux was "canceled" by newly emerging flux of opposite polarity. The jets look like Yohkoh soft X-ray jets, but are smaller and shorter lived than X-ray jets. They have a typical size of 4000-10,000 km, a transverse velocity of 50-100 km s-1, and a lifetime of 2-4 minutes. Each of the jets was ejected from a looplike bright EUV emission patch at the moment that the patch reached its peak emission. We also found dark Hα surges that are correlated with these jets. A careful comparison, however, revealed that the Hα surges are not cospatial with the EUV jets. Instead, the EUV jets are identified with bright jetlike features in the Hα line center. Our results support a picture in which Hα surges and EUV jets represent different kinds of plasma ejection---cool and hot plasma ejections along different field lines---which must be dynamically connected to each other. We emphasize the importance of observed flux cancellation and a small erupting filament in understanding the acceleration mechanisms of EUV jets and Hα surges.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of chromospheric anemone jets with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board Hinode has shown an indirect evidence of magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere. However, the basic nature of magnetic reconnection in chromosphere is still unclear. We studied nine chromospheric anemone jets from SOT/Hinode using Ca ii H filtergrams, and we found multiple bright, plasma ejections along the jets. In most cases, the major intensity enhancements (larger than 30% relative to the background intensity) of the loop correspond to the timing of the plasma ejections. The typical lifetime and size of the plasma ejecta are about 20--60 s and 0.3--1.5 Mm, respectively. The height--time plot of jet shows many sub-structures (or individual jets) and the typical lifetime of the individual jet is about one to five minutes. Before the onset of the jet activity, a loop appears in Ca ii H and gradually increases in size, and after few minutes several jets are launched from the loop. Once the jet activity starts and several individual jets are launched, the loop starts shrinking with a speed of ∼4 km s−1. In some events, a downward moving blob with a speed of ∼35 km s−1 was observed, associated with the upward moving plasma along one of the legs of the loop hosting the jets. The upward moving plasma gradually developed into jets. Multiple plasma ejections in chromospheric anemone jet show the strongly time-dependent as well as intermittent nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere.},

@article{Wang1998,
	abstract = {Time-lapse sequences of white-light images recorded with the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) frequently show long, narrow structures moving outward over the Sun's polar regions at high apparent speeds. By comparing the LASCO observations with Fe XII λ195 spectroheliograms made with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO between 1997 April and 1998 February, we have identified 27 correlated white-light and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jet events. In each case, the EUV jet was observed near the limb of the polar coronal hole 20-60 minutes before the corresponding white-light jet was registered in the coronagraph's 2-6 R☉ field of view. The jets originate near flaring EUV bright points and are presumably triggered by field line reconnection between magnetic bipoles and neighboring unipolar flux. The leading edges of the white-light jets propagate outward at speeds of 400-1100 km s-1, whereas the bulk of their material travels at much lower velocities averaging around 250 km s-1 at heliocentric distances of 2.9-3.7 R☉. These lower velocities may reflect the actual outflow speeds of the background polar wind.},

@article{Sakajiri2004,
	abstract = {We present observations of the eruption of a miniature filament that occurred near NOAA Active Region 9537 on 2001 July 14. The eruption was observed by the Hida Observatory Domeless Solar Telescope, in the Hα line center and $\pm$0.4 {\AA} wings, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory EUV Imaging Telescope (EIT) and Michelson Doppler Imager, and the Yohkoh Soft X-Ray Telescope (SXT). The miniature filament began to form and was clearly visible in Hα images by around 06:50 UT. It erupted about 25 minutes later, accompanied by a small two-ribbon subflare (with an area of 61 arcsec2). The two ribbons were also found to approach each other at a speed of 3.33 km s-1. We found that this event was caused by the emergence of new magnetic flux in a quiet region. The emerging flux appeared as a bright region in the EIT and SXT images taken on the previous day. It moved southward into an area of preexisting opposite-polarity flux, where a cancelling magnetic flux region was formed. The miniature filament then appeared, and we suggest that it played some role in inhibiting the release of energy by delaying reconnection between the emerging and preexisting flux, as evidenced by the disappearance of the bright region between opposite polarities in the EUV and soft X-ray images. Consequently, magnetic energy was stored as a result of the slow converging motion of the two opposite-polarity flux regions (0.17 km s-1). Reconnection below the filament provoked the filament eruption, and the two-ribbon flare occurred. Miniature filaments are thought to be small-scale analogs of large-scale filaments. Our observations also suggest some common properties between small-scale and large-scale flares. These results support the view that a unified magnetic reconnection model may be able to explain all scales of flares.},

	abstract = {The eruption of miniature filaments on the quiet Sun has been analyzed from time sequences of digital Hα filtergrams obtained at Big Bear Solar Observatory during 1997 September 18-24. The 2 days with the best image quality were selected for this initial study. During 13 hr of time-lapse observations on these 2 days, in an effective 640′′ × 480′′ area of quiet Sun close to the disk center, 88 erupting miniature filaments were identified. On average, these small-scale erupting filaments have a projected length of 19,000 km, an observed ejection speed of 13 km s-1, and a mean lifetime of 50 minutes from first appearance through eruption. The total mass and kinetic energy involved in a miniature filament eruption is estimated to be 1013 g and 1025 ergs, respectively. They are distinguished from macrospicules by the same criteria that large-scale filaments, before and during eruption, are distinguished from surges. Prior to eruption, one end, both ends, or the midsection of a miniature filament is superposed over a polarity reversal boundary on line-of-sight magnetograms. We conclude that miniature filaments are the small-scale analog to large-scale filaments.},

    "abstract": "Mini-filament eruptions are one of the most common small-scale transients in the solar atmosphere. However, their eruption mechanisms are still not understood thoroughly. Here, with a combination of 174 A images of high spatio-temporal resolution taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter and images of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory, we investigate in detail an erupting mini-filament over a weak magnetic field region on 2022 March 4. Two bright ribbons clearly appeared underneath the erupting mini-filament as it quickly ascended, and subsequently, some dark materials blew out when the erupting mini-filament interacted with the outer ambient loops, thus forming a blowout jet characterized by a widening spire. At the same time, multiple small bright blobs of 1-2 Mm appeared at the interaction region and propagated along the post-eruption loops toward the footpoints of the erupting fluxes at a speed of ~ 100 km/s. They also caused a semi-circular brightening structure. Based on these features, we suggest that the mini-filament eruption first experiences internal and then external reconnection, the latter of which mainly transfers mass and magnetic flux of the erupting mini-filament to the ambient corona.",

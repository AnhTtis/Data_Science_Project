    "abstract": "We study the linear polarization from the accretion disk around weakly and strongly naked Janis-Newman-Winicour singularities. We consider an analytical toy model of thin magnetized fluid ring orbiting in the equatorial plane and emitting synchrotron radiation. The observable polarized images are calculated and compared to the Schwarzschild black hole for physical parameters compatible with the radio source M87. For small inclination angles the direct images of the weakly naked singularities closely mimic the Schwarzschild black hole. The deviation in the polarization properties increases if we consider larger inclination angles or higher order images as for indirect images the polarization intensity grows several times in magnitude compared to black holes. Strongly naked singularities produce significant observational signatures already in the direct images. They create a second image of the fluid ring with times larger polarization intensity and characteristic twist of the polarization direction. Due to this additional structure they can be distinguished in polarimetric experiments.",

  abstract = {The third edition of this best-selling guide to Prolog and Artificial Intelligence has been updated to include key developments in the field while retaining its lucid approach to these topics. Divided into two parts, the first part of the book introduces the programming language Prolog, while the second part teaches Artificial Intelligence using Prolog as a tool for the implementation of AI techniques. Prolog has its roots in logic, however the main aim of this book is to teach Prolog as a practical programming tool. This text therefore concentrates on the art of using the basic mechanisms of Prolog to solve interesting problems. The third edition has been fully revised and extended to provide an even greater range of applications, which further enhance its value as a self-contained guide to Prolog, AI or AI Programming for students and professional programmers alike.}

The project gave rise to a preliminary version of Prolog at the end of 1971 and a more definitive version at the end of 1972. This article gives the history of this project and describes in detail the preliminary and then the final versions of Prolog. The authors also felt it appropriate to describe the Q-systems because it was a language that played a prominent part in Prolog's genesis.},

These real-world applications create new opportunities for synergy between theory and practice: observing what works well in practice leads to better theories of planning, and better theories lead to better performance of practical applications.
Automated Planning mirrors this dialogue by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date resource on both the theory and practice of automated planning. The book goes well beyond classical planning, to include temporal planning, resource scheduling, planning under uncertainty, and modern techniques for plan generation, such as task decomposition, propositional satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, and model checking.},

    abstract = {Planning is the model-based approach to autonomous behavior where the agent behavior is derived automatically from a model of the actions, sensors, and goals. The main challenges in planning are computational as all models, whether featuring uncertainty and feedback or not, are intractable in the worst case when represented in compact form. In this book, we look at a variety of models used in AI planning, and at the methods that have been developed for solving them. The goal is to provide a modern and coherent view of planning that is precise, concise, and mostly self-contained, without being shallow. For this, we make no attempt at covering the whole variety of planning approaches, ideas, and applications, and focus on the essentials. The target audience of the book are students and researchers interested in autonomous behavior and planning from an AI, engineering, or cognitive science perspective.

    abstract = {This book guides students through an exploration of the idea that
	thinking might be understood as a form of computation. Students make
	the connection between thinking and computing by learning to write
	computer programs for a variety of tasks that require thought, including
	solving puzzles, understanding natural language, recognizing objects
	in visual scenes, planning courses of action, and playing strategic
	games. The material is presented with minimal technicalities and
	is accessible to undergraduate students with no specialized knowledge
	or technical background beyond high school mathematics. Students
	use Prolog (without having to learn algorithms: 'Prolog without tears!'),
	learning to express what they need as a Prolog program and letting
	Prolog search for answers. After an introduction to the basic concepts,
	Thinking as Computation offers three chapters on Prolog, covering
	back-chaining, programs and queries, and how to write the sorts of
	Prolog programs used in the book. The book follows this with case
	studies of tasks that appear to require thought, then looks beyond
	Prolog to consider learning, explaining, and propositional reasoning.},

abstract = "This paper challenges the prevailing pessimism about the scalability of partial order planning (POP) algorithms by presenting several novel heuristic control techniques that make them competitive with the state of the art plan synthesis algorithms. Our key insight is that the techniques responsible for the efficiency of the currently successful planners-viz., distance based heuristics, reachability analysis and disjunctive constraint handling-can also be adapted to dramatically improve the efficiency of the POP algorithm. We implement our ideas in a variant of UCPOP called REPOP 1. Our empirical results show that in addition to dominating UCPOP, REPOP also convincingly outperforms Graphplan in several {"}parallel{"} domains. The plans generated by REPOP also tend to be better than those generated by Graphplan and state search planners in terms of execution flexibility."

	abstract     = {{This paper provides a complete presentation of the syntax, semantics, and some of the properties of ADL, a formalism for representing and reasoning about the effects of actions. ADL is based on the state-transition model of action, combining much of the expressive power of the situation calculus with the notational and computational benefits of the STRIPS language. In combining these elements, ADL attempts to strike a better balance in the tradeoff between the expressiveness of a logical formalism and the computational complexity of reasoning with that formalism. ADL is defined from a semantic standpoint as a set of constraints on the general state-transition model of action. These constraints are general enough to enable situation-dependent effects to be described while being strong enough to provide a simple solution to the frame problem. The syntax of ADL can vary, allowing different syntactical variants to be developed without altering the underlying semantics. The syntax presented here resembles the STRIPS operator language augmented with conditional add and delete lists. Reasoning is accomplished by transforming ADL schemas into regression operators. It is shown that regression operators provide a sound and complete means for reasoning about the effects of actions represented in ADL. It is also shown that, in general, comparable progression operators cannot be constructed from ADL schemas. This result is surprising, since progression operators are conceptually the inverse of regression operators. Reasoning can also be accomplished by axiomatizing ADL schemas in the situation calculus. It is shown that a restricted form of the situation calculus can be defined that is effectively equivalent to ADL in that ADL schemas can be translated into equivalent sets of axioms in this restricted form, and vice versa. The restricted form is interesting in its own right, since it incorporates a solution to the frame problem that does not explicitly rely on circumscription. This solution is derived from the semantics of ADL.}},

    abstract = {This new edition of The Art of Prolog contains a number of important changes. Most background sections at the end of each chapter have been updated to take account of important recent research results, the references have been greatly expanded, and more advanced exercises have been added which have been used successfully in teaching the course. Part II, The Prolog Language, has been modified to be compatible with the new Prolog standard, and the chapter on program development has been significantly altered: the predicates defined have been moved to more appropriate chapters, the section on efficiency has been moved to the considerably expanded chapter on cuts and negation, and a new section has been added on stepwise enhancement---a systematic way of constructing Prolog programs developed by Leon Sterling. All but one of the chapters in Part III, Advanced Prolog Programming Techniques, have been substantially changed, with some major rearrangements. A new chapter on interpreters describes a rule language and interpreter for expert systems, which better illustrates how Prolog should be used to construct expert systems. The chapter on program transformation is completely new and the chapter on logic grammars adds new material for recognizing simple languages, showing how grammars apply to more computer science examples.},

As is often the case, the combinations can be classified according to how tightly the different components are integrated, their range of application, and their degree of automation.}

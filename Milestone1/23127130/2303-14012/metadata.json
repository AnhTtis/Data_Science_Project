    "abstract": "Planning robotic manipulation tasks, especially those that involve interaction between deformable and rigid objects, is challenging due to the complexity in predicting such interactions. We introduce SPONGE, a sequence planning pipeline powered by a deep learning-based contact prediction model for contacts between deformable and rigid bodies under interactions. The contact prediction model is trained on synthetic data generated by a developed simulation environment to learn the mapping from point-cloud observation of a rigid target object and the pose of a deformable tool, to 3D representation of the contact points between the two bodies. We experimentally evaluated the proposed approach for a dish cleaning task both in simulation and on a real \\panda with real-world objects. The experimental results demonstrate that in both scenarios the proposed planning pipeline is capable of generating high-quality trajectories that can accomplish the task by achieving more than 90\\% area coverage on different objects of varying sizes and curvatures while minimizing travel distance.

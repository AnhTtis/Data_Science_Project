    "abstract": "An efficient method of computing power expansions of algebraic functions is the method of Kung and Traub and is based on exact arithmetic. This paper shows a numeric approach is both feasible and accurate while also introducing a performance improvement to Kung and Traub's method based on the ramification extent of the expansions. A new method is then described for computing radii of convergence using a series comparison test. Series accuracies are then fitted to a simple log-linear function in their domain of convergence and found to have low variance. Algebraic functions up to degree 50 were analyzed and timed. A consequence of this work provided a simple method of computing the Riemann surface genus and was used as a cycle check-sum. Mathematica ver. 13.2 was used to acquire and analyze the data on a 4.0 GHz quad-core desktop computer.",

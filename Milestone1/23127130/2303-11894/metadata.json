    "abstract": "A single material achieving multiple topological phases can provide potential application for topological spintronics, whereas the candidate materials are very limited. Here, we report the structure, physical properties, and possible emergence of multiple topological phases in the newly discovered, air-stable EuCuBi single crystal. EuCuBi crystallizes in a hexagonal space group P63/mmc (No. 194) in ZrBeSi-type structure with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state below TN = 11.2 K. There is a competition between AFM and ferromagnetic (FM) interactions below TN revealed by electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. With the increasing magnetic field, EuCuBi evolves from the AFM ground state with a small amount of FM component, going through two possible metamagnetic phases, finally reaches the field-induced FM phase. Based on the first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the Dirac, Weyl, and possible mirror Chern insulator can be achieved in EuCuBi by tuning the temperature and applying magnetic field, making EuCuBi a promising candidate for exploring multiple topological phases.",

    "abstract": "The classical Hochschild cohomology theory of rings is extended to abelian heaps with distributing multiplication or trusses. This cohomology is then employed to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a Nijenhuis product on a truss (defined by the extension of the Nijenhuis product on an associative ring introduced in [{\\sc J.F.\\ Cariñena, J.\\ Grabowski, G.\\ Marmo}, {\\it Quantum Bi-Hamiltonian Systems}. Int.\\ J.\\ Mod.\\ Phys.\\ A {\\bf 15}, 4797--4810, 2000.]) to be associative. The definition of Nijenhuis product and operators on trusses is then linearised to the case of affine spaces with compatible associative multiplications or associative {\\em affgebras}. It is shown that this construction leads to compatible Lie brackets on an affine space.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss Galilean relativistic Proca theory in detail. We first provide a set of mapping relations, derived systematically, that connect the covariant and contravariant vectors in the Lorentz relativistic and Galilean relativistic formulations. Exploiting this map, we construct the two limits of Galilean relativistic Proca theory from usual Proca theory in the potential formalism for both contravariant and covariant vectors which are now distinct entities. An action formalism is thereby derived from which the field equations are obtained and their internal consistency is shown. Next we construct Noether currents and show their on-shell conservation. We introduce analogues of Maxwell's electric and magnetic fields and recast the entire analysis in terms of these fields. Explicit invariance under Galilean transformations is shown for both electric/magnetic limits. We then move to discuss Stuckelberg embedded Proca model in the Galilean framework.",

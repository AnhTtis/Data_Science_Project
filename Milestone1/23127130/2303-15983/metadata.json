    "abstract": "The present work discusses the possibility to realize correlated disorder in electrical circuits and studies the localization phenomena in terms of two-port impedance. The correlated disorder is incorporated using the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model. One-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional AAH structures are explored and directly mapped with their tight-binding analogues. Transitions from the high-conducting phase to the low-conducting one are observed for the circuits.",

    "abstract": "While power systems research relies on the availability of real-world network datasets, data owners (e.g., system operators) are hesitant to share data due to security and privacy risks. To control these risks, we develop privacy-preserving algorithms for the synthetic generation of optimization and machine learning datasets. Taking a real-world dataset as input, the algorithms output its noisy, synthetic version, which preserves the accuracy of the real data on a specific downstream model or even a large population of those. We control the privacy loss using Laplace and Exponential mechanisms of differential privacy and preserve data accuracy using a post-processing convex optimization. We apply the algorithms to generate synthetic network parameters and wind power data.",

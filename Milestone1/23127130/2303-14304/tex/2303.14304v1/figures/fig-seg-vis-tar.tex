    We use the $N=2$ surrogate ensemble to generate this attack against blackbox victim \texttt{PSPNet-Res50}.
    For the direct transfer attack (at $Q=0$), only $67.08\%$ of the pixels of the target region are successfully mapped to the desired class. After weight optimization (with $Q=20$), pixel success rate increases to $99.77\%$.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we will generelize $b$-frames; a new concept of frames for Hilbert spaces, by $K$-$b$-frames. The idea is to take a sequence from a Banach space and see how it can be a frame for a Hilbert space. Instead of the scalar product we will use a new product called the $b$-dual product and it is constructed via a bilinear mapping. We will introduce new results about this product, about $b$-frames, and about $K$-$b$-frames, and we will also give some examples of both $b$-frames and $K$-$b$-frames that have never been given before. We will give the expression of the reconstruction formula of the elements of the Hilbert space. We will as well study the stability and preservation of both $b$-frames and $K$-$b$-frames; and to do so, we will give the equivalent of the adjoint operator according to the $b$-dual product.",

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented \method, a dense 2D-3D correspondence model, and multi-hypothesis refinement framework to estimate accurate 6D poses under very challenging visual conditions, such as aggressive reflections and low signal-to-noise ratio. 
We have shown the benefit of estimating coordinate prediction errors which we used to formulate multiple pose hypotheses using \gls{PnP}. 
Each individual pose hypothesis is refined and the maximum probability estimate yields the final pose. 
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging SPEED+ dataset and post-mortem SPEC2021 competition. 
Finally, we demonstrated the benefit of coordinate prediction errors for pose estimation with approximated 3D models on the TUD-L dataset.
% The main limitation of this work is \gls{PnP} which currently generates a huge computational overhead. Due to this, the system is currently not real-time capable. Moreover,

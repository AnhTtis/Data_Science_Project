The approach first takes a set of 3-D volumetric modeling primitives and generates a hierarchical aspect representation based on the projected surfaces of the primitives; conditional probabilities capture the ambiguity of mappings between levels of the hierarchy. From a region segmentation of the input image, the authors present a formulation of the recovery problem based on the grouping of the regions into aspects. No domain-independent heuristics are used; only the probabilities inherent in the aspect hierarchy are exploited. Once the aspects are recovered, the aspect hierarchy is used to infer a set of volumetric primitives and their connectivity. As a front end to an object recognition system, the approach provides the indexing power of complex 3-D object-centered primitives while exploiting the convenience of 2-D viewer-centered aspect matching; aspects are used to represent a finite vocabulary of 3-D parts from which objects can be constructed.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We describe an algorithm for segmenting a 3D object into its constituent volumetric parts from a single 2D line drawing. This algorithm is part of the bottom-up line drawing description process of PARVO, a generic object recognition system. In PARVO, an object is recognized as being a member of a class defined by qualitative geometrical properties and topological structure. Similarity between different 3D views of any member of a given class is a result of building coarse part-based structural descriptions from limited information. A preliminary stage to part segmentation of an object consists of extracting viewpoint-invariant and nonaccidental features from the line drawing. The segmentation process itself is described as a hierarchical decomposition of the line drawing on the basis of pairs of high-concavity points in its silhouette. The pairing of these so-called segmentation points rests on (i) an object visibility model describing the generic structures present in any line drawing satisfying our assumptions, and (ii) the feature instances extracted from the specific line drawing analyzed. First, we discuss the properties of the line drawings in the domain of PARVO. From them, geometrical models of important line drawing features may be developed. The latter are used both as cues in the segmentation process and as precursors to the representation from which part structure is understood.},

	abstract = {COMPUTER VISION is a field of research that encompasses many objectives. A primary goal has been to construct visual sensors that can provide general-purpose robots with the same information about their surroundings as we receive from our own visual senses. This book takes an important step towards this goal by describing a working computer vision system named SCERPO. This system can recognize known three-dimensional objects in ordinary black-and-white images taken from unknown viewpoints, even when parts of the object are undetectable or hidden from view. A second major goal of computer vision re­ search is to provide a computational understanding of human vision. The research presented in this book has many implica­ tions for our understanding of human vision, particularly in the areas of perceptual organization and knowledge-based recogni­ tion. An attempt has been made to relate each computational result to the relevant areas in the psychology of vision. Since the material is meant to be accessible to a wide range of inter­ disciplinary readers, the book is written in plain language and attempts to explain most concepts from the starting position of the non-specialist. vii viii PREFACE One of the most important conclusions ansmg from this research is that visual recognition can commonly be achieved directly from the two-dimensional image without any prelim­ inary reconstruction of depth information or surface orienta­ tion from the visual input.},

	abstract = {A computer vision system has been implemented that can recognize three-dimensional objects from unknown viewpoints in single gray-scale images. Unlike most other approaches, the recognition is accomplished without any attempt to reconstruct depth information bottom-up from the visual input. Instead, three other mechanisms are used that can bridge the gap between the two-dimensional image and knowledge of three-dimensional objects. First, a process of perceptual organization is used to form groupings and structures in the image that are likely to be invariant over a wide range of viewpoints. Second, a probabilistic ranking method is used to reduce the size of the search space during model-based matching. Finally, a process of spatial correspondence brings the projections of three-dimensional models into direct correspondence with the image by solving for unknown viewpoint and model parameters. A high level of robustness in the presence of occlusion and missing data can be achieved through full application of a viewpoint consistency constraint. It is argued that similar mechanisms and constraints form the basis for recognition in human vision.},

Here, a geometry based approach is used for recognition, i.e. matching objects from a database. Unknown objects are autonomously modeled and added to the recognition database. Next-Best-View planning is performed both for recognition and modeling. Moreover, 3D measurements are merged in a Probabilistic Voxel Space, which is utilized for planning collision free paths, minimal occlusion views, and verifying the poses of the recognized objects against all previous information.

Compared to traditional approaches based on point descriptors, which depend on local information around points, we propose a novel method that creates a global model description based on oriented point pair features and matches that model locally using a fast voting scheme. The global model description consists of all model point pair features and represents a mapping from the point pair feature space to the model, where similar features on the model are grouped together. Such representation allows using much sparser object and scene point clouds, resulting in very fast performance. Recognition is done locally using an efﬁcient voting scheme on a reduced two-dimensional search space.},

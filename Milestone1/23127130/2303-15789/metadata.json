    "abstract": "Small-scale flickering buoyant diffusion flames in externally swirling flows were computationally investigated with a particular interest in identifying and characterizing various distinct dynamical behaviors of the flame oscillators under different swirling flow conditions. By varying the external swirl, six distinct flame dynamical modes, such as the flickering flame, the oscillating flame, the steady flame, the lifted flame, the spiral flame, and the flame with a vortex bubble, were computationally identified in both physical and phase spaces and analyzed from the perspective of vortex dynamics. Specifically, the frequency of buoyancy-induced flame flicker nonlinearly increases with the swirling intensity in the weak swirl regime. Further increasing the swirling intensity causes the vortex shedding to occur either around the flame tip or downstream of the flame, and the flame stops flickering but oscillates with small amplitude or stays in a steady state. A sufficiently high swirling intensity locally extinguishes the flame at its base, leading to a lifted flame. In addition, the spiral mode and the vortex-bubble mode were found for the flame at large swirl angles. Through establishing the phase portrait for featuring the flow in flames, the dynamical behaviors are presented and compared in phase space.",

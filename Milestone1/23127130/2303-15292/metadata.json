    "abstract": "Solid-state cooling based on i-caloric effects may be an alternative to conventional vapor-compression refrigeration systems. The adiabatic temperature change ($ΔT_{S}$) is one of the parameters that characterize the i-caloric effects, therefore it is important to obtain the correct $ΔT_{S}$ values and, whenever possible, to correlate this parameter with thermodynamic and microscopic quantities. In this work, we propose a comprehensive thermodynamic model that allows us to determine the adiabatic temperature change from non-adiabatic measurements of temperature change induced by a field change. Our model fits efficiently temperature versus time and temperature change versus the inverse of the field change rate data for three different materials presenting different i-caloric effects. The results indicate the present model is a very useful and robust tool to obtain the correct $ΔT_{S}$ values and to correlate $ΔT_{S}$ with other thermodynamic quantities.",

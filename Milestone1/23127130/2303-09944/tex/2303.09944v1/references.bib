Here, we demonstrate that EPR in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) allows for probing the bonding and charge state of alkali metal atoms on an ultrathin magnesium oxide layer on a Ag substrate. We observe a magnetic moment of 1 μB for Li2, LiNa, and Na2 dimers corresponding to spin radicals with a charge state of +1e. Single alkali atoms have the same charge state and no magnetic moment. The ionization of the adsorbates is attributed to charge transfer through the oxide to the metal substrate. Our work highlights the potential of EPR-STM to provide insight into dopant atoms that are relevant for the control of the electrical properties of surfaces and nanodevices.},

ESR spectra measured in molecular systems, however, are established on large ensembles of spins and usually require a complicated structural analysis. Recently, the combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy with ESR has proved to be a powerful tool to image and coherently control individual atomic spins on surfaces. Here we extend this technique to single coordination complexes—iron phthalocyanines (FePc)—and investigate the magnetic interactions between their molecular spin with either another molecular spin (in FePc–FePc dimers) or an atomic spin (in FePc–Ti pairs). We show that the molecular spin density of FePc is both localized at the central Fe atom and also distributed to the ligands (Pc), which yields a strongly molecular-geometry-dependent exchange coupling.},

Tailored nanostructures can be built with atomic precision using scanning tunneling microscopes, but quantum-coherent driving has thus far been limited to a spin in the tunnel junction. Here we show the ability to drive and detect the spin resonance of a remote spin using the electric field from the tip and a single-atom magnet placed nearby. Read-out was achieved via a weakly coupled second spin in the tunnel junction that acted as a quantum sensor. We simultaneously and independently drove the sensor and remote spins by two radio frequency voltages in double resonance experiments, which provides a path to quantum-coherent multi-spin manipulation in customized spin structures on surfaces.},

        abstract = {Coulomb-blockade phenomena and quantum fluctuations are studied in mesoscopic metallic tunnel junctions with high charging energies. If the resistance of the barriers is large compared to the quantum resistance, transport can be described by sequential tunneling. Here we study the influence of quantum fluctuations. They are strong when the resistance is small or the temperature is very low. A real-time approach is developed that allows the diagrammatic classification of resonant tunneling processes where different electrons tunnel coherently back and forth between the leads and the metallic island. With the help of a nonperturbative resummation technique we evaluate the spectral density, which describes the charge excitations of the system. From it, physical quantities of interest such as current and average charge can be deduced. Our main conclusions are as follows: An energy renormalization leads to a logarithmic temperature dependence of the renormalized system parameters. A finite lifetime broadening can change the classical picture drastically. It gives rise to a strong flattening of the Coulomb oscillations for low resistances, but in the Coulomb-blockade regime inelastic electron cotunneling persists. The effects become important at temperatures that are accessible in experiments.},

Diverse phenomena, such as control of tunneling, higher harmonic generation, manipulation of the population dynamics and the interplay between the driven tunneling dynamics and dissipative eﬀects are discussed. In the presence of strong driving ﬁelds or ultrafast processes, well-established approximations such as perturbation theory or the rotating wave approximation have to be abandoned. A variety of tools suitable for tackling the quantum dynamics of explicitly time-dependent Schro¨dinger equations are introduced. On the other hand, a real-time path integral approach to the dynamics of a tunneling particle embedded in a thermal environment turns out to be a powerful method to treat in a rigorous and systematic way the combined eﬀects of dissipation and driving. A selection of applications taken from the ﬁelds of chemistry and physics are discussed, that relate to the control of chemical dynamics and quantum transport processes, and which all involve driven tunneling events. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Abstract Dopant atoms are ubiquitous in semiconductor technologies, providing the tailored electronic properties that underpin the modern digital information era. Harnessing the quantum nature of these atomic-scale objects represents a new and exciting technological revolution. In this article, the use of ion-implanted donor spins in silicon for quantum technologies is described. It is reviewed how to fabricate and operate single-atom spin qubits in silicon, obtaining some of the most coherent solid-state qubits, and pathways to scale up these qubits to build large quantum processors are discussed. Heavier group-V donors with large nuclear spins display electric quadrupole couplings that enable nuclear electric resonance, quantum chaos, and strain sensing. Donor ensembles can be coupled to microwave cavities to develop hybrid quantum Turing machines. Counted, deterministic implantation of single donors, combined with novel methods for precision placement, will allow the integration of individual donor spins with industry-standard silicon fabrication processes, making implanted donors a prime physical platform for the second quantum revolution.},

abstract = {The development of electron spin resonance (ESR) combined with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STM) is undoubtedly one of the main experimental breakthroughs in surface science of the last decade thanks to joining the extraordinarily high energy resolution of ESR (nano-eV scale) with the single-atom spatial resolution of STM (sub-Ångström scale). While the experimental results have significantly grown with the number of groups that have succeeded in implementing the technique, the physical mechanism behind it is still unclear, with several different mechanisms proposed to explain it. Here, we start by revising the main characteristics of the experimental setups and observed features. Then, we review the main theoretical proposals, with both their strengths and weaknesses. One of our conclusions is that many of the proposed mechanisms share the same basic principles, the time-dependent electric field at the STM junction is modulating the coupling of the spin-polarized transport electrons with the local spin. This explains why these mechanims are essentially equivalent in a broad picture. We analyze the subtle differences between some of them and how they compare with the different experimental observations.}

abstract = { Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most information-rich analytical techniques available. However, it is also inherently insensitive, and this drawback precludes the application of NMR spectroscopy to mass- and volume-limited samples. We review a particular approach to increase the sensitivity of NMR experiments, namely the use of miniaturized coils. When the size of the coil is reduced, the sample volume can be brought down to the nanoliter range. We compare the main coil geometries (solenoidal, planar, and microslot/stripline) and discuss their applications to the analysis of mass-limited samples. We also provide an overview of the hyphenation of microcoil NMR spectroscopy to separation techniques and of the integration with lab-on-a-chip devices and microreactors. }

However, these methods are built on the electronic structure of the system as computed by density functional theory (DFT). This theory has important limitation for open-shell systems. As a matter of fact, an open-shell molecule on a metallic substrate can lead to correlations among the electrons of the metal. This gives rise to the Kondo effect. Hence, we briefly present a method to implement STM image simulations including the Kondo effect. },

	abstract = {We introduce a systematic approximation for an efficient evaluation of Born–Markov master equations for steady state transport studies in open quantum systems out of equilibrium: the energy resolved master equation approach. The master equation is formulated in the eigenbasis of the open quantum system and build successively by including eigenstates with increasing grandcanonical energies. In order to quantify convergence of the approximate scheme we introduce quality factors to check preservation of trace, positivity and hermiticity. Furthermore, we discuss different types of master equations that go beyond the commonly used secular approximation in order to resolve coherences between quasi-degenerate states. For the discussion of complete positivity we introduce a canonical Redfield–Bloch master equation and compare it to a previously derived master equations in Lindblad form with and without using the secular approximation. The approximate scheme is benchmarked for a six orbital quantum system which shows destructive quantum interference under the application of a bias voltage. The energy resolved master equation approach presented here makes quantum transport calculations in many-body quantum systems numerically accessible also beyond six orbitals with a full Hilbert space of the order of ∼106.}

	abstract = {Magnetism at low dimensions is a thriving field of research with exciting opportunities in technology. This Colloquium focuses on the properties of 1D magnetic systems on solid surfaces. From the emulation of 1D quantum phases to the potential realization of Majorana edge states, spin chains are unique systems to study. The advent of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) based techniques has permitted us to engineer spin chains in an atom-by-atom fashion via atom manipulation and to access their spin states on the ultimate atomic scale. Here the current state of research on spin correlations and dynamics of atomic spin chains as studied by the STM is presented. After a brief review of the main properties of spin chains on solid surfaces, spin chains are classified according to the coupling of their magnetic moments with the holding substrate. This classification scheme takes into account that the nature and lifetimes of the spin-chain excitations intrinsically depend on the holding substrate. Interest is shown of using insulating layers on metals, which generally results in an increase in the spin state’s lifetimes such that their quantized nature gets evident and they are individually accessible. Next shown is the use of semiconductor substrates promising additional control through the tunable electron density via doping. When the coupling to the substrate is increased for spin chains on metals, the substrate conduction electron mediated interactions can lead to emergent exotic phases of the coupled spin chain-substrate conduction electron system. A particularly interesting example is furnished by superconductors. Magnetic impurities induce states in the superconducting gap. Because of the extended nature of the spin chain, the in-gap states develop into bands that can lead to the emergence of 1D topological superconductivity and consequently to the appearance of Majorana edge states. Finally, an outlook is given on the use of spin chains in spintronics, quantum communication, quantum computing, quantum simulations, and quantum sensors.},

  abstract={Combining electron paramagnetA_P_Jauho_2006ic resonance (EPR) with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) enables detailed insight into the interactions and magnetic properties of single atoms on surfaces. A requirement for EPR-STM is the efficient coupling of microwave excitations to the tunnel junction. Here, we achieve a coupling efficiency of the order of unity by using a radio-frequency antenna placed parallel to the STM tip, which we interpret using a simple capacitive-coupling model. We further demonstrate the possibility to perform EPR-STM routinely above 4 K using amplitude as well as frequency modulation of the radio-frequency excitation. We directly compare different acquisition modes on hydrogenated Ti atoms and highlight the advantages of frequency and magnetic-field sweeps as well as amplitude and frequency modulation in order to maximize the EPR signal. The possibility to tune the microwave-excitation scheme and to perform EPR-STM at relatively high temperature and high power opens this technique to a broad range of experiments, ranging from pulsed EPR spectroscopy to coherent spin manipulation of single-atom ensembles. }

Recently, EPR combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) achieved single-spin sensitivity with sub-angstrom spatial resolution. The excitation mechanism of EPR in STM, however, is broadly debated, raising concerns about widespread application of this technique. We present an extensive experimental study and modeling of EPR-STM of Fe and hydrogenated Ti atoms on a MgO surface. Our results support a piezoelectric coupling mechanism, in which the EPR species oscillate adiabatically in the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the STM tip. An analysis based on Bloch equations combined with atomic-multiplet calculations identifies different EPR driving forces. Specifically, transverse magnetic field gradients drive the spin-1/2 hydrogenated Ti, whereas longitudinal magnetic field gradients drive the spin-2 Fe. Also, our results highlight the potential of piezoelectric coupling to induce electric dipole moments, thereby broadening the scope of EPR-STM to nonpolar species and nonlinear excitation schemes.},

Excitation of the paramagnetic dangling bond into a superposition of states will lead to charge-density oscillations, which add a time-dependent term to the tunneling barrier. The nonlinear dependence of the tunneling current on the barrier shape will give rise to a Larmor frequency component in the tunneling current. It is shown how the signal should be affected by different parameters, such as the relative orientations between the tunneling electrons and the dangling bond or the initial spin excitation. Possibilities that will be opened with this technique, as well as the questions that will have to be resolved, are discussed. }

	abstract = {Recent studies of molecules on surface by the use of tunneling electrons of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are reviewed. Characteristic features of tunneling current of STM are used not only for real space imaging with an atomic resolution but also are utilized for chemical analysis of a single molecule and manipulation of a molecule with controlled excitation of their vibration modes. As promising candidates of chemical analysis at a single molecule level, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) researches are discussed. The A_P_Jauho_2006mechanism of vibration excitation in STM-IETS is compared with that in high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HR-EELS). Successful observations of vibration modes of molecules such as C–H stretching mode are introduced. At the same time, expected increase of the importance of resonant scattering mechanism in STM-IETS compared with the conventional IETS is examined, whose mechanism assumes the trapping of tunneling electrons in the adsorbate resonant state and the formation of temporary negative ions. Next, applications of tunneling electrons to the manipulations of adsorbates are discussed focusing on the phenomena induced by vibrational excitations. STM has a unique character of high current density, which cannot be obtained with conventional sources. The similarity between the vibration excitation with the high current of STM and the phenomenon known as desorption induced by multielectron transfer (DIMET) are discussed. Surface phenomena such as desorption, hopping, rotation and chemical reactions are excited as a consequence of sequential climbing of ladders of a vibrational mode formed in the potential well. The intrinsic high current of STM tunneling currentA_P_Jauho_2006 enables such multiple excitations in a more controllable manner than the use of photogenerated hot electrons, and is expected to make a contribution to the understanding of elemental processes of surface phenomena.},

For these purposes, we construct a realistic Anderson model, solve it by using the finite-temperature exact diagonalization method, and compare the calculated one-particle spectral functions with the LDA+U densities of states. In contrast to Mn/CuN and Fe/CuN, the cobalt system tends to form the electronic excitations at the Fermi level. Based on the calculated magnetic response functions, transverse relaxation times for the magnetic moments of impurity orbitals are estimated. To study the effect of the dynamical correlations on the exchange interaction in nanoclusters, we solve the two-impurity Anderson model for the Mn dimer on the CuN surface. It is found that the experimental exchange interaction can be well reproduced by employing U=3 eV, which is two times smaller than the value used in static mean-field LDA+U calculations. This suggests an important role of dynamical correlations in the interaction between adatoms on a surface. To estimate the correlated exchange interaction in the general case we derive a simple and transparent analytical expression demonstrating that the renormalization of the electronic spectrum due to dynamical correlations leads to a rescaling of the magnetic interactions compared to density functional results.}

In the past decade, detailed investigations have been performed on a great variety of molecular switches, including mechanically interlocked switches (rotaxanes and catenanes), redox-active molecules and photochromic switches (e.g. azobenzenes and diarylethenes). To probe these molecules, both individually and in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), a broad set of methods have been developed. These range from low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) via two-terminal break junctions to larger scale SAM-based devices. It is generally found that the electronic coupling between molecules and electrodes has a profound influence on the properties of such molecular junctions. For example, an intrinsically switchable molecule may lose its functionality after it is contacted. Vice versa, switchable two-terminal devices may be created using passive molecules ('extrinsic switching'). Developing a detailed understanding of the relation between coupling and switchability will be of key importance for both future research and technology.},

We will overview some important aspects of these subfields. The most advanced ideas in the field involve the use of molecules as individual logic or memory units and are broadly based on using the quantum state space of the molecule. Current work in molecular electronics usually addresses molecular junction transport, where the molecule acts as a barrier for incoming electrons: This is the fundamental Landauer idea of “conduction as scattering” generalized to molecular junction structures. Another point of view in terms of superexchange as a guiding mechanism for coherent electron transfer through the molecular bridge is discussed. Molecules generally exhibit relatively strong vibronic coupling. The last section of this overview focuses on vibronic effects, including inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, hysteresis in junction charge transport, and negative differential resistance in molecular transport junctions.},

  abstract={The recent development of all-electrical electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) setup has opened the door to vast applications. Despite the fast-growing number of experimental works on STM-ESR, the fundamental principles remain unclear. By using a cotunneling picture, we show that the spin resonance signal can be explained as a time-dependent variation of the tunnel barrier induced by the alternating electric driving field. We demonstrate how this variation translates into the resonant frequency response of the direct current. Our cotunneling theory explains the main experimental findings. Namely, the linear dependence of the Rabi flop rate with the alternating bias amplitude, the absence of resonant response for spin-unpolarized currents, and the weak dependence on the actual atomic species.}

abstract = { Scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy, and more recently, single-atom electron spin resonance, have allowed the direct observation of electron dynamics at the atomic limit. The interpretation of data is strongly dependent on model Hamiltonians. However, fitting effective spin Hamiltonians to experimental data lacks the ability to explore a vast number of potential systems of interest. By using plane-wave density functional theory as starting point, we build a multiplet Hamiltonian making use of maximally localized Wannier functions. The Hamiltonian contains spin–orbit and electron–electron interactions needed to obtain the relevant spin dynamics. The resulting reduced Hamiltonian is solved by exact diagonalization. We compare three prototypical cases of 3d transition metals Mn (total spin S = 5/2), Fe (S = 2), and Co (S = 3/2) on MgO with experimental data and find that our calculations can accurately predict the spin orientation and anisotropy of the magnetic adatom. Our method does not rely on experimental input and allows us to explore and predict the fundamental magnetic properties of adatoms on surfaces. }

Theoretical investigation of population and community dynamics in periodic environments has been hampered by the lack of mathematical tools relative to equilibrium systems. Here, I describe one such mathematical tool that has been rarely used in the ecological literature but has widespread use: Floquet theory. Floquet theory is the study of the stability of linear periodic systems in continuous time. Floquet exponents/multipliers are analogous to the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrices of equilibrium points. In this paper, I describe the general theory, then give examples to illustrate some of its uses: it defines fitness of structured populations, it can be used for invasion criteria in models of competition, and it can test the stability of limit cycle solutions. I also provide computer code to calculate Floquet exponents and multipliers}

   abstract={The statistical mechanics of periodically driven ("Floquet") systems in contact with a heat bath exhibits some radical differences from the traditional statistical mechanics of undriven systems. In Floquet systems all quasienergies can be placed in a finite frequency interval, and the number of near degeneracies in this interval grows without limit as the dimension N of the Hilbert space increases. This leads to pathologies, including drastic changes in the Floquet states, as N increases. In earlier work these difficulties were put aside by fixing N, while taking the coupling to the bath to be smaller than any quasienergy difference. This led to a simple explicit theory for the reduced density matrix, but with some major differences from the usual time independent statistical mechanics. We show that, for weak but finite coupling between system and heat bath, the accuracy of a calculation within the truncated Hilbert space spanned by the N lowest energy eigenstates of the undriven system is limited, as N increases indefinitely, only by the usual neglect of bath memory effects within the Born and Markov approximations. As we seek higher accuracy by increasing N, we inevitably encounter quasienergy differences smaller than the system-bath coupling. We therefore derive the steady state reduced density matrix without restriction on the size of quasienergy splittings. In general, it is no longer diagonal in the Floquet states. We analyze, in particular, the behavior near a weakly avoided crossing, where quasienergy near degeneracies routinely appear. The explicit form of our results for the denisty matrix gives a consistent prescription for the statistical mechanics for many periodically driven systems with N infinite, in spite of the Floquet state pathologies. }

  abstract={We report on a theoretical study of magnetic transitions induced by tunneling electrons in individual adsorbed M-Phthalocyanine (M-Pc) molecules where M is a metal atom: Fe-Pc on a Cu(110)(2×1)-O surface and Co-Pc layers on Pb(111) islands. The magnetic transitions correspond to the change in orientation of the spin angular momentum of the metal ion with respect to the surroundings and possibly an applied magnetic field. The adsorbed Fe-Pc system is studied with a density-functional-theory-transport approach showing that (i) the magnetic structure of the Fe atom in the adsorbed Fe-Pc is quite different from that of the free Fe atom or of other adsorbed Fe systems and (ii) that injection of electrons (holes) into the Fe atom in the adsorbed Fe-Pc molecule dominantly involves the Fe 3dz2 orbital. These results fully specify the magnetic structure of the system and the process responsible for magnetic transitions. The dynamics of the magnetic transitions induced by tunneling electrons is treated in a strong-coupling approach. The Fe-Pc treatment is extended to the Co-Pc case. The present calculations accurately reproduce the strength of the magnetic transitions as observed by magnetic inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy experiments; in particular, the dominance of the inelastic current in the conduction of the adsorbed M-Pc molecule is accounted for. }

abstract={  When deriving a master equation for a multipartite weakly-interacting open quantum systems, dissipation is often addressed locally on each component, i.e. ignoring the coherent couplings, which are later added ‘by hand’. Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to be thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a consistent global master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis of the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node ‘quantum wire’ connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME are obtained and benchmarked against the exact result. Importantly, in our model, the validity of the GME is constrained by the underlying secular approximation. Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes), we observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a) predicts the correct steady state, (b) yields with the exact asymptotic heat currents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In contrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node coupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the global and local approach may be viewed as complementary tools, best suited to different parameter regimes. }

  abstract={  A Floquet-Liouville supermatrix (FLSM) approach is presented for nonperturbative treatment of the time development of the density-matrix operator of atoms and molecules exposed to intense polychromatic fields. By extending the many-mode Floquet theory (MMFT) recently developed, the time-dependent Liouville equation for the density matrix of quantum systems undergoing relaxations (due to radiative decays and collisional dampings, etc.) can be transformed into an equivalent time-independent non-Hermitian FLSM eigenvalue problem. This yields a numerically stable and computationally efficient approach for the unified treatment of nonresonant and resonant, one- and multiple-photon, steady-state and transient phenomena in nonlinear optical processes, much beyond the conventional rotating-wave-approximation (RWA) method. Connections of the FLSM approach to the MMFT in the limit of zero relaxations are also made, providing the understanding of the physical significance of FLSM supereigenvalues and eigenvectors. In addition to the exact FLSM formalism, we have also presented higher-order perturbative results, based on the extension of the generalized Van Vleck (GVV) nearly degenerate perturbation theory, appropriate for somewhat weaker fields and near-resonant processes, but beyond the RWA limit. The implementation of the GVV method in the time-independent Floquet-Liouvillian allows the reduction of the infinite-dimensional FLSM into a finite-dimensional GVV-Liouville matrix, from which essential analytical results are readily obtained. As an illustration of the usefulness of the new formalism, we extend both the FLSM and the GVV methods to a formal study of the multiphoton-induced resonance fluorescence spectra of two-level systems subject to purely radiation relaxations. Both the time-averaged power spectrum and the time-dependent physical spectrum are exploited in details, and novel new features in intense fields are pointed out. }

	abstract = {The study of quantum thermal machines, and more generally of open quantum systems, often relies on master equations. Two approaches are mainly followed. On the one hand, there is the widely used, but often criticized, local approach, where machine sub-systems locally couple to thermal baths. On the other hand, in the more established global approach, thermal baths couple to global degrees of freedom of the machine. There has been debate as to which of these two conceptually different approaches should be used in situations out of thermal equilibrium. Here we compare the local and global approaches against an exact solution for a particular class of thermal machines. We consider thermodynamically relevant observables, such as heat currents, as well as the quantum state of the machine. Our results show that the use of a local master equation is generally well justified. In particular, for weak inter-system coupling, the local approach agrees with the exact solution, whereas the global approach fails for non-equilibrium situations. For intermediate coupling, the local and the global approach both agree with the exact solution and for strong coupling, the global approach is preferable. These results are backed by detailed derivations of the regimes of validity for the respective approaches.}

At the heart of the mechanism, periodic transient charging and electric polarization due to the rf-modulated tunneling process cause a periodic asymmetric deformation of the adsorbed qudot, enabling efficient spin transitions via spin-phonon-like coupling.

The effective lateral resolution is related to the tip radius R and the vacuum gap distance d approximately as [(2 Å)(R+d)]1/2. The theory is applied to the 2×1 and 3×1 reconstructions of Au(110); results for the respective corrugation amplitudes and for the gap distance are all in excellent agreement with experimental results of Binnig et al. if a 9-Å tip radius is assumed. In addition, a convenient approximate calculational method based on atom superposition is tested; it gives reasonable agreement with the self-consistent calculation and with experiment for Au(110). This method is used to test the structure sensitivity of the microscope. We conclude that for the Au(110) measurements the experimental ‘‘image’’ is relatively insensitive to the positions of atoms beyond the first atomic layer. Finally, tunneling to semiconductor surfaces is considered. Calculations for GaAs(110) illustrate interesting qualitative differences from tunneling to metal surfaces.}

NMR, the resonant control of nuclear spins, is a powerful tool for probing local magnetic environments in condensed matter systems, which range from magnetic ordering in high-temperature superconductors7,8 and spin liquids9 to quantum magnetism in nanomagnets10,11. Increasing the sensitivity of NMR to the single-atom scale is challenging as it requires a strong polarization of nuclear spins, well in excess of the low polarizations obtained at thermal equilibrium, as well as driving and detecting them individually4,5,12. Strong nuclear spin polarization, known as hyperpolarization, can be achieved through hyperfine coupling with electron spins2. The fundamental mechanism is the conservation of angular momentum: an electron spin flips and a nuclear spin flops. The nuclear hyperpolarization enables applications such as in vivo magnetic resonance imaging using nanoparticles13, and is harnessed for spin-based quantum information processing in quantum dots14 and doped silicon15,16,17. Here we polarize the nuclear spins of individual copper atoms on a surface using a spin-polarized current in a scanning tunnelling microscope. By employing the electron–nuclear flip-flop hyperfine interaction, the spin angular momentum is transferred from tunnelling electrons to the nucleus of individual Cu atoms. The direction and magnitude of the nuclear polarization is controlled by the direction and amplitude of the current. The nuclear polarization permits the detection of the NMR of individual Cu atoms, which is used to sense the local magnetic environment of the Cu electron spin. }

	abstract = {Spin resonance of individual spin centers allows applications ranging from quantum information technology to atomic-scale magnetometry. To protect the quantum properties of a spin, control over its local environment, including energy relaxation and decoherence processes, is crucial. However, in most existing architectures, the environment remains fixed by the crystal structure and electrical contacts. Recently, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in combination with electron spin resonance (ESR), allowed the study of single adatoms and inter-atomic coupling with an unprecedented combination of spatial and energy resolution. We elucidate and control the interplay of an Fe single spin with its atomic-scale environment by precisely tuning the phase coherence time T2 using the STM tip as a variable electrode. We find that the decoherence rate is the sum of two main contributions. The first scales linearly with tunnel current and shows that, on average, every tunneling electron causes one dephasing event. The second, effective even without current, arises from thermally activated spin-flip processes of tip spins. Understanding these interactions allows us to maximize T2 and improve the energy resolution. It also allows us to maximize the amplitude of the ESR signal, which supports measurements even at elevated temperatures as high as 4 K. Thus, ESR-STM allows control of quantum coherence in individual, electrically accessible spins.},

Here, we engineered the magnetic interactions between the electron spins of two spin-1/2 atoms to create a {\textquotedblleft}clock transition{\textquotedblright} and thus enhance their spin coherence. To construct and electrically access the desired spin structures, we use atom manipulation combined with electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope. We show that a two-level system composed of a singlet state and a triplet state is insensitive to local and global magnetic field noise, resulting in much longer spin coherence times compared with individual atoms. Moreover, the spin decoherence resulting from the interaction with tunneling electrons is markedly reduced by a homodyne readout of ESR. These results demonstrate that atomically precise spin structures can be designed and assembled to yield enhanced quantum coherence.},

  abstract={Spin resonance provides the high-energy resolution needed to determine biological and material structures by sensing weak magnetic interactions1. In recent years, there have been notable achievements in detecting2 and coherently controlling3,4,5,6,7 individual atomic-scale spin centres for sensitive local magnetometry8,9,10. However, positioning the spin sensor and characterizing spin–spin interactions with sub-nanometre precision have remained outstanding challenges11,12. Here, we use individual Fe atoms as an electron spin resonance (ESR) sensor in a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure the magnetic field emanating from nearby spins with atomic-scale precision. On artificially built assemblies of magnetic atoms (Fe and Co) on a magnesium oxide surface, we measure that the interaction energy between the ESR sensor and an adatom shows an inverse-cube distance dependence (r−3.01±0.04). This demonstrates that the atoms are predominantly coupled by the magnetic dipole–dipole interaction, which, according to our observations, dominates for atom separations greater than 1 nm. This dipolar sensor can determine the magnetic moments of individual adatoms with high accuracy. The achieved atomic-scale spatial resolution in remote sensing of spins may ultimately allow the structural imaging of individual magnetic molecules, nanostructures and spin-labelled biomolecules. }

  abstract={The latest concepts for quantum computing and data storage rely on the addressing and manipulation of single spins. A limitation for single atoms or molecules in contact with a metal surface is the short lifetime of excited spin states, typically picoseconds, due to the exchange of energy and angular momentum with the itinerant electrons of the substrate1,2,3,4. Here we show that paramagnetic molecules on a superconducting substrate exhibit excited spin states with a lifetime of τ≈10 ns. We ascribe this increase in lifetime by orders of magnitude to the depletion of electronic states around the Fermi level in the superconductor. This prohibits pathways of energy relaxation into the substrate and allows the magnetic molecule to be electrically pumped into higher spin states, making superconducting substrates prime candidates for spin manipulation. We further show that the proximity of the scanning tunnelling microscope tip modifies the magnetic anisotropy. }

In the first step we calculate the electronic structure employing standard density functional theory (DFT), based on generalized gradient approximation (GGA), using plane waves as a basis set. The corresponding basis of atomic-like maximally localized Wannier functions is derived and used to represent the DFT Hamiltonian, resulting in a tight-binding model for the atomic orbitals of the magnetic impurity. The third step is to solve, by exact numerical diagonalization, the N electron problem in the open shell of the magnetic atom, including both effects of spin–orbit and Coulomb repulsion. Finally, the low energy sector of this multi-electron Hamiltonian is mapped into effective spin models that, in addition to the spin matrices S , can also include the orbital angular momentum L when appropriate. We successfully apply the method to Fe in MgO, considering both the undistorted and Jahn–Teller (JT) distorted cases. Implications for the influence of Fe impurities on the performance of magnetic tunnel junctions based on MgO are discussed.}

We use DFT to compare the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of different transition metal adatoms on the surface. We find that the average occupation of the transition metal d shell, main contributor to the magnetic moment, is not quantized, in contrast with the quantized spin in the model Hamiltonians that successfully describe spin excitations in this system. In order to reconcile these two pictures, we build a zero bandwidth multi-orbital Anderson Hamiltonian for the d shell of the transition metal hybridized with the p orbitals of the adjacent nitrogen atoms, by means of maximally localized Wannier function representation of the DFT Hamiltonian. The exact solutions of this model have quantized total spin, without quantized charge at the d shell. We propose that the quantized spin of the models actually belongs to many-body states with two different charge configurations in the d shell, hybridized with the p orbital of the adjacent nitrogen atoms. This scenario implies that the measured spin excitations are not fully localized at the transition metal. }

Transport pump and probe techniques with spin polarized tips permit measuring the spin relaxation time T1, while novel demonstration of electrically driven STM single spin resonance has provided a direct measurement of the spin coherence time T2 of an individual magnetic adatom. Here we address the problem of spin decoherence from the theoretical point of view. First we provide a short general overview of decoherence in open quantum systems and we discuss with some detail ambiguities that arise in the case of degenerate spectra, relevant for magnetic atoms. Second, we address the physical mechanisms that allows probing the spin coherence of magnetic atoms on surfaces. Third, we discuss the main spin decoherence mechanisms at work on a surface, most notably, Kondo interaction, but also spin–phonon coupling and dephasing by Johnson noise. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications in the broader context of quantum technologies.}

The same exchange interactions induce the so-called RKKY indirect exchange interaction between two otherwise decoupled local spins. Here, we show that both the spin relaxation and the RKKY coupling can be seen as the dissipative and reactive response to the coupling of the local spins with the itinerant electrons. We thereby predict that the spin relaxation rates of magnetic nanostructures of exchanged coupled local spins, such as nanoengineered spin chains, have an oscillatory dependence on kFd, where kF is the Fermi wave number and d is the interspin distance, very much like the celebrated oscillations in the RKKY interaction. We demonstrate that both T1 and T2 can be enhanced or suppressed, compared to the single-spin limit, depending on the interplay between the Fermi surface and the nanostructure geometrical arrangement. Our results open a route to engineer spin relaxation and decoherence in atomically designed spin structures. }

However, scattering of electrons and phonons with the nanomagnet leads its state to have incoherent classical dynamics and might cause fast loss of the encoded information. Recently, it has been understood that such scattering obeys certain selection rules due to the symmetries of the system. By analyzing the point-group symmetry of the surface, the time-reversal symmetry and the magnitude of the adatom effective spin, we identify which nanomagnet configurations are to be avoided and which are promising to encode a stable bit. A new tool of investigation is introduced and exploited: the quasispin quantum number. By means of this tool, our results are easily generalized to a broad class of bipartite cluster configurations where adatoms are coupled through Heisenberg-like interactions. Finally, to make contact with the experiments, numerical simulations have been performed to show how such stable configurations respond to typical scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. }

Electron-electron interactions increase the relaxation rate by the Stoner factor squared. We attribute the large anisotropic enhancements of the relaxation rate observed recently in multilayers containing palladium to this mechanism.

We quantify this interaction by comparing our measurements to a quantum magnetic model and ab-initio calculations yielding a map of the chiral ground states of pairs of atoms depending on the interatomic separation.

So far, the smallest individually addressable bistable magnetic bits have consisted of 3–12 atoms1, 2, 3. Long magnetic relaxation times have been demonstrated for single lanthanide atoms in molecular magnets4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, for lanthanides diluted in bulk crystals13, and recently for ensembles of holmium (Ho) atoms supported on magnesium oxide ({M}g{O})14. These experiments suggest a path towards data storage at the atomic limit, but the way in which individual magnetic centres are accessed remains unclear. Here we demonstrate the reading and writing of the magnetism of individual Ho atoms on {M}g{O}, and show that they independently retain their magnetic information over many hours. We read the Ho states using tunnel magnetoresistance15, 16 and write the states with current pulses using a scanning tunnelling microscope. The magnetic origin of the long-lived states is confirmed by single-atom electron spin resonance17 on a nearby iron sensor atom, which also shows that Ho has a large out-of-plane moment of 10.1 ± 0.1 Bohr magnetons on this surface. To demonstrate independent reading and writing, we built an atomic-scale structure with two Ho bits, to which we write the four possible states and which we read out both magnetoresistively and remotely by electron spin resonance. The high magnetic stability combined with electrical reading and writing shows that single-atom magnetic memory is indeed possible.}

	abstract = {An important goal in molecular magnetism is to create a permanent magnet from a single atom. Metal atoms adsorbed on surfaces can develop strong magnetization in an applied field (paramagnetism). Donati et al. show that single holmium atoms adsorbed on a magnesium oxide film grown on a silver substrate show residual magnetism for temperatures up to 30 K and bistabilty that lasts for 1500 s at 10 K (see the Perspective by Khajetoorians and Heinrich). The atom avoids spin relaxation by a combination of quantum-state symmetry and by the oxide film preventing the spin from interacting with the underlying metal via tunneling.Science, this issue p. 318; see also p. 296A permanent magnet retains a substantial fraction of its saturation magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field. Realizing magnetic remanence in a single atom allows for storing and processing information in the smallest unit of matter. We show that individual holmium (Ho) atoms adsorbed on ultrathin {M}g{O}(100) layers on Ag(100) exhibit magnetic remanence up to a temperature of 30 kelvin and a relaxation time of 1500 seconds at 10 kelvin. This extraordinary stability is achieved by the realization of a symmetry-protected magnetic ground state and by decoupling the Ho spin from the underlying metal by a tunnel barrier.},

	abstract={The ability to manipulate single atoms has opened up the door to constructing interesting and useful quantum structures from the ground up1. On the one hand, nanoscale arrangements of magnetic atoms are at the heart of future quantum computing and spintronic devices2, 3; on the other hand, they can be used as fundamental building blocks for the realization of textbook many-body quantum models4, illustrating key concepts such as quantum phase transitions, topological order or frustration as a function of system size. Here, we use low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy to construct arrays of magnetic atoms on a surface, designed to behave like spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chains in a transverse field, for which a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase is predicted in the thermodynamic limit5. Site-resolved measurements on these finite-size realizations reveal a number of sudden ground state changes when the field approaches the critical value, each corresponding to a new domain wall entering the chains. We observe that these state crossings become closer for longer chains, suggesting the onset of critical behaviour. Our results present opportunities for further studies on quantum behaviour of many-body systems, as a function of their size and structural complexity. }

abstract = {Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) was performed on single molecules with a variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope. The peak intensity, width, position, and line shape of single molecule vibrational spectra were studied as a function of temperature, modulation bias, bias polarity, and tip position for the (C?H,C?D) stretching vibration of acetylene (C2H2,C2D2) on Cu(001). The temperature broadening of vibrational peaks was found to be a consequence of Fermi smearing as in macroscopic IETS. The modulation broadening of vibrational peaks assumed the expected form for IETS. Extrapolation of the peak width to zero temperature and modulation suggested an intrinsic width of ? 4 meV due primarily to instrumental broadening. The inelastic tunneling cross section at negative bias was reduced by a factor of 1.7 for the C?H stretch mode. Low energy modes of other molecules did not show such a reduction. There was no evidence of a tip-induced Stark shift in the peak positions. The spatial variation of the inelastic signal was measured to determine the junction stability necessary for the acquisition of single molecule vibrational spectra. }

 abstract= {Chirality is a fascinating phenomenon that can manifest itself in subtle ways, for example in biochemistry (in the observed single-handedness of biomolecules1) and in particle physics (in the charge-parity violation of electroweak interactions2). In condensed matter, magnetic materials can also display single-handed, or homochiral, spin structures. This may be caused by the Dzyaloshinskii?Moriya interaction, which arises from spin?orbit scattering of electrons in an inversion-asymmetric crystal field3, 4. This effect is typically irrelevant in bulk metals as their crystals are inversion symmetric. However, low-dimensional systems lack structural inversion symmetry, so that homochiral spin structures may occur5. Here we report the observation of magnetic order of a specific chirality in a single atomic layer of manganese on a tungsten (110) substrate. Spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals that adjacent spins are not perfectly antiferromagnetic but slightly canted, resulting in a spin spiral structure with a period of about 12 nm. We show by quantitative theory that this chiral order is caused by the Dzyaloshinskii?Moriya interaction and leads to a left-rotating spin cycloid. Our findings confirm the significance of this interaction for magnets in reduced dimensions. Chirality in nanoscale magnets may play a crucial role in spintronic devices, where the spin rather than the charge of an electron is used for data transmission and manipulation. For instance, a spin-polarized current flowing through chiral magnetic structures will exert a spin-torque on the magnetic structure6, 7, causing a variety of excitations or manipulations of the magnetization8, 9 and giving rise to microwave emission, magnetization switching, or magnetic motors. }

The statistics of the photons emitted by the quantum dot reflect the quantum fluctuations of the localized spin interacting with the injected carriers.

A phenomenological model is proposed to quantitatively describe these observations, allowing a measurement of the spin dynamics of an individual magnetic atom at zero magnetic field. These results demonstrate the existence of an efficient spin-relaxation channel arising from a spin exchange with individual carriers surrounding the quantum dot. A theoretical description of a spin-flip mechanism involving spin exchange with surrounding carriers gives relaxation times in good agreement with the measured dynamics. }

The compounds are isomorphous to each other. The compounds have metal centers (M = Tb3+, Dy3+, and Y3+) sandwiched by two Pc ligands via eight isoindole-nitrogen atoms in a square-antiprism fashion. The twist angle between the two Pc ligands is 41.4�. Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to investigate the compounds adsorbed on a Au(111) surface, deposited by using the thermal evaporation in ultrahigh vacuum. Both MPc2 with eight lobes and MPc with four lobes, which has lost one Pc ligand, were observed. In the scanning tunneling spectroscopy images of TbPc molecules at 4.8 K, a Kondo peak with a Kondo temperature (TK) of 250 K was observed near the Fermi level (V = 0 V). On the other hand, DyPc, YPc, and MPc2 exhibited no Kondo peak. To understand the observed Kondo effect, the energy splitting of sublevels in a crystal field should be taken into consideration. As the next step in our studies on the SMM/Kondo effect in Tb-Pc derivatives, we investigated the electronic transport properties of Ln-Pc molecules as the active layer in top- and bottom-contact thin-film organic field effect transistor devices. Tb-Pc molecule devices exhibit p-type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility (?H) of 10?4 cm2 V?1 s?1. Interestingly, the Dy-Pc based devices exhibited ambipolar semiconducting properties with an electron mobility (?e) of 10?5 and a ?H of 10?4 cm2 V?1 s?1. This behavior has important implications for the electronic structure of the molecules. }

abstract = "The advent of milli-kelvin scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) with inbuilt magnetic fields has opened access to the study of magnetic phenomena with atomic resolution at surfaces. In the case of single atoms adsorbed on a surface, the existence of different magnetic energy levels localized on the adsorbate is due to the breaking of the rotational invariance of the adsorbate spin by the interaction with its environment, leading to energy terms in the meV range. These structures were revealed by \{STM\} experiments in \{IBM\} Almaden in the early 2000s for atomic adsorbates on CuN surfaces. The experiments consisted in the study of the changes in conductance caused by inelastic tunneling of electrons (IETS, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy). Manganese and Iron adatoms were shown to have different magnetic anisotropies induced by the substrate. More experiments by other groups followed up, showing that magnetic excitations could be detected in a variety of systems: e.g. complex organic molecules showed that their magnetic anisotropy was dependent on the molecular environment, piles of magnetic molecules showed that they interact via intermolecular exchange interaction, spin waves were excited on ferromagnetic surfaces and in Mn chains, and magnetic impurities have been analyzed on semiconductors. These experiments brought up some intriguing questions: the efficiency of magnetic excitations was very high, the excitations could or could not involve spin flip of the exciting electron and singular-like behavior was sometimes found at the excitation thresholds. These facts called for extended theoretical analysis; perturbation theories, sudden-approximation approaches and a strong coupling scheme successfully explained most of the magnetic inelastic processes. In addition, many-body approaches were also used to decipher the interplay between inelastic processes and the Kondo effect. Spin torque transfer has been shown to be effective in changing spin orientations of an adsorbate in theoretical works, and soon after it was shown experimentally. More recently, the previously mentioned strong coupling approach was extended to treat the excitation of spin waves in atomic chains and the ubiquitous role of electron?hole pair creation in de-exciting spins on surfaces has been analyzed. This review article expounds these works, presenting the theoretical approach by the authors while trying to thoroughly review parallel theoretical and experimental works. "

excitation transfers energy between two X-ray beams in a time
shorter than the synchrotron pulse width of about 100 ps. Gigahertz
modulation of the diffracted X-rays is also observed. We
report different geometric arrangements, such as a switch based
on the collision of two counter-propagating acoustic pulses: this
doubles the X-ray modulation frequency, and also provides a
means of observing a localized transient strain inside an opaque
material. We expect that these techniques could be scaled to
produce subpicosecond pulses, through laser-generated coherent
optical phonon modulation of X-ray diffraction in crystals. Such
ultrafast capabilities have been demonstrated thus far only in
laser-generated X-ray sources, or through the use of X-ray streak

The model assumes a realistic parametrization of the potential created by the surface and a d3z2-r2 orbital for the description of the adsorbate. Fano line shapes associated with the Kondo resonance are found to be sensitive to details of the adsorbate-substrate interaction. For instance, bringing the adsorbate closer to the surface leads to more asymmetric line shapes while their dependence on the tip distance is weak. We find that it is important to use a realistic surface potential to properly include the tunneling matrix elements to the tip and to use substrate states which are orthogonal to the adsorbate and tip states. An application of our model to Co adsorbed on Cu explains the difference in the line shapes observed between Cu(100) and Cu(111) surfaces.}

By a certain approximation, there appear long range exchange type interactions between d-electron spins and, in certain conditions both ferro- and antiferromagnetism appear. The excitations of spin wave modes are the same as those in the ordinary modes of the short range exchange force, viz, the energy of the spin wave excitations is proportional to q2 for ferromagnetism and q for antiferromagnetism in the region of small wave vector q. The T3/2 law for the temperature dependence of the magnetization of ferromagnetism is applicable up to very high temperatures, and this result is in good agreement with the results of experiments on metallic ferromagnetism.}

the spin voltage generated from a temperature gradient in a

at distances far from the sample ends, and spins can be extracted
from every position on the magnet simply by attaching a metal.
The spin Seebeck effect observed here is directly applicable to the
production of spin-voltage generators, which are crucial for driving

Our model is characterized by single electron tunneling between electrodes represented by free electron reservoirs through a system characterized by its electron levels, nuclear vibrations and their structures.

The temperature of an electron gas is determined by this distribution: refrigeration is equivalent to narrowing it, and thermometry is probing its convolution with a function characterizing the measuring device. Temperature exists, strictly speaking, only in quasiequilibrium in which the distribution follows the Fermi-Dirac form. Interesting nonequilibrium deviations can occur due to slow relaxation rates of the electrons, e.g., among themselves or with lattice phonons. Observation and applications of nonequilibrium phenomena are also discussed. The focus in this paper is at low temperatures, primarily below 4  K, where physical phenomena on mesoscopic scales and hybrid combinations of various types of materials, e.g., superconductors, normal metals, insulators, and doped semiconductors, open up a rich variety of device concepts. This review starts with an introduction to theoretical concepts and experimental results on thermal properties of mesoscopic structures. Then thermometry and refrigeration are examined with an emphasis on experiments. An immediate application of solid-state refrigeration and thermometry is in ultrasensitive radiation detection, which is discussed in depth.

A method for dynamical simulation of inelastic electron–ion interactions in nanoscale conductors is applied to a model system consisting of an adatom bonded to an atomic wire. It is found that the vibrational energy of such a system may decrease under bias, and furthermore that, as the bias is increased, the rate of cooling, within certain limits, will increase. This phenomenon can be understood qualitatively through low-order perturbation theory, and is due to the presence of an anti-resonance in the transmission function of the system at the Fermi level. Such current-assisted cooling may act as a stabilization mechanism, and may form the basis for a nanoscale cooling 'fan'.}

Experimentally, the crossover between these regimes can be explored by looking for signatures of quantum-mechanical behaviour—such as tunneling—in macroscopic systems1. Magnetic systems (such as small grains, spin glasses and thin films) are often investigated in this way2–12 because transitions between different magnetic states can be closely monitored. But transitions between states can be induced by thermal fluctuations, as well as by tunnelling, and definitive identification of macroscopic tunnelling events in these complex systems is therefore difficult13. Here we report the results of low-temperature experiments on a single crystal composed of super-paramagnetic manganese clusters (Mn12-ac), which clearly demonstrate the existence of quantum-mechanical tunnelling of the bulk magnetization. In an applied magnetic field, the magnetization shows hysteresis loops with a distinct 'staircase' structure: the steps occur at values of the applied field where the energies of different collective spin states of the manganese clusters coincide. At these special values of the field, relaxation from one spin state to another is enhanced above the thermally activated rate by the action of resonant quantum-mechanical tunnelling. These observations corroborate the results of similar experiments performed recently on a system of oriented crystallites made from a powdered sample4.}

and MPc2 exhibited no Kondo peak. To understand the observed Kondo effect, the energy splitting of
sublevels in a crystal field should be taken into consideration. As the next step in our studies on the SMM/
Kondo effect in Tb-Pc derivatives, we investigated the electronic transport properties of Ln-Pc molecules
as the active layer in top- and bottom-contact thin-film organic field effect transistor devices. Tb-Pc molecule
devices exhibit p-type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility (μH) of ∼10-4 cm2 V-1 s-1. Interestingly,
the Dy-Pc based devices exhibited ambipolar semiconducting properties with an electron mobility (μe) of
∼10-5 and a μH of ∼10-4 cm2 V-1 s-1. This behavior has important implications for the electronic structure
of the molecules.}

to the change of orientation of the spin angular momentum of the metal ion with respect to the

a Density Functional Theory (DFT) transport approach showing that i) the magnetic structure

It it shown that the tunneling conductance can be partitioned into three separate contributions, a background conductance which is independent of the local spin, a dynamical conductance which is proportional to the local-spin moment, and a conductance which is proportional to the noise spectrum of the local-spin interactions. The presented theory is applicable to setups with magnetic tip and substrate in noncollinear arrangement, as well as for nonmagnetic situations. The partitioning of the tunneling current suggests a possibility to extract the total spin moment of the local spin from the dynamical conductance. The dynamical conductance suggests a possibility to generate very high-frequency spin-dependent ac currents and/or voltages. We also propose a measurement of the dynamical conductance that can be used to determine the character of the effective exchange interaction between individual spins in clusters. The third contribution to the tunneling current is associated with the spin-spin correlations induced by the exchange interaction between the local-spin moment and the tunneling electrons. We demonstrate how this term can be used in the analysis of spin excitations recorded in conductance measurements. Finally, we propose to use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy for detailed studies of the spin-excitation spectrum.}

However, it can be misleading in magnetic nanostructures consisting of separate magnetic atoms adsorbed on the surface of a non-magnetic material. Here, an atomically precise map of the magnetic coupling between individual adatoms in pairs is measured and directly compared with first-principles calculations, proving that RKKY interaction is strongly directional.

The model has a quantum phase transition which separates regions of a doublet and a singlet ground state. The limits of integer valence of the STAM (which include a model similar to the underscreened spin-1 Kondo model) are derived and used to predict the behavior of the conductance through the system on both sides of the transition, where it jumps abruptly. At a special quantum critical line, the STAM can be mapped to an infinite- U ordinary Anderson model (OAM) plus a free spin 1/2. We use this mapping to obtain the spectral densities of the STAM as a function of those of the OAM at the transition. Using the non-crossing approximation (NCA), we calculate the spectral densities and conductance through the system as a function of temperature and bias voltage, and determine the changes that take place at the quantum phase transition. The separation of the spectral density into a singlet and a triplet part allows us to shed light on the underlying physics and to explain a shoulder observed recently in the zero bias conductance as a function of temperature in transport measurements through a single fullerene molecule (Roch et al 2008 Nature 453 633).

To probe these molecules, both individually and in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), a broad set of methods have been developed. These range from low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) via two-terminal break junctions to larger scale SAM-based devices. It is generally found that the electronic coupling between molecules and electrodes has a profound influence on the properties of such molecular junctions. For example, an intrinsically switchable molecule may lose its functionality after it is contacted. Vice versa, switchable two-terminal devices may be created using passive molecules ('extrinsic switching'). Developing a detailed understanding of the relation between coupling and switchability will be of key importance for both future research and technology.}

problem whereby a spin current interacts with a ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain, to eventually reverse the
magnetization of the chain. Spin flips are accomplished through both elastic and inelastic scattering. A consequence
of the inelastic-scattering channel, when it is no longer energetically possible, is the occurrence of a
nonequilibrium bound state, which is an emergent property of the coupled local plus itinerant spin system. For
certain definite parameter values the itinerant spin lingers near the local spins for some time, before eventually
leaking out as an outwardly diffusing state. This phenomenon results in spin-flip dynamics and filtering

  abstract = 	 {Magnetic impurities in solids cause manifold changes in their macroscopic properties, such as anomalous low temperature resistance due to Kondo screening, reduction of the superconducting transition temperature due to local suppression of the order parameter, they create magnetic signatures in semiconductors, and lead to inelastic spin excitations in tunnel junctions. In the present paper we review what has been learnt about these effects from a surface science approach. Placing the magnetic impurities at well defined adsorption sites on single crystal surfaces makes their effect on the host, as well as their own magnetic properties better accessible to experiments, and also better understandable since the atomic environment of the impurity is exactly known lending comparison with theory more direct. After an introduction we discuss X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements which are spatially averaging and therefore report on ensemble properties. One of the recent progresses achieved in surface science is the preparation of well defined ensembles, such as surfaces with only single adatoms, each of them in an identical atomic environment and with sufficient mutual distance to exclude interactions. Due to this approach we can now determine the electronic configuration of individual adatoms, their hybridization with the host, and quantify their spin and orbital moments, as well as the spin–orbit induced magneto-crystalline anisotropy, which can be orders of magnitude larger than thin film and bulk values. In the second part we review recent progress in revealing the magnetic properties of individual atoms with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). With this technique the spatial extent of the Kondo screening cloud and of subgap excitations in the superconductor quasiparticle density of states became apparent. We outline the first pioneering experiments measuring transport through reversible atomic point contacts containing magnetic atoms and measurements using the subgap features caused in superconducting STM tips to detect the magnetism of individual atoms. We then describe experiments using inelastic spin excitation spectroscopy to pin down the magnetic ground state and anisotropy energy of magnetic impurities. We continue with spin-polarized STM experiments reporting magnetization curves of individual magnetic adatoms and finish by a description of the most recent spin-excitation experiments revealing the necessary anisotropy environment for a high spin impurity to display the Kondo effect.}

These have been intensively investigated for their rich quantum behaviour4 but no magnetic hysteresis has been so far reported for monolayers of SMMs on various non-magnetic substrates, most probably owing to the chemical instability of clusters on surfaces5. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism synchrotron-based techniques, pushed to the limits in sensitivity and operated at sub-kelvin temperatures, we have now found that robust, tailor-made Fe4 complexes retain magnetic hysteresis at gold surfaces. Our results demonstrate that isolated SMMs can be used for storing information.

However, we also illustrate the possibility of ultrafast quantum coherent switching via adiabatic evolution. The switching speeds are numerically calculated and found to be tens of picoseconds or less for a single cell. The effect of decoherence is also simulated in the form of a dephasing process and limits are estimated for operation with finite dephasing.

  abstract={Continuous-wave (cw) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at both X-band and W-band frequencies, pulsed-EPR, and pulsed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) were used to study phosphorus shallow donors in 3C-, 4H-, and 6H-SiC doped with phosphorus (P) during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth. In 3C-SiC, a spectrum with D2d symmetry and the principal g values, g‖=2.0051, g⊥=2.0046, was detected. The 31P hyperfine (hf) constants of the center, A‖=0.53  MHz and A⊥=−0.13  MHz, were determined from pulsed-ENDOR measurements. A doublet with C3v symmetry (g‖=2.0065, g⊥=2.0006, and 31P hf constants A‖=8.24  MHz, A⊥=5.89  MHz) was detected in P-doped 4H-SiC. In the 6H polytype, the same P1 and P2 doublets [Greulich-Weber, Phys. Status Solidi A 162, 95 (1997)] or dPh, dPc1, and dPc2 doublets [Baranov et al., Phys. Rev. B 66, 165206 (2002)] previously reported in material doped with P by neutron transmutation were detected. Our cw-EPR, two-dimensional EPR, and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) results confirm that the dPc1 and dPc2 doublets are related to different allowed and forbidden transitions of the P2 center with S=1∕2 and I=1∕2. Based on the observed 31P hf interaction (for three polytypes) and the 13C hf interaction with nearest neighbors (for 4H- and 6H-SiC), the P-related spectra are assigned to the ground states of the isolated shallow P at Si site. The valley-orbit splitting of the shallow P donors was estimated from the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time and of the cw-EPR signal intensities. Based on the ab initio supercell calculations of the spin localizations on the P atom and the nearest C neighbors in 4H-SiC and the similarity between the spectra in the 4H and 6H polytypes, we reassign the spectrum in 4H-SiC to the shallow P donor at the quasicubic site (Pk) and the two doublets P1 and P2 in 6H-SiC to the shallow P donors at two quasicubic sites, Pk1 and Pk2, respectively.}

 abstract={Using a semiempirical molecular-orbital technique, incorporating Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, the structure and properties of the common aggregates of nitrogen atoms in diamond have been investigated. Nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been examined in the same way, showing that, as is observed, it is energetically favorable for the nitrogen to form aggregates and for the vacancies to be trapped at the nitrogen, whatever its state of aggregation. The activation energy for migration of the vacancy was found to be 2.4 eV, in close agreement with experiment, and the processes by which the nitrogen complexes trap vacancies were modeled. The mechanisms involved in the migration of the single nitrogen atom and its aggregation to form pairs are explored. It is found that a vacancy-assisted mechanism has an activation energy of 4.5 eV, and a direct atomic exchange of the nitrogen with its carbon neighbor has an energy of 6.3 eV. These values straddle the experimental estimate of 5 eV and would indicate why radiation damage enhances the nitrogen aggregation. The mechanisms involved in the further aggregation of nitrogen pairs to form well-defined clusters of four nitrogen atoms were also modeled, and an activation energy of 7–8 eV found.}

Coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond was used to gain insight into its local environment. We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.}

The observed dynamics are well explained by analytics and numerical simulations, leading to valuable insight into the loss of coherence in spin systems.

Surface state electrons on a copper(111) surface were confined to closed structures (corrals) defined by barriers built from iron adatoms. The barriers were assembled by individually positioning iron adatoms with the tip of a 4-kelvin scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A circular corral of radius 71.3 � was constructed in this way out of 48 iron adatoms. Tunneling spectroscopy performed inside of the corral revealed a series of discrete resonances, providing evidence for size quantization. STM images show that the corral's interior local density of states is dominated by the eigenstate density expected for an electron trapped in a round two-dimensional box. }

A xenon atom is moved reversibly between stable positions on each of two stationary conducting 'leads', corresponding to the STM tip and a nickel surface. The state of the switch is set (that is, the xenon atom is moved to the desired location) by the application of a voltage pulse of the appropriate sign across the leads. The state of the switch is identified by measuring the conductance across the leads. This switch is a prototype of a new class of potentially very small electronic devices which we will call atom switches.}

The principal effect of temperature is to broaden the observed spectral lines which can be accounted for quantitatively by considering the thermal smearing of the electron distribution in metals. Two detailed interaction mechanisms are discussed which can give rise to infrared dipole or Raman selection rules. None of the experiments carried out thus far can distinguish between these two processes, because of the low symmetry of the molecules used.

Elementary processes of the mode-selective control of different motions are also discussed in conjunction with a recent experimental result of lateral hopping and desorption of a single NH3 molecule on Cu(100). Although still at a premature stage, these novel phenomena open a new world of "nano-surface-science," in which the manipulation and reaction of single adsorbates, and synthesis of a new molecular system are realized by a selective excitation of the relevant vibrational mode by tunneling electrons with an STM.}

  abstract = 	 {We study the effects of the exchange interaction between an adsorbed magnetic atom with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy and the conduction-band electrons from the substrate. We model the system using an anisotropic Kondo model and we compute the impurity spectral function, which is related to the differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra measured using a scanning tunneling microscope. To make contact with the known experimental results for iron atoms on the CuN/Cu(100) surface (Hirjibehedin et al 2007 Science 317 1199), we calculated the spectral functions in the presence of an external magnetic field of varying strength applied along all three spatial directions. It is possible to establish an upper bound on the coupling constant J: in the range of the magnetic fields for which the experimental results are currently known (up to 7 T), the low-energy features in the calculated spectra agree well with the measured dI/dV spectra if the exchange coupling constant J is at most half as large as that for cobalt atoms on the same surface. We show that for an even higher magnetic field (between 8 and 9 T) applied along the 'hollow direction', the impurity energy states cross, giving rise to a Kondo effect which takes the form of a zero-bias resonance. The coupling strength J could be determined experimentally by performing tunneling spectroscopy in this range of magnetic fields. On the technical side, the paper introduces an approach for calculating the expectation values of global spin operators and all the components of the impurity magnetic susceptibility tensor (including the out-of-diagonal ones) in numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations with no spin symmetry. An appendix contains a density functional theory (DFT) study of the Co and Fe adsorbates on the CuN/Cu(100) surface: we compare magnetic moments, as well as orbital energies, occupancies, centers and spreads, by calculating the maximally localized Wannier orbitals of the adsorbates.}

abstract ={The importance to the mechanism of ferromagnetism of exchange interaction between conduction electrons and unfilled inner shell electrons (called s-d interaction) has been pointed out by Zener. Especially for rare earth metals, this interaction seems to be the only mechanism which can cause ferro- and antiferromagnetism. However Zener's works are unsatisfactory because his model is phenomenological and moreover does not involve antiferromagnetism and spin wave mode.Our paper considers this s-d interaction on a more rigorous basis. By a certain approximation, there appear long range exchange type interactions between d-electron spins and, in certain conditions both ferro- and antiferromagnetism appear. The excitations of spin wave modes are the same as those in the ordinary modes of the short range exchange force, viz, the energy of the spin wave excitations is proportional to q2 for ferromagnetism and q for antiferromagnetism in the region of small wave vector q. The T3/2 law for the temperature dependence of the magnetization of ferromagnetism is applicable up to very high temperatures, and this result is in good agreement with the results of experiments on metallic ferromagnetism.},

  abstract= {A simple scheme, capable of treating transport in molecular junctions in the language of many-body states, is presented. By introducing an ansatz in Liouville space, similar to the generalized Kadanoff-Baym approximation, a quantum master equation (QME)-like expression is derived starting from the exact equation of motion for Hubbard operators. Using an effective Liouville space propagation, a dressing similar to the standard diagrammatic one is proposed. The scheme is compared to the standard QME approach and its applicability to transport calculations is discussed.}

  abstract= {The system of several (N) quantum dots coupled in parallel to the same single-mode conduction channel can be modeled as a single-channel N-impurity Anderson model. Using the generalized Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we show that near the particle-hole symmetric point, the effective Hamiltonian in the local moment regime is the N-impurity S=1∕2 Kondo model. The conduction-band-mediated RKKY exchange interaction between the dots is ferromagnetic and at intermediate temperatures locks the moments into a maximal spin S=N∕2 ground state. We provide an analytical estimate for the RKKY interaction. At low temperatures the spin is partially screened by the conduction electrons to N∕2−1∕2 due to the Kondo effect. By comparing accurate numerical renormalization group results for magnetic susceptibility of the N-impurity Anderson model to the exact Bethe ansatz results of a S=N∕2 SU(2) Kondo system we show that at low-temperature the quantum dots can be described by the effective S=N∕2 Kondo model. Moreover, the Kondo temperature is independent of the number of impurities N. We demonstrate the robustness of the spin N∕2 ground state as well as of the associated S=N∕2 Kondo effect by studying the stability of the system with respect to various experimentally relevant perturbations. We finally explore various quantum phase transitions driven by these perturbations.}

abstract ={The transport properties of a linear structure of three quantum dots, with the central one connected to leads, are studied using the logarithmic discretization embedded cluster approximation. It is shown that the side dot spins can be ferromagnetically (F) or antiferromagnetically (AF) correlated between them, depending on the charge at the central dot. The system possesses a regime of coexistence of a two stage Kondo effect and the F phase. Ferromagnetism destroys the Kondo ground state when the system is driven to the molecular regime by increasing the interdot interaction above the largest Kondo temperature. Instead, an AF ground state does not compete with the Kondo regime. This remarkable behavior indicates that the measurement of the conductance can be an efficient readout procedure when the system operates as a quantum gate. }

  abstract = {The spatial length of the Kondo screening is still a controversial issue related to Kondo physics. While renormalization-group and Bethe-Ansatz solutions have provided detailed information about the thermodynamics of magnetic impurities, they are insufficient to study the effect on the surrounding electrons, i.e., the spatial range of the correlations created by the Kondo effect between the localized magnetic moment and the conduction electrons. The objective of this work is to present a quantitative way of measuring the extension of these correlations by studying their effect directly on the local density of states (LDOS) at arbitrary distances from the impurity. The numerical techniques used, the embedded cluster approximation, the finite-U slave bosons, and numerical renormalization group, calculate the Green?s functions in real space. With this information, one can calculate how the local density of states away from the impurity is modified by its presence, below and above the Kondo temperature, and then estimate the range of the disturbances in the noninteracting Fermi sea due to the Kondo effect, and how it changes with the Kondo temperature TK. The results obtained agree with results obtained through spin-spin correlations, showing that the LDOS captures the phenomenology of the Kondo cloud as well.}

For strong electron-boson coupling, we find that the tunneling conductance as a function of bias voltage is characterized by a large and dense set of resonances. Their magnetic field dependence in the large-field regime is linear, with slopes of the same sign. Both features are in agreement with recent tunneling experiments.}

However, dopants in semiconductors so far have not been studied by magnetically sensitive techniques with atomic resolution that correlate the atomic structure with the dopant’s magnetism. Here we show electrical excitation and read-out of a spin associated with a single magnetic dopant in a semiconductor host. We use spin-resolved scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the spin excitations and the magnetization curve of individual iron surface-dopants embedded within a two-dimensional electron gas confined to an indium antimonide (110) surface. The dopants act like isolated quantum spins the states of which are governed by a substantial magnetic anisotropy that forces the spin to lie in the surface plane. This result is corroborated by our first principles calculations. The demonstrated methodology opens new routes for the investigation of sample systems that are more widely studied in the field of spintronics—that is, Mn in GaAs (ref. 5), magnetic ions in semiconductor quantum dots3, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond6 and phosphorus spins in silicon7.}

abstract = {Digital magnetic recording is based on the storage of a bit of information in the orientation of a magnetic system with two stable ground states. Here we address two fundamental problems that arise when this is done on a quantized spin: quantum spin tunneling and backaction of the readout process. We show that fundamental differences exist between integer and semi-integer spins when it comes to both reading and recording classical information in a quantized spin. Our findings imply fundamental limits to the miniaturization of magnetic bits and are relevant to recent experiments where a spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscope reads and records a classical bit in the spin orientation of a single magnetic atom. }

Lett. 103, 176601 (2009) and Phys. Rev. B 81, 165423 (2010)], we compute the excitation rates by a tunneling current for all the Mn spin states. A rate equation approach permits us to simulate the experimental results by Loth and co-workers [Nat.

Our simulations give us insight into the spin dynamics, in particular, in the way polarized electrons can reveal the existence of an excited-state population. In addition, it reveals that the excitation process occurs in a way very different from the deexcitation one. Indeed, while excitation by tunneling electrons proceeds via the s and p electrons of the adsorbate, deexcitation mainly involves the d electrons.}

We show how a scanning tunneling microscope can measure electron spin relaxation times of individual atoms adsorbed on a surface using an all-electronic pump-probe measurement scheme. The spin relaxation times of individual Fe-Cu dimers were found to vary between 50 and 250 nanoseconds. Our method can in principle be generalized to monitor the temporal evolution of other dynamical systems.}

 abstract={The monitoring of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator on which a classical force acts is important in a variety of high-precision experiments, such as the attempt to detect gravitational radiation. This paper reviews the standard techniques for monitoring the oscillator, and introduces a new technique which, in principle, can determine the details of the force with arbitrary accuracy, despite the quantum properties of the oscillator. The standard method for monitoring the oscillator is the "amplitude-and-phase" method (position or momentum transducer with output fed through a narrow-band amplifier). The accuracy obtainable by this method is limited by the uncertainty principle ("standard quantum limit"). To do better requires a measurement of the type which Braginsky has called "quantum nondemolition." A well known quantum nondemolition technique is "quantum counting," which can detect an arbitrarily weak classical force, but which cannot provide good accuracy in determining its precise time dependence. This paper considers extensively a new type of quantum nondemolition measurement—a "back-action-evading" measurement of the real part X1 (or the imaginary part X2) of the oscillator's complex amplitude. In principle X1 can be measured "arbitrarily quickly and arbitrarily accurately," and a sequence of such measurements can lead to an arbitrarily accurate monitoring of the classical force. The authors describe explicit Gedanken experiments which demonstrate that X1 can be measured arbitrarily quickly and arbitrarily accurately. In these experiments the measuring apparatus must be coupled to both the position (position transducer) and the momentum (momentum transducer) of the oscillator, and both couplings must be modulated sinusoidally. For a given measurement time the strength of the coupling determines the accuracy of the measurement; for arbitrarily strong coupling the measurement can be arbitrarily accurate. The "momentum transducer" is constructed by combining a "velocity transducer" with a "negative capacitor" or "negative spring." The modulated couplings are provided by an external, classical generator, which can be realized as a harmonic oscillator excited in an arbitrarily energetic, coherent state. One can avoid the use of two transducers by making "stroboscopic measurements" of X1, in which one measures position (or momentum) at half-cycle intervals. Alternatively, one can make "continuous single-transducer" measurements of X1 by modulating appropriately the output of a single transducer (position or momentum), and then filtering the output to pick out the information about X1 and reject information about X2. Continuous single-transducer measurements are useful in the case of weak coupling. In this case long measurement times are required to achieve good accuracy, and continuous single-transducer measurements are almost as good as perfectly coupled two-transducer measurements. Finally, the authors develop a theory of quantum nondemolition measurement for arbitrary systems. This paper (Paper I) concentrates on issues of principle; a sequel (Paper II) will consider issues of practice.}

  abstract = 	 {Electrons in a single sheet of graphene behave quite differently from those in traditional two-dimensional electron systems. Like massless relativistic particles, they have linear dispersion and chiral eigenstates. Furthermore, two sets of electrons centred at different points in reciprocal space (‘valleys’) have this dispersion, giving rise to valley degeneracy. The symmetry between valleys, together with spin symmetry, leads to a fourfold quartet degeneracy of the Landau levels, observed as peaks in the density of states produced by an applied magnetic field. Recent electron transport measurements have observed the lifting of the fourfold degeneracy in very large applied magnetic fields, separating the quartet into integer1, 2, 3, 4 and, more recently, fractional5, 6 levels. The exact nature of the broken-symmetry states that form within the Landau levels and lift these degeneracies is unclear at present and is a topic of intense theoretical debate7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here we study the detailed features of the four quantum states that make up a degenerate graphene Landau level. We use high-resolution scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 10 mK in an applied magnetic field to study the top layer of multilayer epitaxial graphene. When the Fermi level lies inside the fourfold Landau manifold, significant electron correlation effects result in an enhanced valley splitting for even filling factors, and an enhanced electron spin splitting for odd filling factors. Most unexpectedly, we observe states with Landau level filling factors of 7/2, 9/2 and 11/2, suggestive of new many-body states in graphene.}

A quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement minimizes this disturbance by using a particular system—detector interaction that preserves the eigenstates of a suitable operator of the quantum system. This leads to an ideal projective measurement. We present experiments in which we carry out two consecutive measurements on a quantum two-level system, a superconducting flux qubit, by probing the hysteretic behaviour of a coupled nonlinear resonator. The large correlation between the results of the two measurements demonstrates the QND nature of the readout method. The fact that a QND measurement is possible for superconducting qubits strengthens the notion that these fabricated mesoscopic systems are to be regarded as fundamental quantum objects. Our results are also relevant for quantum-information processing for protocols such as state preparation and error correction.}

In the 25-year period since its invention, the STM has helped uncover a wealth of phenomena in diverse physical systems—ranging from semiconductors2, 3 to superconductors4 to atomic and molecular nanosystems5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A severe limitation in scanning tunnelling microscopy is the low temporal resolution, originating from the diminished high-frequency response of the tunnel current readout circuitry. Here we overcome this limitation by measuring the reflection from a resonant inductor–capacitor circuit in which the tunnel junction is embedded, and demonstrate electronic bandwidths as high as 10 MHz. This approx100-fold bandwidth improvement on the state of the art translates into fast surface topography as well as delicate measurements in mesoscopic electronics and mechanics. Broadband noise measurements across the tunnel junction using this radio-frequency STM have allowed us to perform thermometry at the nanometre scale. Furthermore, we have detected high-frequency mechanical motion with a sensitivity approaching approx15 fm Hz-1/2. This sensitivity is on par with the highest available from nanoscale optical and electrical displacement detection techniques, and the radio-frequency STM is expected to be capable of quantum-limited position measurements.}

The approach leads to a time resolution 3−4 orders of magnitude faster than the measurements carried out to date, making it possible to observe fast transient conductance-switching events associated with the breakdown, re-formation, and atomic scale structural rearrangements of the contact. The study bridges the wide gap in the time scales between the molecular dynamic simulations and real world experiments, and the method may be applied to study nano- and subnanosecond processes in other nanoscale devices, such as molecular junctions.}

Particular attention is paid to the regime of intermediate molecule-lead coupling, where cotunneling effects manifest themselves in the Coulomb-blockade regime. The experimental results for the differential conductance as a function of bias, gate voltage, and external magnetic field are in agreement with our analysis of the tunneling rates and provide evidence of magnetic signatures in single-N@C60 devices arising from an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the C60 spin and the nitrogen spin.}

  abstract = 	 {Quantum metrology1 uses tools from quantum information science to improve measurement signal-to-noise ratios. The challenge is to increase sensitivity while reducing susceptibility to noise, tasks that are often in conflict. Lock-in measurement is a detection scheme designed to overcome this difficulty by spectrally separating signal from noise. Here we report on the implementation of a quantum analogue to the classical lock-in amplifier. All the lock-in operations—modulation, detection and mixing—are performed through the application of non-commuting quantum operators to the electronic spin state of a single, trapped Sr+ ion. We significantly increase its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three orders of magnitude, to more than one second. Using this technique, we measure frequency shifts with a sensitivity of 0.42 Hz Hz−1/2 (corresponding to a magnetic field measurement sensitivity of 15 pT Hz−1/2), obtaining an uncertainty of less than 10 mHz (350 fT) after 3,720 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities are limited by quantum projection noise and improve on other single-spin probe technologies2, 3 by two orders of magnitude. Our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity non-conservation4, as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single electronic spin one micrometre from an ion detector with nanometre resolution. As a first application, we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical quadrupole transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor.}

Mapping both the Hamiltonian and decoherence properties of a qubit simultaneously provides a unique image of the magnetic (or electric) field properties at the nanoscale. The resulting images are sensitive to the temporal as well as spatial variation in the fields created by the sample. As examples we theoretically study two applications; one from condensed matter physics, the other biophysics. The individual components required to realize the simplest version of this device (characterization and measurement of qubits, nanoscale positioning) have already been demonstrated experimentally.}

In the weakly coupled case the spectrum exhibits a moderate peak at the frequency of quantum (Rabi) oscillations and a Lorentzian-shape increase of the detector noise at low frequency. As the coupling increases, the spectrum transforms into a single Lorentzian corresponding to random jumps between two states. We prove that the Bayesian formalism for the selective evolution of the density matrix gives the same spectrum as the conventional master equation approach, despite the significant difference in interpretation. The effects of the detector nonideality and the finite-temperature environment are also discussed.}

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.

We sent single photons emitted by a quantum dot through a double-slit interferometer and reconstructed these trajectories by performing a weak measurement of the photon momentum, postselected according to the result of a strong measurement of photon position in a series of planes.

The bias electric field pulls the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different alloy composition. Owing to the variation of the g factor (Si:g=1.998,Ge:g=1.563), this displacement changes the spin Zeeman energy, allowing single-qubit operations. By displacing the electron even further, the overlap with neighboring qubits is affected, which allows two-qubit operations.

Heavier impurities such as bismuth in silicon (Si:Bi) could be used in conjunction with Si:P for quantum information proposals that require two separately addressable spin species12, 13, 14, 15. However, the question of whether the incorporation of the much less soluble Bi into Si leads to defect species that destroy coherence has not been addressed. Here we show that schemes involving Si:Bi are indeed feasible as the electron spin coherence time T2 is at least as long as for Si:P with non-isotopically purified silicon. We polarized the Si:Bi electrons and hyperpolarized the I=9/2 nuclear spin of 209Bi, manipulating both with pulsed magnetic resonance. The larger nuclear spin means that a Si:Bi dopant provides a 20-dimensional Hilbert space rather than the four-dimensional Hilbert space of an I=1/2 Si:P dopant.}

We detect a signal corresponding to roughly 800 μB in 2 s of integration time, without any control on the target spins, and obtain magnetic-field spectral information using dynamical decoupling techniques.

  abstract= {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques1, 2, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells3, 4, and magnetic resonance force microscopy5 has succeeded in detecting single electrons6 and small nuclear spin ensembles7. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications8. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically9, 10, even at room temperature in some systems11, 12, 13, 14. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells. }

  abstract = 	 {The nitrogen vacancy and some nickel related defects in diamond can be observed as single quantum systems in diamond by their fluorescence. The fabrication of single colour centres occurs via generation of vacancies or via controlled nitrogen implantation in the case of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre. The NV centre shows an electron paramagnetic ground and optically excited state. As a result electron and nuclear magnetic resonance can be carried out on single defects. Due to the localized nature of the electron spin wavefunction hyperfine coupling to nuclei more than one lattice constant away from the defect as dominated by dipolar interaction. As a consequence the coupling to close nuclei leads to a splitting in the spectrum which allows for optically detected electron nuclear double resonance. The contribution discusses the physics of the NV and other defect centre from the perspective of single defect centre spectroscopy.}

Using field gradients as high as 5   G/nm, we achieved a detection sensitivity equivalent to roughly two electron spins, and observed ultralong spin-lock lifetimes, as long as 20 s.

  abstract = 	 {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well known as a powerful technique for visualizing subsurface structures with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Pushing the resolution below 1 microm remains a major challenge, however, owing to the sensitivity limitations of conventional inductive detection techniques. Currently, the smallest volume elements in an image must contain at least 1012 nuclear spins for MRI-based microscopy1, or 107 electron spins for electron spin resonance microscopy2. Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) was proposed as a means to improve detection sensitivity to the single-spin level, and thus enable three-dimensional imaging of macromolecules (for example, proteins) with atomic resolution3, 4. MRFM has also been proposed as a qubit readout device for spin-based quantum computers5, 6. Here we report the detection of an individual electron spin by MRFM. A spatial resolution of 25 nm in one dimension was obtained for an unpaired spin in silicon dioxide. The measured signal is consistent with a model in which the spin is aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the effective field, with a rotating-frame relaxation time of 760 ms. The long relaxation time suggests that the state of an individual spin can be monitored for extended periods of time, even while subjected to a complex set of manipulations that are part of the MRFM measurement protocol.}

  abstract = 	 {Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) images the three-dimensional spatial distribution of resonant spins by mechanical force detection. Image reconstruction in MRFM is challenging because the resonance occurs in a strongly curved shell that extends beyond the scan range. In contrast with conventional magnetic resonance imaging, where Fourier techniques work well, the curved-shell resonant geometry inherent to MRFM requires novel reconstruction methods. Here, we show the application of iterative reconstruction in an electron spin resonance imaging experiment with 80 nm voxels. The reconstructed image has a total scan volume of 0.5 cubic micrometers, and was generated by a magnetic resonant shell with a curvature radius of 2.3 ?m. The imaged object was a paramagnetically doped solid with an obliquely tilted surface. The reconstructed image correctly identified the location and orientation of the surface, and mapped the spin distribution within the solid. Applications of MRFM include three-dimensional nanometer-scale mapping of dopant distributions in semiconductors, studies of magnetism of thin films, and spin diffusion physics. An ultimate goal of MRFM is the direct observation of molecular structure at the atomic scale}

This produced an oscillatory magnetic force between the electron spins and a nearby permanent magnet, resulting in the vibration of a cantilever on which the sample was mounted. By pulsing the microwave field prior to the force-detection sequence, nutation of the spins could be observed. Spin echoes were observed mechanically using a modified echo-pulse sequence. The decay of magnetization during cyclic adiabatic inversion was also studied and is discussed in terms of utility for future single-spin detection experiments.}

Three systems have been studied, 19F nuclei in CaF2, and 1H nuclei (protons) in both polymethylmethacrylate and collagen, a naturally occurring protein. By detecting the statistical polarization, we not only can work with relatively small ensembles, but we eliminate any need to wait a longitudinal relaxation time T1 to polarize the spins. We have also made use of the fact that the statistical polarization, which can be considered a form of spin noise, has a finite correlation time. A method similar to one previously proposed by Carlson et al. [Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 44, 541 (1999)] has been used to suppress the effect of the statistical uncertainty and extract meaningful information from time-averaged measurements. By implementing this method, we have successfully made nutation and transverse spin relaxation time measurements in CaF2 at low temperatures.}

Recent solid-state approaches have used quantum dots2, donor-atom nuclear spins3 or electron spins4; in these architectures, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable exchange interaction between spins (a Heisenberg interaction), whereas the one-qubit gates require control over a local magnetic field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower, requiring substantially greater materials and device complexity—potentially contributing to a detrimental increase in the decoherence rate. Here we introduced an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to implement exactly any quantum computer circuit. This capability comes at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits, and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards solid-state implementations of quantum computation1.}

Our theory is based on a generalization of a Hubbard model and the linear combination of harmonic orbitals combined with configuration interaction method for arbitrary magnetic fields. The few-particle spectra obtained as a function of the magnetic field exhibit Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. As a result, by changing the magnetic field, it is possible to engineer the degeneracies of single-particle levels, and thus, control the total spin of the many-electron system. For the triple dot with two and four electrons, we find oscillations of total spin due to the singlet-triplet transitions occurring periodically in the magnetic field. In the three-electron system, we find a transition from a magnetically frustrated to a spin-polarized state. We discuss the impact of these phase transitions on the addition spectrum and the spin blockade of the lateral triple quantum dot molecule.}

We show that for positive anisotropy D and for any spin S, the systems behave at low temperatures as regular Fermi liquids with fully compensated impurity spin. The approach to the stable fixed point depends on the value of the spin S and on the ratio D/TK(0), where TK(0) is the Kondo temperature in the absence of the anisotropy. For S=1, the screening occurs in two stages if D<TK(0); the second Kondo temperature is exponentially reduced in this case. More generally, there is an effective spin-1/2 Kondo effect for any integer S if D<TK(0) and for any half-integer S if D>TK(0). For negative anisotropy D, the system is a non-Fermi liquid with residual anisotropic exchange interaction. However, the presence of transverse magnetic anisotropy E(Sx2−Sy2) restores Fermi-liquid behavior in real systems.}

In the present paper we consider the possibility of deducing precise information from this spectroscopy. The low-voltage part of the spectrum (i.e., the d2I/dV2-vs-V characteristic) gives information about the phonons of the electrodes. The phonon density, which is deduced for a Mg electrode, is critically compared with the density deduced from neutron scattering. The range of this phonon probe is then studied by tunneling into multilayer electrodes. The 40-90-meV range of the characteristic of a Mg-Pb junction exhibits a specific structure due to the lattice vibrations of the insulator. This structure is compared with the infrared spectrum and the phonon density of states of {M}g{O}, as well as with a theoretical calculation of the tunneling current in the transfer-Hamiltonian formalism. From the fit obtained, it is deduced that the 30-Å-thick insulator, grown on Mg, is an oxide, in contrast with the insulator grown on Al, which was previously deduced to be a hydroxide. At higher energies (100-500 meV), the vibrational spectrum of molecules contained in the insulator region is observed. The identification of the lines is shown to be accurate and it gives precise information on these molecules, especially about their chemical binding with the insulator. This last point could be important in the future for studying the problem of adsorption on solid surfaces.}

  abstract={We review some electron transport experiments on few-electron, vertical quantum dot devices. The measurement of current versus source-drain voltage and gate voltage is used as a spectroscopic tool to investigate the energy characteristics of interacting electrons confined to a small region in a semiconducting material. Three energy scales are distinguished: the single-particle states, which are discrete due to the confinement involved; the direct Coulomb interaction between electron charges on the dot; and the exchange interaction between electrons with parallel spins. To disentangle these energies, a magnetic field is used to reorganize the occupation of electrons over the single-particle states and to induce changes in the spin states. We discuss the interactions between small numbers of electrons (between 1 and 20) using the simplest possible models. Nevertheless, these models consistently describe a large set of experiments. Some of the observations resemble similar phenomena in atomic physics, such as shell structure and periodic table characteristics, Hund's rule, and spin singlet and triplet states. The experimental control, however, is much larger than for atoms: with one device all the artificial elements can be studied by adding electrons to the quantum dot when changing the gate voltage.}

However, it is reasonable to predict that other classes of molecules will be discovered which have similar or superior properties. To do this it is necessary that synthetic chemists have a good understanding of the correlation between the structure and properties of the molecules, for this it is necessary that concepts such as quantum tunneling, quantum coherence, quantum oscillations are understood.

abstract={A theory is given for three closely related effects involving a nonmagnetic electron-tunneling barrier separating two ferromagnetic conductors. The first is Julliere’s magnetic valve effect, in which the tunnel conductance depends on the angle θ between the moments of the two ferromagnets. One finds that discontinuous change of the potential at the electrode-barrier interface diminishes the spin-polarization factor governing this effect and is capable of changing its sign. The second is an effective interfacial exchange coupling -J cosθ between the ferromagnets. One finds that the magnitude and sign of J depend on the height of the barrier and the Stoner splitting in the ferromagnets. The third is a new, irreversible exchange term in the coupled dynamics of the ferromagnets. For one sign of external voltage V, this term describes relaxation of the Landau-Lifshitz type. For the opposite sign of V, it describes a pumping action which can cause spontaneous growth of magnetic oscillations. All of these effects were investigated consistently by analyzing the transmission of charge and spin currents flowing through a rectangular barrier separating free-electron metals. In application to Fe-C-Fe junctions, the theory predicts that the valve effect is weak and that the coupling is antiferromagnetic (J<0). Relations connecting the three effects suggest experiments involving small spatial dimensions.}

But as device dimensions approach the nanometre scale, quantum effects become increasingly important for device operation, and conceptually new transistor structures may need to be adopted. A notable example of such a structure is the single-electron transistor, or SET1, 2, 3, 4. Although it is unlikely that SETs will replace FETs in conventional electronics, they should prove useful in ultra-low-noise analog applications. Moreover, because it is not affected by the same technological limitations as the FET, the SET can approach closely the quantum limit of sensitivity.

 abstract= {The monitoring of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator on which a classical force acts is important in a variety of high-precision experiments, such as the attempt to detect gravitational radiation. This paper reviews the standard techniques for monitoring the oscillator, and introduces a new technique which, in principle, can determine the details of the force with arbitrary accuracy, despite the quantum properties of the oscillator. The standard method for monitoring the oscillator is the "amplitude-and-phase" method (position or momentum transducer with output fed through a narrow-band amplifier). The accuracy obtainable by this method is limited by the uncertainty principle ("standard quantum limit"). To do better requires a measurement of the type which Braginsky has called "quantum nondemolition." A well known quantum nondemolition technique is "quantum counting," which can detect an arbitrarily weak classical force, but which cannot provide good accuracy in determining its precise time dependence. This paper considers extensively a new type of quantum nondemolition measurement—a "back-action-evading" measurement of the real part X1 (or the imaginary part X2) of the oscillator's complex amplitude. In principle X1 can be measured "arbitrarily quickly and arbitrarily accurately," and a sequence of such measurements can lead to an arbitrarily accurate monitoring of the classical force. The authors describe explicit Gedanken experiments which demonstrate that X1 can be measured arbitrarily quickly and arbitrarily accurately. In these experiments the measuring apparatus must be coupled to both the position (position transducer) and the momentum (momentum transducer) of the oscillator, and both couplings must be modulated sinusoidally. For a given measurement time the strength of the coupling determines the accuracy of the measurement; for arbitrarily strong coupling the measurement can be arbitrarily accurate. The "momentum transducer" is constructed by combining a "velocity transducer" with a "negative capacitor" or "negative spring." The modulated couplings are provided by an external, classical generator, which can be realized as a harmonic oscillator excited in an arbitrarily energetic, coherent state. One can avoid the use of two transducers by making "stroboscopic measurements" of X1, in which one measures position (or momentum) at half-cycle intervals. Alternatively, one can make "continuous single-transducer" measurements of X1 by modulating appropriately the output of a single transducer (position or momentum), and then filtering the output to pick out the information about X1 and reject information about X2. Continuous single-transducer measurements are useful in the case of weak coupling. In this case long measurement times are required to achieve good accuracy, and continuous single-transducer measurements are almost as good as perfectly coupled two-transducer measurements. Finally, the authors develop a theory of quantum nondemolition measurement for arbitrary systems. This paper (Paper I) concentrates on issues of principle; a sequel (Paper II) will consider issues of practice.}

In our development, we consider two cases. In the first, the measurement is predefined and we seek the optimal code-states. In the second, optimization is performed on both the code-states and the measurement. We show that one cannot outperform "pseudo-classical transmission," in which we transmit n symbols with orthogonal code-states, and discard the remaining symbols. However, such pseudo-classical transmission is not the only optimum. We fully characterize the collection of optimal setups, and briefly discuss the links between our findings and applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum computing}

Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface. }

An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times6 because of the weak spin?orbit coupling7 and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal8. However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible.

Spin resonance of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has been detected optically3, and spin precession of a localized electron spin on a surface was detected4, 5 using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Spins in semiconductors are particularly attractive for study because of their very long decoherence times6. Here we demonstrate electrical sensing of the magnetic resonance spin-flips of a single electron paramagnetic spin centre, formed by a defect in the gate oxide of a standard silicon transistor. The spin orientation is converted to electric charge, which we measure as a change in the source/drain channel current. Our set-up may facilitate the direct study of the physics of spin decoherence, and has the practical advantage of being composed of test transistors in a conventional, commercial, silicon integrated circuit. It is well known from the rich literature of magnetic resonance studies that there sometimes exist structural paramagnetic defects7 near the Si/SiO2 interface.

abstract= {We report the electrical induction and detection of dynamic nuclear polarization in the spin-blockade regime of double GaAs vertical quantum dots. The nuclear Overhauser field measurement relies on bias voltage control of the interdot spin exchange coupling and measurement of dc current at variable external magnetic fields. The largest Overhauser field observed was about 4 T, corresponding to a nuclear polarization ?40% for the electronic g factor typical of these devices, |g*|?0.25. A phenomenological model is proposed to explain these observations.}

Here we demonstrate such spin?orbit coupling in a carbon-nanotube quantum dot in the general multielectron regime and in the presence of finite disorder. Also, we find a systematic dependence of the spin?orbit coupling on the electron occupation of the quantum dot. Such a dependence has not been seen in any other system and follows from the curvature-induced spin?orbit-split Dirac spectrum of the underlying graphene lattice. Our findings suggest that the spin?orbit coupling is a general property of carbon-nanotube quantum dots, which should provide a unique platform for the study of spin?orbit effects and their applications.}

Recently, fast gate operations have been demonstrated in logical spin qubits composed of two electron spins where the rapid exchange of the two electrons permits electrically controllable rotations around one axis of the qubit. However, universal control of the qubit requires arbitrary rotations around at least two axes. Here, we show that by subjecting each electron spin to a magnetic field of different magnitude, we achieve full quantum control of the two-electron logical spin qubit with nanosecond operation times. Using a single device, a magnetic-field gradient of several hundred millitesla is generated and sustained using dynamic nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As nuclei. Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using quantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single- and potentially multiple-qubit operations with gate times that approach the threshold required for quantum error correction.}

Under a magnetic field, the 60 expected allowed transitions cannot be individually resolved, but the effects of the nuclear spin distribution, -9/2?Iz?9/2, are clearly observed. A strong hyperpolarization of the nuclear spin towards Iz=-9/2 is observed to result from the nonresonant optical excitation. This is very similar to the recently reported optical hyperpolarization of P donors observed by EPR at higher magnetic fields. We introduce a new model to explain this effect, and predict that it may be very fast.}

As a result, in a Si fin-type field effect transistor Kondo physics can govern transport when one electron is bound to the single dopant. Orbital (valley) degrees of freedom, apart from the standard spin, strongly modify the Kondo effect in such systems. Owing to the small size and the s-like orbital symmetry of the ground state of the dopant, these orbital degrees of freedom do not couple to external magnetic fields which allows us to tune the symmetry of the Kondo effect. Here we study this tunable Kondo effect and demonstrate experimentally a symmetry crossover from an SU(4) ground state to a pure orbital SU(2) ground state as a function of magnetic field. Our claim is supported by theoretical calculations that unambiguously show that the SU(2) symmetric case corresponds to a pure valley Kondo effect of fully polarized electrons.}

The paper discusses the instrumentation, as well as the corrections necessary to separate the TMF noise from the total noise as collected. It shows that the thermal electrical noise component of this total noise is not white, but approximately follows the small-signal resistance of a saturated sensor versus frequency. The paper gives examples of noise imaging using magnetic field sweeps and electrical bias sweeps, and interprets the results. As another application example, it shows that the signal-to-noise ratio of a GMR head does not improve if one replaces the free layer by a synthetic (double) free layer with the same net moment. It presents examples of multimode TMF spectra, together with the causes of these extra resonances: spatial standing spin waves in the free layer and pinned layer resonances. It shows how one can calculate the stiffening field, damping, and free layer dimensions (magnetically active height and width) from the TMF spectra. These parameters can be obtained in a nondestructive fashion. They are difficult to measure in other ways. }

Selected surface configurations presenting increasing densities of neutral oxygen vacancies, ranging from 12.5% to 100%, are considered, the missing oxygen being periodically distributed in the surface layer either homogeneously or in a close-packed fashion. We show that the electronic structure is characterized by occupied states in the gap which result either from the hybridization of atomiclike orbitals localized on vacancy sites, or involve surface magnesium orbitals. The latter case occurs at large vacancy concentrations, and the conditions for the apparition of metallicity in the surface layer are derived. The formation energy of oxygen vacancies is calculated as a function of the vacancy concentration and of the particular configuration. A two-body model potential is proposed to account for their interaction. The activation energy for vacancy diffusion at the surface is also computed, thus providing a complete set of parameters for a description of the thermodynamics as well as of the kinetics of oxygen vacancies on a {M}g{O}(100) surface. }

  abstract= {The electronic and atomic structures of nondashstoichiometric {M}g{O} {100} surfaces, with several densities of neutral oxygenvacancies, have been studied using a semi-empirical Hartree-Fock method associated with a geometry optimization code. The oxygenvacancies are periodically repeated in the surface top layer with equal spacings. Strong electron redistributions take place on the magnesiums which surround the vacancies and localized electron states appear in the gap below the conduction band minimum. Their positions shift towards lower and lower energies as the vacancy density increases. The energy of formation of a vacancy is found to be close to 10 eV at low densities. It strongly decreases as the oxygen deficiency grows, due to electrostatic interactions. The mechanisms responsible for the displacements of the magnesiums which surround the vacancy are analysed. }

The O-17 chemical shifts increase linearly from 47 ppm at room temperature to 57 ppm at 1300-degrees-C, and over the same temperature range the Mg-25 chemical shift increases linearly from 25 to 27 ppm. These changes are not the result of changes in the bulk magnetic susceptibility of the samples, but may be due to increased orbital overlap which is the result of the increase in thermal vibration of the ions with temperature. In the case of Mg-25, the shift to lower shielding with increasing temperature is opposite to that expected from simple bond length versus chemical shift trends established for the oxides at room temperature. If this is a general phenomenon, high-temperature NMR data may be biased to lower shielding. Spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) were measured in order to study the energetics of defect motion. T1's for O-17 and Mg-25 exhibit similar behavior over the range of temperatures studied. Up to 800-degrees-C, T1's decrease gradually, but above 800-degrees-C, T1's drop rapidly, with slopes corresponding to apparent activation energies of 192 +/- 9 kJ/mol (2.0 +/- 0.1 eV) for O-17 and 151 +/- 6 kJ/mol (1.56 +/- 0.06 eV) for Mg-25. While direct comparison of these activation energies to those derived from diffusion or conductivity measurements is complicated, the similar behavior for both nuclei suggests their relaxation phenomena are related.}

The performance of these devices is currently limited by the modest (<~70%) room-temperature tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) of technologically relevant MTJs. Much higher TMR values have been theoretically predicted for perfectly ordered (100) oriented single-crystalline Fe/{M}g{O}/Fe MTJs. Here we show that sputter-deposited polycrystalline MTJs grown on an amorphous underlayer, but with highly oriented (100) {M}g{O} tunnel barriers and CoFe electrodes, exhibit TMR values of up to ~220% at room temperature and ~300% at low temperatures. Consistent with these high TMR values, superconducting tunnelling spectroscopy experiments indicate that the tunnelling current has a very high spin polarization of ~85%, which rivals that previously observed only using half-metallic ferromagnets2. Such high values of spin polarization and TMR in readily manufactureable and highly thermally stable devices (up to 400 �C) will accelerate the development of new families of spintronic devices.}

This low magnetoresistance seriously limits the feasibility of spintronics devices. Here, we report a giant MR ratio up to 180% at room temperature in single-crystal Fe/{M}g{O}/Fe MTJs. The origin of this enormous TMR effect is coherent spin-polarized tunnelling, where the symmetry of electron wave functions plays an important role. Moreover, we observed that their tunnel magnetoresistance oscillates as a function of tunnel barrier thickness, indicating that coherency of wave functions is conserved across the tunnel barrier. The coherent TMR effect is a key to making spintronic devices with novel quantum-mechanical functions, and to developing gigabit-scale MRAM. }

The undoped {M}g{O} yields the shortest positron lifetime of 140 ps that is shorter than that of a single crystal sample. The positron lifetime of the doped samples increases with the increase of the Al dopant concentration and is saturated at around 180 ps. This result clearly indicates that the formation of Mg vacancy is induced by Al dopant. The concentration of the other trivalent impurities can be evaluated using the result of component analysis of positron lifetimes. The experimental bulk lifetime of 130 ps, which is obtained by employing trapping model, is well reproduced by the theoretical calculation using the semiconductor model. The calculated defect lifetime is about 20 ps longer than the experimental value. This may be due to the lattice relaxation around Mg vacancy associated with the trapping of positrons.}

First, we demonstrate that for unrestricted measurement accuracy, no classical description is possible for arbitrarily large systems.

Deterministic (or triggered) single-photon sources exhibit non-classical behaviour in that they emit, with a high degree of certainty, just one photon at a user-specified time. (In contrast, a classical source such as an attenuated pulsed laser emits photons according to Poisson statistics.) A deterministic source of single photons could find applications in quantum information processing3, quantum cryptography4 and certain quantum computation problems5. Here we realize a controllable source of single photons using optical pumping of a single molecule in a solid. Triggered single photons are produced at a high rate, whereas the probability of simultaneous emission of two photons is nearly zero?a useful property for secure quantum cryptography. Our approach is characterized by simplicity, room temperature operation and improved performance compared to other triggered sources of single photons.}

Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter ? which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin View the MathML source systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system. }

It is shown that, provided a few commonly satisfied conditions obtain, there is a simple prescription for writing down the imaginary-time effective action functional which determines the tunneling rate in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin limit; namely, it contains the usual term in V(q), plus a term of the form (1/2?) ?-??1/2 K(-i|?|)|q?(?)|2d?, where q?(?) is the Fourier transform of the imaginary-time trajectory.

The entanglement entropy allows to make a precise unification between entanglement of the spin with its environment, decoherence, and quantum phase transitions. We derive exact analytical results which are confirmed by Numerical Renormalization Group arguments both for an ohmic and a subohmic bosonic bath. The entanglement entropy obeys universal scalings. We make comparisons with entanglement properties in the quantum Ising model and in the Dicke model. We also emphasize the possibility of measuring this entropy using charge qubits subject to electromagnetic noise; such measurements would provide an empirical proof of the existence of entanglement entropy. }

As a subfield of nanoscience, nanomagnetism shares many of the same basic organizing principles such as geometric confinement, physical proximity, and chemical self-organization. These principles are illustrated by means of several examples drawn from the quests for ultrastrong permanent magnets, ultra-high-density magnetic recording media, and nanobiomagnetic sensing strategies. As a final example showing the synergetic relationships to other fields of science, this Colloquium discusses the manipulation of viruses to fabricate magnetic nanoparticles. }

We demonstrate that the method is suitable for fermionic as well as bosonic baths. Comparisons with exact analytical results for the charge relaxation in the resonant-level model and for dephasing in the spin-boson model establish the accuracy of the method. The real-time dynamics of a single spin coupled to each type of bath is investigated. We use the TD-NRG to calculate the spin relaxation and spin precession of a single Kondo impurity. The short- and long-time dynamics are studied as a function of temperature in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. The short-time dynamics agrees very well with analytical results obtained at second order in the exchange coupling J. In the ferromagnetic regime, the transient spin decay is described by the scaling variable x=2?F?J(T)?Tt. In the antiferromagnetic regime, the long-time decay is governed for T<TK by the Kondo time scale 1?TK. Here ?F is the conduction-electron density of states, TK is the Kondo temperature, and J(T) is the effective exchange coupling at temperature T. Results for spin precession are obtained by rotating the external magnetic field from the x axis to the z axis. }

In the mean-field approximation for an extended range of parameters at half-filling, we show that the conduction-electron magnetization responds logarithmically to f-moment formation due to nesting; the ordered moment in the antiferromagnetic state is anomalously small, and the N�el temperature is of the order observed, though agreement for both of these quantities is not attained simultaneously. The model gives a qualitatively correct temperature dependence, but not magnitude, of the specific heat. The majority of the specific-heat jump at the N�el temperature arises from the formation of a spin gap in the conduction-electron spectrum. We also discuss the single-impurity version of the model and speculate on ways to increase the specific-heat coefficient. In the limits of small bandwidth and of small Ising-Kondo coupling, we find that the model corresponds to anisotropic Heisenberg and Hubbard models, respectively. }

The line shapes are the same in pure and impure TMMC at both angles. These results are explained in terms of a model in which the only effect of impurities is to alter the rate of diffusion along the chain. The slower diffusion produces a marked increase in width at ?=0�, where long-time effects dominate the one-dimensional (1d) spin dynamics, but has no effect at the "magic angle" (?=55�,3cos2?-1=0), where there is no secular contribution to the broadening and thus the 1d character is unimportant. A continuum calculation is presented in which an impurity is replaced by a region in which the diffusion coefficient is D?, compared with the host value D. The line shape is not altered in this model, in agreement with experiment, and the width, compared with pure TMMC, is related to D?/D. A relation is then assumed between D?/D and J?/J from which we estimate |J?/J|=0.06, where J? and J are impurity-host and host-host intrachain interactions, respectively. }

A fundamental problem resulting from their quantum mechanical nature is that the localized magnetic moments of these atoms are easily destabilized by interactions with electrons, nuclear spins and lattice vibrations of the substrate3, 4, 5. Even when large magnetic fields are applied to stabilize the magnetic moment, the observed lifetimes remain rather short5, 6 (less than a microsecond). Several routes for stabilizing the magnetic moment against fluctuations have been suggested, such as using thin insulating layers between the magnetic atom and the substrate to suppress the interactions with the substrate?s conduction electrons2, 3, 5, or coupling several magnetic moments together to reduce their quantum mechanical fluctuations7, 8. Here we show that the magnetic moments of single holmium atoms on a highly conductive metallic substrate can reach lifetimes of the order of minutes. The necessary decoupling from the thermal bath of electrons, nuclear spins and lattice vibrations is achieved by a remarkable combination of several symmetries intrinsic to the system: time reversal symmetry, the internal symmetries of the total angular momentum and the point symmetry of the local environment of the magnetic atom. }

Although this can lead to unwanted consequences, such as causing decoherence in qubits used for quantum computation1, it can also be exploited as a probe of the environment. For example, magnetic resonance imaging is based on the dependence of the spin relaxation times of protons2 in water molecules in a host's tissue3. Here we show that the excitation energy of a single spin, which is determined by magnetocrystalline anisotropy and controls its stability and suitability for use in magnetic data-storage devices4, can be modified by varying the exchange coupling of the spin to a nearby conductive electrode. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe variations up to a factor of two of the spin excitation energies of individual atoms as the strength of the spin's coupling to the surrounding electronic bath changes. These observations, combined with calculations, show that exchange coupling can strongly modify the magnetic anisotropy. This system is thus one of the few open quantum systems in which the energy levels, and not just the excited-state lifetimes, can be renormalized controllably. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, a property normally determined by the local structure around a spin, can be tuned electronically. These effects may play a significant role in the development of spintronic devices5 in which an individual magnetic atom or molecule is coupled to conducting leads. }

abstract ={The spin dynamics of all ferromagnetic materials are governed by two types of collective phenomenon: spin waves and domain walls. The fundamental processes underlying these collective modes, such as exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy, all originate at the atomic scale. However, conventional probing techniques based on neutron1 and photon scattering2 provide high resolution in reciprocal space, and thereby poor spatial resolution. Here we present direct imaging of standing spin waves in individual chains of ferromagnetically coupled S  =  2 Fe atoms, assembled one by one on a Cu2N surface using a scanning tunnelling microscope. We are able to map the spin dynamics of these designer nanomagnets with atomic resolution in two complementary ways. First, atom-to-atom variations of the amplitude of the quantized spin-wave excitations are probed using inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy. Second, we observe slow stochastic switching between two opposite magnetization states3, 4, whose rate varies strongly depending on the location of the tip along the chain. Our observations, combined with model calculations, reveal that switches of the chain are initiated by a spin-wave excited state that has its antinodes at the edges of the chain, followed by a domain wall shifting through the chain from one end to the other. This approach opens the way towards atomic-scale imaging of other types of spin excitation, such as spinon pairs and fractional end-states5, 6, in engineered spin chains. }

  abstract={Electrical control and readout of magnetic states is an important goal in spintronics. But electrical access to quantum spin systems comes at the cost of coupling to electrodes, which reduces the spin lifetimes through relaxation to electron–hole pairs. Here we report an electrically probed single-atom spin that is long-lived thanks to engineering the coupling of individual iron atoms to the nearby metallic electrodes. Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy, we show that the excited spin state of these atoms persists for more than ten milliseconds. The lifetime can be tuned by varying the distance to the microscope probe tip—acting as one electrode—and by changing the thickness of the insulating film which separates the atom from the underlying electrode. The cross-section for spin-flip scattering is so small that many thousands of electrons can probe the spin state projectively before it relaxes. Using all-electrical pump–probe spectroscopy, we measure the lifetime of the atom for different tip–atom distances and determine the intrinsic lifetime as a function of the insulator thickness. We explain the tuning of the spin lifetime in terms of the conductance to each of the electrodes, which provides a method to maximize the electrical readout signal for a given lifetime. }

abstract ={We combined the high-energy resolution of conventional spin resonance (here ~10 nano?electron volts) with scanning tunneling microscopy to measure electron paramagnetic resonance of individual iron (Fe) atoms placed on a magnesium oxide film. We drove the spin resonance with an oscillating electric field (20 to 30 gigahertz) between tip and sample. The readout of the Fe atom?s quantum state was performed by spin-polarized detection of the atomic-scale tunneling magnetoresistance. We determine an energy relaxation time of T1 ? 100 microseconds and a phase-coherence time of T2 ? 210 nanoseconds. The spin resonance signals of different Fe atoms differ by much more than their resonance linewidth; in a traditional ensemble measurement, this difference would appear as inhomogeneous broadening.},

 variations is solved by first considering
the homogeneous transport equation which omits electric fields. 
The homogeneous solution gives the
purely diffusive motion of current carriers and involves large 
space charges. The electric field is then found,
and approximate space charge neutrality is restored, by adding 
a particular solution of the transport
equation in which the electric field is associated only with space 
charge but not with a current. The presence
of point scatterers leads to a dipole field about each scatterer. 
The spatial average of a number of
these dipole fields is the same as that obtained by the usual approach
 which does not explicitly consider
the spatial variation. Infinite plane obstacles with a reflection 
coefficient r are also considered. These produce
a resistance proportional to r / ( l - r l .}

abstract = {The manner in which states of some quantum systems become effectively classical is of great significance for the foundations of quantum physics, as well as for problems of practical interest such as quantum engineering. In the past two decades it has become increasingly clear that many (perhaps all) of the symptoms of classicality can be induced in quantum systems by their environments. Thus decoherence is caused by the interaction in which the environment in effect monitors certain observables of the system, destroying coherence between the pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the universe in spite of the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the flagrantly nonlocal ?Schr�dinger-cat states.? The classical structure of phase space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic limit. Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the classical correlation. Only the preferred pointer observable of the apparatus can store information that has predictive power. When the measured quantum system is microscopic and isolated, this restriction on the predictive utility of its correlations with the macroscopic apparatus results in the effective ?collapse of the wave packet.? The existential interpretation implied by einselection regards observers as open quantum systems, distinguished only by their ability to acquire, store, and process information. Spreading of the correlations with the effectively classical pointer states throughout the environment allows one to understand ?classical reality? as a property based on the relatively objective existence of the einselected states. Effectively classical pointer states can be ?found out? without being re-prepared, e.g, by intercepting the information already present in the environment. The redundancy of the records of pointer states in the environment (which can be thought of as their ?fitness? in the Darwinian sense) is a measure of their classicality. A new symmetry appears in this setting. Environment-assisted invariance or envariance sheds new light on the nature of ignorance of the state of the system due to quantum correlations with the environment and leads to Born?s rules and to reduced density matrices, ultimately justifying basic principles of the program of decoherence and einselection. }

abstract= {Wave-particle duality, as manifest in the two-slit experiment, provides perhaps the most vivid illustration of Bohr's complementarity principle: wave-like behaviour (interference) occurs only when the different possible paths a particle can take are indistinguishable, even in principle1. The introduction of a which-path (welcher Weg) detector for determining the actual path taken by the particle inevitably involved coupling the particle to a measuring environment, which in turn results in dephasing (suppression of interference). In other words, simultaneous observations of wave and particle behaviour is prohibited. Such a manifestation of the complementarity principle was demonstrated recently using a pair of correlated photons, with measurement of one photon being used to determine the path taken by the other and so prevent single-photon interference2. Here we report the dephasing effects of a which-path detector on electrons traversing a double-path interferometer. We find that by varying the sensitivity of the detector we can affect the visibility of the oscillatory interference signal, thereby verifying the complementarity principle for fermions.}

Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) is a scanning probe technique that relies on the mechanical measurement of the weak magnetic force between a microscopic magnet and the magnetic moments in a sample. Spurred by the recent progress in fabricating ultrasensitive force detectors, MRFM has rapidly improved its capability over the last decade. Today it boasts a spin sensitivity that surpasses conventional, inductive nuclear magnetic resonance detectors by about eight orders of magnitude. In this review we touch on the origins of this technique and focus on its recent application to nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles, in particular on the imaging of nanoscale objects with a three-dimensional (3D) spatial resolution better than 10 nm. We consider the experimental advances driving this work and highlight the underlying physical principles and limitations of the method. Finally, we discuss the challenges that must be met in order to advance the technique towards single nuclear spin sensitivity?and perhaps?to 3D microscopy of molecules with atomic resolution.}

abstract = "Abstract When individual quantum spins are placed in close proximity to conducting substrates, the localized spin is coupled to the nearby itinerant conduction electrons via Kondo exchange. In the strong coupling limit this can result in the Kondo effect ? the formation of a correlated, many body singlet state ? and a resulting renormalization of the density of states near the Fermi energy. However, even when Kondo screening does not occur, Kondo exchange can give rise to a wide variety of other phenomena. In addition to the well known renormalization of the g factor and the finite spin decoherence and relaxation times, Kondo exchange has recently been found to give rise to a newly discovered effect: the renormalization of the single ion magnetic anisotropy. Here we put these apparently different phenomena on equal footing by treating the effect of Kondo exchange perturbatively. In this formalism, the central quantity is ?J, the product of the density of states at the Fermi energy ? and the Kondo exchange constant J. We show that perturbation theory correctly describes the experimentally observed exchange induced shifts of the single spin excitation energies, demonstrating that Kondo exchange can be used to tune the effective magnetic anisotropy of a single spin.

Furthermore, correlated many-particle states can emerge due to the interaction with itinerant electrons of the electrodes, making these systems ideal prototypical quantum systems.

  abstract={In recent years inelastic spin-flip spectroscopy using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope has been a very successful tool for studying not only individual spins but also complex coupled systems. When these systems interact with the electrons of the supporting substrate correlated many-particle states can emerge, making them ideal prototypical quantum systems. The spin systems, which can be constructed by arranging individual atoms on appropriate surfaces or embedded in synthesized molecular structures, can reveal very rich spectral features. Up to now the spectral complexity has only been partly described. This manuscript shows that perturbation theory enables one to describe the tunneling transport, reproducing the differential conductance with surprisingly high accuracy. Well established scattering models, which include Kondo-like spin?spin and potential interactions, are expanded to enable calculation of arbitrary complex spin systems in reasonable time scale and the extraction of important physical properties. The emergence of correlations between spins and, in particular, between the localized spins and the supporting bath electrons are discussed and related to experimentally tunable parameters. These results might stimulate new experiments by providing experimentalists with an easily applicable modeling tool.}

To control and engineer the magnetism of quantum devices, it is necessary to quantify how the structural and chemical environment of the junction affects the spin centre. Metrics such as coordination number or symmetry provide a simple method to quantify the local environment, but neglect the many-body interactions of an impurity spin coupled to contacts. Here, we utilize a highly corrugated hexagonal boron nitride monolayer to mediate the coupling between a cobalt spin in CoHx (x=1,2) complexes and the metal contact. While hydrogen controls the total effective spin, the corrugation smoothly tunes the Kondo exchange interaction between the spin and the underlying metal. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy together with numerical simulations, we quantitatively demonstrate how the Kondo exchange interaction mimics chemical tailoring and changes the magnetic anisotropy.}

  title = 	 {Valley Kondo Effect in Silicon Quantum Dots},
  abstract = 	 {Recent progress in the fabrication of quantum dots using
 silicon opens the prospect of observing the Kondo effect associated with
 the valley degree of freedom. We compute the dot density of states using
 an Anderson model with infinite Coulomb interaction U, whose structure 
mimics the nonlinear conductance through a dot. The density of states is 
obtained as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field in the 
Kondo regime using an equation-of-motion approach. We show that there is a
very complex peak structure near the Fermi energy, with several signatures
that distinguish this spin-valley Kondo effect from the usual spin Kondo
 effect seen in GaAs dots. We also show that the valley index is generally 
not conserved when electrons tunnel into a silicon dot, though the extent 
of this non-conservation is expected to be sample-dependent. We identify
features of the conductance that should enable experimenters to understand
 the interplay of Zeeman splitting and valley splitting, as well as the
 dependence of tunneling on the valley degree of freedom.},

  quantum dots in a perpendicular magnetic field. At zero field, destructive
   interference can trap an electron in a dark state — a 
coherent superposition of dot states that completely blocks current flow. 
The magnetic field can disrupt this interference giving rise to oscillations in 
the current and its higher-order statistics as the field is increased. These 
oscillations have a period of either the flux-quantum or half the flux- 
quantum, depending on the dot geometry. We give results for the stationary 
current and for the 
shotnoise and skewness at zero and finite frequency.},

Special attention is given to the nonsecular DME that is needed in the vicinity of overdamped tunnelling resonances in molecular magnets (MM). The relaxation terms of the DME for MM are represented in the universal form that does not employ any unknown spin-lattice coupling constants and absorbs the information about the spin Hamiltonian in the exact basis states and transition frequencies. This makes adding new types of anisotropy easy and error-free. The Mathematica code is available from the author.},

spectroscopy of a single iron atom absorbed on a nonmagnetic substrate. The observed steps in
the dierential conductance marked the spin excitation energies. In this Letter, we explain observed
nonmonotonicities in the dierential conductance by a nonequilibrium population of the atom spin
states. Furthermore, we predict super-Poissonian current noise due to this nonequilibrium situation.
By introducing an anisotropic relaxation channel we are also able to explain the remarkable absence
of nonequilibrium features at certain conductance steps.},

In addition, we also find an antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling, and a previously undiscovered correlated Kondo coupling between the two impurities.}

We analyze the applicability of this approach in the presence of highly polarizable substrates, e.g. for an ultrathin Fe layer on Pd(111), Rh(111), Ru(0001), or Tc(0001). We find that the traditionally accepted model Hamiltonians (Heisenberg plus nearest neighbor higher-order spin Hamiltonians) are not sufficient to capture the magnetic interactions in these systems and examine new terms that can be included to improve the description. Challenges for this technique are exemplified by the double-rowwise antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state predicted for Fe/Rh(111). }

  volume={27},

  abstract={Due to the quantum evolution of molecular magnetic moments, the magnetic state of nanomagnets can suffer spontaneous changes. This process can be completely quenched by environment-induced decoherence. However, we show that for typical small supported atomic objects, the substrate-induced decoherence does change the magnetic-moment evolution but does not quell it. To be specific and to compare with experiment, we analyze the spontaneous switching between two equivalent magnetization states of atomic structures formed by Fe on Cu2N/Cu (1 0 0), measured by Loth et al (2012 Science 335 196-9). Due to the substrate-induced decoherence, the Rabi oscillations proper to quantum tunneling between magnetic states are replaced by an irreversible decay of long characteristic times leading to the observed stochastic magnetization switching. We show that the corresponding switching rates are small, rapidly decreasing with system's size, with a 1/T thermal behavior and in good agreement with experiments. Quantum tunneling is recovered as the switching mechanism at extremely low temperatures below the ?K range for a six-Fe-atom system and exponentially lower for larger atomic systems. The unexpected conclusion of this work is that experiments could detect the switching of these supported atomic systems because their magnetization evolution is somewhere between complete decoherence-induced stability and unobservably fast quantum-tunneling switching.}

Using the numerical renormalization group method we calculate the spectral functions and linear conductance in the Kondo regime. We show that the exchange coupling between conducting electrons and localized magnetic core generally leads to suppression of the Kondo effect. We also predict a nontrivial dependence of the tunnel magnetoresistance on the strength of exchange coupling and on the anisotropy constant.}

  year={2012},
  abstract= {We investigate the effect of low-coordinated surface atoms on the defect-induced magnetism in {M}g{O} nanocrystallites using hybrid density functional theory calculations. It has been demonstrated that when Mg vacancies are introduced at the corners of cube-like {M}g{O} clusters, a magnetic state becomes lower in total energy than the nonmagnetic singlet state by 1-2 eV, resulting in the spin-polarized ground state. The spin density is not only located at the surrounding O atoms neighbor to the corner Mg vacancy site but is also extended to the distant (1 nm or longer) low-coordinated surface O atoms along the <110> directions. This directional spin delocalization allows a remote Mg vacancy-Mg vacancyinteraction, eventually leading to a spontaneous long-range ferromagnetic interaction.  }

  note={arXiv:1507.04785},
  year={2015},
abstract={   Quantum entanglement permeates the complex ground states of correlated electron materials defying single-particle descriptions. Coupled magnetic atoms have potential as model systems for entanglement in condensed matter giving the opportunity to create artificial many-body states which can be controlled by tuning the underlying interactions. They provide an avenue to unravel the complexities of correlated-electron materials. Here we use low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and atomic manipulation to tune entanglement in chains of magnetic atoms. We find that a Kondo singlet state can emerge from this entanglement. The many electron Kondo state is based on the screening of the entangled spin ground state of the chain by substrate electrons and can be engineered to envelop at least ten magnetic atoms. The concomitant Kondo resonance measured in the differential conductance enables the electric read-out of entanglement. By tuning composition and coupling strength within atomic chains it is possible to create model spin chains with defined entanglement. This lays the foundation for a new class of experiments to construct exotic correlated-electron materials atom by atom. }

  note={arXiv:1502.03857},
  year={2015},
  abstract={Quantum systems are inherently dissipation-less, making them excellent candidates even for classical information processing.
We propose to use an array of large-spin quantum magnets for realizing a device which has two modes of operation: memory
and data-bus. While the weakly interacting low-energy levels are used as memory to store classical information (bits), the
high-energy levels strongly interact with neighboring magnets and mediate the spatial movement of information through
quantum dynamics. Despite the fact that memory and data-bus require different features, which are usually prerogative of
different physical systems ? well isolation for the memory cells, and strong interactions for the transmission ? our proposal
avoids the notorious complexity of hybrid structures. The proposed mechanism can be realized with different setups. We
specifically show that molecular magnets, as the most promising technology, can implement hundreds of operations within their
coherence time, while adatoms on surfaces probed by a scanning tunneling microscope is a future possibility.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {We have developed a multi-orbital approach to compute the electronic structure of a quantum impurity using the non-crossing approximation. The calculation starts with a mean-field evaluation of the system’s electronic structure using a standard quantum chemistry code; here we use density functional theory (DFT). We transformed the one-electron structure into an impurity Hamiltonian by using maximally localized Wannier functions. Hence, we have developed a method to study the Kondo effect in systems based on an initial one-electron calculation. We have applied our methodology to a copper phthalocyanine molecule chemisorbed on Ag(100), and we have described its spectral function for three different cases where the molecule presents a single spin or two spins with ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic exchange couplings. We find that the use of broken-symmetry mean-field theories such as Kohn–Sham DFT cannot deal with the complexity of the spin of open-shell molecules on metal surfaces and extra modeling is needed.}

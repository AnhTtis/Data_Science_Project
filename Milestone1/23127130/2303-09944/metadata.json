    "abstract": "Motivated by recent developments in measurements of electron spin resonances of individual atoms and molecules with the scanning tunneling microscope (ESR-STM), we study electron transport through an impurity under periodic driving as a function of the transport parameters in a model junction. The model consists of a single-orbital quantum impurity connected to two electrodes via time-dependent hopping terms. The hopping terms are treated at the lowest order in perturbation theory to recover a Lindblad-like quantum master equation with electron transport.\n  As in the experiment, the ESR-STM signal is given by the variation of the long-time DC current with the driving frequency. The density-matrix coherences play an important role in the evaluation of the ESR-STM signal. Electron correlation is included in our impurity mode. The charging energy $U$ has significant influence on the spin dynamics depending on the sign and magnitude of the applied DC bias. Our model allows direct insight into the origin of the ESR signal from the many-body dynamics of the impurity.",

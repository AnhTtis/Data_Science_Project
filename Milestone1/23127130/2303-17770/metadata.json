    "abstract": "In this work, we study the strong decays of the newly observed $Ω^{*}_c(3185)$ and $Ω^{*}_c(3327)$ assuming that $Ω^{*}_c(3185)$ and $Ω^{*}_c(3327)$ as $S$-wave $DΞ$ and $D^{*}Ξ$ molecular state, respectively. Since the $Ω_c^{*}$ was observed in the $Ξ_c^{+}K^{-}$ invariant mass distributions, the partial decay width of $Ω^{*}_c(3185)$ and $Ω^{*}_c(3327)$ into $Ξ_c^{+}K^{-}$ through hadronic loops are evaluated with the help of the effective Lagrangians. Moreover, the decay channel of $Ξ_c^{'}\\bar{K}$ is also included. The decay process is described by the $t$-channel $Λ$, $Σ$ baryons and $D_s$, $D_s^{*}$ mesons exchanges, respectively. By comparison with the LHCb observation, the current results support the $Ω^{*}_c(3327)$ with$J^P=3/2^{-}$ as pure $D^{*}Ξ$ molecule while the $Ω^{*}_c(3327)$ with $J^P=1/2^{-}$ can not be well reproduced in the molecular state picture. In addition, the spin-parity $J^P=1/2^{-}$ $DΞ$ molecular assumptions for the $Ω^{*}_c(3185)$ can't be conclusively determined. It may be a meson-baryon molecule with a big $DΞ$ component. Although the decay width of the $Ω_c^{*}\\to{}\\bar{K}Ξ_c^{'}$ is of the order several MeV, it can be well employed to test the molecule interpretations of $Ω^{*}_c(3185)$ and $Ω^{*}_c(3327)$.",

    "abstract": "In the setting of a Drinfeld module $φ$ over a curve $X/\\mathbb{F}_q$, we use a functorial point of view to define \\emph{Anderson eigenvectors}, a generalization of the so called \"special functions\" introduced by Anglès, Ngo Dac and Tavares Ribeiro, and prove the existence of a universal object $ω_φ$.\n  We adopt an analogous approach with the dual Drinfeld module $φ^*$ to define \\textit{dual Anderson eigenvectors}. The universal object of this functor, denoted by $ζ_φ$, is a generalization of Pellarin zeta functions, can be expressed as an Eisenstein-like series over the period lattice, and its coordinates are entire functions over $X_{\\mathbb{C}_\\infty}\\setminus\\infty$.\n  For all integers $i$ we define dot products $ζ_φ\\cdotω_φ^{(i)}$ as certain meromorphic differential forms over $X_{\\mathbb{C}_\\infty}\\setminus\\infty$, and prove they are actually rational. This amounts to a generalization of Pellarin's identity for the Carlitz module.\n  Finally, we develop an algorithm to compute the forms $ζ_φ\\cdotω_φ^{(i)}$ when $X=\\mathbb{P}^1$, and prove a conjecture of Gazda and Maurischat about the invertibility of special functions for Drinfeld modules of rank $1$.",

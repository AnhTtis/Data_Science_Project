    "abstract": "We classify discrete quantum subgroups in the quantum double of the $q$-deformation of a compact semisimple Lie group, regarded as the complexification. We also record their classifications in some variants of quantum groups. Along the way, we show that quantum doubles of non-Kac type compact quantum groups do not admit the quantum analog of lattices considered by Brannan-Chirvasitu-Viselter.",

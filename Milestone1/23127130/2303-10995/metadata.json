    "abstract": "The $n$-dimensional hypercube has $n+1$ distinct eigenvalues $n-2i$, $0\\leq i\\leq n$, with corresponding eigenspaces $U_i(n)$. In 2021 it was proved by the author that if a function with non-empty support belongs to the direct sum $U_i(n)\\oplus U_{i+1}(n)\\oplus\\ldots\\oplus U_j(n)$, where $0\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n$, then it has at least $\\max(2^i,2^{n-j})$ non-zeros. In this work we give a characterization of functions achieving this bound.",

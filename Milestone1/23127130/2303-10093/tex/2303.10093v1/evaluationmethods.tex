\section{Evaluation Methods}

    \subsection{Open-vocabulary object detection}

        One downstream, object-level task that we consider is open-vocabulary detection. 

             - Our approach is weakly supervised for "novel" classes. We should probably evaluate on truly novel classes too. We know the labels upfront, but do not having bounding boxes for labels. 
             
    The model can be trained with cross-entropy loss on \textit{base} classes, can be directly used for inference on \textit{novel} classes, or both can be done in tandem in a \textit{generalized} scenario. 
        
        In the case of context-based negatives, we assume a list of COCO objects and thus relax the assumption of not knowing which labels are used downstream. However, novel classes still do not have any bounding boxes and are only defined during finetuning.      

    \subsection{Text-to-region retrieval}

        For a more fine-grained evaluation, we also explore text-to-region retrieval as a downstream task.

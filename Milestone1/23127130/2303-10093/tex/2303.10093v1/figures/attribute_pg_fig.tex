    %AP$_{30}$ is reported with respect to various adjective changes to captions. Note that 
    The default contextualized AP$_{30}$ is mostly hurt by removal of object adjectives from captions, rather than by changing the adjectives (plausibly or randomly) in the caption, showing a lack of sensitivity to adjective meaning. On the other hand, our adjective-sensitive model cares more that a reasonable adjective appears with an object, bringing finer-grained attention to objects with their attributes.}

    \caption{\textbf{Our context enhancement strategies (adjective-noun negative caption sampling, contextualized grounding), shown within the OVR-CNN \cite{zareian2021open} region-word, detection pretraining method.} The model is encouraged to pay further attention to the context surrounding object nouns like ``frisbee" (i.e.  the model is encouraged to ground ``orange frisbee"). The components which we add or strategically change (see Section \ref{enhance}) are shown/written in {\color{blue}{blue}}. Multimodal objectives are omitted for brevity.}

    \caption{\textbf{Effects from removing adjectives in OVR-CNN pretraining on COCO open-vocabulary detection}. Across settings, the maximum drop from removing adjectives from training is only -0.36 AP$_{50}$. These results indicate that attribute context has limited benefit in detection. Error bars show std. error (3 trials).}

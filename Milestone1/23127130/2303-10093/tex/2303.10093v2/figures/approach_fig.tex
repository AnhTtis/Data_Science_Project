    \caption{\textbf{Context enhancement strategies of exploration (adjective-noun negative caption sampling, contextualized grounding) for OVR-CNN \cite{zareian2021open} region-word grounding framework.} We experiment with encouraging the model to pay further attention to the context surrounding object nouns like ``frisbee" (\eg  the model is encouraged to ground ``orange frisbee"). The components which we add or strategically change are shown/written in {\color{blue}{blue}}. Multimodal objectives are omitted for brevity.}

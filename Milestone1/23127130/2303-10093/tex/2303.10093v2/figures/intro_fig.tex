    \caption{\textbf{Do vision-language models effectively leverage attribute context in captions?} In captions, objects (\eg \underline{bear}) are often described with rich contextual information (\eg attributes like \textbf{big}, \textbf{furry}, \textbf{black}). We evaluate the impact and utility of attributes in VL modeling through tasks such as text-region retrieval. }

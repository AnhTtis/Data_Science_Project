    "abstract": "We present a formalization of basics related to infinite words in the generic proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we present a formalization of purely morphic and morphic languages. Finally, we present a formalized definition of Sturmian words as lower mechanical words and prove some very elementary facts. The formalization is based on an ongoing larger project of formalization of combinatorics on words.",

    "abstract": "Sum systems are finite collections of finite component sets of non-negative integers, of prescribed cardinalities, such that their set sum generates consecutive integers without repetitions. In this present work we consider centred sum systems which generate either consecutive integers or half-integers centred around the origin, detailing some invariant properties of the component set sums and sums of squares for a fixed target set. Using a recently established bijection between sum systems and joint ordered factorisations of their component set cardinalities, we prove a formula expressing the number of different $m$-part sum systems in terms of associated divisor functions and Stirling numbers of the second kind. A sum over divisors relation is also established generalising and clarifying the known two-dimensional results.",

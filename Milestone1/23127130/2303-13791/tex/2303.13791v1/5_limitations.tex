\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
\noindent
We show that our method can estimate long camera trajectories robustly while maintaining a high-resolution representation. 
However, our pose estimation and progressive scheme assume that we are working with a continuous video \emph{without shot changes}.
This means that our method is not fit to reconstruct a scene from a collection of unstructured frames without coherence. 
We also do not tackle dynamic elements. 
Dynamic elements in the last row of Figure~\ref{fig:ours_results} lead to blurry regions. 
Another limitation that we observed is that sudden rotations can break pose estimation, leading to poorly rendered images.

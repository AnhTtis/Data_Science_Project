\noindent
We have presented a new method for reconstructing radiance fields of a large scene from a casually captured video. 
The core ideas of our work are 
1) a \emph{progressive} optimization scheme for jointly estimating camera poses and radiance fields and 
2) dynamically instantiating \emph{local} radiance fields.
From extensive evaluation on two datasets, we show that the proposed method substantially improves the robustness and fidelity of radiance field reconstruction in this challenging scenario.

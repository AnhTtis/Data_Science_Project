    "abstract": "Programming languages are incredibly versatile, enabling developers to create applications and programs that suit their individual requirements. This article introduces a new language called Cesno, designed from the ground up to offer an advanced, user-friendly, and easy-to-use programming environment. Cesno's syntax is similar to other popular languages, making it simple to learn and work with. It incorporates features from other languages, such as syntactic sugar, a built-in library, support for functional programming, object-oriented programming, dynamic typing, a type system, and a variety of function parameters and restrictions. This article will explore the design of Cesno's grammar, provide a brief overview of how Cesno processes and compiles code, and provide examples of what Cesno's code looks like and how it can aid in development.",

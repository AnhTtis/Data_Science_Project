    "abstract": "We propose an one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr{é}-Harper (AAH) model with off-diagonal hopping and staggered on-site potential. We find that the localization transitions could be multiple reentrant with the increasing of staggered on-site potential. The multiple localization transitions are verified by the quantum static and dynamic measurements such as the inversed or normalized participation ratios, fractal dimension and survival probability. Based on the finite-size scaling analysis, we also obtain an interesting intermediate phase where the extended, localized and critical states are coexistent in certain regime of model parameters. These results are quite different from those in the generalized AAH model with off-diagonal hopping, and can help us to find novel quantum phases, new localization phenomena in the disordered systems.",

    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a graph and $U\\subset V(G)$ be a set of vertices. For each $v\\in\nU$, let $h_v\\colon U\\to \\{0, 1\\}$ be the function defined by\n\\[h_v(u)=\\begin{cases} &1 ~\\mbox{if}~u\\sim v, u\\in U\\\\&0 ~\\mbox{if}~u\\not\\sim\nv, u\\in U\\end{cases},\\] and set $\\mathcal{H}(U):=\\{h_v\\colon v\\in U\\}$. The\nfirst purpose of this paper is to study the following question: What families\nof graphs $G$ and what conditions on $U$ do we need so that the VC-dimension of\n$\\mathcal{H}(U)$ can be determined? We show that if $G$ is a pseudo-random\ngraph, then under some mild conditions, the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}(U)$\ncan be bounded from below. Specific cases of this theorem recover and improve\nprevious results on VC-dimension of functions defined by the well-studied\ndistance and dot-product graphs over a finite field.",

    "abstract": "We present an implementation of a channelizer (F-engine) running on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). While not the first GPU implementation of a channelizer, we have put significant effort into optimizing the implementation. We are able to process four antennas each with 2 Gsample/s, 10-bit dual-polarized input and 8-bit output, on a single commodity GPU. This fully utilizes the available PCIe bandwidth of the GPU. The system is not as optimized for a single high-bandwidth antenna, but handles 6.2 Gsample/s, limited by single-core CPU performance.",

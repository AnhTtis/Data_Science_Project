\begin{abstract}
  We present an implementation of a channelizer (F-engine) running on a
  Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). While not the first GPU implementation of a
  channelizer, we have put significant effort into optimizing the
  implementation. We are able to process four antennas each with
  \qty{2}{\giga\sample\per\second}, 10-bit dual-polarized input and
  8-bit output, on a single commodity GPU. This fully utilizes the available
  PCIe bandwidth of the GPU. The system is not as optimized for a single
  high-bandwidth antenna, but handles
  \qty{6.2}{\giga\sample\per\second}, limited by single-core CPU performance.

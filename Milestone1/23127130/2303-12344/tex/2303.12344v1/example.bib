              Nonthermal desorption of molecules from icy grain surfaces is required to explain molecular line observations in the cold gas of star-forming regions. Chemical desorption is one of the nonthermal desorption processes and is driven by the energy released by chemical reactions. After an exothermic surface reaction, the excess energy is transferred to products’ translational energy in the direction perpendicular to the surface, leading to desorption. The desorption probability of product species, especially that of product species from water-ice surfaces, is not well understood. This uncertainty limits our understanding of the interplay between gas-phase and ice-surface chemistry. In the present work, we constrain the desorption probability of H

              S and PH
              3
              per reaction event on porous amorphous solid water (ASW) by numerically simulating previous laboratory experiments. Adopting the microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo method, we find that the desorption probabilities of H

              S and PH
              3
              from porous ASW per hydrogen-addition event of the precursor species are 3\% ± 1.5\% and 4\% ± 2\%, respectively. These probabilities are consistent with a theoretical model of chemical desorption proposed in the literature if ∼7\% of energy released by the reactions is transferred to the translational excitation of the products. As a byproduct, we find that approximately 70\% (40\%) of adsorption sites for atomic H on porous ASW should have a binding energy lower than ∼300 K (∼200 K). The astrochemical implications of our findings are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {We present an extended version of the two-phase gas-grain code nautilus to the three-phase modelling of gas and grain chemistry of cold cores. In this model, both the mantle and the surface are considered as chemically active. We also take into account the competition among reaction, diffusion and evaporation. The model predictions are confronted to ice observations in the envelope of low-mass and massive young stellar objects as well as towards background stars. Modelled gas-phase abundances are compared to species observed towards TMC-1 (CP) and L134N dark clouds. We find that our model successfully reproduces the observed ice species. It is found that the reaction-diffusion competition strongly enhances reactions with barriers and more specifically reactions with H2, which is abundant on grains. This finding highlights the importance having a good approach to determine the abundance of H2 on grains. Consequently, it is found that the major N-bearing species on grains go from NH3 to N2 and HCN when the reaction-diffusion competition is taken into account. In the gas phase and before a few 105 yr, we find that the three-phase model does not have a strong impact on the observed species compared to the two-phase model. After this time, the computed abundances dramatically decrease due to the strong accretion on dust, which is not counterbalanced by the desorption less efficient than in the two-phase model. This strongly constrains the chemical age of cold cores to be of the order of few 105 yr.},

In particular, for the simple formic and thioformic acids, the low temperatures found in molecular clouds indicate that cis-trans isomerization in the gas-phase must be impeded. Reactions happening on top of interstellar dust grains may explain the isomer interconversion at low temperatures. We studied the isomerization processes of formic and thioformic acid susceptible to happen on the surface of interstellar dust grains and initiated by H abstraction reactions. Similarly, deuterium enrichment of the acids can occur by the same mechanism. Our objective is to shed light on both topics to increase our understanding of key precursors of organic molecules in space.},

  abstract = {The detection of phosphorous-bearing molecules in interstellar environments constitutes a fundamental task for understanding the formation of prebiotic molecules, but it is also a challenge. In cold interstellar environments, where rich chemistry is expected to happen, only PN and PO have been detected. Phosphine (PH3) must also play an essential role in these regions, since P is expected to deplete onto dust grains significantly, and hydrogenation reactions are dominant in such environments. Surface chemistry on dust grains shows a particular idiosyncrasy where an equilibrium between competitive reactions, photoconversion processes, and desorption are in continuous interplay, modifying both the dust composition and the gas composition. In this study, we theoretically study in detail the interconversion of P to PH3 via subsequent additions of H on cold dust grain analogues. For all reactions, we provide the binding energy of the adsorbates, reaction energies, and, when present, activation barriers and tunneling-corrected rate constants. We also present an estimate of the desorption temperature of these species based on transition state theory. Using recently available experimental results on PH3 desorption via chemical reactions, we conclude that all of the intermediate products of the hydrogenation sequence to phosphine may be released to the gas phase.},

	abstract = {On the surface of icy dust grains in the dense regions of the interstellar medium a rich chemistry can take place. Due to the low temperature, reactions that proceed via a barrier can only take place through tunneling. The reaction H + H\$\_2\$O\$\_2\$ \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ H\$\_2\$O + OH is such a case with a gas-phase barrier of \${\textbackslash}sim\$26.5 kJ/mol. Still the reaction is known to be involved in water formation on interstellar grains. Here, we investigate the influence of a water ice surface and of bulk ice on the reaction rate constant. Rate constants are calculated using instanton theory down to 74 K. The ice is taken into account via multiscale modeling, describing the reactants and the direct surrounding at the quantum mechanical level with density functional theory (DFT), while the rest of the ice is modeled on the molecular mechanical level with a force field. We find that H\$\_2\$O\$\_2\$ binding energies cannot be captured by a single value, but rather depend on the number of hydrogen bonds with surface molecules. In highly amorphous surroundings the binding site can block the routes of attack and impede the reaction. Furthermore, the activation energies do not correlate with the binding energies of the same sites. The unimolecular rate constants related to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism increase as the activation energy decreases. Thus, we provide a lower limit for the rate constant and argue that rate constants can have values up to two order of magnitude larger than this limit.},

	abstract = {OH radicals play a key role as an intermediate in the water formation chemistry of the interstellar medium. For example, the reaction of OH radicals with H2 molecules is among the final steps in the astrochemical reaction network starting from O, O2, and O3. Experimentally, it was shown that, even at 10 K, this reaction occurs on ice surfaces. Because the reaction has a high activation energy, only atom tunneling can explain such experimental findings. In this study, we calculated reaction rate constants for the title reaction on a water-ice Ih surface. To our knowledge, low-temperature rate constants on a surface are not available in the literature. All surface calculations were performed using a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics framework (BHLYP/TIP3P) after a thorough benchmark of different density functionals and basis sets to highly accurate correlation methods. Reaction rate constants are obtained using the instanton theory, which takes atom tunneling into account inherently, with reaction rate constants down to 110 K for the Eley-Rideal mechanism and down to 60 K for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. We found that the reaction rate is nearly temperature-independent below 80 K. We give kinetic isotope effects for all possible deuteration patterns for both reaction mechanisms. For the implementation in astrochemical networks, we also give fit parameters to a modified Arrhenius equation. Finally, several different binding sites and binding energies of OH radicals on the Ih surface are discussed, and the corresponding rate constants are compared to the gas-phase case.},

Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is considered a precursor to the amino acid glycine. Although not yet detected, NH2OH is considered a likely target of detection with ALMA. We report on an experimental investigation of the formation of hydroxylamine on an amorphous silicate surface via the oxidation of ammonia. The experimental data are then fed into a simulation of the formation of NH2OH in dense cloud conditions. On ices at 14 K and with a modest activation energy barrier, NH2OH is found to be formed with an abundance that never falls below a factor 10 with respect to NH3. Suggestions of conditions for future observations are provided.},

@article{Rivilla_2020,
abstract = {One of the proposed scenarios for the origin of life is the primordial RNA world, which considers that RNA molecules were likely responsible for the storage of genetic information and the catalysis of biochemical reactions in primitive cells, before the advent of proteins and DNA. In the last decade, experiments in the field of prebiotic chemistry have shown that RNA nucleotides can be synthesized from relatively simple molecular precursors, most of which have been found in space. An important exception is hydroxylamine, NH2OH, which, despite several observational attempts, it has not been detected in space yet. Here we present the first detection of NH2OH in the interstellar medium toward the quiescent molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 located in the Galactic Center. We have targeted the three groups of transitions from the J = 2−1, 3−2, and 4−3 rotational lines, detecting five transitions that are unblended or only slightly blended. The derived molecular abundance of NH2OH is (2.1 ± 0.9) × 10−10. From the comparison of the derived abundance of NH2OH and chemically related species, with those predicted by chemical models and measured in laboratory experiments, we favor the formation of NH2OH in the interstellar medium via hydrogenation of NO on dust grain surfaces, with possibly a contribution of ice-mantle NH3 oxidation processes. Further laboratory studies and quantum chemical calculations are needed to completely rule out the formation of NH2OH in the gas phase.},

abstract = {Recent laboratory measurements have confirmed that chemical desorption (desorption of products due to exothermic surface reactions) can be an efficient process. The impact of including this process into gas-grain chemical models entirely depends on the formalism used and the associated parameters. Among these parameters, binding energies are probably the most uncertain ones for the moment. We propose a new model to compute binding energy of species to water ice surfaces. We have also compared the model results using either the new chemical desorption model proposed by Minissale et al. (2016) or the one of Garrod et al. (2007). The new binding energies have a strong impact on the formation of complex organic molecules. In addition, the new chemical desorption model from Minissale produces a much smaller desorption of these species and also of methanol. Combining the two effects, the abundances of CH3OH and COMs observed in cold cores cannot be reproduced by astrochemical models anymore.},

abstract = {Phosphine (PH3) is an important molecule in the chemistry of phosphorus (P)-bearing species in the interstellar medium. Interstellar PH3 is thought to primarily form on icy grains, where several surface processes may occur during and after its formation. To better understand the physicochemical behavior of PH3 on icy grains in dense molecular clouds, we performed experimental and computational studies on the reactions of phosphine with H and D atoms at low temperatures. We found that phosphine and its deuterated isotopologue PD3 are released into the gas phase from icy surfaces (porous amorphous, compact amorphous, and crystalline ice) via chemical desorption. Even though the effective desorption cross section did not vary between the different icy surfaces, the desorption fraction was smallest for porous amorphous ice. We confirmed that, at 10 K on icy surfaces, H–D substitution reactions of PH3 and D–H substitution reactions of PD3 occurred following reactions with D and H atoms, respectively. Because the activation barrier for the abstraction of H or D atoms from phosphine is ∼1500 K, quantum tunneling should play a role at low temperatures. Under the present experimental conditions, the H–D substitution reaction of PH3 was slightly slower than the D–H substitution reaction of PD3. Therefore, the rates of the H–D and D–H substitution reactions should not be constrained by tunneling reactions but rather by other elementary processes such as atom diffusion on ice. Our experimental results suggest the possible presence of a deuterated phosphine isotopologue (PH2D) in PH3-rich interstellar environments.},

Chemical desorption is one of the nonthermal desorption processes and is driven by the energy released by chemical reactions. After an exothermic surface reaction, the excess energy is transferred to products’ translational energy in the direction perpendicular to the surface, leading to desorption. The desorption probability of product species, especially that of product species from water-ice surfaces, is not well understood. This uncertainty limits our understanding of the interplay between gas-phase and ice-surface chemistry. In the present work, we constrain the desorption probability of H2S and PH3 per reaction event on porous amorphous solid water (ASW) by numerically simulating previous laboratory experiments. Adopting the microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo method, we find that the desorption probabilities of H2S and PH3 from porous ASW per hydrogen-addition event of the precursor species are 3% ± 1.5% and 4% ± 2%, respectively. These probabilities are consistent with a theoretical model of chemical desorption proposed in the literature if ∼7% of energy released by the reactions is transferred to the translational excitation of the products. As a byproduct, we find that approximately 70% (40%) of adsorption sites for atomic H on porous ASW should have a binding energy lower than ∼300 K (∼200 K). The astrochemical implications of our findings are briefly discussed.}

To enhance the applicability of instanton theory, we present a dual-level approach in which instanton optimizations and Hessian calculations are performed using an efficient but approximate electronic structure method, and the potential energy along the tunneling path is recalculated using a more accurate method. This procedure extends the applicability of instanton theory to high-level electronic structure methods for which analytic gradients may not be available, like local linear-scaling approaches. We demonstrate for the analytical Eckart barrier and three molecular systems how the dual-level instanton approach corrects for the largest part of the error caused by the inaccuracy of the efficient electronic structure method. This reduces the error of the calculated rate constants significantly.},

  abstract = {A computational study of the reactions of hydroxylamine and its ionized and protonated derivatives with acetic acid is provided. The reaction of neutral hydroxylamine with acetic acid, despite being clearly exothermic, involves a very large energy barrier. The reaction of ionized hydroxylamine with acetic acid is also clearly exothermic, but again a significant energy barrier is found (around 24 kcal mol-1 at the CCSD(T) level). The reaction of the most stable protonated isomer of hydroxylamine, NH3OH+, with acetic acid also involves a high barrier (more than 27 kcal mol -1 at the CCSD(T) level). Only the higher energy isomer, NH 2OH+2, leads to a sensibly lower energy barrier (about 2.3 kcal mol-1 at the CCSD(T) level). Nevertheless, an estimate of the reaction coefficient at low temperatures such as those reigning in the interstellar medium gives very low values. Therefore, it seems that precursors of interstellar glycine could not be efficiently produced from the reactions of hydroxylamine-derived ions with acetic acid. \textcopyright{} 2012.

A broad consensus has been reached in the astrochemistry community on how to suitably treat gas-phase processes in models, and also on how to present the necessary reaction data in databases; however, no such consensus has yet been reached for grain-surface processes. A team of {$\sim$} 25 experts covering observational, laboratory and theoretical (astro)chemistry met in summer of 2014 at the Lorentz Center in Leiden with the aim to provide solutions for this problem and to review the current state-of-the-art of grain surface models, both in terms of technical implementation into models as well as the most up-to-date information available from experiments and chemical computations.

This simplest carbonylic compound is central to the formation of complex organics in cold interstellar clouds and is generally regarded to be formed by the hydrogenation of solid-state carbon monoxide. We demonstrate H2CO formation via the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water. Crucial to our proposed mechanism is a concerted proton transfer catalyzed by the water hydrogen bonding network. Consequently, the reactions 3C + H2O \textrightarrow{} 3HCOH and 1HCOH \textrightarrow{} 1H2CO can take place with low or without barriers, contrary to the high-barrier traditional internal hydrogen migration. These low barriers (or the absence thereof) explain the very small kinetic isotope effect in our experiments when comparing the formation of H2CO to D2CO. Our results reconcile the disagreement found in the literature on the reaction route C + H2O \textrightarrow{} H2CO.},

abstract = { With the presence of evermore complex S-bearing molecules being detected lately, studies of their chemical formation routes need to keep up the pace to rationalize observations, suggest new candidates for detection, and provide input for chemical evolution models. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the hydrogenation channels of OCS on top of amorphous solid water (ASW) as an interstellar dust grain analog in molecular clouds. Our results show that the significant reaction outcome is trans-HC(O)SH, a recently detected prebiotic molecule toward G+0.693. The reaction is diastereoselective, explaining the apparent absence of the cis isomer in astronomical observations. We found that the reaction proceeds through a highly localized radical intermediate (cis-OCSH), which could be essential in the formation of other sulfur-bearing complex organic molecules due to its slow isomerization dynamics on top of ASW. },

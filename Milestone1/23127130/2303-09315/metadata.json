    "abstract": "Cold atom ion sources have been developed and commercialized as alternative sources for focused ion beams (FIB). So far, applications and related research have not been widely reported. In this paper, a prototype rubidium FIB is used to study the irradiation damage of 8.5 keV beam energy Rb$^+$ ions on silicon to examine the suitability of rubidium for nanomachining applications. Transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is applied to silicon samples irradiated by different doses of rubidium ions. The experimental results show a duplex damage layer consisting of an outer layer of oxidation without Rb and an inner layer containing Rb mostly at the interface to the underlying Si substrate. The steady-state damage layer is measured to be $23.2(\\pm 0.3)$ nm thick with a rubidium staining level of $7(\\pm1)$ atomic percentage.",

\begin{abstract}
Centrality measures aim to indicate who is important in a network. Various notions of `being important' give rise to different centrality measures. In this paper, we study how important the central vertices are for the \emph{connectivity structure} of the network, by investigating how the removal of the most central vertices affects the number of connected components and the size of the giant component. We use \emph{local convergence techniques} to identify the limiting number of connected components for locally converging graphs and centrality measures that depend on the vertex's neighborhood. For the size of the giant, we prove a general upper bound. For the matching lower bound, we specialize to the case of \emph{degree centrality} on one of the most popular models in network science, the \emph{configuration model}, for which we show that removal of the highest-degree vertices destroys the giant most.

abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.}

abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the “wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.}

abstract={Almost all the natural or human made systems can be understood and controlled using complex networks. This is a difficult problem due to the very large number of elements in such networks, on the order of billions and higher, which makes it impossible to use conventional network analysis methods. Herein, we employ artificial intelligence (specifically swarm computing), to compute centrality metrics in a completely decentralized fashion. More exactly, we show that by overlaying a homogeneous artificial system (inspired by swarm intelligence) over a complex network (which is a heterogeneous system), and playing a game in the fused system, the changes in the homogeneous system will reflect perfectly the complex network properties. Our method, dubbed Game of Thieves (GOT), computes the importance of all network elements (both nodes and edges) in polylogarithmic time with respect to the total number of nodes. Contrary, the state-of-the-art methods need at least a quadratic time. Moreover, the excellent capabilities of our proposed approach, it terms of speed, accuracy, and functionality, open the path for better ways of understanding and controlling complex networks.},

abstract = {PageRank is defined as the stationary state of a Markov chain. The chain is obtained by perturbing the transition matrix induced by a web graph with a damping factor α that spreads uniformly part of the rank. The choice of α is eminently empirical, and in most cases the original suggestion α = 0.85 by Brin and Page is still used. Recently, however, the behaviour of PageRank with respect to changes in α was discovered to be useful in link-spam detection[21]. Moreover, an analytical justification of the value chosen for α is still missing. In this paper, we give the first mathematical analysis of PageRank when α changes. In particular, we show that, contrarily to popular belief, for real-world graphs values of α close to 1 do not give a more meaningful ranking. Then, we give closed-form formulae for PageRank derivatives of any order, and an extension of the Power Method that approximates them with convergence O (tk αt) for the k-th derivative. Finally, we show a tight connection between iterated computation and analytical behaviour by proving that the k-th iteration of the Power Method gives exactly the PageRank value obtained using a Maclaurin polynomial of degree k. The latter result paves the way towards the application of analytical methods to the study of PageRank.},

In particular, the tail behavior of the degree distribution does not play the same crucial role for the size of the giant as it does for many other properties of the graph. Upper and lower bounds for the component size are derived for an arbitrary given distribution over small degrees {\$}{\$}d{\backslash}le L{\$}{\$}and given expected degree, and numerical implementations show that these bounds are close already for small values of L. On the other hand, examples illustrate that, for a fixed degree tail, the component size can vary substantially depending on the distribution over small degrees.},

abstract={Identifying influential spreaders is an important task in controlling the spread of information and epidemic diseases in complex networks. Many recent studies have indicated that the identification of influential spreaders is dependent on the spreading dynamics. Finding a general optimal order of node importance ranking is difficult because of the complexity of network structures and the physical background of dynamics. In this paper, we use four metrics, namely, betweenness, degree, H-index, and coreness, to measure the central attributes of nodes for constructing the disease spreading models and target immunization strategies. Numerical simulations show that spreading processes based on betweenness centrality lead to the widest range of propagation and the smallest epidemic threshold for all six networks (including four real networks and two BA scale-free networks generated according to Barabasi--Albert algorithm). The target immunization strategy based on the betweenness centrality of nodes is the most effective for BA scale-free networks but displays poor immune effect for real networks in identifying the most important spreaders for disease control. The immunization strategy based on node degrees is the most effective for the four real networks. Findings show that the target immune strategy based on the betweenness centrality of nodes works best for standard scale-free networks, whereas that based on node degrees works best for other nonstandard scale-free networks. The results can provide insights into understanding the different metrics of measuring node importance in disease transmission and control.},

              Scientific Impact of Researchers",
  author   = "Senanayake, Upul and Piraveenan, Mahendra and Zomaya, Albert",
  abstract = "Quantifying and comparing the scientific output of researchers
              has become critical for governments, funding agencies and
              universities. Comparison by reputation and direct assessment of
              contributions to the field is no longer possible, as the number
              of scientists increases and traditional definitions about
              scientific fields become blurred. The h-index is often used for
              comparing scientists, but has several well-documented
              shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce a new index for
              measuring and comparing the publication records of scientists:
              the pagerank-index (symbolised as $\pi$). The index uses a
              version of pagerank algorithm and the citation networks of papers
              in its computation, and is fundamentally different from the
              existing variants of h-index because it considers not only the
              number of citations but also the actual impact of each citation.
              We adapt two approaches to demonstrate the utility of the new
              index. Firstly, we use a simulation model of a community of
              authors, whereby we create various 'groups' of authors which are
              different from each other in inherent publication habits, to show
              that the pagerank-index is fairer than the existing indices in
              three distinct scenarios: (i) when authors try to 'massage' their
              index by publishing papers in low-quality outlets primarily to
              self-cite other papers (ii) when authors collaborate in large
              groups in order to obtain more authorships (iii) when authors
              spend most of their time in producing genuine but low quality
              publications that would massage their index. Secondly, we
              undertake two real world case studies: (i) the evolving author
              community of quantum game theory, as defined by Google Scholar
              (ii) a snapshot of the high energy physics (HEP) theory research
              community in arXiv. In both case studies, we find that the list
              of top authors vary very significantly when h-index and
              pagerank-index are used for comparison. We show that in both
              cases, authors who have collaborated in large groups and/or
              published less impactful papers tend to be comparatively favoured
              by the h-index, whereas the pagerank-index highlights authors who
              have made a relatively small number of definitive contributions,
              or written papers which served to highlight the link between
              diverse disciplines, or typically worked in smaller groups. Thus,
              we argue that the pagerank-index is an inherently fairer and more
              nuanced metric to quantify the publication records of scientists
              compared to existing measures.",

abstract={Measuring the importance of nodes in a network with a centrality measure is an core task in any network application. There many measures available and it is speculated that many encode similar information. We give an explicit non-linear relationship between two of the most popular measures of node centrality: degree and closeness. Based on a shortest-path tree approximation, we give an analytic derivation that shows the inverse of closeness is linearly dependent on the logarithm of degree. We show that our hypothesis works well for a range of networks produced from stochastic network models and for networks derived from 130 real-world data sets. We connect our results with previous results for other network distance scales such as average distance. Our results imply that measuring closeness is broadly redundant unless our relationship is used to remove the dependence on degree from closeness. The success of our relationship suggests that most networks can be approximated by shortest-path spanning trees which are all statistically similar two or more steps away from their root nodes.},

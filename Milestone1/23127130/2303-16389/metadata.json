    "abstract": "A spatial active noise control (ANC) method based on kernel interpolation of a sound field with exterior radiation suppression is proposed. The aim of spatial ANC is to reduce incoming noise over a target region by using multiple secondary sources and microphones. The method based on kernel interpolation of a sound field allows noise attenuation in a regional space with an array of arbitrary geometry. The cost function is defined as the acoustic potential energy, i.e., the regional integral of the power distribution inside the target region. However, this cost function does not take into consideration the exterior radiation of secondary sources. Thus, the acoustic power in the exterior region can be amplified by the output of the secondary sources. We propose two spatial ANC methods with exterior radiation suppression. The first approach is based on the minimization of the cost function formulated as a sum of the interior acoustic potential energy and exterior radiation power. The second approach is based on the minimization of the interior acoustic potential energy with inequality constraints on the exterior radiation power. Adaptive algorithms for minimizing the cost function are derived for the two approaches. Numerical experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can reduce the interior regional noise while suppressing the exterior radiation.",

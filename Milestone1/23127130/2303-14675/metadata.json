    "abstract": "We describe the projective superspace approach to supersymmetric models with off-shell $(0,4)$ supersymmetry in two dimensions. In addition to the usual superspace coordinates, projective superspace has extra bosonic variables -- one doublet for each $\\text{SU}(2)$ in the R-symmetry $\\text{SU}(2) \\times \\text{SU}(2)$ which are interpreted as homogeneous coordinates on $\\mathbf{CP}^1 \\times \\mathbf{CP}^1$. The superfields are analytic in the $\\mathbf{CP}^1$ coordinates and this analyticity plays an important role in our description. For instance, it leads to stringent constraints on the interactions one can write down for a given superfield content of the model. As an example, we describe in projective superspace Witten's ADHM sigma model -- a linear sigma model with non-derivative interactions whose target is $\\mathbf{R}^4$ with a Yang-Mills instanton solution. The hyperkähler nature of target space and the twistor description of instantons by Ward, and Atiyah, Hitchin, Drinfeld and Manin are natural outputs of our construction.",

    "abstract": "Bulk Dirac semimetals (DSMs) exhibit unconventional transport properties and phase transitions due to their peculiar low-energy band structure. Yet the electronic interactions governing nonequilibrium phenomena in DSMs are not fully understood. Here we show that electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions in a prototypical bulk DSM, Na3Bi, are predominantly two-dimensional (2D). Our first-principles calculations discover a 2D optical phonon with strong e-ph interactions associated with in-plane vibrations of Na atoms. We show that this 2D mode governs e-ph scattering and charge transport in Na3Bi, and induces a dynamical phase transition to a Weyl semimetal. Our work advances quantitative analysis of electron interactions in topological semimetals and reveals dominant low-dimensional interactions in bulk quantum materials.",

    "abstract": "Watershed segmentation method has been used in various applications. But many a times, due to its over-segmentation attributes, it underperforms in several tasks where noise is a dominant source. In this study, Optical Coherence Tomography images have been acquired, and segmentation has been performed to analyse the different regions of fluid filled sacs in a lemon. A modified watershed algorithm has been proposed which gives promising results for segmentation of internal lemon structures.",

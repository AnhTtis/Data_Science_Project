@article{Aberg2014,
abstract = {Conservation of energy implies that we cannot freely create superpositions between energy eigenstates, while access to coherence enables such processes. A simple example of the latter is when an atom is put into a superposition of two energy levels, using coherent radiation in form of a laser. The question is to what extent the coherence is degraded when utilized. Here we show that coherence can be turned into a catalytic resource, meaning that it can be used indefinitely to induce coherent operations without ever being degraded. As an application we consider quantum thermodynamics, where we demonstrate that access to sufficient coherence enables the release of all latent expected work content in a system. Since we can make it a catalyst, no coherence is spent to achieve this work extraction. In a wider perspective, the fact that coherence can be made catalytic provides a step towards a characterization of the relation between energy and coherence as resources in quantum statistical mechanics.},

We implement the unitary time evolution in the system as a physical phenomenon that results from the interaction between the system and the apparatus. We investigate the fundamental limitation of an accurate implementation for the desired unitary time evolution. This limitation is manifested in the form of trade-off relations between the accuracy of the implementation and quantum fluctuation of energy in the external apparatus. Our relations clearly show that an accurate unitary operation requires a large energy fluctuation inside the apparatus originated from the quantum fluctuation.},

@article{Ozawa1984,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a basis of theory of measurements of continuous observables. We generalize von Neumann's description of measuring processes of discrete quantum observables in terms of interaction between the measured system and the apparatus to continuous observables, and show how every such measuring process determines the state change caused by the measurement. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between completely positive instruments in the sense of Davies and Lewis and the state changes determined by the measuring processes. We also prove that there are no weakly repeatable completely positive instruments of nondiscrete observables in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, so that there are no measuring processes of nondiscrete observables whose state changes satisfy the repeatability hypothesis. A proof of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem on the nonexistence of repeatable measurements of observables not commuting conserved quantities is given in our framework. We also discuss the implication of these results for the recent results due to Srinivas and due to Mercer on measurements of continuous observables. {\textcopyright} 1984 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Recent investigations show that conservation laws limit the accuracy of gate operations in quantum computing. The inevitable error under the angular momentum conservation law has been evaluated so far for the CNOT, Hadamard and NOT gates for spin-1/2 qubits, while the SWAP gate has no constraint. Here, we extend the above results to general single-qubit gates. We obtain an upper bound of the gate fidelity of arbitrary single-qubit gates implemented under arbitrary conservation laws, determined by the geometry of the conservation law and the gate operation on the Bloch sphere as well as the size of the ancilla. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Quantum measurement is ultimately a physical process, resulting from an interaction between the measured system and a measurement apparatus. Considering the physical process of measurement within a thermodynamic context naturally raises the following question: how can the work and heat resulting from the measurement process be interpreted? In the present manuscript, we model the measurement process for an arbitrary discrete observable as a measurement scheme. Here, the system to be measured is first unitarily coupled with a measurement apparatus, and subsequently the apparatus is measured by a pointer observable, thus producing a definite measurement outcome. The work can therefore be interpreted as the change in internal energy of the compound of system-plus-apparatus due to the unitary coupling. By the first law of thermodynamics, the heat is the subsequent change in internal energy of this compound due to the measurement of the pointer observable. However, in order for the apparatus to serve as a stable record for the measurement outcomes, the pointer observable must commute with the Hamiltonian, and its implementation must be repeatable. Given these minimal requirements, we show that the heat will necessarily be a classically fluctuating quantity.},

abstract = {Nature imposes many restrictions on the operations that we perform. Many of these restrictions can be interpreted in terms of {\it resource} required to realize the operations. Classifying required resource for different types of operations and determining the amount of resource are the crucial subjects in physics. Among many types of operations, a unitary operation is one of the most fundamental operation that has been studied for long time in terms of the resource implicitly and explicitly. Yet, it is a long standing open problem to identify the resource and to clarify the necessary and sufficient amount of resource for implementing a general unitary operation under conservation laws. In this paper, we provide a solution to this open problem. We derive an asymptotically exact equality that clarifies the necessary and sufficient amount of quantum coherence as a resource to implement arbitrary unitary operation within a desired error. In this equality, the required coherence cost is asymptotically expressed with the implementation error and the degree of violation of conservation law in the desired unitary operation. We also discuss the underlying physics in several physical situations from the viewpoint of coherence cost based on the equality. This work does not only provide a solution to a long-standing problem on the unitary control, but also clarifies the key question of the resource theory of the quantum channels in the region of resource theory of asymmetry, for the case of unitary channels.},

@article{Karasawa2007,
abstract = {In recent investigations, it has been found that conservation laws generally lead to precision limits on quantum computing. Lower bounds of the error probability have been obtained for various logic operations from the commutation relation between the noise operator and the conserved quantity or from the recently developed universal uncertainty principle for the noise-disturbance trade-off in general measurements. However, the problem of obtaining the precision limit to realizing the quantum NOT gate has eluded a solution from these approaches. Here, we develop a method for this problem based on analyzing the trace distance between the output state from the realization under consideration and the one from the ideal gate. Using the mathematical apparatus of orthogonal polynomials, we obtain a general lower bound on the error probability for the realization of the quantum NOT gate in terms of the number of qubits in the control system under conservation of the total angular momentum of the computational qubit plus the control system along the direction used to encode the computational basis. The lower bound turns out to be more stringent than one might expect from previous results. Our method is expected to lead to more accurate estimates for physical realizations of various types of quantum computations under conservation laws and to contribute to related problems such as the accuracy of programmable quantum processors. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Marvian2020,
abstract = {According to an elementary result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using 2-local unitaries, i.e., those which act only on two subsystems. Beside its fundamental importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. We ask if such universality remains valid in the presence of conservation laws and global symmetries. In particular, can k-local symmetric unitaries on a composite system generate all symmetric unitaries on that system? Interestingly, it turns out that the answer is negative in the case of continuous symmetries, such as U(1) and SO(3): unless there are interactions which act non-trivially on every subsystem in the system, some symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented using symmetric Hamiltonians. In fact, the difference between the dimensions of the Lie algebra of all symmetric Hamiltonians and its subalgebra generated by k-local symmetric Hamiltonians with a fixed k, constantly increases with the system size (i.e., the number of subsystems). On the other hand, in the case of group U(1), we find that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if one is allowed to use a pair of ancillary qubits. In particular, any unitary which is invariant under rotations around z, can be implemented using Hamiltonians XX+YY and local Z on qubits. We discuss some implications of these results in the context of quantum thermodynamics and quantum computing.},

abstract = {The ideas of thermodynamics have proved fruitful in the setting of quantum information theory, in particular the notion that when the allowed transformations of a system are restricted, certain states of the system become useful resources with which one can prepare previously inaccessible states. The theory of entanglement is perhaps the best-known and most well-understood resource theory in this sense. Here we return to the basic questions of thermodynamics using the formalism of resource theories developed in quantum information theory and show that the free energy of thermodynamics emerges naturally from the resource theory of energy-preserving transformations. Specifically, the free energy quantifies the amount of useful work which can be extracted from asymptotically-many copies of a quantum system when using only reversible energy-preserving transformations and a thermal bath at fixed temperature. The free energy also quantifies the rate at which resource states can be reversibly interconverted asymptotically, provided that a sublinear amount of coherent superposition over energy levels is available, a situation analogous to the sublinear amount of classical communication required for entanglement dilution.},

The engine is constituted of a system $\mathcal{S}$, a weight $\mathcal{W}$, and a Maxwell demon $\mathcal{D}$, and extracts work via measurement-assisted feedback control. By imposing natural constraints on the measurement and feedback processes, such as energy conservation and leaving the memory of the demon intact, we show that while the engine can function without heat from a thermal reservoir, it must give up at least one of the following features that are satisfied by a standard Szilard engine: (i) repeatability of measurements; (ii) invariant weight entropy; or (iii) positive work extraction for all measurement outcomes. This result is shown to be a consequence of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem, which imposes restrictions on the observables that can be measured under additive conservation laws. This observation is a first-step towards developing "second-law-like" relations for measurement-assisted feedback control beyond thermality.},

abstract = {Uncertainty relations are one of the fundamental principles in physics. It began as a fundamental limitation in quantum mechanics, and today the word {\it uncertainty relation} is a generic term for various trade-off relations in nature. In this letter, we improve the Kennard-Robertson uncertainty relation, and clarify how much coherence we need to implement quantum measurement under conservation laws. Our approach systematically improves and reproduces the previous various refinements of the Kennard-Robertson inequality. As a direct consequence of our inequalities, we improve a well-known limitation of quantum measurements, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase-Ozawa theorem. This improvement gives an asymptotic equality for the necessary and sufficient amount of coherence to implement a quantum measurement with the desired accuracy under conservation laws.},

If an operator A is invariant under a quantum operation $\phi$, we call A a $\phi$-fixed point. Physically, the $\phi$-fixed points are the operators that are not disturbed by the action of $\phi$. Our main purpose is to answer the following question. If A is a $\phi$-fixed point, is A compatible with the operation elements of $\phi$? We shall show in general that the answer is no and we shall give some sufficient conditions under which the answer is yes. Our results will follow from some general theorems concerning completely positive maps and injectivity of operator systems and von Neumann algebras. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Observations in Quantum Mechanics are subject to complex restrictions arising from the principle of energy conservation. Determining such restrictions, however, has been so far an elusive task, and only partial results are known. In this paper we discuss how constraints on the energy spectrum of a measurement device translate into limitations on the measurements which we can effect on a target system with non-trivial energy operator. We provide efficient algorithms to characterize such limitations and we quantify them exactly when the target is a two-level quantum system. Our work thus identifies the boundaries between what is possible or impossible to measure, i.e., between what we can see or not, when energy conservation is at stake.},

abstract = {A spin chain extending from Alice to Bob with nearest neighbors interactions, initially in its ground state, is considered. Assuming that Bob measures the last spin of the chain, the energy of the spin chain has to increase, at least on average, due to the measurement disturbance. Presumably, the energy is provided by Bob's measurement apparatus. Assuming that, simultaneously to Bob's measurement, Alice measures the first spin, it is shown that either energy is not conserved, – implausible – or the projection postulate doesn't apply, and that there is signalling. An explicit measurement model shows that energy is conserved (as expected), but that the spin chain energy increase is not provided by the measurement apparatus(es), that the projection postulate is not always valid – illustrating the Wigner–Araki–Yanase (WAY) theorem – and that there is signalling, indeed. The signalling is due to the non-local interaction Hamiltonian. This raises the question of whether a suitable quantum-information-inspired model of such non-local Hamiltonians can be developed.},

Incompatibility is a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum theory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous impossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ``no-cloning'' and ``no information without disturbance''; these can be all seen as statements about incompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a concise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility.},

We note that for conservation laws to hold exactly for quantum systems in this sense (not just on average), it is necessary to assume the so-called "totalitarian property of quantum theory", namely that any system capable of measuring a quantum observable must itself be quantised. Hence, if conservation laws are to hold exactly, the idea of a `classical measuring apparatus' (i.e., not subject to the branching structure) is untenable. We also point out that any other principle having a well-defined formulation within classical physics, such as the Equivalence principle, is also to be extended to the quantum domain in exactly the same way, i.e., branch by branch.},

The expectation value of the Hamiltonian of a system can clearly change when wave functions collapse in accordance with the standard textbook (Copenhagen) treatment of quantum measurement, but one might imagine that the change in energy is compensated by the measuring apparatus or environment. We show that this is not true; the change in the energy of a state after measurement can be arbitrarily large, independent of the physical measurement process. In Everettian quantum theory, while the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is conserved for the wave function of the universe (including all the branches), it is not constant within individual worlds. It should therefore be possible to experimentally measure violations of conservation of energy, and we suggest an experimental protocol for doing so.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a definition for conditional energy changes due to general quantum measurements, as the change in the conditional energy evaluated before, and after, the measurement process. By imposing minimal physical requirements on these conditional energies, we show that the most general expression for the conditional energy after the measurement is simply the expected value of the Hamiltonian given the post-measurement state. Conversely, the conditional energy before the measurement process is shown to be given by the real component of the weak value of the Hamiltonian. Our definition generalises well-known notions of distributions of internal energy change, such as that given by stochastic thermodynamics. By determining the conditional energy change of both system and measurement apparatus, we obtain the full conditional work statistics of quantum measurements, and show that this vanishes for all measurement outcomes if the measurement process conserves the total energy. Additionally, by incorporating the measurement process within a cyclic heat engine, we quantify the non-recoverable work due to measurements. This is shown to always be non-negative, thus satisfying the second law, and will be independent of the apparatus specifics for two classes of projective measurements.},

@article{Gudder2008,
abstract = {Our basic structure is a finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space $H$. We point out that the set of effects on $H$ form a convex effect algebra. Although the set of operators on $H$ also form a convex effect algebra, they have a more detailed structure. W introduce sequential products of effect and operations. Although these have already been studied, we introduce the new concept of sequential products of effects with operations and operations with effects. We then consider various special types of operations. After developing properties of these concepts, the results are generalized to include observables and instruments. In particular, sequential products of observables with instruments and instruments with observables are developed. Finally, we consider conditioning and coexistence of observables and instruments.},

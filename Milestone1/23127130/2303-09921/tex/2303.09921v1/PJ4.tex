Such a transition can be convenientlyquantified by a nonzero value of an order parameter $P$ which, in the usuallyconsidered case of spin $s=1/2$ fermions, can be defined to have the meaningof the polarization (magnetization) $P=(N_\uparrow-N_\downarrow)/N$,$N=N_\uparrow+N_\downarrow$ of the system. (An analogous order parametercan be defined in the general case of spin $s>1/2$ if a specific patternof the ordering is assumed.)Theoretical investigation of this transition at zero temperature reduces tocomputing the energy density of the system of $N$ fermions enclosed in thevolume $V$ as a function of the densities of different spin projections (oras a function of the chosen order parameter) and taking the thermodynamic limit.Such computations are most easily performed using the effective field theoryapproach within which the underlying spatially non-local binary interaction offermions is replaced by a (in principle infinite) set of local operators ofdecreasing length dimension and which yields the expansion of thecomputed energy density in powers (in higher orders modified also bylogarithms) of the (overall) Fermi wave vector\begin{eqnarray}  k_{\rm F}=\left({6\pi^2\over g_s}~\!{N\over V}\right)^{1/3},\phantom{aaa}  g_s=2s+1~\!,\end{eqnarray}of the system. The expansion obtained in this way is naturally parametrizedby the scattering lengths $a_\ell$, effective radii $r_\ell$, etc.,$\ell=0,1,\dots,$ which characterize the elastic scattering of low energyfermions ``in vacuum'' and which are taken to specify the underlyinginteraction potential. This approach, pioneered in \cite{HamFur00} (seealso \cite{HamFur02,KolckiSka}), allowed to complete recently \cite{WeDrSch}the order $k_{\rm F}^4$ (with respect to the energy of the system of completelynon-interacting fermions) corrections to the ground state of the system of spin$s$ fermions with equal densities of different spin projections. Using thisapproach it was also easy to reproduce (semi-analytically) but in the universalsetting the old (obtained by considering the specific model of hard spheresinteraction) result of Kanno\cite{KANNO} who computed (fully analytically) the order $k_{\rm F}^2$ correctionto the ground state of the system of spin $1/2$ fermions \cite{CHWO1} for anarbitrary value of the system's polarization $P$. The effective theory approachallows to immediately extend \cite{PECABO} the result of Kanno to the case ofspin $s$ fermions:the complete up to the order $k_{\rm F}^2$ formula for the ground state energydensity $E_\Omega/V$ as a function of the densities of fermions havingdifferent spin projections can be now written in the form\footnote{The order  $k_{\rm F}$ correction is the extension (obvious from the effective field  theory point of view) of the textbook  \cite{Kesio,Pathria} mean-field result to the case of spin $s$ fermions.}\begin{eqnarray}  {E_\Omega\over V}={k_{\rm F}^3\over6\pi^2}~\!{3\over5}~\!  {\hbar^2k_{\rm F}^2\over2m_f}\left\{\sum_{\sigma=1}^{g_s} x_\sigma^5  +{20\over9\pi}~\!k_{\rm F}a_0\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}x_{\sigma^\prime}^3x_\sigma^3   +{2\over\pi^2}~\!(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  J_K(x_{\sigma^\prime},x_\sigma,)\right\},\label{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}\end{eqnarray}in which \begin{eqnarray}  x_\sigma={p_{{\rm F}\sigma}\over k_{\rm F}}~\!,\phantom{aaaa}  p_{{\rm F}\sigma}=\left({6\pi^2}~\!{N_\sigma\over V}\right)^{1/3},\label{eqn:Defs}\end{eqnarray}and \begin{eqnarray}  J_K(x,y)={1\over21}\left\{  (22~\! x^3y^3 (x + y) - 4~\!x ^7 \ln\!\left(1+{y\over x}\right) -   4~\!y^7 \ln\!\left(1+{x\over y}\right)\right.\nonumber\\  + {1\over2}~\!x~\!y~\!(x - y)^2 (x + y) [15~\!(x^2 + y^2) + 11~\! x~\! y]  \phantom{aaaaa}~\nonumber\\   \left.- {7\over4} (x - y)^4 (x + y) ((x + y)^2 + x~\!y)      \ln\!\left({x+y\over x-y}\right)\right\},\phantom{a}~\label{eqn:JKanno}\end{eqnarray}is the function obtained by Kanno in his computation \cite{KANNO}.The extension to $s>1/2$ is of obvious interest in view of the fact thatthe systems of interacting fermions (and bosons) are nowadays investigatedin experiments with cold atoms in which the interaction strengthcan be tuned by exploiting the physics of the so-called Feshbach resonance.The system of spin of $1/2$ fermions with the (spin independent) repulsiveinteraction constitutes the simple, textbook example \cite{Kesio,Pathria} ofthe continuous phase transition because such a character of the paramagneticto ferromagnetic transition to the ordered state (signaled by the emergenceof spontaneous magnetization), both when it is induced by decreasingthe temperature and by increasing the density and/or the interaction strengths(that is when the value of the parameter $k_{\rm F}a_0$ is increased) is foundwhen the computations are restricted to the mean field approximation (only theorder $k_{\rm F}a_0$ corrections to the thermodynamic functions are taken intoaccount).%the phenomenon of the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition (signaled%by the emergence of spontaneous magnetization) and, more generally, of a%continuous phase transition because such a character of the transition to the%ordered state, both when it is induced by decreasing the temperature and when%increasing the density and/or the interaction strenghts (that is when the%value of the parameter $k_{\rm F}a_0$ is increased) is found when the%computations are restricted to the mean field approximation (only the order%$k_{\rm F}a_0$ corrections to the thermodynamic functions are taken into%account).However when the order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2$ corrections are includedthis transition turns at low temperatures into the ordinary first order one ashas been found in \cite{DUMacDO} and at exactly $T=0$ can be easily confirmedby using the formula (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}) \cite{CHWO2,PECABO}.Although in this approximation the transition at zero temperature occurs at$k_{\rm F}a_0=1.054$ at which value theperturbative expansion cannot most probably be trusted,such a character of the transition seemed to be in line with the arguments\cite{BeKiVoj} based on general principles of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. On the other hand in the series of papers \cite{He} (overlooked in\cite{CHWO1,CHWO2}) the ground state energy of the system of spin $1/2$fermions as a function of the polarization $P$ has been computed beyonda fixed order, by performing a resummation of an infinite subclass of theeffective field theory diagrams contributing to it. As the authors of thesepapers claim, the transition to the ordered state at $T=0$ becomes thenagain of the continuous type. Moreover, the critical value of the parameter$k_{\rm F}a_0$ found by them is in a surprisingly good agreement with theestimates based on the Quantum Monte Carlo computations reported in\cite{QMC10}. While assessing the reliability of the approximations made in\cite{He} is in general difficult, it might be instructive to see, using thecomplete order $k_{\rm F}^3$ corrections, which we have recently computed in\cite{CHWO3} in the case of spin $1/2$, how the third order termsincluded in the resummation compare with the ones neglected and how the character of the phase transition changes when it is analyzed using the complete third order formula for the ground state energy. In viewof the mentioned circumstance that inexperimental setups the role of fermions are played by cold atomic gases which can have spins greater than $1/2$, it is also of interest to investigatethe transition in the case of higher spins. Finally, according to the powercounting rules which organize the expansion within the effective field theory\cite{Weinberg,HamFur00}, in the order $k_{\rm F}^3$ to the energy contribute density for the first time interaction operators involving in addition to fourfermion field operators also two spatial derivatives which bring in thedependence on the $p$-wave scattering length $a_1$ and the $s$-wave effectiveradius $r_0$ which parametrize the departure of the result from strictunversality. It is therefore natural to check their potential impact on thephase transition. Therefore the plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section, toprepare the ground, we recall the effective theory approach allowing toeasily recover the order $k_{\rm F}a_0$ and $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2$ (this onesemi-analytically) corrections in (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}).Then, in Section \ref{sec:Third} and \ref{sec:HigherDimOps} we determinethe next order correction to the formula (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder})adapting appropriately the computation \cite{CHWO3} of the third ordercorrection to the ground state energy of the arbitrarily polarized gas ofspin $1/2$ fermions. The discussion of the approach of \cite{He}is included in Section \ref{sec:Third}. The character of the transitionto the ordered state is discussed in Section \ref{sec:PhTr}. %Theoretical investigation of such a transition,%taking into account its temperature profile, requires the complicated machinery%of statistical mechanics. The concrete results that have been obtained%use either the mean field approximation which allows to perform the%computations analytically or in \section{Second order corrections}As said, the effective theory naturally yields an expansion of the computedquantities in powers of the product $kR$ of the wave vector $k$ correspondingto the characteristic energy scale of the problem and of the characteristiclength scale $R$ of the ``fundamental'' interaction potential. In the case ofthe corrections to the ground state energy of the gas of fermions the role ofthe characteristic wave vector plays the Fermi wave vector $k_{\rm F}$ definedin (\ref{eqn:Defs}) and they are most conveniently computed (using the standardFeynman rules formulated e.g. in \cite{FetWal}) as the sum of connected``vacuum'' diagrams using the Dyson expansion of the right hand side of theformula\begin{eqnarray}  \lim_{T\rightarrow\infty}\exp(-iT(E_\Omega-E_{\Omega_0})/\hbar)=  \lim_{T\rightarrow\infty}\langle\Omega_0  |{\rm T}\exp\!\left(-{i\over\hbar}\!\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}\!dt~\!  V^I_{\rm int}(t)\right)\!|\Omega_0\rangle~\!,\label{eqn:basicFormula}\end{eqnarray}in which $|\Omega_0\rangle$ is the ground state of the free Hamiltonian inthe $N$-fermion subspace of the Fock space, $V^I_{\rm int}(t)$ is the theoryinteraction operator $V_{\rm int}$ taken in the interaction picture and thelimits $T\rightarrow\infty$, $V\rightarrow\infty$ are implicit (T standsfor the chronological product.If, as assumed, the underlying ''fundamental'' interaction of spin $s$fermions is spin-independent and (in the infinite volume limit) Galileoinvariant, $V_{\rm int}$ in (\ref{eqn:basicFormula}) is the effective theoryinteraction operator\footnote{The absence of the $\sigma^\prime=\sigma$term in the sum is the immediate consequence of the anticommutativity of thefermionic field operators; in \cite{CHWO1}, where only the spin $s=1/2$ wastreated, the sum in (\ref{eqn:Veff}) consisted a single term only.}of the form \cite{HamFur00}\begin{eqnarray} V_{\rm int}=C_0\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{x}\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}\psi_{\sigma^\prime}^\dagger\psi_{\sigma^\prime}\psi_\sigma^\dagger\psi_\sigma+V_{\rm int}^{(C_2)}+V_{\rm int}^{(C_2^\prime)}+\dots,  \label{eqn:Veff}\end{eqnarray}The terms $V_{\rm int}^{(C_2)}$ and$V_{\rm int}^{(C_2^\prime)}$, which will be specified in Section\ref{sec:HigherDimOps}, involve two spatial derivatives and are of lowerlength dimension than the first one; the ellipsis stands for otheroperators of yet lower length dimension.Despite the infinite number of interaction terms in (\ref{eqn:Veff}),to a term proportional to a given power\footnote{Terms proportional to  higher powers of $(kR)$ are also modified by logarithms \cite{HamFur00}.}of $(kR)$ in the computed quantity contributes only a finite number ofFeynman diagrams (constructed using only a finite subset of the interactionterms of (\ref{eqn:Veff})) - only those dictated by the so-called powercounting rules \cite{Weinberg,HamFur00}.The couplings $C_0$, $C_2$, $C_2^\prime,\dots$ of the effective theoryare fixed by matching the amplitude of the elastic fermion-fermionscattering computed using the effective theory onto the general formof such an amplitude expanded in powers of the relative particle momentaand parametrized by the scattering lengths $a_\ell$, the effective radii $r_\ell$,etc. which with the sufficient accuracy characterize  the ``fundamental''binary interaction. Of course, since the effective interaction is local,divergences appear and must be regularized (in \cite{CHWO1} a cutoff$\Lambda$ on the wave vectors circulating in loops have been imposed); therelations between computed physical quantities like $a_\ell$,$r_\ell$, $E_\Omega,\dots$ and the effective theory parameters $C_0$, $C_2,\dots$depend then on the regularization but this dependence disappears when thecomputed energy is expressed in terms of the scattering lengths and radii.To the order which is needed to compute the third order corrections tothe ground state energy of the gas of fermionsthe relations between the couplings $C_0$, $C_2$ and $C_2^\prime$and the scattering lengths $a_0$, $a_1$ and the radius $r_0$ are known\cite{WeDrSch} and (when the cutoff $\Lambda$ is used as the regulator) read\begin{eqnarray}  C_0(\Lambda)={4\pi\hbar^2\over m_f}~\!a_0\left(1  +{2\over\pi}~\!a_0\Lambda+{4\over\pi^2}~\!a^2_0\Lambda^2+\dots\right), \phantom{aaaaaaa}\! \label{eqn:C0Determined}\\ C_2(\Lambda)={4\pi\hbar^2\over m_f}~\!{1\over2}~\!a_0^2r_0+\dots~\!, \phantom{aaaa} C_2^\prime(\Lambda) ={4\pi\hbar^2\over m_f}~\!a_1^3+\dots~\!. \label{eqn:C2C2primeDetermined}\end{eqnarray}\begin{figure}[]\begin{center}%\begin{tabular}{lp{280\unitlength}}\begin{picture}(370,40)(5,0)\ArrowArc(30,20)(25,70,290)\DashArrowArc(30,20)(25,290,70){2}%\DashArrowArc(50,20)(25,110,250){2}\ArrowArc(50,20)(25,250,110)\Vertex(40,-2.5){2}\Vertex(40,42.5){2}%\Text(155,30)[]{$A_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)=$}\Vertex(190,30){2}\ArrowArc(210,35)(20,195,345)\DashArrowArcn(210,25)(20,165,15){2}\Vertex(230,30){2}\Text(215,50)[]{$^{-k+q~\sigma^\prime}$}\Text(215,8)[]{$_{k~\sigma}$}%\Text(295,30)[]{$B_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)=$}\Vertex(330,30){2}\ArrowArc(350,35)(20,195,345)\DashArrowArc(350,25)(20,15,165){2}\Vertex(370,30){2}\Text(355,50)[]{$^{k~\sigma^\prime}$}\Text(355,8)[]{$_{k+q~\sigma}$}%\end{picture}\end{center}\caption{The only type of diagrams contributing to the order $(k_{\rm F}R)^2$  correction to the ground state energy of the gas of spin $s$ fermions and  two ``elementary'' one-loop diagrams out of which the second  order and the third order corrections with the $C_0$ couplings can be  constructed.

The correction of order $k_{\rm F}a_0$is therefore given by the sum over all possible choices of the (different)pairs of spin projections $\sigma^\prime$ and $\sigma$ circulating in thetwo loops of a simple two-loop diagram that can be formed by sewingtogether the corresponding pairs of lines representing theinteraction vertex proportional to $C_0$ while that of order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2$are given by the similar sum over spin projections circulatingin the three-loop diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig:ElementaryLoops} on theleft. This diagram can be composed in three equivalent ways (correspondingto different assignments of the momenta to its internal lines):\begin{eqnarray}  {1\over i\hbar}~\!{E^{(2)}_\Omega\over V}  ={1\over2!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^2\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\![A_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)]^2  ={1\over2!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^2\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\![B_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)]^2\nonumber\\  ={1\over2!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^2\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\!B_{\sigma,\sigma}(q)~\!  B_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma^\prime}(q)~\!,\phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}  \label{eqn:ProductsOfTwoBlocks}\end{eqnarray}out of the two ``elementary blocks'' (corresponding to thetwo ``elementary'' loops shown in Figure \ref{fig:ElementaryLoops})\begin{eqnarray}A_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)=\int\!{d^3\mathbf{k}\over(2\pi)^3}~\!i\!\left[{\theta(|\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})~\!    \theta(|\mathbf{k}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\overq^0-\omega_{\mathbf{k}}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q}}+i0}  -{\theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q}|)~\!    \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{k}|)\over    q^0-\omega_{\mathbf{k}}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q}}-i0}\right],\phantom{a}\nonumber\\\label{eqn:blockA}\\B_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)=\int\!{d^3\mathbf{k}\over(2\pi)^3}~\!i\!\left[-{\theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{k}|)~\!    \theta(|\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\overq^0+\omega_{\mathbf{k}}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q}}+i0}  +{\theta(|\mathbf{k}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})~\!    \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q}|)\overq^0+\omega_{\mathbf{k}}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q}}-i0}\right],\nonumber\\\label{eqn:blockB}\end{eqnarray}in which $\omega_{\mathbf{k}}=\hbar\mathbf{k}^2/2m_f$, obtained by the standardintegration over $k^0$ using the residue method. Each of these ``blocks'' is asum of two parts - those in the ``elementary block'' $A_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)$which will be needed in the discussion of the approach of \cite{He}, can begiven the interpretation as corresponding to the propagation of two particles(the first part) and the propagation of two holes (the other part). In eitherform of (\ref{eqn:ProductsOfTwoBlocks}) after the integration over $dq^0$ onlytwo (out of the possible four) terms are nonzero (and equal to one another),because in the two others all poles are on the same side of the real $q^0$ axis.The final form of the order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2$ contribution to the energydensity is obtained (see \cite{CHWO1}) by making the appropriate changeof the remaining integration variables. In this way one arrives at\begin{eqnarray}  {E^{(2)}_\Omega\over V}={64m_fC_0^2\over\hbar^2(2\pi)^6}\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})~\!,\end{eqnarray}with the function $J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})=J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ given by the integral \begin{eqnarray}  J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})  =\int_0^{s_{\rm max}}\!ds~\!s^2~\!{1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{t}~\!  \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{s}|)~\!  \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{t}-\mathbf{s}|)~\!  g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)~\!,\label{eqn:JfunctionDef}\end{eqnarray}in which $s_{\rm max}={1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$.The function $g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)\equivg_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(|\mathbf{t}|,~\!|\mathbf{s}|)=g_{\sigma,\sigma^\prime}(t,s)$given by the integral (symmetric in the labels $\sigma$ and $\sigma^\prime$)\begin{eqnarray}g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)\equiv{1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{u}~\!{\theta(|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})\theta(|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\over \mathbf{t}^2-\mathbf{u}^2+i0}\nonumber\\=-\Lambda+g^{\rm fin}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)+{t^2\over\Lambda}+\dots,\phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaa}\label{eqn:g(t,s)functionDef}\end{eqnarray}has been obtained in \cite{CHWO1} in the analytic form which assumes (withoutloosing generality) that $p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}\leq p_{{\rm F}\sigma}$:\begin{eqnarray}  g^{\rm fin}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)={1\over2}~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma}  +{t\over4}\ln{(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-t)^2-s^2\over(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+t)^2-s^2}  +{p^2_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s^2-t^2\over8s}\ln{(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+s)^2    -t^2\over(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s)^2-t^2}~\!,\label{eqn:g(t,s)Explicit1}\end{eqnarray}when $0<s\leq{1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})$ and\begin{eqnarray}  g^{\rm fin}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)={1\over4}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+p_{{\rm F}\sigma}  +2s)+{t\over4}\ln{p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+s-t\over p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+s+t}  +{t\over4}\ln{p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+s-t\over p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+s+t}\phantom{aaaaaaaaa}  \nonumber\\  +~\!{p^2_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-t^2-s^2\over8s}  \ln{(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+s)^2-t^2\over u_0^2-t^2}  +{p^2_{{\rm F}\sigma}-t^2-s^2\over8s}  \ln{(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+s)^2-t^2\over u_0^2-t^2}~\!,\label{eqn:g(t,s)Explicit2}\end{eqnarray}where\begin{eqnarray}  u_0^2={1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^2+p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2)-s^2~\!,  \label{eqn:u0squared}\end{eqnarray}when ${1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})<s\leq s_{\rm max}$.It is convenient to write the function$J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ as the sum\begin{eqnarray}  J=J_{\rm div}+J_{\rm fin}+J_{1/\Lambda}+\dots,\nonumber\end{eqnarray}where the successive terms directly correspond to the terms in(\ref{eqn:g(t,s)functionDef}). $J_{\rm fin}$ is therefore independent of thecutoff $\Lambda$ while $J_{1/\Lambda}$ and the ellipsis stand for terms vanishingin the limit $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$.

The cutoffindependent terms of (\ref{eqn:C0Correction}) give then the term proportionalto $k_{\rm F}a_0$ in (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder})and the terms proportional to inverse powers of $\Lambda$ (which would beabsent, if the dimensional regularization was used instead of the cutoff$\Lambda$) can be, if the computation is restricted to the second order,simply discarded. In the computation including higher order corrections theycancel against similar spurious contributions arising in higher orders.If the densities of fermions having different spin projections are allequal ($N_\sigma=N/g_s$, $p_{{\rm F}\sigma}=k_{\rm F}$ for all $\sigma=1,\dots,g_s$),one numerically finds that\begin{eqnarray}  J_{\rm fin}(k_{\rm F},k_{\rm F})={k_{\rm F}^7\over840}~\!(11-2\ln2)~\!.\nonumber\end{eqnarray}The sum over pairs of different spin projections gives in this case the factor${1\over2}g_s(g_s-1)$ and one recovers the well known old result re-derived in\cite{HamFur00} using the effective field theory. If the densities offermions with different spin projections are not equal, numerical evaluationof the integrals defining the function$J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ shows it is proportional to thefunction $J_K$ (\ref{eqn:JKanno}) introduced by Kanno the precise relationbeing\footnote{From the formulae (\ref{eqn:JfunctionDef}) and  (\ref{eqn:g(t,s)functionDef}) it is clear that  $J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\equiv  J(x_{\sigma^\prime}k_{\rm F},~\!x_\sigma k_{\rm F})=  k_{\rm F}^7J(x_{\sigma^\prime},~\!x_{\sigma})$.}\begin{eqnarray}  160~\!J_{\rm fin}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma})  =k_{\rm F}^7J_K(x_{\sigma^\prime},~\!x_\sigma)~\!.\nonumber\end{eqnarray}This leads to the result (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder})obtained recently in a somewhat different way in \cite{PECABO}.\section{Third order corrections proportional to $C_0^3$}\label{sec:Third}According to the power counting rules the order$(k_{\rm F}R)^3$ corrections to the ground state energy density arise fromthe four-loop diagrams with three interaction vertices proportional to $C_0$and from the two-loop diagrams with a single $C_2$ or $C_2^\prime$ interactionvertex (the terms $V_{\rm int}^{(C_2)}$ and $V_{\rm int}^{(C_2^\prime)}$ in(\ref{eqn:Veff})). In this section we work out the contribution of thefirst class of diagrams; the contribution of diagrams with the verticesgenerated by the interaction terms proportional to $C_2$ and $C_2^\prime$will be computed in Section \ref{sec:HigherDimOps}.\begin{figure}[]\begin{center}%\begin{tabular}{lp{280\unitlength}}\begin{picture}(360,80)(5,0)  \ArrowArc(40,40)(40,330,90)  \ArrowArc(40,40)(40,90,210)  \ArrowArc(40,40)(40,180,360)  \Vertex(74,20){2}  \Vertex(6,20){2}  \Vertex(40,80){2}  \DashArrowArcn(40,-53)(80,115,65){2}  \DashArrowArcn(120,86)(80,235,185){2}  \DashArrowArcn(-40,86)(80,355,305){2}  %\Text(60,-5)[]{$a)$}  \ArrowArc(200,40)(40,330,90)  \ArrowArc(200,40)(40,90,210)  \ArrowArc(200,40)(40,180,360)  \Vertex(234,20){2}  \Vertex(166,20){2}  \Vertex(200,80){2}  \DashArrowArc(200,-53)(80,65,115){2}  \DashArrowArc(280,86)(80,185,235){2}  \DashArrowArc(120,86)(80,305,355){2}  %\Text(60,-5)[]{$a)$}  \DashArrowArc(320,40)(40,330,90){3}  \DashArrowArc(320,40)(40,90,210){1}  \ArrowArc(320,40)(40,210,330)  \Vertex(354,20){2}  \Vertex(286,20){2}  \Vertex(320,80){2}  \ArrowArc(320,-53)(80,65,115)  \DashArrowArc(400,86)(80,185,235){3}  \DashArrowArc(240,86)(80,305,355){1}  %\Text(60,-5)[]{$a)$}%\end{picture}\end{center}\caption{The single particle-particle and two different particle-hole  vacuum diagrams contributing in the order $C^3_0$ to $E_\Omega$.

The first one is the so-calledparticle-particle diagram while the remaining two are called particle-holediagrams.The contribution of the order $C_0^3$ particle-particle diagram shown inFigure \ref{fig:C0cube} on the left is (2 is the combinatoric factor)\begin{eqnarray}  {1\over i\hbar}~\!{E^{(3){\rm pp}}_\Omega\over V}  ={1\over3!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^3 2\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\![A_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)]^3~\!,  \label{eqn:ThreeAblocksComposed}\end{eqnarray}As it is clear from the spin structure of the interaction termproportional to $C_0$ and the flow of the spin projections in thediagram, the sum runs only over pairs of different spin projectionlabels $\sigma^\prime\neq\sigma$. There are $g_s(g_s-1)/2$ such pairs and,if densities of fermions with different spin projections are all equal,the summation reproduces the usual spin factor associated withthis contribution \cite{HamFur00}. For the sake of further discussionwe note that the product of three $A$-''blocks'' gives rise to$2^3=8$ terms out of two are killed by the integration over $dq^0$(they have all poles on the same side of the real $q^0$ axis)while the remaining six split into three identical terms which arisefrom the products of two terms corresponding in (\ref{eqn:blockA})- appealing to the interpretation of the two terms of the $A$-''block'' -to the propagation of ``particles'' and one corresponding to thepropagation of holes and another three identical ones in whichthis composition is reversed.As a result this contribution to the energy density can be writtenin terms of two functions, $G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$,and $G^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ (correspondingrespectively to these two kinds of compositions): \begin{eqnarray}  {E^{(3){\rm pp}}_\Omega\over V}  ={128m_f^2C_0^3\over(2\pi)^8\hbar^4}\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \left[G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})    +G^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})    \right].\end{eqnarray}The functions $G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ and$G^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ are given by the integrals \begin{eqnarray} G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})=\!\int_0^{s_{\rm max}}\!\!ds~\!s^2~\!  {1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{t}~\!  \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{t}+\mathbf{s}|)~\!  \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{t}-\mathbf{s}|)~\!  (g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s))^2~\!,\phantom{a}\!\label{eqn:G1FunctionDef}\end{eqnarray}\begin{eqnarray} G^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})=\!\int_0^{s_{\rm max}}\!\!ds~\!s^2~\!  {1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{t}~\!  \theta(|\mathbf{t}+\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})~\!  \theta(|\mathbf{t}-\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma})~\!  (h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s))^2~\!,\phantom{a}\!\label{eqn:G2FunctionDef}\end{eqnarray}in which $g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$ is the function defined by(\ref{eqn:g(t,s)functionDef}) and$h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)\equiv h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(|\mathbf{t}|,|\mathbf{s}|)=h_{\sigma,\sigma^\prime}(t,s)$ is given by the finite integral\begin{eqnarray}  h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)={1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{u}~\!  {\theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{s}|)    \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{s}|)\over    \mathbf{t}^2-\mathbf{u}^2-i0}~\!.\label{eqn:h(t,s)functionDef}\end{eqnarray}The explicit form of the function $h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$ has beenobtained\footnote{Analysis of the integration domains of  (\ref{eqn:h(t,s)functionDef}) shows that the pole at$\mathbf{t}^2=\mathbf{u}^2$ is never reached.}using the same method (based on the trick introduced in Appendix C of\cite{FUHATI}) by which the function $g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$ has beencomputed in \cite{CHWO1}. Assuming without loss of generalitythat $p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}\leq p_{{\rm F}\sigma}$, it reads\begin{eqnarray}  h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)=-{1\over2}~\!p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}  -{t\over4}\ln{t-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)\over t+(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)}  -{t\over4}\ln{t-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+s)\over t+(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+s)}  \phantom{aaaaaaaa}\nonumber\\  +~\!{t^2-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^2-s^2)\over8s}  \ln{t^2-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}+s)^2\over t^2-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)^2}~\!,  \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}~ \label{eqn:h(t,s)Explicit:slts0}\end{eqnarray}if $0\leq s\leq {1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})$, and ($u^2_0$is again given by (\ref{eqn:u0squared}))\begin{eqnarray}  h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)  ={1\over2}\left(2s-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}\right)  -{t\over4}\ln{t-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)\over t+(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)}  -{t\over4}\ln{t-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s)\over t+(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s)}  \phantom{aaaaaa}\nonumber\\    -{1\over8s}\left[(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s)^2+(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)^2-2u_0^2\right]    \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}\label{eqn:h(t,s)Explicit:s0gts}\\    -~\!{t^2-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2+s^2\over8s}    \ln{t^2-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s)^2\over t^2-u_0^2}   -{t^2-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^2+s^2\over8s}   \ln{t^2-(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-s)^2\over t^2-u_0^2}~\!,\nonumber\end{eqnarray}if ${1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})\leq s\leq s_{\rm max}={1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})$. Expanding  both theseexpression one finds that the function $h_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$ behavesas $1/t^2$ when $t=|\mathbf{t}|\rightarrow\infty$. Therefore, although theintegral over $d^3\mathbf{t}$ in (\ref{eqn:G2FunctionDef}) covers theinfinite exterior of the two Fermi spheres, it is convergent - unlike thefunction $G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ which depends on thedivergent function $g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$, the function $G^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ is finite.\vskip0.1cmSince the remaining order $C_0^3$ contributions to $E_\Omega/V$ will turn outfinite, already at this point one can check the cancellation of ultravioletdivergences in the expression\begin{eqnarray}  {\Delta E_\Omega\over V}=\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}\left[    {p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^3p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^3\over36\pi^4}~\!C_0  +{64 m_fC_0^2\over(2\pi)^6\hbar^2}~\!J(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})  +{128m_f^2C_0^3\over(2\pi)^8\hbar^4}~\!  G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\right]+\dots\nonumber\end{eqnarray}Inserting here the expansions (\ref{eqn:C0Determined}) of $C_0$ (truncatedto the appropriate order), writing\begin{eqnarray}  (g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s))^2=\Lambda^2-2\Lambda~\! g^{\rm fin}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}  +(g^{\rm fin}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma})^2-2t^2+\dots\label{eqn:g(t,s)Squared}\end{eqnarray}and using result (\ref{eqn:stIntegrals}) it is a matter of a simplealgebra to check that all terms diverging with $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$as well as the spurious terms specific for the adopted regularization(that is the finite term arising from the product of the term proportional to$a_0\Lambda$ and the term $t^2/\Lambda$ from $g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$in the contribution proportional to $C_0^2$ and the term $-2t^2$in (\ref{eqn:g(t,s)Squared})) completely cancel out as they should.As a result, to obtain the relevant contribution to $E_\Omega/V$one can simply drop all $\Lambda$ dependent terms in thefunction $g_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(t,s)$ and set $C_0=(4\pi\hbar^2/m_f)a_0$ (theremaining part of the function $G^{(1)}$ will be denoted $G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}$).\vskip0.2cmThe first type of the particle-hole diagrams (the middle one in Figure\ref{fig:C0cube}) has been computed in \cite{CHWO3} in the case of spin$s={1\over2}$ fermions. The generalization of the formulae obtainedthere is straightforward and reduces to taking again the sum over pairs ofdifferent spin projections:\begin{eqnarray}  {1\over i\hbar}~\!{E^{(3){\rm ph1}}_\Omega\over V}  ={1\over3!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^3 2\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\![B_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)]^3~\!.\end{eqnarray}(Again  2 is the combinatoric factor). This gives\begin{eqnarray}  {E_\Omega^{(3){\rm ph1}}\over V}=-{32m_f^2C_0^3\over(2\pi)^8\hbar^4}  \sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \left[K^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})    +K^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\right],  \label{eqn:C03phEnergyPol1}\end{eqnarray}where the functions $K^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ and$K^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ are given by\begin{eqnarray}  K^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})=\int_0^\infty\!ds~\!s^2~\!{1\over4\pi}\!  \int\!d^3\mathbf{t}~\!\theta(|\mathbf{t}+\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})~\!  \theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{t}-\mathbf{s}|)~\!  (f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(1)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s))^2~\!,\phantom{a}  \label{eqn:K1functionDef}\end{eqnarray}\begin{eqnarray}  K^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})=\int_0^\infty\!ds~\!s^2~\!{1\over4\pi}\!  \int\!d^3\mathbf{t}~\!\theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{t}+\mathbf{s}|)~\!  \theta(|\mathbf{t}-\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma})~\!  (f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(2)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s))^2~\!,  \phantom{a}\label{eqn:K2functionDef}\end{eqnarray}and the functions$f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(1)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s)$ and$f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(2)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s)$ are definedby the integrals\begin{eqnarray}f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(1)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s)={1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{u}~\!{\theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}-|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{s}|)~\!\theta(|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma})\over(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{t})\cdot\mathbf{s}+i0}~\!,\label{eqn:f1(t,s)Def}\end{eqnarray}and \begin{eqnarray}f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(2)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s)={1\over4\pi}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{u}~\!{\theta(|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{s}|-p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime})~\!\theta(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{s}|)\over(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{t})\cdot\mathbf{s}-i0}~\!.\label{eqn:f2(t,s)Def}\end{eqnarray}Finally the contribution of the last type of diagrams (the rightmostone in Figure \ref{fig:C0cube}) is given by\begin{eqnarray}{1\over i\hbar}~\!{E^{(3){\rm ph2}}_\Omega\over V}={1\over3!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^3(-3!)\!\sum_{\sigma^{\prime\prime},\sigma^\prime,\sigma}\int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\!B_{\sigma^{\prime\prime},\sigma^{\prime\prime}}(q)~\!B_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma^\prime}(q)~\!B_{\sigma,\sigma}(q)~\!,\end{eqnarray}where $-3!$ is the sign/combinatoric factor and the sum is over all tripletsof different spin projections ($\sigma\neq\sigma^\prime\neq\sigma^{\prime\prime}$,$\sigma\neq\sigma^{\prime\prime}$).

The spin factors of the sum of the contributions(\ref{eqn:C03phEnergyPol1}) and (\ref{eqn:C03phEnergyPol2}) combine in thiscase into\begin{eqnarray}  -{g_s(g_s-1)\over2}+3~\!{g_s(g_s-1)(g_s-2)\over6}  ={1\over2}~\!g_s(g_s-1)(g_s-3)~\!,\nonumber\end{eqnarray}which is the spin factor associated with the particle-hole diagramin this case \cite{HamFur00}.Analysis of the integration domains in the formulae defining the$K$-functions one finds that the poles of the integrands at$\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{s}=\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{s}$ are never reached,so the prescriptions $\pm i0$ can be dropped. Still, obtaining the analyticforms of the functions$f_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}^{(1,2)}(\mathbf{t}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{s},~\!s)$ is rathercumbersome - hence we do not give the technical details of the computation.The final formulae (different in the regimes of small, intermediate andlarge $s$) for these functions can be found in \cite{CHWO3}; the formulaefor the function $f^{(2)}_{\sigma,\sigma}(\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{t},s)$ (notgiven in \cite{CHWO3}) can in principle be obtained as a$p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}=p_{{\rm F}\sigma}$ limitof the function $f^{(2)}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{t},s)$but for this particular case a much simpler formula can beobtained.\footnote{We have, of course,  checked numerically that  $f^{(2)}_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{t},s)$  agrees with $f^{(2)}_{\sigma,\sigma}(\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{t},s)$  in the limit $p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}=p_{{\rm F}\sigma}$.}It reads:\begin{eqnarray}f^{(2)}_{\sigma\sigma}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{s},s)=  s~\!(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-t)  \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}\nonumber\\  +{1\over4}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2-s^2+2st)  \ln\!\left[{(t^2-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2+s^2-2st)      (t p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2+s^2-st)\over t^2(    t p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+k^2-s^2+st)}\right]\nonumber\\    -{1\over4}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2-s^2-2st)    \ln\!\left[{(t^2-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2+s^2+2st)(tp_{{\rm F}\sigma}        -p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2+s^2+st)\over t^2      (t p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2-s^2-st)}\right]\nonumber\\      +{1\over2}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2-s^2)      \ln{p_{{\rm F}\sigma}+s\over p_{{\rm F}\sigma}-s}      -t^2\ln{t-s-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}\over t+s-p_{{\rm F}\sigma}}~\!      \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}\nonumber      \end{eqnarray}$f^{(2)}_{\sigma\sigma}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{s},s)=-f^{(1)}_{\sigma\sigma}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{s},s)$.With the analytical formulae for these functions the remaining integrals in(\ref{eqn:K1functionDef}), (\ref{eqn:K2functionDef})and (\ref{eqn:tildeK2functionDef}) can be evaluated numerically usingthe standard Mathematica built-in routine for multidimensional integrationover a prescribed domain. \vskip0.1cmThe resulting, order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^3$ correction, that adds up to the terms inthe curly bracket in (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}) is\footnote{From the  defining formulae it is clear that all the functions  $G^{(1,2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$,  $K^{(1,2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ and  $\tilde K^{2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^{\prime\prime}};p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$   scale like the eight power of the wave vector $k_{\rm F}$ which effectively  reduces them to functions of the single variable $r=x_{\sigma^\prime}/x_\sigma$:  $G^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})  =p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^8G^{(1)}(x_{\sigma^\prime}/x_\sigma,1)$, etc.}  \begin{eqnarray}  {160\over\pi^3}~\!(k_{\rm F}a_0)^3\left(\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}\!    \left[4G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}(x_{\sigma^\prime},x_\sigma)+4G^{(2)}(x_{\sigma^\prime},x_\sigma)    -K^{(1)}(x_{\sigma^\prime},x_\sigma)-K^{(2)}(x_{\sigma^\prime},x_\sigma)\right]\right.    \nonumber\\    \left.+\sum_{\sigma^{\prime\prime},\sigma^\prime,\sigma}\!\!    \left[2\tilde K^{(2)}(x_{\sigma^{\prime\prime}};x_{\sigma^\prime},x_\sigma)      +2\tilde K^{(2)}(x_{\sigma^\prime};x_\sigma,x_{\sigma^{\prime\prime}})      +2\tilde K^{(2)}(x_\sigma;x_{\sigma^{\prime\prime}},x_{\sigma^\prime})\right]\right),    \phantom{a}\label{eqn:finalC0cubeContribution}\end{eqnarray}where the sum in the last line is over all triplets of differentindices $\sigma^{\prime\prime},\sigma^\prime,\sigma$.\vskip0.1cm\begin{figure}\psfig{figure=G1G2Kfun.eps,width=8.cm,height=5.0cm} \caption{Plot of the functions $G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}(r,1)$ (the highest, blue, curve),  $G^{(2)}(r,1)$ (the lowest, red, curve) and  ${1\over4}[K^{(1)}(r,1)+K^{(2)}(r,1)]$ (the middle, green, curve).}\label{fig:G1G2Kplot}\end{figure}With these results one can try to verify the reliability of the approachdeveloped in \cite{He}. Its authors have considered only the case of spin$1/2$ fermions and only the contributions to the ground state energy densitywhich, like the order $C_0^2$ contribution (\ref{eqn:ProductsOfTwoBlocks})and the order $C_0^3$ contribution (\ref{eqn:ThreeAblocksComposed}), can becomposed out of the $A$-''blocks''. Of the corresponding $n$-th ordercontribution ($(n-1)!$ is the combinatoric factor)\begin{eqnarray}  {1\over i\hbar}~\!{E^{(n)\rm pp}_\Omega\over V}  ={1\over n!}\left({C_0\over i\hbar}\right)^n(n-1)!\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  \!\int\!{d^4q\over(2\pi)^4}~\![A_{\sigma^\prime,\sigma}(q)]^n~\!,  \label{eqn:AtoNthContribution}\end{eqnarray}which gives rise to $2^n-2$ nonvanishing terms they retain only $n$identical ones obtained by taking $n-1$ parts of the $A$-''block''corresponding to the propagation of particles and one part correspondingto the propagation of holes (again appealing to the interpretationintroduced earlier). Thus, out of the complete order $C_0^3$ contributionobtained above they take only the function$G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$ discarding thecontributions of the function $G^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$and of the sum ${1\over4}[K^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})  +K^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})]$. As the plot\ref{fig:G1G2Kplot} shows, the first of these two functions is indeed oneorder of magnitude smaller than $G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}$ in the entire range of theratio $r=p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}/p_{{\rm F}\sigma}$ (both these functions, similarlyas the functions $K^{(1,2)}$ and $\tilde K^{(2)}$ vanish at $r=0$ as a resultof the absence of $s$-wave interaction of fermions obeying the Pauliexclusion principle) but the same is not true of the secondfunction which is always comparable with $G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}$ and enters (\ref{eqn:finalC0cubeContribution}) with the opposite sign stronglyreducing the contribution of the function $G^{(1)}_{\rm fin}$. Moreover, in higherorders the number of discarded terms arising from (\ref{eqn:AtoNthContribution})rapidly grows and if each of the discarded $(2^n-2)-n$ terms of the contribution(\ref{eqn:AtoNthContribution}) is only one order of magnitude smaller thaneach of the $n$ terms taken into account, the domination of the latter canbe invalidated (as the transition to the ordered state is expected to occur at$k_{\rm F}a_0\simlt1$, the higher order contributions are not much suppressed bythe powers of the expansion parameter $k_{\rm F}a_0$). Moreover, inhigher orders the number of other types of diagrams (with topologies differentthan those shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0cube}) grows and their contribution,like the one of $K^{(1)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})+K^{(2)}(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime},p_{{\rm F}\sigma})$, may dominate theone of the retained terms. Thus the reliability of theapproximations made in \cite{He} may be questioned even thoughthe numerical results obtained there agree quite well with thoseobtained by the Quantum Monte Carlo methods.\section{Contribution of the interaction terms proportional to $C_2$  and $C_2^\prime$}\label{sec:HigherDimOps}According to the power counting rule in the order$k^3_{\rm F}(\hbar^2k_{\rm F}^2/2m_f)(k_{\rm F}R)^3$ one has to takeinto account also  the operators:\begin{eqnarray}V^{(C_2)}_{\rm int}=-{C_2\over8}\int\!d^3\mathbf{x}\sum_{\sigma<\sigma^\prime}\left[\psi^\dagger_\sigma\psi^\dagger_{\sigma^\prime}(\psi_{\sigma^\prime}\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}^2\psi_\sigma-2\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi_{\sigma^\prime}\!\cdot\!\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi_\sigma+\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}^2\psi_{\sigma^\prime}~\!\psi_\sigma)\right.\phantom{a}~\nonumber\\\left.+(\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}^2\psi^\dagger_\sigma~\!\psi^\dagger_{\sigma^\prime}-2\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi^\dagger_\sigma\!\cdot\!\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi^\dagger_{\sigma^\prime}+\psi^\dagger_\sigma\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}^2\psi^\dagger_{\sigma^\prime})\psi_{\sigma^\prime}\psi_\sigma\right],\label{eqn:C2Interaction}\end{eqnarray}and\begin{eqnarray}  V_{\rm int}^{(C_2^\prime)}= -{C^\prime_2\over8}\!\int\!d^3\mathbf{x}  \sum_{\sigma,{\sigma^\prime}}(\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi^\dagger_\sigma\psi^\dagger_{\sigma^\prime}-\psi^\dagger_\sigma\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi^\dagger_{\sigma^\prime})\!\cdot\!(\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}\psi_{\sigma^\prime}\psi_\sigma-\psi_{\sigma^\prime}{\mbox{\boldmath{$\nabla$}}}\psi_\sigma)~\!.\label{eqn:C2PrimOpExplicit}\end{eqnarray}(Notice that in the second operator the sum involves also terms with$\sigma={\sigma^\prime}$).Their contribution to the ground state energy density in the case ofnonequal densities of spin $1/2$ fermions having different spin projectionshas been explicitly written down in \cite{CHWO3}. Generalization of theseformulae to the case of spin $s$ fermions with different densities of their$g_s$ spin projections is straightforward. They read\begin{eqnarray}  {E^{(C_2)}_\Omega\over V}={C_2\over240\pi^4}\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^3p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^3(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^2+p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2)  \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}~\nonumber\\  ={k_{\rm F}^3\over6\pi^2}~\!{3\over5}~\!{\hbar^2k_{\rm F}^2\over2m_f}~\!  {1\over6\pi}~\!k_{\rm F}^3a_0^2r_0  \sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma} x^3_{\sigma^\prime}x^3_\sigma(x^2_{\sigma^\prime}+x^2_\sigma )~\!.  \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaa}\end{eqnarray}\begin{eqnarray}  {E^{(C^\prime_2)}_\Omega\over V}={C^\prime_2\over120\pi^4}\left\{  \sum_{\sigma=1}^{g_s}p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^8+{1\over2}\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^3p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^3(p_{{\rm F}\sigma^\prime}^2  +p_{{\rm F}\sigma}^2)\right\}\phantom{aaaaaaaaaa}\nonumber\\  ={k_{\rm F}^3\over6\pi^2}~\!{3\over5}~\!{\hbar^2k_{\rm F}^2\over2m_f}~\!  {2\over3\pi}~\!(k_{\rm F}a_1)^3  \left\{\sum_{\sigma=1}^{g_s}x_\sigma^8+{1\over2}\sum_{\sigma^\prime<\sigma}  x^3_{\sigma^\prime}x^3_\sigma(x^2_{\sigma^\prime}+x^2_\sigma)\right\}.\end{eqnarray}For equal all densities of all spin projections this reduces to the knownresults given e.g. in \cite{HamFur00}. The contribution $E^{(C^\prime_2)}_\Omega$is special in that unlike the remaining ones (to this order) it does notvanish if all fermions have the same spin projection. This has importantconsequences for the transition to the ordered state.\section{Phase transition to the ordered state}\label{sec:PhTr}A short range repulsive interaction, cooperating with the Pauli exclusion rulecan, if its strength is large enough and the gas density is not too low, causethe transition to the ordered state. The qualitative explanation of thisphenomenon is that because of the Pauli exclusion, the dominant $s$-waveinteraction energy of two fermions with the same spin projection must vanish(it is positive if the spin projections are different); hence assuming by themajority of fermions the same spin projection and decreasing thereby theinteraction energy may become energetically more favourable than minimizingthe kinetic energy by having all spin projections equally populated. Since theeffect is due to the competition between the energy of the free system and theinteraction energy, it can occur only if the interaction is sufficiently strong, which implies that it hardly can be treated perturbatively.In the mean field approximation,equivalent to taking in (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}) into account only theorder $k_{\rm F}a_0$ correction, and for spin $s=1/2$ fermions this happens when$k_{\rm F}a_0>\pi/2$ (see e.g. \cite{Stoner,Kesio,Pathria}). In this simplest case the role of the order parameter naturally plays thepolarization $P=(N_+-N_-)/N$ and seeking the minimum of the ground state energy$E_\Omega(P)$ as a function of $P$ is straightforward. In the case of spin $s$fermions there are in principle many possible configurations with non-equaldensities of different spin projections but from theheuristic argument given above it follows that in this case the minimum ofthe ground state energy should be in the configuration in which only one spinprojection has the density larger than the remaining ones which all haveequal densities.\footnote{The authors of \cite{PECABO}  claim to  have proved this mathematically but a cursory look at their argument  which relies on the obvious symmetry of the equations determining thedensities of the spin projections different than the distinguished oneshows it is not valid.}Of course, in the ordered phase there are then $g_s=2s+1$ degenerate groundstates related to one another by the $SU(g_s)$ symmetry because in theabsence of an external field any of the $g_s$ spin projections can be that onewhich is populated by the majority of fermions. Therefore the natural orderparameter $P$ defined by setting (without loss of generality we assume thatit is the first spin component which is populated differently than theremaining ones)\begin{eqnarray}  x_1=(1+P)^{1/3}~\!,\phantom{aaa}  x_\sigma=\left(1-{P\over g_s-1}\right)^{1/3}~\!,\phantom{aaa}  \sigma=2,\dots,g_s~\!,\label{eqn:x1Andx2Defs}\\  x_1^3+x_2^3+\dots+x_{g_s}^3=g_s~\!,\phantom{aaaa}  -1\leq P\leq g_s-1~\!,\phantom{aaaaaaa}\end{eqnarray}which corresponds to\begin{eqnarray}  P={g_sN_1-N\over N}=(g_s-1)~\!{N_1-N_2\over N}~\!,\end{eqnarray}ceases to have the simple interpretation of the system'spolarization.\footnote{Obviously, if the spontaneous ordering is approached  in the usual thermodynamic limit by switching off an external magnetic  field coupled to the fermion spin, it will be the largest spin projection  in the direction of the field that will be singled out. In this case  the magnetization will be given by $N\mu P/(g_s-1)$, where $\mu$  is the magnetic moment associated with a single spin.}In terms of the factors $x_1(P)$ and $x_2(P,g_s)$  given by(\ref{eqn:x1Andx2Defs}) the curly bracket in the formula(\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}) takes the form\begin{eqnarray}  f_s(P)=x_1^5+(g_s-1)x_2^5+{20\over9\pi}~\!k_{\rm F}a_0~\!(g_s-1)~\!x_2^3  \left[x_1^3+{1\over2}~\!(g_s-2)~\!x_2^3\right]\nonumber\\  +~\!{2\over\pi^2}~\!(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2(g_s-1)\left[J_K(x_1,x_2)+    {1\over2}~\!(g_s-2)~\!{44-8\ln2\over21}\right].\phantom{a}~\!  \label{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrderReduced}\end{eqnarray}In the case of spin $1/2$ fermions the phase transition to the orderedstate at $k_{\rm F}a_0=\pi/2$ in the mean field approximation, equivalentto retaining in (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrder}) only the first twoterms in the curly bracket, is known to be continuous. This resultshowever from a numerical coincidence which makes the second derivativeof $E^{\rm MF}_\Omega(P)$ with respect to $P$ to vanish at $P=0$ for$k_{\rm F}a_0=\pi/2$, precisely when the nontrivial minimum first appears.This does not happen if $s>1/2$ and in the mean field approximation thephase transitions to the ordered states are in all these cases offirst order.\footnote{Taking the effects of the interaction in the  first nontrivial order and restricting oneself to the configurations  specified by (\ref{eqn:x1Andx2Defs}) one can repeat the steps taken  in \cite{Kesio} and obtain the full low temperature profile of the transition  to the ordered phase for any spin $s$. At zero magnetic field $H$,  the equation  \begin{eqnarray}    g_s\mu H+{4g_s\over3\pi}~\!k_{\rm F}a_0~\!P    =(g_s-1)\left\{(1+P)^{2/3}-\left(1-{P\over g_s-1}\right)^{2/3}    \right.\phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}\nonumber\\    \left.    -{\pi^2\over12}\left({k_{\rm B}T\over\varepsilon^{(s)}_{\rm F}}\right)^2    \left[(1+P)^{-2/3}-\left(1-{P\over g_s-1}\right)^{-2/3}\right]    +\dots\right\},\nonumber  \end{eqnarray}  which determines the parameter $P$ starts, for $s>1/2$ to have  a nontrivial solution before the slopes at $P=0$ of its both sides  equalize - this shows that the  transition is of first order.}It can be also easily checked that the critical value of$k_{\rm F}a_0$ at which it occurs decreases with the spin $s$ but ratherslowly - $(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm MF}\approx1.43$ for $s=3/2$, $(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm MF}\approx1.21$ for $s=7/2$ and$(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm MF}\approx1.14$ for $s=9/2$. In view of the qualitative explanation of the reasons for the transitionsuch a behaviour is easy to understand: the gas kinetic energy is linearin the number $g_s$ of the possible spin projections while the interactiondepends on it (in the mean field approximation) quadratically. One canalso observe that only for $s=3/2$ (and, of course, $s=1/2$) is thespontaneous polarization $P$ not maximal at $(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm MF}$;for all higher spins it becomes maximal ($P=g_s-1$) already at the transitionpoint.If the corrections of order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^2$ are included, i.e. the fullformula (\ref{eqn:EnergyUpToSecondOrderReduced}) is used, the transitionto the ordered state (at zero temperature) becomes of first order also for$s={1\over2}$ (and retains, of course, this character for $s>{1\over2}$).The relevant plots can be found in \cite{CHWO2} and in \cite{PECABO}for $s={1\over2}$ and in \cite{PECABO} for $s\geq{1\over2}$.The transition occurs now at$(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm2nd}\approx1.054$ for $s=1/2$,$(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm2nd}\approx0.954$ for $s=3/2$,  $(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm2nd}\approx0.840$ for $s=7/2$ and$(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm2nd}\approx0.804$ for $s=9/2$. Moreover, in thisapproximation only for $s=1/2$ the polarization gradually approachesthe maximal value $P=1$ ($P\approx0.58$ exactly at the critical coupling$k_{\rm F}a_0=(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm2nd}$); in the remaining casesit jumps immediately to the maximal possible value $P_{\rm max}=g_s-1$.\begin{figure}\centerline{\hbox{\psfig{figure=E2ndgs2.eps,width=8.cm,height=5.0cm} \psfig{figure=E3rdgs2.eps,width=8.cm,height=5.0cm} }}\caption{Plots of the ground state energy of the system of spin $1/2$  fermions as a function of the order parameter $P$ in units of  $(k_{\rm F}^3/6\pi^2)(3/5)(\hbar^2k_{\rm F}^2/2m_f)$, i.e. of the  function $f_s(P)$.

Firstly, the critical value of theexpansion parameter $k_{\rm F}a_0$ is further reduced: the transition occursnow at $(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm3rd}=0.99096$ for $s=1/2$ (at$(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm3rd}=0.74190$ and $0.49445$ for $s=3/2$ and $s=9/2$,respectively). Secondly, the first order character of the transition, quiteclear without this correction, becomes now much less pronounced - while for$s=1/2$ the height of the hill separating the minimum at $P=0$ from the oneat $P\neq0$ remains almost unchanged, greatly reduced is the nonzero valueof the order parameter right at the transition. This is clear from thecomparison of the two panels of Figure \ref{fig:Egs1} showing the shape of the function $f_s(P)$ for three values of $k_{\rm F}a_0$ close to the criticalone (corresponding to the approximation used): in the left one the order$(k_{\rm F}a_0)^3$ corrections are not included, in the right one they are.This aspect - the reduction of the the nonzero value of the order parameterright at the transition - is even more dramatic in the case ofhigher spins: without the third order corrections this valuewas maximal $P=g_s-1$; with these corrections it is reduced to $\sim0.12$(practically independent of the value of $s$)! Moreover, for $s>1/2$also the height  of the hill separating the symmetry breaking minimumfrom the symmetry preserving one at $P=0$ is reduced by roughly threefor $s=3/2$ up to four for $s=9/2$ orders of magnitude. In the case of spin$3/2$ this is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Egs4}. The results for different values of the spin $s$ are  presented in Table \ref{t:results}.These purely perturbative results strongly point towards the possibilitythat the transition to the ordered state is, when all effects associatedwith the interactions other than that proportional to the coupling $C_0$in (\ref{eqn:Veff}) are ignored (which is equivalent to setting to zero allthe higher partial waves scattering lengths $a_\ell$ and all the effectiveradii $r_\ell$), indeed of the continuoustype. Most probably with the inclusion of higher and higher correctionsits character becomes less and less first order and becomes truly continuouswhen a resummation of the sort performed in \cite{He} is made butbecomes practically indistinguishable from such already at a finite(not very high, as our computation shows) order of the ordinary perturbativeexpansion.\begin{figure}\centerline{\hbox{\psfig{figure=E2ndgs4.eps,width=8.cm,height=5.0cm} \psfig{figure=E3rdgs4.eps,width=8.cm,height=5.0cm} }}\caption{Plots of the ground state energy of the system of spin $3/2$  fermions as a function of the order parameter $P$ in units of  $(k_{\rm F}^3/6\pi^2)(3/5)(\hbar^2k_{\rm F}^2/2m_f)$, i.e. of the  function $f_s(P)$.

They are introduced through the two lower lengthdimension operators in (\ref{eqn:Veff}) which are given explicitly by theformulae (\ref{eqn:C2Interaction}) and (\ref{eqn:C2PrimOpExplicit}). Inthe configuration of densities assumed in this Section these interactionsadd to the function $f_s(P)$ the terms\begin{eqnarray}  {1\over6\pi}~\!k_{\rm F}^3a_0^2r_0~\!(g_s-1)\left[x_1^3x_2^3(x_1^2+x_2^2)    +(g_s-2)~\!x_2^8\right]\phantom{aaaaaaaaa}~\nonumber\\  +{2\over3\pi}~\!(k_{\rm F}a_1)^3\left[x_1^8+{1\over2}g_s(g_s-1)~\!x_2^8    +{1\over2}(g_s-1)~\!x_1^3x_2^3(x_1^2+x_2^2)\right].  \label{eqn:HigherOrderOpsContrib}\end{eqnarray}If the effects of these operators are subleading compared to the effectscaused by the order $k_F^3$ corrections of the operator proportional to $C_0$(that is, when that $|r_0|, |a_1|\ll a_0$) they modify the general picturedescribed above only slightly. For instance in the case of  $s=1/2$ thepresence of $r_0\approx a_0/10$ decreases by less than one percent thecritical value of the parameter $k_{\rm F}a_0$, while $r_0\approx -a_0/10$increases it by the same amount in agreements with the observation made in\cite{He}. In both cases the character of the phase transition is notappreciably changed. Somewhat surprising is, however, the observation thatfor larger spin values this patern is reversed: negative $r_0$ decreasesslightly the critical value of $k_{\rm F}a_0$, while positive $r_0$ increasesit. The reason for this is that while for $s=1/2$ the first line of (\ref{eqn:HigherOrderOpsContrib}) is a function of $P$ monotonicallydecreasing to zero (the contribution to the energy density of the interactionproportional to $C_2$ is by the Pauli exclusion principle also bound tovanish at $P=1$), for higher spins it a is slightly increasing function,precisely in the range in which the new minimum of the energy density forms.In general, the correction induced by the operator(\ref{eqn:C2PrimOpExplicit})  is larger than the one induced by(\ref{eqn:C2Interaction}). Moreover in the perturbation series for$E_\Omega/V$ it is the first correction which is not bound to vanish at$P=1$ by the Pauli exclusion principle. Nevertheless, if one assumes that $|a_1|$ is of the same order as $|r_0|$and much smaller than $a_0$, its contribution is not larger thanthat of (\ref{eqn:C2Interaction}) simply because it is proportional to$a_1^3$.  In the configuration of the densities considered here the expressionin the second line of (\ref{eqn:HigherOrderOpsContrib}) is for all values of thespin $s$ a monotonically increasing function. For this reason thecontribution increases the value of $(k_{\rm F}a_0)_{\rm cr}$ for $a_1>0$and lowers if for $a_1<0$ by roughly one percent so long as$|a_1|\simlt a_0/10$ without affecting significantly the character of thetransition. Thus, it seems likely, that if all the scattering lengths $a_\ell$,$\ell=1,2,\dots$, all the radii $r_\ell$, etc. are subleading with respect to$a_0$, the continuos character of the transition will emerge afterall corrections are taken into account (being, from the practicalpoint of view indistinguishable from continuos already starting fromsome fixed order of the perturbative expansion).\begin{table}\begin{center}$\begin{array}{|c||c|c||c|c||c|c|}\hlines& (k_Fa_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm MF} & P^{\rm MF}_{\rm cr}&(k_Fa_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm 2nd}&P^{\rm 2nd}_{\rm cr}&(k_Fa_0)_{\rm cr}^{\rm 3rd}&P^{\rm 3rd}_{\rm cr}\\\hline 1/2& \pi/2 & 0        & 1.0540& 0.58     & 0.99097& 0.11\\  3/2& 1.4298& 2.78     & 0.9543& P_{\rm max}& 0.74190& 0.14\\  5/2& 1.3016& P_{\rm max}& 0.8877& P_{\rm max}& 0.62560& 0.125\\  7/2& 1.2118& P_{\rm max}& 0.8405& P_{\rm max}& 0.54976& 0.115\\  9/2& 1.1439& P_{\rm max}& 0.8040& P_{\rm max}& 0.49445& 0.105\\ 11/2& 1.0901& P_{\rm max}& 0.7753& P_{\rm max}& 0.45164& 0.10\\ \hline\end{array}$\caption{Characteristics of the transitions to the ordered state at $T=0$for different values of the spin $s$ of fermions.}\label{t:results}\end{center}\end{table}\section{Conclusions}Computing the ground-state energy of a finite density system of fermionsinteracting through a binary spin independent repulsive interaction is aclassic problem of many-body quantum mechanics. The modern effective fieldtheory approach greatly simplifies this task. In particular it allowed tocomplete the computation of the fourth order (i.e. proportional to $k_{\rm F}^4$)corrections in the case of spin $s$ fermions and equal densities ofdifferent spin projections \cite{WeDrSch} and to extend to the third order thecomputation of energy of spin $1/2$ fermions for an arbitrary value of thesystem's polarization \cite{CHWO3}. Here we have extended the latter resultto the case of spin $s$ fermions and arbitrary densities of different spinprojections. The derived formulae allow to compute the ground state energysemi-analytically exploiting only the built-in routines of the Mathematicapackage.We have used this result to discuss two issues. Firstly we have checkednumerically how the magnitude of the third order term included in theresummation of an infinite subset of corrections done in \cite{He} compareswith the magnitudes of the rejected terms and found that it is not obviouslydominant. Secondly, we have discussed the impact the third order correctionshave on the characteristics of the system's transition to the ordered phaseat zero temperature. We have found that already the third order correctionstend to erase the first order character of this transition independentlyof the value $s$ of the spin of fermions. Although our observations aremade on the basis of the perturbative expansion used in the regime whichis probably beyond the domain of its applicability (the comparison ofthe results of the Quantum Monte Carlo computations of the ground stateenergy of the unpolarized gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with the perturbativecoputation reveals \cite{QMC10} that the expansion is reliable up to$k_{\rm F}a_0\simlt0.6$; in the case of $s>1/2$ the value of the expansionparameter$k_{\rm F}a_0$ at which the transition to the ordered state occurs is smallerbut since at the same time the magnitude of the successive terms of theperturbation series are increased by the growing powers of the factor $g_s$,the limit of the reliability of the expansion probably also decreases with$s$), they nevertheless seem to lend some support to theclaim made in \cite{He} that the transition is continuous rather thanfirst order. It seems that the picture which emerges is quite sensible:since continuous transition are associated with fluctuations at alllength scales, at any finite order of the perturbative expansion sucha transition should look like a first order one (the continuous transitionin the system of spin $1/2$ fermions obtained in the mean fieldapproximation is from this perspective a mere numerical coincidence),though its first order character may rapidly disappear with increasedorder of the approximation (so that it quickly may becomeindistinguishable from a continuous one from the practical point of view);the truly continuous character of a transition can really be revealedonly by a (partial) resummation of of all orders contributions, of the sortproposed in \cite{He}.\vskip0.3cm\noindent{\bf Acknowledgments.} We would like to thank Dr KrzysztofJachymski for a discussion.%\section*{Appendix} \vskip0.5cm\begin{thebibliography}{99}\bibitem{Jo} G.-B.

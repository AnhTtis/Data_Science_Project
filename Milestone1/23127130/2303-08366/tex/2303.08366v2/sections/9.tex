\section{Conclusion}


We present \toolName, a novel visualization approach for quantum state representation.
Built upon the visualization of the state vectors, we utilized multiple coordinated 2D geometrical shapes to reflect the probability distribution of all quantum states, which provides an intuitive view of quantum superposition.
Also, we applied the same form of visualization approaches to enable \toolName\ to support single-qubit and two-qubit state representations.
% , where two-qubit states include two-qubit entanglement.
We evaluated \toolName\ by conducting two case studies and in-depth expert interviews, and
the results show that \toolName\ can effectively facilitate the visual analysis of single-qubit and two-qubit states.

In the future, we plan to enhance the data loading of quit states by making the user interface of \toolName\ able to read qubit states from quantum computing circuits automatically.  
Also, it will be interesting to investigate how visualization techniques can be applied to show the quantum states of more than two qubits. 

% focus on enhancing the functionality of qubit state representation, like integrating the quantum noise representation into \toolName\ via multiple glyphs, which can highlight the differences between the noisy and noise-free results for post-execution analysis.
% Furthermore, we could enhance the efficiency of \toolName\ exploration, such as a web browser plugin that can recognize and visualize the quantum states automatically.

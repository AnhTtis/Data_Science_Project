    "abstract": "In this study, we compare the performance of the new-generation communication protocol Zenoh with the widely-used MQTT, Kafka, and DDS. Two performance indexes were evaluated, including throughput and latency. A brief description of each protocol is introduced in this article. The experiment configuration and the testing scenarios are described in detail. The results show that Zenoh outperforms the others with impressive performance numbers.",

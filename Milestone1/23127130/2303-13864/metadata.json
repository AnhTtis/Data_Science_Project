    "abstract": "For $S\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|\\ge 2$, let $κ_G (S)$ denote the maximum number of internally disjoint trees connecting $S$ in $G$. For $2\\le k\\le n$, the generalized $k$-connectivity $κ_k(G)$ of an $n$-vertex connected graph $G$ is defined to be $κ_k(G)=\\min \\{κ_G(S): S\\in V(G) \\mbox{ and } |S|=k\\}$. The generalized $k$-connectivity can serve for measuring the fault tolerance of an interconnection network. The bubble-sort graph $B_n$ for $n\\ge 2$ is a Cayley graph over the symmetric group of permutations on $[n]$ generated by transpositions from the set $\\{[1,2],[2,3],\\dots, [n-1,n]\\}$. In this paper, we show that for the bubble-sort graphs $B_n$ with $n\\ge 3$, $κ_4(B_n)=n-2$.",

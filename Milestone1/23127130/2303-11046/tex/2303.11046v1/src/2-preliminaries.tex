\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec-pre}

This section introduces the basic properties of the convex analysis used in this paper.
Let us denote $\R^n$ as the $n$-dimentional Euclidean space and $\ri S$ as the relative interior of $S\subset\R^n$. 
We will denote $\bm x^\T$ and $\bm A^\T$ as the transpose of the $n$-dimentional vector $\bm x\in\R^n$ and the $n\times m$ matrix $\bm A\in\R^{n\times m}$.
For a convex compact set $S\subset\R^n$, let us define the conjugate function $f^*\colon\R^n\to\R$ of a function $f\colon S\to\R$ by
\begin{align}
    f^*(\bm\xi) := \max_{\bm x\in S}\qty{
    \bm\xi^\T \bm x - f(\bm x)
    }.
\end{align}
If the above maximizer is unique, then by Danskin's theorem, $f^*$ is differentiable at $\bm\xi\in\R^n$, and its derivative is given by
\begin{align}
    \nabla f^*(\bm\xi) = \argmax_{\bm x\in S}\qty{
    \bm\xi^\T \bm x - f(\bm x)
    }.
\end{align}

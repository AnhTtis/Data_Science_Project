\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}
To make the smoothing method for solving extensive-form games applicable to large games, we proposed a modified version of the prox-function used internally in the smoothing method to improve its theoretical convergence guarantees.
We also proposed a heuristic to update the prox-function with temporary solutions, which is expected to improve the accuracy of the internal approximation of the smoothing method.
Numerical experiments confirm that the smoothing method applying the heuristic with the solution of CFR+, the state-of-the-art method for large games, converges faster than pure CFR+.
Some future works include confirming the performance of the smoothing method when applied to larger-scale extensive-form games and proving theoretically that the proposed heuristic improves convergence.

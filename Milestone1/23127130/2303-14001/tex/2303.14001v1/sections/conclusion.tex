\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we target on large urban scene rendering, and  propose a novel framework that integrates the MLP-based NeRF with an explicitly constructed a feature grid to effectively encode both local and global scene informations. Our method overcomes various drawbacks of state-of-the-art methods when when applied to large-scale scenes.
Our model achieves high visual fidelity rendering even for extremely large-scale urban scenes, which is crucial for real-world application scenarios.

While we mainly investigate the ground feature plane representation tailored for large urban scene scenario, our two-branch design can also be considered for other grid-based representation, serving as an additional regularization on the learned feature values by bringing more continuity. 
Still, our model inherits some limitations of NeRF-based methods, such as the slow training for our joint-learning stage. Another critical issue is dealing with a large amount of high-resolution images. The current batch sampling of shuffled rays is highly ineffective without distributed training. More discussions can be found in the supplementary.

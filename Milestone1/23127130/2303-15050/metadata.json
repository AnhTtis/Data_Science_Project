    "abstract": "We study the interplay of two different non-Hermitian constitutive parameters: directional coupling and onsite gain/loss balancing along with topology in a coupled one dimensional (1D) lattice chain. This work demonstrates two distinct localization behaviors for the bulk and discrete in-gap eigen modes in the system. We numerically show that the bulk and half of the in-gap modes are strongly confined at the boundaries due to directional hopping and topological localization, respectively. Whereas, correlation between the constitutive non-Hermitian parameters can tune the energy and localization length of the remaining in-gap modes and demonstrates two novel phenomena: one is when the directional strength and gain/loss match these states become completely extended. Second, coalescing of these modes into exceptional point (EP). We present explicit analytical solutions for the eigen function and energy of in-gap modes, that exactly matches with our numerical results and uncover the origin of delocalization and emergence of EP.",

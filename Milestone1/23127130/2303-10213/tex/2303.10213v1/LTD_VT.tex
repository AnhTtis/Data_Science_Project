\begin{abstract}
We study the probability distribution function of the long-time values of observables being time-evolved by Hamiltonians modeling clean and disordered one-dimensional chains of many spin-1/2 particles. In particular we analyze the return probability and its version for a completely extended initial state, the so-called spectral form factor. We complement our analysis with the spin autocorrelation and connected spin-spin correlation functions, both of interest in experiments with quantum simulators.  We show that the distribution function has a universal shape provided the Central Limit Theorem holds. Explicitly, the shape is exponential for the return probability and spectral form factor, meanwhile it is Gaussian for the few-body observables.  We also discuss implications over the so-called many-body localization. Remarkably, our approach requires only a single sample of the dynamics, which is quite advantageous for experiments and theory.

\section{Introduction}\label{Sec. I}

Probability distribution functions (pdfs) are of fundamental interest in different branches of science. In physics, in particular, pdfs are important not only for the purpose of computing mean values or expectation values of relevant physical quantities, but also by themselves because they could provide fine information about fluctuations around the mean values of properties of a given system. For a comprehensive review on fluctuations in physical systems see, for instance, Ref.~\cite{Clusel2008}.

In the realm of quantum mechanics, the characterization of fluctuations in time domain has been useful to understand reversibility in generic chaotic and integrable systems~\cite{Peres1984}, to establish a Gaussian scenario for equilibration in non-interacting models~\cite{Venuti2010,Venuti2013}, where fluctuations can decay as the square root of the system size. Although later is was shown in~\cite{Zangara2013} that for many-body systems the fluctuations of generic observables decay exponentially with system size in both, integrable and chaotic systems. 

Late-time pdfs are also important in the context of thermalization and many-body localization (MBL).  Just some examples are: Gaussian momentum distribution functions for noninteracting spinless fermions and hard-core bosons in one-dimensional (1D) lattices were observed in~\cite{Gramsch2012,HeSantos2013}. Gaussian distributions are experimentally obtained for the equilibrium value of a temporal autocorrelation function, number entropy and Hamming distance in~\cite{gong2021}. In numerical experiments employing the time dependence variational principle for matrix product states and machine learning, late-time pdfs where analyzed for the spin imbalance, entanglement entropy and so-called Schmidt gap~\cite{Doggen2018}. Pdfs were useful for the determination of the universality class of MBL under speckle disorder~\cite{maksymov2020}. Long-tails and bimodal probability distribution functions of the entanglement entropy near and at the MBL transition respectively were previously analyzed in~\cite{luitz2016long,Yu2016}.  

From our point of view a clear determination of the conditions under which the formerly found, experimentally and theoretically, pdfs of observables in many-body systems is missing. Our aim in this work is to set, in a systematic way, the basic conditions that lead to universal late-time probability distribution functions of physical quantities and observables in 1D interacting quantum systems. We will show that the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is behind the universal late-time pdfs, but even deeper are the conditions under which this almost ubiquitous and undoubtedly celebrated theorem holds in the time evolutions generated by paradigmatic models of spin-1/2 particles, with or without interactions, clean or disordered, chaotic or integrable.  Projections of the initial state in the energy eigenstates, as well as eigenvalues are the main characters playing a relevant role in the fulfillment of the CLT. Of course, when dealing with observables matrix elements in energy representation could be also relevant.

Our analysis will employ different probes of the dynamics, namely, return probability, spectral form factor, spin auto-correlation function and connected spin-spin correlation function. We will put main emphasis in the first one, the return probability, this because it has been prominently studied since the early years of the first quantum revolution. Let us give another non exhaustive but larger list of examples: In the context of the time-energy uncertainty relation~\cite{Mandelstam1945,Bhattacharyya1983}, non-exponential late-time decays of a quasy-stationary state~\cite{Khalfin1958}, quantum Zeno's paradox~\cite{Misra1977}, quantum speed limits~\cite{Pfeifer1993,Ufink1993,Margolus1998,Giovannetti2003}, quantum energy flow~\cite{Schofield1995}, non-periodic substitution potentials~\cite{de1999quantum}, connection with the time operator through a generalized Weyl relation~\cite{Miyamoto2001}, cosmology ~\cite{krauss2008late}, quantum walks and complex networks~\cite{xu2008,mulken2011,ampadu2012return,riascos2015}, dynamics of a thermofield double state~\cite{Campo2017,CampoSantos2018}, matter-radiation interaction models like Dicke ~\cite{lerma2019} and Bose-Hubbard~\cite{delacruz2020}. The return probability has been also measured in experiments to observe time-resolved level repulsion of chaotic systems~\cite{Leviandier1986}, fluorescence experiments with molecules~\cite{Gruebele2004,rothe2006violation}, ultra-cold atoms in magneto-optic traps~\cite{wilkinson1997}, atom chip~\cite{gherardini2017} and prethermalization in Floquet systems~\cite{singh2019}.   

The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Models and quantities are introduced in Secs.~\ref{sec:mod} and~\ref{sec:QO} respectively. In Sec.~\ref{sec:dynamics} we provide an overview of the dynamics from the time it is initiated up to equilibrium.  In Sec.~\ref{sec:CLT} we present a justification of the universal distributions based on theoretical grounds. Results for the addressed systems are shown and discussed in Sec.~\ref{Sec:Results}. Conclusions are finally presented in Sec.~\ref{Sec:Conclusions}.

\section{Models}\label{sec:mod}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We consider a system of spin-$1/2$ particles that can interacting with nearest-neighbors in a 1D lattice. Spins can also be subjected to an on-site random potential. The general Hamiltonian describing such a system is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ham}
\mathcal{H} = \sum _{k} (S_{k}^{x}S_{k+1}^{x}+S_{k}^{y}S_{k+1}^{y} + \Delta S_{k}^{z}S_{k+1}^{z}) + \sum _{k=1}^{L}h_{k}S_{k}^{z}.
\end{equation}
%
With spin-$1/2$ operators $S_{k}^{x,y,z}$ acting on the spin located at the $k$-th site. We set $\hbar=1$. The anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ and the on-site potential amplitudes $h_k$ are tuned to obtain different instances of model~\eqref{eq:Ham}. Setting $\Delta=0$ together with $h_k=0$ leads to a non-interacting model, known as XX model which is solved by applying a Jordan-Wigner transformation~\cite{Jordan_1928,Lieb1961}. With $\Delta=1$ and $h_k=0$ we obtain the isotropic XXZ model with Ising-like interactions in $z$-direction, this model in also solvable but via the celebrated Bethe ansatz~\cite{Bethe1931,hulthen1938,des1962,yang1966one,kirillov1987I}. We arrive to a paradigmatic model for the MBL transition by setting again $\Delta=1$ but with $h_k$ as uncorrelated random numbers uniformly distributed in the interval $(-h,h)$, with $h$ as the disorder strength. A critical point $h_c$ has been identified, $3.75 \lesssim h_c $, but still without consensus about its precise location in the $h$-axis, see for instance Refs.~\cite{Oganesyan2007,Pal2010,Berkelbach2010,Kjall2014,Luitz2015,Devakul2015,Doggen2018,Sierant_2020}. For the XX and XXZ models we consider open boundaries conditions, meanwhile for the disordered model we use periodic boundary conditions, $\hat{S}_{L+1}=\hat{S}_{1}$, implying that in the first summation of Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Ham} we have the index $k$ running from $1$ to $L-1$ for the two former models and from $1$ to $L$ for the latter. 

Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Ham} conserves the total spin in the $z$-direction, ${\cal{S}}^z=\sum_k S_k^z$, it only moves an excitation (spin up) through the chain due to the XX term which is also known as the flip-flop term. This allows to focus our study on the largest subspace with ${\cal{S}}^z=0$ and dimension ${\cal{N}}=L!/(L/2)!^{2}$.

\section{Quantities and observables}\label{sec:QO}
In this Section we describe the time-dependent quantities and observables employed in our study. We also present the level spacing distribution traditionally used as a probe of repulsion between adjacent energy levels, a fingerprint of quantum chaos.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
\subsection{Return probability and spectral form factor}\label{ssub:rpsff}

The return probability, $RP$, is a dynamical quantity defined as the probability to find an initial state $\ket{\Psi(0)}$ at a future time $t$. It is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rp}
RP(t) =  |S(t)|^{2}= \left| \displaystyle{\sum _{\alpha =1}^{\cal{N}}|c_{\alpha}^0|^{2}e^{-iE_{\alpha}t}} \right|^{2}.
\end{equation}
Where $S(t)=\bra{\Psi(0)}{\cal{U}}(t)\ket{\Psi(0)}$ is the return amplitude and ${\cal{U}}(t)=\exp(-i{\mathcal{H}}t)$ the unitary time evolution operator. For the Hamiltonian generating the dynamics we have the eigenvalue equation $\mathcal{H}\ket{\psi_\alpha} =E_{\alpha}\ket{\psi_\alpha}$, $\alpha=1,\,2,\,\dots,\,{\cal{N}}$. Meanwhile $c_{\alpha}=\braket{\psi_\alpha|\Psi(0)}$ are the projections of the initial state into the energy eigenstates.

When the initial state $\ket{\Psi (0)}$ is completely extended in the energy eigenbasis, its components goes as 
$1/\sqrt{\cal{N}}$ and from Eq.\eqref{eq:rp} we recover the younger relative of $RP(t)$, the so-called spectral form factor,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sff}
K(t)=\frac{1}{{\cal{N}}^{2}}\left|\sum_{\alpha=1}^{\cal{N}} e^{-iE_{\alpha}t} \right|^{2},
\end{equation}
where only energy eigenvalues are involved. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Spin autocorrelation function}
How close the spin configuration at time $t$ is to the one at $t=0$ can be measured through so-called spin autocorrelation function, given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SAF}
I(t) = \frac{4}{L}\sum _{i=1}^{L}\braket{\Psi (0)|\hat{S}_{i}^{z}e^{i\hat{\mathcal{H}}t}\hat{S}_{i}^{z}e^{-i\hat{\mathcal{H}}t}|\Psi (0)}.
\end{equation}
For particular initial states, like a quantum Néel-like state, $I(t)$ is equivalent to the density imbalance measured in experimental platforms studying ultra-cold atoms~\cite{Schreiber2015,Bordia2017a}. 

\subsection{Connected spin-spin correlation function}
Another quantity also of interest in quantum simulators is the connected spin-spin correlation function, defined through 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:CSSCF}
\begin{array}{ll}
C(t) & = \displaystyle{ \frac{4}{L}\sum _{k=1}^{L-1}\left[ \bra{\Psi (t)}S_{k}^{z}S_{k+1}^{z}\ket{\Psi (t)} -\right.}\\
 &  \displaystyle{\left. \hspace{1.3cm}\bra{\Psi (t)}S_{k}^{z}\ket{\Psi (t)}\bra{\Psi (t)}S_{k+1}^{z}\ket{\Psi (t)} \right]}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
It quantifies time-dependent correlations between neighboring spins in the chain. It has been measured, for instance, in experiments with trapped ions studying systems with long-range interactions~\cite{Richerme2014}.

\subsection{Level spacings}\label{sec:ls}
We present in this subsection the theoretical predictions for the distribution $P(s)$ of spacings between adjacent energy levels, $s_\alpha=(E_{\alpha+1}-E_{\alpha})/\delta E$, with $\delta E$ being the mean level spacing of the system. For integrable systems the level spacings typically follow an exponential distribution, they obey Poisson-like statistics~\cite{Berry1977},
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:P}
 P_\text{P}(s)=\exp(-s). 
\end{equation}
No level repulsion is apparent from Eq.~\eqref{eq:P} since $P(s\to 0)\to 1$. Meanwhile spacings between energy levels of time-reversal invariant systems, just like the ones we deal with, that are chaotic follow statistics from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of random matrix theory (RMT)~\cite{Bohigas1984},
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GOE}
 P_\text{GOE}(s)=\frac{\pi}{2}s\exp\left(-\dfrac{\pi}{4}s^2\right), 
\end{equation}
%
and level repulsion is manifested as indicated by the limit case $P(s\to 0)\to s$. We stress that $P(s)$ will be used just to signal the regime of the Hamiltonian, being integrable or chaotic (ergodic, thermalizing), and also to expose possible degeneracies of the energy spectrum, like in the XX model.

\section{Dynamics overview}\label{sec:dynamics}
We focus on the late-time behavior of the dynamical quantities and observables introduced lines above, that is, beyond the so-called Heisenberg time, $t_\text{H}=2\pi/\delta E$. However, it is instructive to illustrate their time evolution from $t=0$ up to saturation. Figure~\ref{fig:dyn} depicts the full-time evolution generated by the disordered model with fixed number of sites $L=16$ for $RP(t)$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn}(a)], $K(t)$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn}(b)], $I(t)$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn}(c)] and $C(t)$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn}(d)]. Three different disorder strengths are considered, $h=0.5$ (red), $h=3.75$ (yellow) and $h=6.0$ (blue). Dark-colored curves are averages over samples obtained from $130$ disorder realizations and $78$ initial states with energy closest to zero, $E_0=\bra{\Psi(0)}{\mathcal{H}}\ket{\Psi(0)}\approx 0$. Then a total of $\sim 10^3$ samples were considered for the average.  Light-colored curves are results from five individual samples, i.e., each one representing the dynamics for a single initial state with energy closest to zero and only one disorder realization. Note that individual samples for $h=3.75$ are omitted, this is done only to avoid overcrowding of figure. For $K(t)$ only disorder realizations were considered. The individual samples present huge sample-to-sample fluctuations~\cite{Prange1997} that could hide or obscure some relevant aspects of the dynamics, as the ones shown by the averaged quantities~\cite{Schiulaz2020,TorresHerrera2020a,TorresHerrera2020b}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Fig01a.eps}
\caption{Full-time dynamics of the quantities and observables treated in our study. Time evolution is generated by the disordered model in the ergodic phase with $h=0.5$ (red), $h=3.75$ (orange) and $h=6.0$ (blue). Return probability (a), spectral form factor (b), spin auto-correlation function (c) and connected spin-spin correlation function (d). Light-colored curves are results from five samples of the dynamics, meanwhile dark-colored curves correspond to an average over $\sim 10^4$ samples originated from different initial states and random realizations. System size is $L=16$.}
\label{fig:dyn}
\end{figure}

In fact, from the averages shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn} a clear power-law decay is seen for the return probability and apparently also for the imbalance~\cite{Torres2015,luitz2016}, although for this last quantity dissipative dynamics includes a stretched exponential decay~\cite{Fischer2016,Levi2016}. The power-law decay is followed by the correlation hole~\cite{TorresH2017,Torres2018,Torres2019} which is visible for both quantities but also for the spectral form factor.  For $C(t)$ the correlation hole is not apparent but it is present, a deep close up is needed to observe it~\cite{lezama2021}. We note that also in~\cite{lezama2021} it was shown how these features depend on both, system size and kind of observable.  

Figure~\ref{fig:dyn2} shows the whole dynamics for the clean XXZ and XX models, but considering only the return probability [Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn2}(a,c)] and spectral form factor [Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn2}(b,d)]. In Fig.~\ref{fig:dyn2}(a,c) the dark-blue curves are averages over $200$ initial states together with an additional moving average to reduce fluctuations. Light-blue curves are dynamics for five individual initial states with energies closest to zero. In Figs.~\ref{fig:dyn2}(b,d) the dark curves are moving averages over a single sample. While the light-colored curves are the rough data. Although interesting transient behavior is observed in Figs.~\ref{fig:dyn} and~\ref{fig:dyn2}, it is worth to emphasize that our main analysis of the distribution functions will be carried out for times beyond the Heisenberg time, $t_\text{H}$. However, we eventually will provide examples of distribution functions for different time scales. The vertical dashed line in all panels of both figures marks the point where $t/t_\text{H}=1$. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Fig01b.eps}
\caption{Full-time dynamics of $RP(t)$ and $K(t)$ generated by the XXZ (a, b) and XX (c, d) models. The light-colored curves in (a) and (c) are for individual samples of $RP(t)$ obtained for five different initial states, meanwhile the dark-colored ones correspond to an average over $200$ initial states, together with an additional moving average performed to further smooth the curves. For $K(t)$ in (b) and (d) the light-colored curves represent the dynamics from a single initial state and the dark-colored curves correspond to moving averages over the same sample. System size is $L=16$.}
\label{fig:dyn2}
\end{figure}

\section{Central Limit Theorem and distribution functions}\label{sec:CLT}
Equation~\eqref{eq:rp} for the return probability can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spe}
RP(t)= \left|\sum _{\alpha =1}^{\cal{N}}X_{\alpha}(t) - i \sum _{\alpha =1}^{\cal{N}}Y_{\alpha}(t)\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $X_\alpha(t)=|c^0_\alpha|^{2}\cos(E_\alpha t)$ and $Y_\alpha(t)=|c^0_\alpha|^{2}\sin(E_\alpha t)$. 
At this point we remind that the classical Central Limit Theorem roughly states that if $X_\alpha(t)$ or $Y_\alpha(t)$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with finite second moment, then the distribution of their sum is well approximated by a Gaussian shape. Thus, if we assume that $X_\alpha(t)$ and $Y_\alpha(t)$ behave as i.i.d. in a time window $[t_i,t_f]$ with initial time $t_i$ and final time $t_f$, then Eq.~\eqref{eq:spe} can be considered as the squared norm of a complex random variable with Gaussian real and imaginary parts. In such a case the distribution of $RP(t)$ should be exponential~\cite{Siddiqui1962},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RPexp}
P(RP) = \lambda e^{-\lambda RP}, \hspace{1cm} \lambda\geq 0.
\end{equation}
Considering the terms appearing in Eq.~\eqref{eq:spe}, it is clear that if both, initial state components $c^0_\alpha$ and energy eigenvalues $E_\alpha$ behave simultaneously as i.i.d. then the CLT should hold. Assuming that $X_\alpha(t)$ and $Y_\alpha(t)$ remain each one identically distributed, three possible scenarios where the CLT does not hold are when initial state components are auto-correlated, energy eigenvalues are auto-correlated or both of them are correlated, each of these cases mean that $X_\alpha(t)$ and $Y_\alpha(t)$ are not independent. Note however that even for weakly enough correlated variables the CLT could remain true~\cite{Hilhorst2009}.

In the case of $K(t)$ the exponential distribution should be achieved when correlations between energy eigenvalues are absent, just see the expression defining $K(t)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sff}.  The scenario for the expectation value of generic observables is more involved. From its time evolution 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:go}
\left\langle{\cal{O}}(t)\right\rangle= \sum_{\alpha,\beta}c_\alpha^0c_\beta^0{\cal{O}}_{\alpha\beta}e^{-i(E_\alpha-E_\beta)t},   
\end{equation}
with ${\cal{O}}_{\alpha\beta}=\left\langle \psi_\alpha|{\cal{O}}|\psi_\beta\right\rangle$, we see that matrix elements in energy representation of the observable are also included. The simplest case arises with the assumption that all terms inside the summation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:go} behave collectively as i.i.d. random variables, then by the CLT we expect the distribution to be Gaussian.  We note that having a Gaussian distribution for the late-time values of a generic observable is an indication that the matrix elements of the observable in energy representation are i.i.d. by themselves. However, if the distribution is not Gaussian then we can not ensure that the matrix elements are correlated, this because the presence of energy eigenvalues and eigenstates inside the summation that could be correlated. Although interesting, we leave the analysis of those fine details for a future work. 

At this point it is fair to mention that Aurich and Steiner conjetured in~\cite{Aurich1999} that given an extended initial state, the distribution function of a normalized version of the return amplitude $S(t)$ for a chaotic quantum system should be universally described by Rayleigh's law,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RL}
P(S) = \frac{\pi}{2}S\exp\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}S^{2}\right), \hspace{1cm} S\geq 0.
\end{equation} 
%
This conjecture was established in the context of 2D and 3D quantum billiards. It is straightforward to show that the square root of an exponential distribution, like the one for the return probability, results in a Rayleigh distribution just as Eq.~\eqref{eq:RL}, this is consistent with Eq.~\eqref{eq:RPexp} which was derived using only basics from probability theory.  Also fair is to note that in the context of RMT, Kunz arrived to the rigorous result that the pdf of $RP(t)$ is exponential, independently of the initial state~\cite{Kunz2002}.

\section{Results}\label{Sec:Results}
Now we present and describe our results on the pdfs, starting with the return probability $RP(t)$, to which we devote majority of this paper. Results about level statistics are also presented, but of course they are no new in the existing literature. As explained before, we use them only as a reference.

\subsection{Return probability and spectral form factor}\label{SubSec. III.A}
Figure~\ref{fig:dsp} depicts $P(s)$ and $P(RP)$ for the disordered model and fixed number of spins $L=18$. The upper panels $P(s)$ show the behavior already known in the vicinity of the MBL transition~\cite{Serbyn2016}. For small disorder strength, $h=0.5$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:dsp} (a)], $P(s)$ has the shape described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:GOE}. At intermediate disorder strength, $h=3.75$, the shape of $P(s)$ is neither GOE-like nor Poisson-like, although closer to the Poisson shape than to GOE. Once at the localized phase, $h=6.0$, $P(s)$ gets the shape predicted by Eq.~\eqref{eq:P}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.345]{Fig01.eps}
\caption{Level spacing distribution $P(s)$ (upper panels) and distribution of the late-time values of $RP(t)$ (lower panels) for the disordered model. The time intervals are $t/t_\text{H}\in(11.38,14.93)$, $t/t_\text{H}\in(29.25,38.38)$, and $t/t_\text{H}\in(33.34,43.74)$ for the disorder strengths $h=0.5$ (a), $h=3.75$ (b) and $h=6.0$ (c) respectively. Solid lines in the upper panels depict the theoretical values for $P(s)$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:P} [color red in (b) and (c)] and Eq.~\eqref{eq:GOE} [color blue in (a) and (b)]. Solid curves in the lower panels correspond to Eq.~\eqref{eq:RPexp} with mean 1. System size is $L=18$.}
\label{fig:dsp}
\end{figure}

Distributions of $RP(t)$ with $t/t_\text{H}>1$ are shown in the lower panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:dsp}, specific time intervals are indicated in the captions. An initial state with energy $E_0$ closest to zero is chosen and a single disorder realization is considered. Note that in the whole work we have normalized the values of $RP(t)$ with their standard deviation in the respective time interval. Figure~\ref{fig:dsp} (d) confirms the anticipated in Sec.~\ref{sec:CLT}, for $h=0.5$ the distribution of $RP$ (histogram in color blue) conforms with the exponential distribution given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:RPexp} with $\lambda=1$. Then we can say that both $c_\alpha^0$ and $E_\alpha$ behave collectively as i.i.d. random variables. The increase of disorder strength $h$ is accompanied by the lack of correspondence between the exponential and the distributions of $RP$, which is clearly seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:dsp} (e) and (f) for $h=3.75$ and $h=6.0$ respectively. This is a relevant observation because the distribution $P(RP)$ can detect the MBL transition, and remarkably from a single sample of the dynamics. The shape of $P(RP)$ different from the exponential is a signature of autocorrelations, be in the energy eigenvalues or between initial state components. Correlations between eigenstates components have been shown to exist around the MBL transition, see for instance~\cite{Torres2015,Torres2017} and more recently~\cite{Tikhonov2021}. In fact, the slow dynamics produced by those correlations have been observed experimentally~\cite{Luschen2017}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{Fig02.eps} 
\caption{Distribution of the late-time values of $K(t)$ for the same time window as in Fig.~\ref{fig:dsp} for the disordered model with $h=0.5$ (a), $h=3.75$ (b) and $h=6.0$ (c). Solid curves are given by $P(K)=\exp(-K)$. System size is $L=18$.}
\label{fig:dsff}
\end{figure}

However, up to our knowledge, information about auto-correlations of energy levels does not exist. To fill out this gap, we recur to the spectral form factor and analyze its distribution for $t/t_\text{H}>1$. Figure~\ref{fig:dsff} is conclusive, it shows that for any disorder strength in the disordered model the distribution of $K(t)$ has an exponential shape, meaning that the energy eigenvalues remain as i.i.d. random variables. Then the sole cause for the unconform shapes of $P(RP)$ in Figs.~\ref{fig:dsp} (e) and (f) should be the auto-correlations between initial state components $c_\alpha^0$. To reinforce our statement about initial state, we present in Fig.~\ref{fig:xxzc} $P(RP)$ departing from a random initial state with tuned degree of correlations and evolved by the disordered model in the chaotic region, with fixed $h=0.5$. There the components $c_\alpha^0$ of the initial state are random numbers from a uniform distribution and with correlation degree $q$, generated following the recipe given in~\cite{Thomas1993} and recently used to show the effects of correlated disorder in the region around the MBL transition~\cite{Vallejo2022}. Figure~\ref{fig:xxzc} shows that as the degree of correlations moves from a regime of strong correlations (a), passing trough intermediate (b) and finally arriving to weak correlations (c), the exponential distribution of $P(RP)$ is eventually recovered.

\subsubsection{XX and XXZ models}
As already discussed, auto-correlations between energy levels could block the fulfillment of the CLT. Those correlations can be caused, for instance, by degeneracies in the energy spectrum. A suitable model to show this is the XX model [$\Delta=0$ and $h=0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ham}], which energy spectrum contains a high amount of degeneracies~\cite{Zangara2013}. Figure~\ref{fig:dxxxxz} (a) showing $P(s)$ for the XX model confirms the degenarices with the Shnirelman's peak as a witness~\cite{Chirikov1995}. Consequently, the distribution not only of $RP(t)$ but also of $K(t)$ should not be exponential, which is confirmed by Figs.~\ref{fig:dxxxxz} (c) and (e) for $P(RP)$ and $P(K)$ respectively. 
\begin{figure}[H]

Left column contains results for the XX model, meanwhile in the right columns the results are for the XXZ model. The considered time windows are $t/t_\text{H}\in(9.092,11.928)$ for the XX model and $t/t_\text{H}\in(9.859,12.935)$ for the XXZ model. $L=18$.}
\label{fig:dxxxxz}
\end{figure}

We complement our analysis with the study of the time evolution generated by the XXZ model [$\Delta=1$ and $h=0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ham}]. The Ising interactions present in the integrable XXZ model break some symmetries of the XX model and thus removes degeneracies in the energy spectrum. This is reflected into $P(s)$, Fig~\ref{fig:dxxxxz} (b), which displays Poisson-like statistics. The distribution of the return probability, $P(RP)$, is exponential meaning that energy eigenvalues and initial state components behave as uncorrelated random variables. Figure~\ref{fig:dxxxxz} for $P(K)$ confirms absence of auto-correlations between eigenvalues. To confirm the last same for initial state components, we employed the so-called inverse participation ratio, $IPR=\sum _{\alpha=1}^{\cal{N}}|\braket{\psi_{\alpha}|\Psi(0)}|^{4}\propto {\cal{N}}^{-D_2}$, with $0\leq D_2\leq 1$ known as the correlation dimension that measures the degree of correlations between eigenstate components~\cite{Wegner1980}. Two extreme cases $D_2=0$ and $D_2=1$ mean correlations and absence of correlations respectively. Our scaling analysis of $IPR$ with dimension $\cal{N}$ (not shown) for the initial state $\ket{\Psi(0)}$ used in Fig.~\ref{fig:dxxxxz} (d) lead us to $D_2\approx 0.75$, this value suggest weak correlations between initial state components $c_\alpha^0$, at least weak enough to have the CLT still valid.

Our results for the integrable XXZ model reaffirm the idea that the universal late-time exponential distribution is achieved once the conditions for the CLT fulfillment are provided, that is, simultaneous absence or weak auto-correlations in the initial state components and in the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian generating the time evolution.

\subsubsection{Timescales}\label{SubSec. III.C}
Up to now, the analysis has been carried out using timescales greater than the Heisenberg time $t_\text{H}$, an interesting question is if the universal distribution could appear for smaller timescales. Figure~\ref{fig:tw} displays the distribution of $RP$ for the disordered model in the ergodic phase with $h=0.5$ and for different time intervals, at very short times (a), power-law decay (b), around the correlation hole (c) and saturation (d). The reader is referred to Fig.~\ref{fig:dsp}(a) and discussion in Sec.~\ref{sec:dynamics} to remind all those time scales.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{Fig05.eps} 
\caption{Distribution $P(RP)$ of the return probability for the disordered model in the ergodic phase with $h=0.5$ in different time windows. Initial decay, $t/t_\text{H}\in(0.000034,0.000089)$ (a), power-law decay, $t/t_\text{H}\in(0.00034,0.00089)$ (b), around the time where the minimum of the correlation hole is located, $t/t_\text{H}\in(0.0091,0.0228)$ (c) and saturation, $t/t_\text{H}\in(11.38,14.93)$ (d). Solid curves are given by $P(RP) = \exp(-RP)$. System size is $L=18$.}
\label{fig:tw}
\end{figure}

Once the initial state begins the transition to other basis states, as time increases, the distribution $P(RP)$ moves gradually to an exponential one. At short times the return probability is very similar in values and a peaked distribution is obtained, Fig.~\ref{fig:tw}(a). The exponential shape is completely achieved when the time is large enough like in Fig.~\ref{fig:tw}(d); however, note that for times when the correlation hole appears [Fig.~\ref{fig:tw}(c)] the distribution of $RP$ also looks like an exponential but not quite good as in Fig.~\ref{fig:tw}(d). Then we infer that in order to observe the universal exponential distribution one should wait for times beyond the Heisenberg time, $t_\text{H}$. Now we have the opportunity to mention that the exponential distribution of $RP(t)$ in a time interval coincides with the exponential observed in~\cite{TorresHerrera2020b} also at large times, but there fixing a single time $t_0$ and computing the pdf over different disorder realizations and initial states. This is consistent with the fact that in order to study ergodicity one should do it once at equilibrium.

Solid curves are fittings with a Gaussian function, $P(x)=(\sqrt{2\pi})^{-1/2}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2}$, with $\mu$ a fitting parameter corresponding to the center of the distribution. System size is $L=18$.}

\subsection{Spin auto-correlation function and connected spin-spin correlation function}\label{SubSec. III.B}

In this Section we focus on the analysis of the pdf of two dynamical observables of great interest in quantum simulations with cold atoms and ion traps, the spin auto-correlation function $I(t)$ and the connected spin-spin correlation function $C(t)$ given by Eqs.~\ref{eqn:CSSCF} and~\ref{eqn:SAF} respectively. We see in the upper panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:obs} the pdf for the spin auto-correlation function, $P[I(t/t_\text{H}>1)]$, meanwhile in the lower panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:obs} we have the pdf for the connected spin-spin correlation function, $P[C(t/t_\text{H}>1)]$. Both quantities are evolved by the disordered model with different disorder strengths. As predicted in Sec.~\ref{sec:CLT}, when $h=0.5$ the late-time pdf are Gaussian for both observables [Figs.~\ref{fig:obs} (a) and (d)]. Once the system is outside the ergodic phase, the pdf for both observables do not conform with the Gaussian shape. Comparing Figs.~\ref{fig:obs} (b) and (e), for $h=3.75$, we see that $P(I)$ is more sensitive to the change in disorder than $P(C)$. Finally, when the disorder strength is $h=6.0$, the lack of correspondence between the pdf of both observables and the Gaussian is even more evident. Again, the shape of the pdf can be used as a probe of the MBL transition. Interestingly, our results in the ergodic side of the MBL are in line with results for non-interacting systems in~\cite{Venuti2010,Venuti2013}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{Sec:Conclusions}
We analyzed the late-time probability distribution functions of dynamical quantities of interest for experimental platforms. We argued that the pdfs are universal in the sense that the unique requirement is the CLT to hold. This needs uncorrelated initial state components and energy spectrum. For chaotic quantum systems these conditions are fulfilled, but also for integrable systems like the XXZ model. Strong degeneracies in the energy spectrum, like in the XX model, prevent the CLT to hold, as well as correlated initial state components, like in the disordered model for intermediate and strong disorder strengths. For generic observables, an additional condition should be fulfilled, uncorrelated elements in energy representation. This happens for the two quantities studied in this work, the spin auto-correlation function and the connected spin-spin correlation function.  No averages are needed, our analysis was based on a single sample of the dynamics. Details about auto-correlations between initial state components, energy levels and elements of observables deserve a deeper analysis, but this is leaved for a future work.  We expect our results to motivate further studies of late-time pdfs in several quantum systems.

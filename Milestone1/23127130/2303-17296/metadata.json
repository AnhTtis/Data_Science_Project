    "abstract": "In this work we consider the observational properties of compact boson stars with self-interactions orbited by isotropically emitting (hot-spot) sources and optically thin accretion disks. We consider two families of boson stars supported by quartic and sixth-order self-interaction potentials, and choose three samples of each of them in growing compactness; only those with large enough compactness are capable to hold light-rings, namely, null bound orbits. For the hot-spots, using inclination angles $θ=\\{20^\\circ, 50^\\circ, 80^\\circ \\}$ we find a secondary track plunge-through image of photons crossing the interior of the boson star, which can be further decomposed into additional images if the star is compact enough. For accretion disks we find that the latter class of stars actually shows a sequence of additional secondary images in agreement with the hot-spot analysis, a feature absent in typical black hole space-times. Furthermore, we also find a shadow-like central brightness depression for some of these stars in both axial observations and at the inclination angles above. We discuss our findings in relation to the capability of boson stars to effectively act as black hole mimickers in their optical appearances as well as potential observational discriminators.",

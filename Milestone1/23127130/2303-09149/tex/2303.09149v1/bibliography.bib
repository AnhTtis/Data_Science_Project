The shapes of three-dimensional liquid drops in equilibrium with such substrates in the framework of the classical capillary theory are obtained. The numerical method used for minimizing the free energy is based on the local variations approach. It has been extended here to treat chemically heterogeneous substrates with "mesa" defects, i.e., sharp boundaries between surface patches with different surface tensions. The method allows inclusion of the gravity and the line tension of the contact line as well as different constraints, e.g. the constant volume constraint. We discuss the implications for the standard and modified Cassie equations and for the interpretation of the experimental data. Two different situations arise regarding the averaging of the contact angle for the two types of substrates considered: that with radial symmetry and that without (the dart board substrate).},

Models that express the hysteresis or dynamics in terms of defect properties exist but have yet to be conclusively tested by experiment. Here we produce heterogeneous surfaces and thoroughly characterize individual defects. Precise dynamical measurements allow us to conclude that there is no evidence of a thermally activated dynamics due to their presence, but that the hysteresis scales with their concentration and the square of their height, as predicted by some simple models.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the configuration of the contact line of a water drop lying on an ultrahydrophobic post surface using the numerical algorithm Surface Evolver. For the special situation of Cassie wetting, we propose a modified definition of the contact line as the line in space where the meniscus starts to curve upward out of the plane of the composite surface. In our simulations, it is found that the contact line is very strongly distorted, indicating a strong tendency of the drop to "ball up" in those areas where it is not in contact with the solid surface. The distortion of the contact line corresponds to a pronounced deformation of the liquid-air interface around the base of the drop. We discuss the consequences of this distortion for the definition and practical measurement of the contact angle on ultrahydrophobic surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

The result shows that neither a liquid-solid contact area nor an apparent contact line is a critical physical parameter to determine the depinning force. The configuration of a contact line on a superhydrophobic surface is multimodal, composed of both two phases (liquid and air) and three phases (liquid, solid, and air). The multimodal state is dynamically altered when a droplet recedes. The maximal three-phase contact line attainable along the actual droplet boundary is found to be a direct and linear parameter that decides the depinning force on the superhydrophobic surface. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Understanding the complexities associated with contact line dynamics on chemically heterogeneous and superhydrophobic surfaces is important for a wide variety of engineering problems. Despite significant efforts to capture the behavior of a droplet on these surfaces over the past few decades, modeling of the complex dynamics at the three-phase contact line is needed. In this work, we demonstrate that contact line distortion on heterogeneous and superhydrophobic surfaces is the key aspect that needs to be accounted for in the dynamic droplet models. Contact line distortions were visualized and modeled using a thermodynamic approach to develop a unified model for contact angle hysteresis on chemically heterogeneous and superhydrophobic surfaces. On a surface comprised of discrete wetting defects on an interconnected less wetting area, the advancing contact angle was determined to be independent of the defects, while the relative fraction of the distorted contact line with respect to the baseline surface was shown to govern the receding contact angle. This behavior reversed when the relative wettability of the discrete defects and interconnected area was inverted. The developed model showed good agreement with the experimental advancing and receding contact angles, both at low and high solid fractions. The thermodynamic model was further extended to demonstrate its capability to capture droplet shape evolution during liquid addition and removal in our experiments and those in literature. This study offers new insight extending the fundamental understanding of solid-liquid interactions required for design of advanced functional coatings for microfluidics, biological, manufacturing, and heat transfer applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Capillary action or Capillarity is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition to, external forces like gravity. Three effects contribute to capillary action, namely, adhesion of the liquid to the walls of the confining solid; meniscus formation; and low Reynolds number fluid flow. We investigate the dissipation of energy during one cycle of capillary action, when the liquid volume inside a capillary tube first increases and subsequently decreases while assuming quasi-static motion. The quasi-static assumption allows us to focus on the wetting phenomenon of the solid wall by the liquid and the formation of the meniscus. It is well known that the motion of a liquid on an non-ideal surface involves the expenditure of energy due to contact angle hysteresis. In this paper, we derive the equations for the menisci and the flow rules for the change of the contact angles for a liquid column in a capillary tube at a constant temperature and volume by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy using calculus of variations. We describe the numerical solution of these equations and present results from computations for the case of a capillary tube with 1 mm diameter.},

We observed that the contact line was distorted with a logarithmic shape far from the defect; however, the distortion was dependent on the wall velocity. The apparent (averaged) dynamic contact angle of the wall with a defect was evaluated using a macroscopic energy balance. The apparent dynamic contact angles estimated from the energy balance agree well with the arithmetic averaged angles obtained from the present simulations. The macroscopic energy balance is useful to consider the effect of heterogeneity or roughness of the wall on the relation between the dynamic contact angle and contact line speed.},

abstract = {Describing wetting of a liquid on a rough or structured surface is a challenge because of the wide range of involved length scales. Nano- and micrometer-sized textures cause pinning of the contact line, reflected in a hysteresis of the contact angle. To investigate contact angles at different length scales, we imaged water drops on arrays of 5 $\mu$m high poly(dimethylsiloxane) micropillars. The drops were imaged by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), which allowed us to quantitatively analyze the local and large-scale drop profile simultaneously. Deviations of the shape of drops from a sphere decay at two different length scales. Close to the pillars, the amplitude of deviations decays exponentially within 1-2 $\mu$m. The drop profile approached a sphere at a length scale 1 order of magnitude larger than the pillars' height. The height and position dependence of the contact angles can be understood from the interplay of pinning of the contact line, the principal curvatures set by the topography of the substrate, and the minimization of the air-water interfaces. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A sessile drop is an isolated drop which has been deposited on a solid substrate where the wetted area is limited by the three-phase contact line and characterized by contact angle, contact radius and drop height. Although, wetting has been studied using contact angles of drops on solids for more than 200 years, the question remains unanswered: Is wetting of a rough and chemically heterogeneous surface controlled by the interactions within the solid/liquid contact area beneath the droplet or only at the three-phase contact line? After the publications of Pease in 1945, Extrand in 1997, 2003 and Gao and McCarthy in 2007 and 2009, it was proposed that advancing, receding contact angles, and contact angle hysteresis of rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces are determined by interactions of the liquid and the solid at the three-phase contact line alone and the interfacial area within the contact perimeter is irrelevant. As a consequence of this statement, the well-known Wenzel (1934) and Cassie (1945) equations which were derived using the contact area approach are proposed to be invalid and should be abandoned. A hot debate started in the field of surface science after 2007, between the three-phase contact line and interfacial contact area approach defenders. This paper presents a review of the published articles on contact angles and summarizes the views of the both sides. After presenting a brief history of the contact angles and their measurement methods, we discussed the basic contact angle theory and applications of contact angles on the characterization of flat, rough and micropatterned superhydrophobic surfaces. The weak and strong sides of both three-phase contact line and contact area approaches were discussed in detail and some practical conclusions were drawn.},

abstract = {We study numerically the shapes of a liquid meniscus in contact with ultrahydrophobic pillar surfaces in Cassie's wetting regime, when the surface is covered with identical and periodically distributed micropillars. Using the full capillary model we obtain the advancing and the receding equilibrium meniscus shapes when the cross-sections of the pillars are both of square and circular shapes, for a broad interval of pillar concentrations. The bending of the liquid interface in the area between the pillars is studied in the framework of the full capillary model and compared to the results of the heterogeneous approximation model. The contact angle hysteresis is obtained when the three-phase contact line is located on one row (block case) or several rows (kink case) of pillars. It is found that the contact angle hysteresis is proportional to the line fraction of the contact line on pillars tops in the block case and to the surface fraction for pillar concentrations 0.1-0.5 in the kink case. The contact angle hysteresis does not depend on the shape (circular or square) of the pillars cross-section. The expression for the proportionality of the receding contact angle to the line fraction [Raj, Langmuir 28, 15777 (2012)LANGD50743-746310.1021/la303070s] in the case of block depinning is theoretically substantiated through the capillary force, acting on the solid plate at the meniscus contact line.},

abstract = {A clue to understand wetting hysteresis on superhydrophobic surfaces is the relation between receding contact angle and surface textures. When the surface textures are large, there is a significant distribution of local contact angles around the drop. As seen from the cross section, the apparent contact angle oscillates as the triple line recedes. Our experiments demonstrate that the origin of these oscillations is a finite size effect. Combining side and bottom views of the drop, we take into account the 3D conformation of the surface near the edge to evaluate an intrinsic contact angle from the oscillations of the apparent contact angle. We find that for drops receding on axisymmetric textures the intrinsic receding contact angle is the minimum value of the oscillation while for a square lattice it is the maximum. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

The glass fiber of diameter 1-2$\mu$m and length 100-200$\mu$m is glued onto the front end of a rectangular cantilever beam, which is used for atomic force microscopy. From the measured hysteresis loop of the capillary force for 28 different liquids with varying surface tensions and contact angles, we find a universal behavior of the unbalanced capillary force in the advancing and receding directions and the spring constant of a stretched meniscus by the glass fiber. Measurements of the capillary force and its fluctuations suggest that CAH on an ambient solid surface is caused primarily by two types of coexisting and spatially intertwined defects with opposite natures. The contact line is primarily pinned by the relatively nonwetting (repulsive) defects in the advancing direction and by the relatively wetting (attractive) defects in the receding direction. Based on the experimental observations, we propose a "composite model" of CAH and relevant scaling laws, which explain the basic features of the measured hysteresis force loops.},

The anisotropy is basically due to the hysteresis of the contact angle since there is a wetting process in some parts of the contact line, while a dewetting occurs in other parts. Here, we obtain a characteristic drop shape from the rupture of a long liquid filament sitting on a solid substrate. We analyze its shape and contact angles by means of goniometric and refractive techniques. We also find a non-trivial steady state solution for the drop shape within the long wave approximation (lubrication theory), and we compare most of its features with experimental data. This solution is presented both in Cartesian and polar coordinates, whose constants must be determined by a certain group of measured parameters. Besides, we obtain the dynamics of the drop generation from numerical simulations of the full Navier-Stokes equation, where we emulate the hysteretic effects with an appropriate spatial distribution of the static contact angle over the substrate.},

The method employs a specially designed slitlike channel in contact with a reservoir whereby the wettability of one of the slit walls is to be examined whereas the other (auxiliary) wall is separated by half into a lyophilic and a lyophobic part so as to pin the incoming fluid and fix the one end of the liquid-vapor interface. In the present work, the physical background of the method is elucidated theoretically while the method's applicability is demonstrated by molecular-dynamics simulation of a typical Lennard-Jones fluid, in contact with an atomistic wall.

abstract = {In this article we study the static advancing contact angle +a of a liquid interface in contact with a microstructured substrate equipped with a periodic array of circular posts of height H, diameter W and center to center distance D. Assuming a homogeneous material contact angle o and gravity to be negligible, we numerically minimize the interfacial energy of an asymptotically plane liquid interface aligned with a row of posts for a fixed value of the apparent contact angle a. A number of branches of mechanically stable interfacial morphologies are observed and classified by the topology of the liquid interface and the three phase contact line. Increasing a in small steps, we determined the static advancing contact angle +a as the apparent (asymptotic) contact angle, above which no mechanically stable interfacial configuration exists. Specific types of advancing modes can be assigned to certain regions of the control parameter o, aspect ratio h = H/W, and line fraction w = W/D. A rich spectrum of advancing modes is found in the region of material contact angles o between 45 and 55° where interfacial instabilities due to liquid coalescence and contact line depinning compete. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

These two states are usually described by the theories of Cassie (drops suspended on top of roughness features) and Wenzel (drops impaled on roughness features). Whereas the wetting transition from the Cassie to the Wenzel state has been relatively well studied both experimentally and theoretically, the question of whether metastable Wenzel drops exist and how they transition to the Cassie state has remained open. In this work, we study the wetting behavior of microstructured post surfaces coated with a hydrophobic fluoropolymer. Through condensation, the formation of metastable Wenzel droplets is induced. We show that under certain conditions drops can transition from the Wenzel to the Cassie state. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to measure the contact-angle hysteresis for a nanodroplet of water placed on a nanopillared surface. The water droplet can be in either the Cassie state (droplet being on top of the nanopillared surface) or the Wenzel state (droplet being in contact with the bottom of nanopillar grooves). To measure the contact-angle hysteresis in a quantitative fashion, the molecular dynamics simulation is designed such that the number of water molecules in the droplets can be systematically varied, but the number of base nanopillars that are in direct contact with the droplets is fixed. We find that the contact-angle hysteresis for the droplet in the Cassie state is weaker than that in the Wenzel state. This conclusion is consistent with the experimental observation. We also test a different definition of the contact-angle hysteresis, which can be extended to estimate hysteresis between the Cassie and Wenzel state. The idea is motivated from the appearance of the hysteresis loop typically seen in computer simulation of the first-order phase transition, which stems from the metastability of a system in different thermodynamic states. Since the initial shape of the droplet can be controlled arbitrarily in the computer simulation, the number of base nanopillars that are in contact with the droplet can be controlled as well. We show that the measured contact-angle hysteresis according to the second definition is indeed very sensitive to the initial shape of the droplet. Nevertheless, the contact-angle hystereses measured based on the conventional and new definition seem converging in the large droplet limit. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The shape of a hydrostatic meniscus attached at a fixed contact angle to a vertical plate or circular cylinder with periodic corrugations is studied by analytical and numerical methods, and the effect of wall irregularities on the shape of the contact line and vertical component of the capillary force is discussed. An asymptotic analysis for a plate with small-amplitude sinusoidal corrugations is carried out to first order with respect to the corrugation amplitude, and a boundary-value problem is formulated and solved by a shooting method to determine the meniscus shape and elevation of the contact line. The meniscus attached to a corrugated plate with rounded corners produced by a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping function for a triangular wave is considered by numerical methods. The Laplace-Young equation determining the meniscus shape is solved in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates generated by conformal mapping using a finite-difference method. The numerical results are successfully compared with the predictions of the perturbation expansion for small amplitudes and discussed with reference to the rise of a meniscus inside a dihedral angle for large amplitudes. A companion asymptotic analysis is presented for a meniscus outside a vertical circular cylinder with small-amplitude sinusoidal corrugations. The analytical predictions are successfully compared with numerical solutions of the Laplace-Young equation for a meniscus outside an elliptical cylinder with aspect ratio near unity, regarded as a deformed circle. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Paquin2015,
abstract = {The optoelectronic properties of macromolecular semiconductors depend fundamentally on their solid-state microstructure. For example, the molecular-weight distribution influences polymeric- semiconductor properties via diverse microstructures; polymers of low weight-average molecular weight (Mw) form unconnected, extended-chain crystals, usually of a paraffinic structure. Because of the non-entangled nature of the relatively short-chain macromolecules, this leads to a polycrystalline, one-phase morphology. In contrast, with high-Mw materials, where average chain lengths are longer than the length between entanglements, two-phase morphologies, comprised of crystalline moieties embedded in largely unordered (amorphous) regions, are obtained. We investigate charge photogeneration processes in neat regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of varying Mw by means of time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At 10 K, PL originating from recombination of long-lived charge pairs decays over microsecond timescales. Both the amplitude and decay rate distribution depend strongly on Mw. In films with dominant one-phase chain-extended microstructures, the delayed PL is suppressed as a result of a diminished yield of photoinduced charges, and its decay is significantly faster than in two-phase microstructures. However, independent of Mw, charge recombination regenerates singlet excitons in torsionally disordered chains forming more strongly coupled photophysical aggregates than those in the steady-state ensemble, with delayed PL lineshape reminiscent of that in paraffinic morphologies at steady state. We conclude that highly delocalized excitons in disordered regions between crystalline and amorphous phases dissociate extrinsically with yield and spatial distribution that depend intimately upon microstructure.},

The solid is assumed to be either flat, but chemically heterogeneous (this in turn modulating the interfacial tensions), or rough. For weak heterogeneities, we expect no hysteresis, but the contact line becomes wiggly. For stronger heterogeneities, we first discuss the behavior of the contact line in the presence of a single, localized defect, and show that there may exist two stable positions for the line, obtained by a simple graphic construction. Hysteresis shows up when the strength of the defect is above a certain threshold. Extending this to a dilute system of defects, we obtain formulas for the ``advancing'' and ``receding'' contact angles thetaa, thetar, in terms of the distribution of defect strength and defect sharpness. These formulas might be tested by controlled contamination of a solid surface.},

The spatially periodical chemical heterogeneity is considered. We propose precise definitions for both the advancing and the receding contact angles for the Wilhelmy plate geometry. It is well known that in such a system, a multitude of metastable states of the liquid meniscus occurs for each different relative position of the defect pattern on the plate with respect to the liquid level. As usual, the static advancing and receding angles are assumed to be a consequence of the preceding contact line motion in the respective direction. It is shown how to select the appropriate states among all metastable states. Their selection is discussed. The proposed definitions are applicable to both the static and the dynamic contact angles on heterogeneous surfaces. The static advancing and receding angles are calculated for two examples of periodic heterogeneity patterns with sharp borders: the horizontal alternating stripes of a different wettability (studied analytically) and the doubly periodic pattern of circular defects on a homogeneous base (studied numerically). The wetting hysteresis is determined as a function of the defect density and the spatial period.

The dynamic contact angles of water on these surfaces are carefully measured and found to be consistent with the theoretical predictions of the Cassie model and the Wenzel model. When a water drop is at the Wenzel state, its contact angle hysteresis increases along with an increase in the surface roughness. While the surface roughness is further raised beyond its transition roughness (from the Wenzel state to the Cassie state), the contact angle hysteresis (or receding contact angle) discontinuously drops (or jumps) to a lower (or higher) value. When a water drop is at the Cassie state, its contact angle hysteresis strongly depends on the solid fraction and has nothing to do with the surface roughness. Even for a superhydrophobic surface, the contact angle hysteresis may still exhibit a value as high as 41 degrees for the solid fraction of 0.563.},

abstract = {Contact line motion over a topographical substrate is considered using the spreading of a two-dimensional droplet as a model system. The spreading dynamics is modeled under the assumption of small contact angles where the long-wave expansion in the Stokes-flow regime can be employed to derive a single equation for the evolution of the droplet thickness. The contact line singularity is removed through the Navier slip condition, while the contact angle at the contact points is assumed to remain always equal to its static value. Through a singular perturbation approach, the flow in the vicinity of the contact line is matched asymptotically with the flow in the bulk of the droplet to yield a set of two coupled integrodifferential equations for the location of the two droplet fronts. Our matching procedure is verified through direct comparisons with numerical solutions to the full problem. Analysis of the equations obtained by asymptotic matching reveals a number of intriguing features that are not present when the substrate is flat. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of multiple equilibrium states which allows for a hysteresislike effect on the apparent contact line. Further, we demonstrate a stick-slip-type behavior of the contact line as it moves along the local variations of the substrate shape and the interesting possibility of a relatively brief recession of one of the contact lines.},

@article{Shardt2020,
abstract = {When a drop is in contact with a rough surface, it can rest on top of the rough features (the Cassie-Baxter state) or it can completely fill the rough structure (the Wenzel state). The contact angle ($\theta$) of a drop in these states is commonly predicted by the Cassie-Baxter or Wenzel equations, respectively, but the accuracy of these equations has been debated. Previously, we used fundamental Gibbsian composite-system thermodynamics to rigorously derive the Cassie-Baxter equation, and we found that the contact line determined the macroscopic contact angle, not the contact area that was originally proposed. Herein, to address the various perspectives on the Wenzel equation, we apply Gibbsian composite-system thermodynamics to derive the complete set of equilibrium conditions (thermal, chemical, and mechanical) for a liquid drop resting on a homogeneous rough solid substrate in the Wenzel mode of wetting. Through this derivation, we show that the roughness must be evaluated at the contact line, not over the whole interfacial area, and we propose a new Wenzel equation for a surface with pillars of equal height. We define a new dimensionless number H = h(1 - $\lambda$solid)/R to quantify when the drop's radius of curvature (R) is large enough compared to the size of the pillars for the new Wenzel equation to be simplified (h is the pillar height; $\lambda$solid is the line fraction of the spherical cap's circumference that is on the pillars). Our new line-roughness Wenzel equation can be simplified to cos$\theta$W = $\rho$cos$\theta$Y when H ≪ 1, where $\rho$ is the line roughness. We also perform a thermodynamic free-energy analysis to determine the stability of the equilibrium states that are predicted by our new Wenzel equation.},

@article{Cheng2008,
abstract = {In this paper, we report on stable liquid-air interfaces and high-aspect-ratio polymer micromembranes with complex and controlled structures formed within microfluidic channels. Selective alkanethiol treatment on gold and copper surfaces is employed to create hydrophilic-hydrophobic boundaries between glass and these metal surfaces within microchannels. Robust liquid-air interfaces, featured with different 3-D structures, are formed at these boundaries. The process for creating these liquid-air interfaces is highly reproducible. Simulations are conducted to further study the liquid-air interfaces. The liquid-air interfaces are then utilized for interfacial polymerization. Two immiscible liquid phases containing the reagents react and generate polymer micromembranes within microfluidic channels. Formed following the hydrophilic-hydrophobic boundaries, these membranes have not only complex footprints on the substrates but also different configurations in the z-direction. Here, we demonstrate high-quality and complex 3-D nylon micromembranes fabricated in microchannels using this method. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

@article{Grana-Otero2019,
abstract = {With the aim of finding mathematical criteria for contact line depinning from sharp corners, we have studied the equilibrium and stability of a semi-infinite planar liquid layer pinned at the vertex of a wedge. Equilibrium is compatible with a fan of apparent contact angles $\theta$0 bracketed by the equilibrium contact angles of both flanks of the wedge, so the contact line could remain pinned if $\theta$0 is within this fan. However, the equilibrium becomes unstable at critical depinning advancing $\theta$0a and receding $\theta$0r contact angles, which are found as subcritical saddle-node bifurcations. Equilibrium is possible (stable) within the interval $\theta$0r{\textless}$\theta$0{\textless}$\theta$0a, but the contact line depins from the vertex beyond these critical angles if they occur within the equilibrium fan.},

@article{Savva2019,
abstract = {Slow droplet motion on chemically heterogeneous substrates is considered analytically and numerically. We adopt the long-wave approximation which yields a single partial differential equation for the droplet height in time and space. A matched asymptotic analysis in the limit of nearly circular contact lines and vanishingly small slip lengths yields a reduced model consisting of a set of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the Fourier harmonics of the contact line. The analytical predictions are found, within the domain of their validity, to be in good agreement with the solutions to the governing partial differential equation. The limitations of the reduced model when the contact line undergoes stronger deformations are partially lifted by proposing a hybrid scheme which couples the results of the asymptotic analysis with the boundary integral method. This approach improves the agreement with the governing partial differential equation, but at a computational cost which is significantly lower compared to that required for the full problem.},

    \caption{\textbf{The 4 Conv \& 3 FC Layer-wise Average Capacities} on Sequence of TinyImageNet Dataset Experiments. (a) The proportion of reused weights per task depends on $c$ value, and the proportion of reused weights for all tasks tends to be decreasing, (b) The capacity of Conv4 with high variance is greater than Conv1 with low variance, and the Conv4 proportion of reused weights for all tasks are smaller than the Conv1, (c) The capacity of Conv4 with high variance is greater than Liner2 with low variance and the Conv4 proportion of reused weights for all tasks are smaller than the Linear2, and (d) The capacity of Linear1 is greater than Linear2 in the early task learning stage, and the Linear1 proportion of reused weights for all tasks are smaller than the Linear2 in the early task learning stage. From (b), (c), and (d), the proportion of reused weights per task tends to be progressively saturated to $c=0.1$ value.}

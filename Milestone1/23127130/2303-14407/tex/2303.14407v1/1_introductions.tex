    %2D GANs 
    Since the first introduction by Goodfellow in 2014,
    generative adversarial networks (GANs) \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/GoodfellowPMXWOCB14} have significantly advanced the performance of 2D high-resolution image generation. 
    GANs can accomplish a variety of downstream image editing tasks, particularly face modification \cite{DBLP:journals/tog/AbdalZMW21,nerffaceediting,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2205-15517,DBLP:conf/cvpr/SunWZLZLW22}, thanks to the excellent image quality and semantic features in its latent space. 
    %3D GANs
    Recently, plenty of 3D-aware generators \cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/GuL0T22,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2112-11427,Chan_2022_CVPR,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2110-09788,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2206-07695,DBLP:conf/cvpr/DengYX022,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2206-10535,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2301-09091} have been proposed to learn 3D-consistent face portrait generation from 2D image datasets.

    3D-aware generators can describe and represent geometry in their latent space while rendering objects from different camera perspectives using volumetric rendering. Researchers carefully designed generator architectures and training strategies to accelerate training, reduce memory overheads, and increase rendering resolution.
     
    Both the existing 2D and 3D approaches, however, are unable to process large-pose face data.
     %
    Regarding 2D face generators, those large-pose data are actually outside of their latent space, which prevents them from generating reasonable large-pose data, thus causing at least two problems. 
    First, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2d_gans_steep_yaw-1} (left), moving the latent code along the yaw pose editing direction will cause it to reach the edge of the latent space before faces become profile.
    Second, as shown by the results of image inversion
    in Fig.~\ref{fig:2d_gans_steep_yaw-1} (right), it is challenging to project large-pose images to the latent space, let alone perform semantic modification on them.
     %
    One of the goals of 3D-aware generators is to model realistic human face geometry, but existing 3D-aware generators trained on 2D image datasets still have difficulty producing realistic geometry. This issue is more serious when rendering the results at extreme poses.
    As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ed_aware_gans_steep_yaw-1}, faces synthesized by those methods have noticeable artifacts, including distortion, blurring, and stratification. 
     %
    In Fig. \ref{fig:teaser} (b), EG3D shows a ``wall-mounted'' and distorted 3D representation without ears. All these indicate that the generated face shapes are not realistic enough.
    

    The above issues in the face generators are mainly caused by the unbalanced camera pose distribution of the {narrow-range} training dataset.
    \textbf{F}lickr-\textbf{F}aces-\textbf{HQ} Dataset (\textbf{FFHQ}) is a popular high-quality face dataset used to train those face generators, but it mainly contains images limited to small to medium poses.
    As a result, 2D and 3D-aware generators cannot learn a correct large-pose face
    distribution without sufficient large-pose data.
    To avoid artifacts under large poses, downstream applications \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2205-15517,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2203-13441,DBLP:conf/wacv/KoCCRK23,xie2022high,nerffaceediting,DBLP:conf/siggrapha/JinRKBC22,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2301-02700,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2211-16927} based on those face generators typically sample small poses, which limits their application scenarios. 
    
    It is difficult to get a pose-balanced dataset. 
    %
    First, large-pose faces are nearly impossible to detect using Dlib \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/KazemiS14}, a popular face detector, and the one used to crop \textit{FFHQ}.
    %
    Second, simply replicating extremely limited large-pose data to balance the pose distribution is insufficient to help extend the camera distribution.
    %
    As a result, it is critical to collect a large number of large-pose, {in-the-wild}, and high-resolution face images, which are lacking in existing datasets.

    In this paper, we propose a novel high-quality face dataset containing \textbf{19,590} real large-pose face images, named \textbf{L}arge-\textbf{P}ose-\textbf{F}lickr-\textbf{F}aces Dataset (\textbf{LPFF}), as a supplement to \textit{FFHQ}, in order to extend the camera pose distribution of \textit{FFHQ} and train 2D and 3D-aware face generators that are free of the aforementioned problems. 
    %
    Given the difficulty of large-pose face detection and the imbalanced distribution of camera poses in real-life photographs, we design a face detection and alignment pipeline that is better suited to large-pose images.
    %
    Our method can also gather large amounts of large-pose data based on pose density. We retrain StyleGAN2-ada \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/KarrasAHLLA20} to demonstrate how our dataset can assist 2D face generators in generating and editing large-pose faces. We retrain EG3D \cite{Chan_2022_CVPR} as an example to demonstrate how our dataset can aid 3D face generators in understanding realistic face geometry and appearance across a wide range of camera poses. 
    {
    In order to better evaluate the 3D-level performance of EG3D models trained on different datasets, we propose a new FID measure for pose-conditional 3D-aware generators.
    }
    Extensive experiments show that our dataset leads to realistic large-pose face generation and manipulation in the 2D generator. Furthermore, our dataset results in more realistic face geometry generation in the 3D-aware generator.

    
    Our paper makes the following major contributions: 
     1) {A novel data processing and filtering method that can collect large-pose face data from the Flickr website according to camera pose distribution, leading to a novel face dataset that contains 19,590 high-quality real large-pose face images.}
     2) A retrained 2D face generator that can process large-pose face images.
     3) A retrained 3D-aware generator that can generate realistic human face geometry.
     4) A new FID measure for pose-conditional 3D-aware generators.

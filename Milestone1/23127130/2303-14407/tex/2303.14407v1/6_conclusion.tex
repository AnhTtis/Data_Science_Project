\section{Conclusion}
In order to address the pose imbalance in the current face generator training datasets, we have presented \textit{LPFF}, a large-pose Flickr face dataset comprised of 19,590 high-quality real large-pose portrait images. 
 %
Compared to those models trained on \textit{FFHQ}, the 2D face generators trained on our dataset display a latent space that is more representative of large poses and achieve better performance when projecting and manipulating large-pose data. The 3D-aware face generators trained on our dataset can produce more realistic face geometry and render higher-quality results at large poses. The rendering results are also more view-consistent.
%
We hope our dataset can inspire more portrait generating and editing works in the future. 
%\textbf{We will release the metadata, crops, camera parameters, landmarks, and raw images of our dataset, along with all the pretrained models.}

Our work has several limitations.
% 
Despite having a more balanced camera pose distribution, our dataset still has a semantic attribute imbalance. For instance, we measured the probability of smiling in \textit{FFHQ+LPFF}. The plot shows that people typically smile when they are facing the camera, so the models trained on our dataset have the smile-posture entanglement. 
{Please refer to the supplement file for the smiling probability plot.}
{This can be overcome by building a camera system and capturing large-scale semantic-balanced images.}

Our processing pipeline uses the face detector and face reconstruction model to align faces, but it does not perform well under extreme conditions (for example, when only the back of the head is visible and the face is completely occluded). As a result, we cannot obtain full-head results.}
Future work that can model the full head may be helpful to get a more extensive dataset.

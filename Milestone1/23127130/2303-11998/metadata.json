    "abstract": "On a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with Anosov geodesic flow, the problem of recovering a connection from the knowledge of traces of its holonomies along primitive closed geodesics is known as the holonomy inverse problem. In this paper, we prove Hölder type stability estimates for this inverse problem: 1) locally, near generic connections; 2) globally, for line bundles, and for vector bundles satisfying a certain low-rank assumption over negatively curved base $(M, g)$. The proofs are based on a combination of microlocal analysis along with a new non-Abelian approximate Livsic Theorem in hyperbolic dynamics.",

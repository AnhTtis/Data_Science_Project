From the projected one-dimensional and two-dimensional distribution of C iv absorption, we find that C iv is detected out to ≈100 kpc (corresponding roughly to ≈0.5 Rvir) of the host galaxies. The C iv absorption strength falls off radially as a power law, and beyond ≈0.5 Rvir, no C iv absorption is detected above our sensitivity limit of ≈50–100 mÅ. We find a tentative correlation between detected C iv absorption strength and star formation, paralleling the strong correlation seen in highly ionized oxygen for L  ∼ L* galaxies by the COS-Halos survey. The data imply a large carbon reservoir in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these galaxies, corresponding to a minimum carbon mass of ≳ 1.2 × 106 M☉ out to ∼110 kpc. This mass is comparable to the carbon mass in the interstellar medium and exceeds the carbon mass currently in the stars of these galaxies. The C iv absorption seen around these sub-L* galaxies can account for almost two-thirds of all Wr ⩾ 100 mÅ C iv absorption detected at low z. Comparing the C iv covering fraction with hydrodynamical simulations, we find that an energy-driven wind model is consistent with the observations whereas a wind model of constant velocity fails to reproduce the CGM or the galaxy properties.}

Across three orders of magnitude in stellar mass, the CGM of present-day galaxies exhibits a very high covering fraction of cool hydrogen gas (fC = 87 ± 4%) indicating that the CGM is ubiquitous in modern, isolated galaxies. When H i is detected, its equivalent width declines with increasing radius regardless of the galaxy mass, but the scatter in this trend correlates closely with M*. Using the radial and stellar mass correlations, we construct a planar surface describing the cool CGM of modern galaxies: . The rms scatter around this bivariate relation is ∼0.2 dex. We interpret the explicit correlation between and M* to arise from the underlying dark matter halo mass (Mhalo), thereby suggesting a CGM fundamental plane between , R, and Mhalo. This correlation can be used to estimate the underlying dark matter halo mass from observations of saturated H i in the CGM of a modern galaxy.}

Our sample includes 45 low-z (0.026–0.049) galaxies from the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (Galaxy Evolution Explorer/Arecibo/Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Their CGM was probed via absorption in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects at impact parameters of 63–231 kpc. The spectra were obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We detected neutral hydrogen (Lyα absorption lines) in the CGM of 92% of the galaxies. We find that the radial profile of the CGM as traced by the Lyα equivalent width can be fit as an exponential with a scale length of roughly the virial radius of the dark matter halo. We found no correlation between the orientation of the sightline relative to the galaxy’s major axis and the Lyα equivalent width. The velocity spread of the circumgalactic gas is consistent with that seen in the atomic gas in the ISM. We find a strong correlation (99.8% confidence) between the gas fraction (M(H i)/M⋆) and the impact-parameter-corrected Lyα equivalent width. This is stronger than the analogous correlation between corrected Lyα equivalent width and specific star formation rate (SFR)/M⋆ (97.5% confidence). These results imply a physical connection between the H i disk and the CGM, which is on scales an order of magnitude larger. This is consistent with the picture in which the H i disk is nourished by accretion of gas from the CGM.}

The galaxy sample is established based on a cross-comparison between public galaxy and quasi-stellar object (QSO) survey data and is characterized by a median redshift of 〈 z 〉 = 0.041, a median projected distance of 〈 d 〉 = 362 kpc to the sightline of the background QSO, and a median stellar mass of log  (Mstar/M⊙) = 9.7 ± 1.1. Comparing the absorber features identified in the QSO spectra with known galaxy properties has led to strong constraints for the CGM absorption properties at z ≲ 0.176. First, abundant hydrogen gas is observed out to d ∼ 500 kpc, well beyond the dark matter halo radius Rh of individual galaxies, with a mean covering fraction of ≈60 per cent. In contrast, no heavy elements are detected at d ≳ 0.7 Rh from either low-mass dwarfs or high-mass galaxies. The lack of detected heavy elements in low- and high-ionization states suggests that either there exists a chemical enrichment edge at d ≈ 0.7 Rh or gaseous clumps giving rise to the observed absorption lines cannot survive at these large distances. Considering all galaxies at d \\&gt; Rh leads to a strict upper limit for the covering fraction of heavy elements of ≈3 per cent (at a 95 per cent confidence level) over d = (1 − 9) Rh. At d \\&lt; Rh, differential covering fraction between low- and high-ionization gas is observed, suggesting that the CGM becomes progressively more ionized from d \\&lt; 0.3 Rh to larger distances. Comparing CGM absorption observations at low and high redshifts shows that at a fixed fraction of Rh the CGM exhibits stronger mean absorption at z = 2.2 than at z ∼ 0, and that the distinction is most pronounced in low-ionization species traced by C ii and Si ii absorption lines. We discuss possible pseudo-evolution of the CGM as a result of misrepresentation of halo radius, and present a brief discussion on the implications of these findings.}",

Specific COS science team papers have used this survey to connect absorbers to galaxies, groups of galaxies, and large-scale structures, including voids. Here we present the technical details of the survey and the basic measurements required for its use, including redshifts for individual galaxies and uncertainties determined collectively by spectral class (emission-line, absorption-line, and composite spectra) and completeness for each sight line as a function of impact parameter and magnitude. For most of these sight lines, the design criteria of >90% completeness over a >1 Mpc region down to ≲0.1 L* luminosities at z ≤ 0.1 allows a plausible association between low-z absorbers and individual galaxies. Lyα covering fractions are computed to approximate the star-forming and passive galaxy populations using the spectral classes above. In agreement with previous results, the covering fraction of star-forming galaxies with L ≥ 0.3 L* is consistent with unity inside one virial radius and declines slowly to >50% at four virial radii. On the other hand, passive galaxies have lower covering fractions (∼60%) and a shallower decline with impact parameter, suggesting that their gaseous halos are patchy but have a larger scale-length than star-forming galaxies. All spectra obtained by this project are made available electronically for individual measurement and use.}

Confirming previous studies, we observe a high covering fraction for Lyα absorption to impact parameter ρ = 300 h−172 kpc: 33/37 of our L > 0.01 L* galaxies show Lyα equivalent width WLyα ⩾ 50 mÅ. Galaxies of all luminosity L > 0.01 L* and spectral type are surrounded by a diffuse and ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM), whose baryonic mass is estimated at ∼1010.5 ± 0.3M☉ for a constant NH = 1019 cm−2. The virialized halos and extended CGM of present-day galaxies are responsible for most strong Lyα absorbers (WLyα > 300 mÅ) but cannot reproduce the majority of observed lines in the Lyα forest. We conclude that the majority of Lyα absorption with WLyα = 30–300 mÅ occurs in the cosmic web predicted by cosmological simulations and estimate a characteristic width for these filaments of ≈400 h−172 kpc. Regarding O vi, we observe a near unity covering fraction to ρ = 200 h−172 kpc for L > 0.1 L* galaxies and to ρ = 300 h−172 kpc for sub-L* (0.1 L* < L < L*) galaxies. Similar to our Lyα results, stronger O vi systems (W1031 > 70 mÅ) arise in the virialized halos of L > 0.1 L* galaxies. Unlike Lyα, the weaker O vi systems (W1031 ≈ 30 mÅ) arise in the extended CGM of sub-L* galaxies. The majority of O vi gas observed in the low-z IGM is associated with a diffuse medium surrounding individual galaxies with L ≈ 0.3 L* and rarely originates in the so-called warm-hot IGM (predicted by cosmological simulations.}

	abstract = {We present results from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS), a unique spectroscopic survey of the distant universe designed to explore the details of the connection between galaxies and intergalactic baryons within the same survey volumes, focusing particularly on scales from ∼50 kpc to a few Mpc. The KBSS is optimized for the redshift range z ∼ 2–3, combining S/N ∼100 Keck/HIRES spectra of 15 of the brightest QSOs in the sky at z ≃ 2.5–2.9 with very densely sampled galaxy redshift surveys within a few arcmin of each QSO sightline. In this paper, we present quantitative results on the distribution, column density, kinematics, and absorber line widths of neutral hydrogen (H i) surrounding a subset of 886 KBSS star-forming galaxies with 2.0 ≲ z ≲ 2.8 and with projected distances ⩽3 physical Mpc from a QSO sightline. Using Voigt profile decompositions of the full Lyα forest region of all 15 QSO spectra, we compiled a catalog of ∼6000 individual absorbers in the redshift range of interest, with 12 ⩽ log (NH i) ⩽21. These are used to measure H i absorption statistics near the redshifts of foreground galaxies as a function of projected galactocentric distance from the QSO sightline and for randomly chosen locations in the intergalactic medium (IGM) within the survey volume. We find that NH i and the multiplicity of velocity-associated H i components increase rapidly with decreasing galactocentric impact parameter and as the systemic redshift of the galaxy is approached. The strongest H i absorbers within ≃ 100 physical kpc of galaxies have NH i ∼3 orders of magnitude higher than those near random locations in the IGM. The circumgalactic zone of most significantly enhanced H i absorption is found within transverse distances of ≲ 300 kpc and within ±300 km s−1 of galaxy systemic redshifts. Taking this region as the defining bounds of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), nearly half of absorbers with log(NH i) > 15.5 are found within the CGM of galaxies meeting our photometric selection criteria, while their CGM occupy only 1.5% of the cosmic volume. The spatial covering fraction, multiplicity of absorption components, and characteristic NH i remain significantly elevated to transverse distances of ∼2 physical Mpc from galaxies in our sample. Absorbers with NH i >1014.5 cm−2 are tightly correlated with the positions of galaxies, while absorbers with lower NH i are correlated with galaxy positions only on ≳Mpc scales. Redshift anisotropies on these larger scales indicate coherent infall toward galaxy locations, while on scales of ∼100 physical kpc peculiar velocities of Δv ≃ ±260 km s−1 with respect to the galaxies are indicated. The median Doppler widths of individual absorbers within 1–3 rvir of galaxies are larger by ≃ 50% than randomly chosen absorbers of the same NH i, suggesting higher gas temperatures and/or increased turbulence likely caused by some combination of accretion shocks and galactic winds around galaxies with Mhalo ≃ 1012 M☉ at z ∼ 2–3.}

CGM warm cloud properties are derived, including volume filling factors of 3%–5%, cloud sizes of 0.1–30 kpc, masses of 10–108 M☉, and metallicities of ∼0.1–1 Z☉. Almost all warm CGM clouds within 0.5 Rvir are metal-bearing and many have velocities consistent with being bound, “galactic fountain” clouds. For galaxies with L ≳ 0.1 L*, the total mass in these warm CGM clouds approaches 1010 M☉, ∼10%–15% of the total baryons in massive spirals and comparable to the baryons in their parent galaxy disks. This leaves ≳ 50% of massive spiral-galaxy baryons “missing.” Dwarfs (<0.1 L*) have smaller area covering factors and warm CGM masses (⩽5% baryon fraction), suggesting that many of their warm clouds escape. Constant warm cloud internal pressures as a function of impact parameter (P/k  ∼  10 cm−3 K) support the inference that previous COS detections of broad, shallow O vi and Lyα absorptions are of an extensive (∼400–600 kpc), hot (T ≈ 106 K), intra-cloud gas which is very massive (⩾1011 M☉). While the warm CGM clouds cannot account for all the “missing baryons” in spirals, the hot intra-group gas can, and could account for ∼20% of the cosmic baryon census at z ∼ 0 if this hot gas is ubiquitous among spiral groups.}

We find that detections of H i surrounding ETGs are typically as common and strong as around star-forming galaxies, implying that the total mass of circumgalactic material is comparable in the two populations. For ETGs, the covering fraction for H i absorption above 1016 cm−2 is ∼40%–50% within ∼150 kpc. Line widths and kinematics of the detected material show it to be cold (T ≲ 105 K) in comparison to the virial temperature of the host halos. The implied masses of cool, photoionized circumgalactic medium baryons may be up to 109–1011 M☉. Contrary to some theoretical expectations, strong halo H i absorbers do not disappear as part of the quenching of star formation. Even passive galaxies retain significant reservoirs of halo baryons that could replenish the interstellar gas reservoir and eventually form stars. This halo gas may feed the diffuse and molecular gas that is frequently observed inside ETGs.}

We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of H i. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that ≳ 90% of the detected column density is confined within ±200 km s−1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T ≲ 105 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected H i arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.}

The galaxies examined in this work lie in the fields of 15 hyperluminous background quasi-stellar objects, with galaxy impact parameters ranging from 35 proper kpc (pkpc) to 2 proper Mpc (pMpc). Using the pixel optical depth technique, we present the first galaxy-centred 2D maps of the median absorption by O vi, N v, C iv, C iii, and Si iv, as well as updated results for H i. At small galactocentric radii we detect a strong enhancement of the absorption relative to randomly located regions that extend out to at least 180 pkpc in the transverse direction, and ±240 km s−1 along the line of sight (LOS, ∼1 pMpc in the case of pure Hubble flow) for all ions except N v. For C iv (and H i) we detect a significant enhancement of the absorption signal out to 2 pMpc in the transverse direction, corresponding to the maximum impact parameter in our sample. After normalizing the median absorption profiles to account for variations in line strengths and detection limits, in the transverse direction we find no evidence for a sharp drop-off in metals distinct from that of H i. We argue instead that non-detection of some metal-line species in the extended circumgalactic medium is consistent with differences in the detection sensitivity. Along the LOS, the normalized profiles reveal that the enhancement in the absorption is more extended for O vi, C iv, and Si iv than for H i. We also present measurements of the scatter in the pixel optical depths, covering fractions, and equivalent widths as a function of projected galaxy distance. Limiting the sample to the 340 galaxies with redshifts measured from nebular emission lines does not decrease the extent of the enhancement along the LOS compared to that in the transverse direction. This rules out redshift errors as the source of the observed redshift-space anisotropy and thus implies that we have detected the signature of gas peculiar velocities from infall, outflows, or virial motions for H i, O vi, C iv, C iii, and Si iv.}",

In particular, the simulation reproduces the high metal-line optical depths found at small galactocentric distances, the optical depth enhancements out to impact parameters of 2 proper Mpc, and the prominent redshift–space distortions which we find are due to peculiar velocities rather than redshift errors. The agreement is best for halo masses ∼1012.0 M⊙, for which the observed and simulated stellar masses also agree most closely. We examine the median ion mass-weighted radial gas velocities around the galaxies, and find that most of the gas is infalling, with the infall velocity depending on halo rather than stellar mass.

The baryons traced by H i/O vi absorption are clearly associated with the extended surroundings of galaxies; for impact parameters <400 kpc they are 2–4 times more numerous as those inside the galaxies. This large reservoir of matter likely plays a major role in galaxy evolution. We tabulate the fraction of absorbers having a galaxy of a given luminosity within a given impact parameter (ρ) and velocity difference (Δv), as well as the fraction of galaxies with an absorber closer than a given ρ and Δv. We identify possible “void absorbers” (ρ > 3 Mpc to the nearest L* galaxy), although at v < 2500 km s−1 all absorbers are within 1.5 Mpc of an L>0.1 L* galaxy. The absorber properties depend on ρ, but the relations are not simple correlations. For four absorbers with ρ = 50–350 kpc from an edge-on galaxy with known orientation of its rotation, we find no clear relation between absorber velocities and the rotation curve of the underlying galaxy. For ρ < 350 kpc, the covering factor of Lyα (O vi) around L>0.1 L* galaxies is 100% (70%) for field galaxies and 65% (10%) for group galaxies; 50% of galaxy groups have associated Lyα. All O vi absorbers occur within 550 kpc of an L>0.25 L* galaxy. The properties of three of 14 O vi absorbers are consistent with photoionization, for five the evidence points to collisional ionization; the others are ambiguous. The fraction of broad Lyα lines increases from z = 3 to z = 0 and with decreasing impact parameter, consistent with the idea that gas inside ∼500 kpc from galaxies is heating up, although alternative explanations cannot be clearly excluded.}

For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. The properties of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the temperature has been higher than 105.5 K while it was extragalactic, are clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial temperatures ≫105 K). The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling. However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii. The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high column density H i Lyman α absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.}",

	abstract = {Modern cosmology predicts that matter in our universe today has assembled into a vast network of filamentary structures colloquially termed the “cosmic web.” Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark) or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are limited. Wide-field surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10% of baryonic matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) via spectroscopy of distant quasars support the model yet have not conclusively tied the diffuse IGM to the web. Here, we report on a new method inspired by the Physarum polycephalum slime mold that is able to infer the density field of the cosmic web from galaxy surveys. Applying our technique to galaxy and absorption-line surveys of the local universe, we demonstrate that the bulk of the IGM indeed resides in the cosmic web. From the outskirts of cosmic web filaments, at approximately the cosmic mean matter density (ρm) and ∼5 virial radii from nearby galaxies, we detect an increasing H i absorption signature toward higher densities and the circumgalactic medium, to ∼200ρm. However, the absorption is suppressed within the densest environments, suggesting shock-heating and ionization deep within filaments and/or feedback processes within galaxies.}

We present new measurements of total stellar mass (Mstar), Hα emission line strength (EW(Hα)), and specific star formation rate (sSFR) for the 94 galaxies described by Chen et al.'s 2010 paper. We find that the extent of Mg ii absorbing gas, , scales with Mstar and sSFR, following . The strong dependence of on Mstar is most naturally explained, if more massive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed Mg ii absorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formation in the galaxies. The additional scaling relation of with sSFR can be understood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburst outflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos. The latter is motivated by the well-known sSFR–Mstar inverse correlation in field galaxies. Our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and Mg ii absorbers along common sight lines provides an empirical characterization of halo gaseous radius versus halo mass. A comparison study of around red- and blue-sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint for resolving the physical origin of the observed sSFR–Mstar relation in galaxies.}

Here we take into account the expectation that the hot gas in galactic haloes is thermally unstable and prone to fragmentation during cooling and we show that the implications are more far-reaching than previously expected: allowing multiphase cooling fundamentally alters expectations about gas infall in galactic haloes and naturally gives rise to a characteristic upper limit on the masses of galaxies, as observed. Specifically, we argue that cooling should proceed via the formation of high-density, ∼104 K clouds, pressure-confined within a hot gas background. The background medium that emerges has a low density, and can survive as a hydrostatically stable corona with a long cooling time. The fraction of halo baryons contained in the residual hot core component grows with halo mass because the cooling density increases with gas temperature, and this leads to an upper-mass limit in quiescent, non-merged galaxies of ∼1011 M⊙.In this scenario, galaxy formation is fuelled by the infall of pressure-supported clouds. For Milky-Way-size systems, clouds of mass ∼5 × 106 M⊙ that formed or merged within the last several Gyr should still exist as a residual population in the halo, with a total mass in clouds of ∼2 × 1010 M⊙. The baryonic mass of the Milky Way galaxy is explained naturally in this model, and is a factor of 2 smaller than would result in the standard treatment without feedback. We expect clouds in galactic haloes to be ∼1 kpc in size and to extend ∼150 kpc from galactic centres. The predicted properties of Milky Way clouds match well the observed radial velocity distribution, angular sizes, column densities and velocity widths of high-velocity clouds around our Galaxy. The clouds we predict are also of the type needed to explain high-ion absorption systems at z \\&lt; 1, and the predicted covering factor around external galaxies is consistent with observations.}",

The principal goal is to determine the origin of Lyα absorbers based on their cross-correlation amplitude with known galaxies and to investigate a possible N(H I) dependence of the cross-correlation function. The main results of our study are as follows: (1) The cross-correlation function ξga measured using only emission-line-dominated galaxies and Lyα absorbers with log N(H I) ≥ 14 shows a comparable strength to the galaxy autocorrelation function ξgg on comoving, projected distance scales of less than 1 h-1 Mpc, while there remains a lack of cross-correlation signal when using only absorption-line-dominated galaxies. This signifies a morphology-dependent ξga and indicates that strong absorbers with log N(H I) ≥ 14 and emission-line galaxies reside in the same halo population. (2) A maximum likelihood analysis shows that Lyα absorbers with log N(H I) < 13.6 are consistent with being more randomly distributed with respect to known galaxies. (3) Finally, we find based on this single sight line that the amplitude of ξga does not depend sensitively on N(H I) for strong absorbers, with log N(H I) ≥ 13.6.}

	abstract = {With close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasar sightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption. We use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the H i Lyα absorption transverse to luminous, z ∼ 2 quasars at proper separations of 30 kpc < R⊥ < 1 Mpc. In contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse to quasars exhibit enhanced H i Lyα absorption and a larger variance than the ambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance toward smaller scales. Analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorption characterized by a Lyα equivalent width profile W = 2.3 Å (R⊥/100 kpc)−0.46. We also observe a high (≃ 60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick H i absorbers (H i column ) at separations R⊥ < 200 kpc, which decreases to ∼20% at R⊥ ≃ 1 Mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmic average. This excess of optically thick absorption can be described by a quasar-absorber cross-correlation function ξQA(r) = (r/r0)γ with a large correlation length (comoving) and . The H i absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of any previously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massive dark matter halos Mhalo ≈ 1012.5 M☉ at z ∼ 2.5. The environments of these massive halos are highly biased toward producing optically thick gas, and may even dominate the cosmic abundance of Lyman limit systems and hence the intergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z ∼ 2.5. The anisotropic absorption around quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to be illuminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight.}

	abstract = {We study the interface between galaxies and the intergalactic medium by measuring the absorption by neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 2.4. Our sample consists of 679 rest-frame UV-selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that have impact parameters <2 (proper) Mpc to the line of sight of one of the 15 bright, background QSOs and that fall within the redshift range of its Lyα forest. We present the first two-dimensional maps of the absorption around galaxies, plotting the median Lyα pixel optical depth as a function of transverse and line-of-sight separation from galaxies. The Lyα optical depths are measured using an automatic algorithm that takes advantage of all available Lyman series lines. The median optical depth, and hence the median density of atomic hydrogen, drops by more than an order of magnitude around 100 kpc, which is similar to the virial radius of the halos thought to host the galaxies. The median remains enhanced, at the >3σ level, out to at least 2.8 Mpc (i.e., >9 comoving Mpc), but the scatter at a given distance is large compared with the median excess optical depth, suggesting that the gas is clumpy. Within 100 (200) kpc, and over ±165 km s−1, the covering fraction of gas with Lyα optical depth greater than unity is 100+0− 32% (66% ± 16%). Absorbers with τLyα > 0.1 are typically closer to galaxies than random. The mean galaxy overdensity around absorbers increases with the optical depth and also as the length scale over which the galaxy overdensity is evaluated is decreased. Absorbers with τLyα ∼ 1 reside in regions where the galaxy number density is close to the cosmic mean on scales ⩾0.25 Mpc. We clearly detect two types of redshift space anisotropies. On scales <200 km s−1, or <1 Mpc, the absorption is stronger along the line of sight than in the transverse direction. This “finger of God” effect may be due to redshift errors, but is probably dominated by gas motions within or very close to the halos. On the other hand, on scales of 1.4–2.0 Mpc the absorption is compressed along the line of sight (with >3σ significance), an effect that we attribute to large-scale infall (i.e., the Kaiser effect).}

In particular, we focus on constraints provided by the rest-frame far-ultraviolet (far-UV) spectra of faint galaxies, and demonstrate how galaxy spectra can be used to obtain key spatial and spectral information more efficiently than possible with QSO sightlines. Using a sample of 89 galaxies with 〈z〉 = 2.3 ± 0.3 and with both rest-frame far-UV and Hα spectra, we re-calibrate the measurement of accurate galaxy systemic redshifts using only survey-quality rest-UV spectra. We use the velocity-calibrated sample to investigate the kinematics of the galaxy-scale outflows via the strong interstellar (IS) absorption lines and Lyα emission (when present), as well as their dependence on other physical properties of the galaxies. We construct a sample of 512 close (1″–15″) angular pairs of z ∼ 2–3 galaxies with redshift differences indicating a lack of physical association. Sightlines to the background galaxies provide new information on the spatial distribution of circumgalactic gas surrounding the foreground galaxies. The close pairs sample galactocentric impact parameters 3–125 kpc (physical) at 〈z〉 = 2.2, providing for the first time a robust map of cool gas as a function of galactocentric distance for a well-characterized population of galaxies. We propose a simple model of circumgalactic gas that simultaneously matches the kinematics, depth, and profile shape of IS absorption and Lyα emission lines, as well as the observed variation of absorption line strength (H i and several metallic species) versus galactocentric impact parameter. Within the model, cool gas is distributed symmetrically around every galaxy, accelerating radially outward with vout(r) increasing with r (i.e., the highest velocities are located at the largest galactocentric distances r). The inferred radial dependence of the covering fraction of cool gas (which modulates the absorption line strength) is fc(r) ∝ r−γ with 0.2 ≲ γ ≲ 0.6 depending on transition. We discuss the results of the observations in the context of “cold accretion,” in which cool gas is accreting via filamentary streams directly onto the central regions of galaxies. At present, we find little observational evidence for cool infalling material, while evidence supporting the large-scale effects of superwind outflows is strong. This “pilot” study using faint galaxy spectra demonstrates the potential of using galaxies to trace baryons within galaxies, in the circumgalactic medium, and ultimately throughout the intergalactic medium.}

We further estimate a bias factor of from the galaxy–galaxy auto-correlation, indicating the galaxies are hosted by halos with mass . Finally, we estimate an O vi–galaxy bias factor from the cross-correlation which is consistent with O vi absorbers being hosted by dark matter halos with typical mass .

We analyse an HST/COS archival spectrum of a quasar sightline (PHL2525), which is 45 kpc (0.5 virial radius) from WLM and close to the Magellanic Stream (MS). Along this sightline, two ion absorbers are detected in Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, C ii, and C iv at velocities of ∼−220 km s−1 (Component v-220) and ∼−150 km s−1 (Component v-150). To identify their origins, we study the position–velocity alignment of the components with WLM and the nearby MS. Near the magellanic longitude of PHL2525, the MS-related neutral and ionized gas moves at ≲−190 km s−1, suggesting an MS origin for Component v-220, but not for Component v-150. Because PHL2525 passes near WLM and Component v-150 is close to WLM’s systemic velocity (∼−132 km s−1), it is likely that Component v-150 arises from the galaxy’s CGM. This results in a total Si mass in WLM’s CGM of \\$M\_\\{\\rm Si\\}^\\{\\rm CGM\\}\\sim (0.2-1.0)\\times 10^5~\\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot\\$ using assumption from other COS dwarf studies.

Our finding resonates with other COS dwarf galaxy studies and theoretical predictions that low-mass galaxies can easily lose metals into their CGM due to stellar feedback and shallow gravitational potential.}",

Among the sight lines, four are pointed toward UV-bright stars in IC 1613, and the other six sight lines are background QSOs at impact parameters from 6 kpc (<0.1R200) to 61 kpc (0.6R200). We detect a number of Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, C ii, and C iv absorbers, most of which have velocities less than the escape velocity of IC 1613 and thus are gravitationally bound. The line strengths of these ion absorbers are consistent with the CGM absorbers detected in dwarf galaxies at low redshifts. Assuming that Si ii, Si iii, and Si iv comprise nearly 100% of the total silicon, we find 3% (∼8 × 103 M⊙), 2% (∼7 × 103 M⊙), and 32%–42% [∼(1.0–1.3) × 105 M⊙] of the silicon mass in the stars, interstellar medium, and within 0.6R200 of the CGM of IC 1613. We also estimate the metal outflow rate to be and the instantaneous metal mass loading factor to be ηZ ≥ 0.004, which are in broad agreement with available observation and simulation values. This work is the first time a dwarf galaxy of such low mass is probed by a number of both QSO and stellar sight lines, and it shows that the CGM of low-mass, gas-rich galaxies can be a large reservoir enriched with metals from past and ongoing outflows.}

We find the radial scale length of the distributions of the equivalent widths of the Lyα and Si iii absorbers to be ∼1 and ∼0.4 Rvir, respectively. The radial distribution of equivalent widths is relatively uniform for the blue galaxies, but highly patchy (i.e., it has a low covering fraction) for the red galaxies. We also find that the Lyα and Si iii equivalent widths show significant positive correlations with the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of the galaxy. We find a surprising lack of correlations between the halo mass (virial velocity) and either the velocity dispersions or velocity offsets of the Lyα lines. The ratio of the velocity offset to the velocity dispersion for the Lyα absorbers has a mean value of ∼4, suggesting that a given line of sight is intersecting a dynamically coherent structure in the CGM, rather than a sea of orbiting clouds. The kinematic properties of the CGM are similar in the blue and red galaxies, although we find that a significantly larger fraction of the blue galaxies have large Lyα velocity offsets (>200 km s−1). We show that—if the CGM clouds represent future fuel for star formation—our new results could imply a large drop in the sSFR across the galaxy mass-range we probe.}

The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is fed by galaxy outflows and accretion of intergalactic gas, but its mass, heavy element enrichment, and relation to galaxy properties are poorly constrained by observations. In a survey of the outskirts of 42 galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we detected ubiquitous, large (150-kiloparsec) halos of ionized oxygen surrounding star-forming galaxies; we found much less ionized oxygen around galaxies with little or no star formation. This ionized CGM contains a substantial mass of heavy elements and gas, perhaps far exceeding the reservoirs of gas in the galaxies themselves. Our data indicate that it is a basic component of nearly all star-forming galaxies that is removed or transformed during the quenching of star formation and the transition to passive evolution.}}

	abstract = {We present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low and intermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding 44 low-z, L ≈ L* galaxies drawn from the COS-Halos survey. These measurements are derived from far-UV transitions observed in HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra of background quasars within an impact parameter R < 160 kpc to the targeted galaxies. The data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44 galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurrence of a cool (T ≈ 104–105 K), metal-enriched CGM. The detection rates and column densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile for the CGM. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent ionization states indicates that the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool CGM (very conservatively, McoolCGM > 109 M☉), which likely traces a distinct density and/or temperature regime from the highly ionized CGM traced by O+5 absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including non-detections) suggests that the cool CGM traces a wide range of densities or a mix of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool CGM being bound to the dark matter halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future star formation. Future work will leverage this data set to provide estimates on the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool CGM in low-z, L* galaxies.}

However, QSOs are effectively point sources, limiting their potential to constrain the size of circumgalactic gaseous structures. Here we present the first large Keck/Low-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Focal Reducer/Low-dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) spectroscopic survey of bright () background galaxies whose lines of sight probe Mg ii absorption from the CGM around close projected foreground galaxies at transverse distances .

We detect Mg ii absorption associated with these foreground galaxies with equivalent widths of at significance in 20 individual background sightlines passing within and place upper limits on W2796 of in an additional 11 close sightlines. Within , W2796 is anticorrelated with R⊥, consistent with analyses of Mg ii absorption detected along background QSO sightlines. Subsamples of these foreground hosts divided at exhibit statistically inconsistent W2796 distributions at , with the higher-M* galaxies yielding a larger median W2796 by . Finally, we demonstrate that foreground galaxies with similar stellar masses exhibit the same median W2796 at a given R⊥ to within toward both background galaxies and toward QSO sightlines drawn from the literature.

All 37 absorbers with N ≥ 1013.2 cm-2 lie within 800 h kpc of the nearest galaxy, with no compelling evidence for O VI absorbers in voids. The O VI absorbers often appear to be associated with environments of individual galaxies. Gas with 10% ± 5% solar metallicity (O VI and C III) has a median spread in distance of 350-500 h kpc around L⋆ galaxies and 200-270 h kpc around 0.1L⋆ galaxies (ranges reflect uncertain metallicities of gas undetected in Lyα absorption). In order to match the O VI line frequency, (d𝒩/dz) ≈ 20 for N ≥ 1013.2 cm-2, galaxies with L ≤ 0.1L⋆ must contribute to the cross section. Lyα absorbers with N ≥ 1013.2 cm-2 cover ~50% of the surface area of typical galaxy filaments. Two-thirds of these show O VI and/or C III absorption, corresponding to a 33%-50% covering factor at 0.1 Z☉ and suggesting that metals are spread to a maximum distance of 800 h kpc, within typical galaxy supercluster filaments. Approximately 50% of the O VI absorbers have associated Lyα line pairs with separations (Δv)Lyα = 50-200 km s-1. These pairs could represent shocks at the speeds necessary to create copious O VI, located within 100 h kpc of the nearest galaxy and accounting for much of the two-point correlation function of low-z Lyα forest absorbers.}

    abstract = "{We introduce the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS), an on-going large programme that is gathering high quality H i-line spectra using the Arecibo radio telescope for an unbiased sample of ∼1000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 1010 M⊙ and redshifts 0.025 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.05, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) imaging surveys. The galaxies are observed until detected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5–5 per cent) is reached. This paper presents the first Data Release, consisting of ∼20 per cent of the final GASS sample. We use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of the H i gas fraction with galaxy structure and NUV−r colour. A large fraction (∼60 per cent) of the galaxies in our sample are detected in H i. Even at stellar masses above 1011 M⊙, the detected fraction does not fall below ∼40 per cent. We find that the atomic gas fraction MH i/M★ decreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and NUV−r colour, but is only weakly correlated with the galaxy bulge-to-disc ratio (as measured by the concentration index of the r-band light). We also find that the fraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few per cent) H i decreases sharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 108.5 M⊙ kpc−2. The fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly with stellar mass. One of the key goals of GASS is to identify and quantify the incidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-forming cloud and the red sequence of passively evolving galaxies. Likely transition candidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relations between MH i/M★ and other galaxy properties. We have fitted a plane to the two-dimensional relation between the H i mass fraction, stellar surface mass density and NUV−r colour. Interesting outliers from this plane include gas-rich red sequence galaxies that may be in the process of regrowing their discs, as well as blue, but gas-poor spirals.}",

    abstract = { The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research. }

    abstract = "{With a projected size of about 450 kpc at z ≃ 2.3, the Slug Ly α nebula is a rare laboratory to study, in emission, the properties of the intergalactic gas in the Cosmic Web. Since its discovery, the Slug has been the subject of several spectroscopic follow-ups to constrain the properties of the emitting gas. Here we report the results of a deep MUSE integral-field spectroscopic search for non-resonant, extended \\$\\rm\\{He\\,\\small \\{II\\}\\}\\, \\lambda 1640\\$ and metal emission. Extended \\$\\rm\\{He\\,\\small \\{II\\}\\}\\$ radiation is detected on scales of about 100 kpc, but only in some regions associated with the bright Ly α emission and a continuum-detected source, implying large and abrupt variations in the line ratios across adjacent regions in projected space. The recent detection of associated H α emission and similar abrupt variations in the Ly α kinematics, strongly suggest that the \\$\\rm\\{He\\,\\small \\{II\\}\\}\\$/Ly α gradient is due to large variations in the physical distances between the associated quasar and these regions. This implies that the overall length of the emitting structure could extend to physical Mpc scales and be mostly oriented along our line of sight. At the same time, the relatively low \\$\\rm\\{He\\,\\small \\{II\\}\\}\\$/Ly α values suggest that the emitting gas has a broad density distribution that – if expressed in terms of a lognormal – implies dispersions as high as those expected in the interstellar medium of galaxies. These results strengthen the possibility that the density distribution of intergalactic gas at high redshift is extremely clumpy and multiphase on scales below our current observational spatial resolution of a few physical kpc.}",

We have developed a new redshifting application Marz with greater usability, flexibility, and the capacity to analyse a wider range of object types than the runz software package previously used for redshifting spectra from 2dF. Marz is an open-source, client-based, Javascript web-application which provides an intuitive interface and powerful automatic matching capabilities on spectra generated from the AAOmega spectrograph to produce high quality spectroscopic redshift measurements. The software can be run interactively or via the command line, and is easily adaptable to other instruments and pipelines if conforming to the current FITS file standard is not possible. Behind the scenes, a modified version of the autoz cross-correlation algorithm is used to match input spectra against a variety of stellar and galaxy templates, and automatic matching performance for OzDES spectra has increased from 54% (runz) to 91% (Marz). Spectra not matched correctly by the automatic algorithm can be easily redshifted manually by cycling automatic results, manual template comparison, or marking spectral features.}

	abstract = {We investigate the [O II] emission line as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator using integrated spectra of 97 galaxies from the Nearby Field Galaxies Survey (NFGS). The sample includes all Hubble types and contains SFRs ranging from 0.01 to 100 M⊙ yr-1. We compare the Kennicutt [O II] and Hα SFR calibrations and show that there are two significant effects that produce disagreement between SFR([O II]) and SFR(Hα): reddening and metallicity. Differences in the ionization state of the interstellar medium do not contribute significantly to the observed difference between SFR([O II]) and SFR(Hα) for the NFGS galaxies with metallicities log (O/H) + 12 ≳ 8.5. The Kennicutt [O II]-SFR relation assumes a typical reddening for nearby galaxies; in practice, the reddening differs significantly from sample to sample. We derive a new SFR([O II]) calibration that does not contain a reddening assumption. Our new SFR([O II]) calibration also provides an optional correction for metallicity. Our SFRs derived from [O II] agree with those derived from Hα to within 0.03–0.05 dex. We show that the reddening, E(B-V), increases with intrinsic (i.e., reddening-corrected) [O II] luminosity for the NFGS sample. We apply our SFR([O II]) calibration with metallicity correction to two samples: high-redshift 0.8 < z < 1.6 galaxies from the NICMOS Hα survey and 0.5 < z < 1.1 galaxies from the Canada-France Redshift Survey. The SFR([O II]) and SFR(Hα) for these samples agree to within the scatter observed for the NFGS sample, indicating that our SFR([O II]) relation can be applied to both local and high-z galaxies. Finally, we apply our SFR([O II]) to estimates of the cosmic star formation history. After reddening and metallicity corrections, the star formation rate densities derived from [O II] and Hα agree to within ∼30%.}

We resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the MFs derived from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and from the nearby luminosity functions, respectively. We show that this discrepancy stemmed from two cumulative effects, namely, (1) incorrect color-magnitude-determined distances, due to a substantial fraction of M dwarfs in the HST sample belonging to the metal-depleted thick-disk population, as corrected recently by Zheng et al., and (2) unresolved binaries. We show that both the nearby and HST MF for unresolved systems are consistent with a fraction ~50% of M dwarf binaries, with the mass of both the primaries and the companions originating from the same underlying single MF. This implies that ~30% of M dwarfs should have an M dwarf companion and ~20% should have a brown dwarf companion, in agreement with recent determinations. The present calculations show that the so-called "brown dwarf desert" should be reinterpreted as a lack of high mass ratio (m2/m1 ≲ 0.1) systems and does not preclude a substantial fraction of brown dwarfs as companions of M dwarfs or for other brown dwarfs.}

We employ 148 projected quasar pairs to study the circumgalactic gas of the foreground quasars in absorption. The sample selects foreground quasars with precise redshift measurements, using emission lines with precision 300 km s−1 and average offsets from the systemic redshift ∣100 km s-1∣. We stack the background quasar spectra at the foreground quasar’s systemic redshift to study the mean absorption in C II, C IV, and Mg II. We ﬁnd that the mean absorptions exhibit large velocity widths σv≈300 km s−1. Further, the mean absorptions appear to be asymmetric about the systemic redshifts. The mean absorption centroids exhibit small redshift relative to the systemic δv≈+200 km s−1, with large intrinsic scatter in the centroid velocities of the individual absorption systems. We ﬁnd the observed widths are consistent with gas in gravitational motion and Hubble ﬂow. However, while the observation of large widths alone does not require galactic-scale outﬂows, the observed offsets suggest that the gas is on average outﬂowing from the galaxy. The observed offsets also suggest that the ionizing radiation from the foreground quasars is anisotropic and/or intermittent.}, number={2}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Lau, Marie Wingyee and Prochaska, J.

    abstract = "{Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we measure the mean transmitted flux in the Lyα forest for quasar sightlines that pass near a foreground quasar. We find that the trend of absorption with pixel quasar separation distance can be fitted using a simple power-law form including the usual correlation function parameters r0 and γ, so that . From the simulations, we find the relation between r0 and quasar host mass, and formulate this as a way to estimate quasar host dark matter halo masses, quantifying uncertainties due to cosmological and IGM parameters, and redshift errors. With this method, we examine data for ∼9000 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5, assuming that the effect of ionizing radiation from quasars (the so-called transverse proximity effect) is unimportant (no evidence for it is seen in the data). We find that the best-fitting host halo mass for SDSS quasars with mean redshift z= 3 and absolute G-band magnitude −27.5 is log M/M⊙= 12.68+0.81−0.67. We also use the Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) and Lyα forest data of Adelberger et al. in a similar fashion to constrain the halo mass of LBGs to be log10M/M⊙= 11.41+0.54−0.59, a factor of ∼20 lower than the bright quasars. In addition, we study the redshift distortions of the Lyα forest around quasars, using the simulations. We use the quadrupole to monopole ratio of the quasar Lyα forest correlation function as a measure of the squashing effect. We find its dependence on halo mass difficult to measure, but find that it may be useful for constraining cosmic geometry.}",

title = {AN EXTREME METALLICITY, LARGE-SCALE OUTFLOW FROM A STAR-FORMING GALAXY AT z ∼ 0.4},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a large-scale galactic outflow in the circumgalactic medium of a massive (), star-forming ( yr−1), sub-L* () galaxy at z = 0.39853 that exhibits a wealth of metal-line absorption in the spectra of the background quasar Q 0122−003 at an impact parameter of 163 kpc. The galaxy inclination angle () and the azimuthal angle () imply that the QSO sightline is passing through the projected minor-axis of the galaxy. The absorption system shows a multiphase, multicomponent structure with ultra-strong, wide velocity spread  (  419 km s−1) and  (  285 km s−1) lines that are extremely rare in the literature. The highly ionized absorption components are well explained as arising in a low density ( cm−3), diffuse (∼10 kpc), cool (∼104 K) photoionized gas with a super-solar metallicity (). From the observed narrowness of the Lyβ profile, the non-detection of  absorption, and the presence of strong  absorption in the low-resolution FOS spectrum, we rule out equilibrium/non-equilibrium collisional ionization models. The low-ionization photoionized gas with a density of  cm−3 and a metallicity of  is possibly tracing recycled halo gas. We estimate an outflow mass of  a mass-flow rate of  a kinetic luminosity of  erg s−1, and a mass loading factor of ∼8 for the outflowing high-ionization gas. These are consistent with the properties of “down-the-barrel” outflows from infrared-luminous starbursts as studied by Rupke et al. Such powerful, large-scale, metal-rich outflows are the primary means of sufficient mechanical and chemical feedback as invoked in theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution.}

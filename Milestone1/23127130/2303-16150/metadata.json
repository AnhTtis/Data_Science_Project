    "abstract": "Human activity recognition and clinical biomechanics are challenging problems in physical telerehabilitation medicine. However, most publicly available datasets on human body movements cannot be used to study both problems in an out-of-the-lab movement acquisition setting. The objective of the VIDIMU dataset is to pave the way towards affordable patient tracking solutions for remote daily life activities recognition and kinematic analysis. The dataset includes 13 activities registered using a commodity camera and five inertial sensors. The video recordings were acquired in 54 subjects, of which 16 also had simultaneous recordings of inertial sensors. The novelty of VIDIMU lies in: i) the clinical relevance of the chosen movements, ii) the combined utilization of affordable video and custom sensors, and iii) the implementation of state-of-the-art tools for multimodal data processing of 3D body pose tracking and motion reconstruction in a musculoskeletal model from inertial data. The validation confirms that a minimally disturbing acquisition protocol, performed according to real-life conditions can provide a comprehensive picture of human joint angles during daily life activities.",

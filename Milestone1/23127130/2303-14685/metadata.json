    "abstract": "We theoretically propose that the monolayer V$_2 MX_4$ ($M=$ W, Mo; $X=$ S, Se) is a new family of quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number $\\mathcal{C}=-1$. The interplay between topology and magnetism in this class of compounds are from $d$-orbitals of both V and $M$. We construct the tight-binding model from orbital projected band structure and symmetry analysis to uncover the origin of topology. Remarkably, the topology is not only from the spin polarized quadratic band touching of degenerate $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals of V guaranteed by $C_{4z}$ symmetry, but also the band inversion between $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V and $d_{z^2}$ of $M$ at Fermi level, which is further gapped by spin-orbit coupling. This results in the Chern band lying far below Fermi energy. Furthermore, the thickness dependence of the Chern number for few multilayers shows interesting oscillating behavior. The general physics from the $d$-orbitals here applies to a large class of ternary transition metal chalcogenide such as Ti$_2$W$X_4$ with the space group $P$-$42m$.",

\begin{abstract}
We theoretically propose that the monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ ($M=$ W, Mo; $X=$ S, Se) is a new family of quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$. The interplay between topology and magnetism in this class of compounds are from $d$-orbitals of both V and $M$. We construct the tight-binding model from orbital projected band structure and symmetry analysis to uncover the origin of topology. Remarkably, the topology is not only from the spin polarized quadratic band touching of degenerate $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals of V guaranteed by $C_{4z}$ symmetry, but also the band inversion between $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V and $d_{z^2}$ of $M$ at Fermi level, which is further gapped by spin-orbit coupling. This results in the Chern band lying far below Fermi energy. Furthermore, the thickness dependence of the Chern number for few multilayers shows interesting oscillating behavior. The general physics from the $d$-orbitals here applies to a large class of ternary transition metal chalcogenide such as Ti$_2$W\textit{X}$_4$ with the space group $P$-$42m$.

{\color{blue}\emph{Introduction.}} 
The discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect set a remarkable example for understanding topological states of quantum matter in condensed matter physics and material science~\cite{hasan2010,qi2011,tokura2019,wang2017c,bernevig2022,chang2023}. Such a state is characterized by a topologically nontrivial insulating bulk with a finite Chern number $\mathcal{C}$~\cite{thouless1982,haldane1988} but gapless chiral edge states, which is promising for the realization of dissipationless electronic devices~\cite{zhang2012,wang2013a} and topological computation~\cite{qi2010b,wang2015c,lian2018b}. The QAH effect has been observed first in magnetically doped topological insulators (TI)~\cite{chang2013b,chang2015,mogi2015,bestwick2015,watanabe2019}, and subsequently in the intrinsic magnetic TI MnBi$_2$Te$_4$~\cite{deng2020}, in the moir\'e graphene~\cite{serlin2020} and moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide~\cite{li2021}, but only at low temperature (below $5$~K). Such low critical temperature is a weighty obstacle for practical applications, for example the quantum resistance standard~\cite{okazaki2022}. Seeking new QAH insulator materials~\cite{you2019,sunj2020,liy2020,xuan2022,sun2020,li2022,jiang2022} with preferably large bulk gaps has become an important goal in topological material research.

Physically, the basic mechanism for the QAH effect is band inversion of the spin polarized bands~\cite{liu2008}, where both the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and ferromagnetism are sufficiently strong. From the materials perspective, strong SOC prefers heavy elements, while the ferromagnetism favors transition metal elements preferably with 3$d$ electrons. Thus the challenge in searching for large-gap QAH insulator materials is to synergize the seemingly conflicting requirement of SOC and ferromagnetism. Indeed, the inhomogeneities in magnetic TI~\cite{yu2010,wang2015d,zhang2019,li2019,otrokov2019a} from magnetic dopants~\cite{chong2020} and defects~\cite{garnica2022} drastically suppress the exchange gap by several order of magnitude, which fundamentally limits the exactly quantized anomalous Hall effect to very low temperatures. Therefore, finding stoichiometric 2D magnetic materials for QAH effect preferably in the monolayer with versatile tunability is highly desired.

Here we propose a series of large-gap QAH insulators in monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ ($M=$ W, Mo; $X=$ S, Se), based on first-principles calculations and tight-binding model. These materials have the ferromagnetic (FM) ground state with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$ and extraordinarily large bulk gaps ($\sim0.2$~eV). We find the topology is from both the polarized quadratic band touching of $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V at the $\Gamma$ point, as well as the band inversion between V $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals and $M$ $d_{z^2}$ orbital, which are further gapped by SOC. The thickness dependence of the magnetic and topological properties for few multilayers are studied. The general physics from the $d$-orbitals applies to ternary transition metal chalcogenide Ti$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ with the space group $P$-$42m$.

{\color{blue}\emph{Structure and magnetic properties.}} The monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ family has a tetragonal lattice with the space group $P$-$42m$ (No.~111). As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}(a), each primitive cell includes three (i.e., one V$_2M$ and two $X_2$) atomic layers, where each V or $M$ atom is surrounded by four $X$ atoms forming a distorted edge-sharing tetrahedron. These QAH materials are obtained from high-throughput screening of insulating V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ with $M$ from group VIB and VB,  and $X$ from group VIA. Their lattice constants are listed in Table~\ref{tab1}. The absence of imaginary phonon frequency from first-principles calculations suggest the dynamical stability of monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ ($M=$ W, Mo; $X=$ S, Se) (Fig.~S1~\cite{supple}). We will mainly discuss V$_2$WS$_4$ with similar results for this material class. In reality, the materials with the same structure Cu$_2\textit{MX}_4$ and Ag$_2\textit{MX}_4$ have been experimentally synthesized by a solvothermal method and applied in electrocatalysis and electro-chemical hydrogen evolution~\cite{crossland2005,gan2014,hu2016,zhan2018,wu2019,lin2019}, which implies the possibility to fabricate V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$.

To determine the magnetic ground state of monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$, we compare several magnetic configurations: (i) FM, (ii) collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM), (iii) checkboard AFM, (iv) zigzag AFM, and (v) big zigzag AFM (see Fig.~S2~\cite{supple}), and find that FM is the ground state (Table~S1~\cite{supple}). Take V$_2$WS$_4$ for example, the calculated energy of FM state is about $227$, $211$, $152$ and $153$~meV/V lower than the other four AFM states, respectively. The calculated energy difference is similar for other monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$. The large magnetic energy difference indicates that the FM exchange coupling is strong. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), defined as the total energy difference between in-plane and out-of-plane spin configurations, are listed in Table~\ref{tab1}, while a positive MAE implies an out-of-plane easy axis.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism of ferromagnetism, we analyze the orbital occupation of the transition metal atoms. The magnetic moments are mainly provided by V ($\approx2.6\mu_B$) rather than W ($\approx0.4\mu_B$). The fractional magnetic moment is due to band inversion between V $d_{xz,yz}$ orbitals and W $d_{z^2}$ orbital (Fig.~\ref{fig3}(a)). Thus the magnetism is from V atoms. The tetrahedral crystal field splits the V $3d$ orbitals into doublet $e_g (d_{x^2-y^2},d_{z^2})$ and triplet $t_{2g}(d_{xy},d_{xz},d_{yz})$ orbitals (Fig.~\ref{fig1}(d) with coordinates in Fig.~\ref{fig1}(b)). The energy of $e_g$ stays lower with respect to $t_{2g}$, because the latter point towards the negatively charged ligands. Thus each V atom is in the $e^2_gt_{2g}^1$ configuration with the magnetic moment of $3\mu_B$ according to the Hund's rule, which is close to the density functional theory calculation. The FM exchange coupling between neighboring V atoms is strongly enhanced by Hund's rule interaction due to the empty $t_{2g}$ orbitals~\cite{khomskii2004}. Furthermore, the $ab$ $ initio$ Heisenberg exchange parameters of V$_2$WS$_4$ are $J_1=-23.5$ meV, $J_2=-13.4$ meV and $J_3=1.6$ meV for nearest-, next-nearest-, and next-nearest-neighbor V-V pairs, respectively~\cite{supple}. Negative $J_i$ means the FM exchange coupling. The Curie temperature for monolayer V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ are listed in Table~\ref{tab1} (Fig.~S3) by Monte Carlo simulations.

\end{figure}

{\color{blue}\emph{Electronic structures.}} 
Fig.~\ref{fig2}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig3}(a) display the electronic structure of monolayer V$_2$WS$_4$ with and without SOC, respectively. There are two band inversions between different spin polarized bands, both of which are further gapped by SOC. Specifically, one is near the Fermi energy $E_F$ between spin up bands contributed by $d_{xy},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V and spin down band by $d_{z^2}$ orbital of W, the other is about $0.7$~eV below $E_F$ between V $d_{xy},d_{yz}$ spin up bands and W $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spin down band. There also exists a spin polarized quadratic band touching at $\Gamma$ point from $d_{xy},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V above $E_F$, with the nontrivial gap opened by SOC~\cite{wang2021}. The anomalous Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}$ versus $E_F$ is calculated in Fig.~\ref{fig2}(c), which displays a quantized value of $-e^2/h$ near both $E_F$ and $E_F-0.7$~eV. This indicates the topological nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C}=-1$ below $E_F-0.7$~eV, which is consistent with single chiral edge states dispersing within the bulk gap as in the edge local density of states (Fig.~\ref{fig2}(b)). Interestingly, there also exists an occupied 2nd chiral edge state which is $0.7$~eV below $E_F$, which can be measured by scanning tunneling microscope. By replacing W by the same group element Mo, V$_2$MoS$_4$ monolayer has similar band structure and same topological properties as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}(d)-\ref{fig2}(f). The topological gap of monolayer V$_2$W$X_4$ is larger than that of V$_2$Mo$X_4$, which is due to enhanced SOC from heavier elements. It is worth mentioning that if we replace W with neighboring group element Ta, the band inversion between spin up $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ of V and spin down $d_{x^2-y^2}$ of Ta is now promoted to the Fermi level, which holds the $\mathcal{C}=+1$ QAH phase (Fig.~S6).

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig3}(b) shows the band structure for the in-plane ferromagnetism along $x$-axis. The symmetries of the system reduces to $C_{2x}$ and $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is time-reversal. One can see the gap along $\Gamma$-Y decreases but not to close, for here there is no symmetry to guarantee a gapless point. Along the high symmetry lines, there is a small negative indirect gap between valence top along $\Gamma$-Y and conduction bottom along $\Gamma$-M. The Chern number of valence bands still can be calculated to be $\mathcal{C}=0$, which is guaranteed by $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$. Similar to $\mathcal{IT}$, $\sigma_{xy}$ is odd under $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$ in 2D materials, which ensures $\mathcal{C}=0$ when ferromagnetism is completely along any in-plane direction. This is consistent with the edge local density of state calculation in Fig.~\ref{fig3}(c), where there is no chiral edge state. The FM-$x$ state is trivial without higher-order topology, which is checked by the band representation of $C_{2x}$ (i.e., symmetry indicator). Then by varying the spin orientation from $+z$ to $+x$, then to $-z$ axis, the band gap monotonically decreases to close, and negative then reopens, which is accompanied by the topological phase transitions from $\mathcal{C}=-1$ to $\mathcal{C}=0$ and then to $\mathcal{C}=1$ in Fig.~\ref{fig3}(d). From first principles calculations, the topological transition happens 
when $|\theta_c-\pi/2|<\pi/72$, namely, when the spin orientation is very close to in-plane.

{\color{blue}\emph{Tight-binding model and origin of topology.}} 
To reveal the origin of $\mathcal{C}=-1$ topology in the electronic structure, we perform the symmetry analysis of the band irreducible representation and construct a tight-binding model to recover the essential topological physics. The first and second band inversions occur at $\Gamma$ and M point, respectively. Naively, one may simply count the angular momentum difference locally at the band inversion point to be the Chern number change as in the conventional $s$-$p$ band inversion. However, this is incorrect due to band inversion from the opposite spin polarization here. For example, at M point for second band inversion, only spin contributes to the angular momentum difference, which implies the lowest band ($d^\downarrow_{x^2-y^2}$ from W) should have $\mathcal{C}=1$, this is contrary to the first principles calculations of $\mathcal{C}=-1$.

Then we construct a concrete tight-binding model including $d^\uparrow_{xz},d^\uparrow_{yz}$ of V and $d_{z^2}^\downarrow, d_{x^2-y^2}^\downarrow$ of W to decipher the origin of topology. There are two V in an unit cell, and $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals of each V are non-degenerate. However, $d_{xz}$ of one V and $d_{yz}$ of the other V are degenerate, which are related to each other by $\mathcal{I}C_{4z}$. Therefore, for the low energy physics, we only need to consider $d^\uparrow_{xz},d^\uparrow_{yz}$ from two V, respectively and $d_{z^2}^\downarrow, d_{x^2-y^2}^\downarrow$ of W, namely a four orbitals model. The Hamiltonian is written as $\mathcal{H}=\sum_id_i^\dag\varepsilon^i_0d_i+\sum_{\left<ij\right>}[d_i^\dagger \hat{t}_{ij}d_j+\text{H.c.}]+\sum_{\left<\left<ij\right>\right>}[d_i^\dagger\hat{t}_{ij}^\prime d_j+\text{H.c.}]$, where $\left<ij\right>$ and $\left<\left<ij\right>\right>$ denote the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor sites, respectively, $d\equiv$ ($d^\uparrow_{xz}$,$d^\uparrow_{yz}$,$d^\downarrow_{z^2}$,$d^\downarrow_{x^2-y^2}$)$^T$, $\varepsilon_0^i$ is the onsite energy, $\hat{t}_{ij}$ and $\hat{t}_{ij}^\prime$ are $4\times4$ hopping matrices terms with SOC included, which can be simplified by symmetry considerations. The explicit forms are listed in Supplementary Materials~\cite{supple}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig4}(a) and~\ref{fig4}(b), the band structure and the corresponding irreducible representations of high symmetry points (listed in Table~\ref{tab2}) in density functional theory calculation (Fig.~\ref{fig2}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig3}(a)) are rebuilt in our tight-binding model.

\end{table}

The symmetry generators of space group $P$-$42m$ are $\mathcal{I}C_{4z}$, $C_{2z}$ and $C_{2x}$. As we can see from the tight-binding model for V$_2$\textit{MX}$_4$ above, $\mathcal{I}$ can be viewed as $C_{2z}$ due to lacking of $z$ direction. Then $\mathcal{I}C_{4z}$ becomes $C^3_{4z}$, namely, the system is $C_{4z}$ invariant. The Chern number of band in a $C_{4z}$ invariant system is shown to be~\cite{fang2012},
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
i^\mathcal{C}=\prod \limits_{j\in\text{occupied}} (-1)^F \xi_j(\Gamma)\xi_j(M)\zeta_j(X).
\end{equation}
Here $F=0$ or 1 labels spinless or spinful case, respectively, $\xi_j(k)$ is the eigenvalue of $C_{4z}$ at the $C_{4z}$-invariant $\Gamma$ and M points of the $j$-th band, $\zeta_j(k)$ is the eigenvalue of $C_{2z}$ at the $C_{2z}$-invariant X point on the $j$-th band. Now the band topology can be diagnosed by the symmetry information listed in Table~\ref{tab2}. For the lowest band in Fig.~\ref{fig4}(b), we have $F=1$, $\xi(\Gamma_3\downarrow)=\exp\left(-i\frac{\pi}{2}\times\frac{3}{2}\right)$, $\xi(M_4\uparrow)=\exp\left(-i\frac{\pi}{2}\times\frac{5}{2}\right)$, and $\zeta(X_1\downarrow)=\exp\left(i \pi\times\frac{1}{2}\right)$, so the Chern number of the lowest band is $\mathcal{C}_A=-1$ (mod 4). For the second lowest band in Fig.~\ref{fig4}(b), $F=1$, $\xi(\Gamma_1\downarrow)=\exp\left(i\frac{\pi}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\right)$, $\xi(M_3\downarrow)=\exp\left(-i\frac{\pi}{2}\times\frac{3}{2}\right)$, and $\zeta(X_3\uparrow)=\exp\left(-i\pi\times\frac{1}{2}\right)$, so the Chern number of the second lowest band equal $\mathcal{C}_B=0$ (mod 4). All of these are consistent with the Wilson loop calculations for the lowest one and two bands shown in Fig.~\ref{fig4}(c) and~\ref{fig4}(d). The quadratic band touching at $\Gamma_5$ is from degenerate $d_{xz},d_{yz}$, which have an effective angular momentum $\ell_z=\pm1$, and SOC opens a topologically nontrivial gap~\cite{wang2021}. Thus the Chern number summation of lowest three bands is only determined by the sign of SOC. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig4}(e), the total Chern number of the lowest three bands is $\mathcal{C}=-1$, namely, both bands B and C have $\mathcal{C}=0$, and the only nontrivial $\mathcal{C}=-1$ is carried by band A, which is consistent with first principles calculations. If we artificially reverse the sign of SOC, then the Chern number of the lowest three bands are $(\mathcal{C}_{A},\mathcal{C}_B,\mathcal{C}_C)=(-1,0,2)$. Now we fully understand that the topology in this system is not only from gapping the degenerate $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V by SOC, but also the band inversions from them and W $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$.

{\color{blue}\emph{Material generalization.}}
The key for the $\mathcal{C}=-1$ phase here is rooted in the spin polarized quadratic band touching of $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals at $\Gamma$ point, where $\mathcal{I}C_{4z}$ ensures their degeneracy. With SOC and certain orbital occupations, the QAH phase can be realized. In fact, the model and analysis from $d$ orbitals above are quite general, and also apply to monolayer Ti$_2$W\textit{X}$_4$ ($X=$ S, Se) with the same lattice structure of $P$-$42m$ symmetry and similar $d$-orbital projected band structure and irreducible representations~\cite{supple}. Ti$_2$W\textit{X}$_4$ has the FM ground state, and the magnetism is from Ti atom. Interestingly, the bandwith of $d_{z^2}$ orbital is much narrower than that of $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals in Ti. Each Ti atom is in the $e_g^1t_{2g}^1$ configuration with the magnetic moment close to $2\mu_B$ according to the Hund’s rule. The $e_g$-$t_{2g}$ kinetic exchange leads to strong ferromagnetism~\cite{jiang2022}. Meanwhile, similar two band inversions occur between $d^\uparrow_{xy},d^\uparrow_{yz}$ bands of Ti and $d^\downarrow_{z^2}$ band of $M$ first at $E_F$, and $d^\downarrow_{x^2-y^2}$ band of $M$ then below $E_F$. By adding SOC, the nontrivial topology from quadratic band touching of $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ at $\Gamma$ is now transmitted to the bands below $E_F$, leading to the $\mathcal{C}=-1$ QAH phase. We point out that Ti $d$-orbitals contribute both of topology and magnetism, nevertheless the physics is quite different from KTiSb class of compounds, where the topology is from band inversion from $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ and $d_{z^2}$ at $M$ point~\cite{jiang2022}.

{\color{blue}\emph{Discussions.}}
The topological band structures in these materials have an interesting thickness dependence. The bilayer V$_2$WS$_4$ has AA or AB stacking. The magnetic ground state is $A$-type AFM with the out-of-plane easy axis in AB stacking, which is FM within each layer but AFM between the adjacent layer~\cite{supple}. The $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ exchange of V atoms between neighbor layers via $p$ orbitals of ligand is AFM due to the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rule, where V-S-V bonding angle is close to 90 degree~\cite{khomskii2004}. The system has a full band gap and gapped helical edge state, namely $\mathcal{C}=0$, which can be simply viewed as stacking of two QAH with opposite Chern number along $z$-axis. The FM-$z$ state of bilayer also has a full gap but with $\mathcal{C}=-2$. We further calculate the trilayer case and obtain AFM ground state with an uncompensated FM layer along $z$ axis, and the system is a $\mathcal{C}=-1$ QAH insulator~\cite{supple}. Therefore, we expect $\mathcal{C}$ will oscillate between $-1$ and $0$ depending on odd and even layers of multilayer, as long as it has a full band gap. 

The quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and vanishing longitudinal conductivity of QAH insulator imply a quantized Kerr/Faraday rotation~\cite{ikebe2010,shimano2013}, when the frequency satisfies $\omega\ll E_g/\hbar$. However, such a quantized magnetooptical effect has not been achieved in existing QAH systems yet due to the small band gap~\cite{okada2016,mogi2022}. Here the topologically nontrivial Chern bands in V$_2$\emph{MX}$_4$ lies far below and above $E_F$, which provides an intriguing but rare platform for exploring giant Kerr rotation from the optical transitions between Chern bands, even possibly in the optical frequency range.

In summary, our work uncover $\mathcal{C}=-1$ QAH phase with interesting interplay between magnetism and topology solely from $d$ orbitals, which applies to a large class of ternary chalcogenide in the space group $P$-$42m$. We hope the theoretical work here could aid the search for new QAH insulators in transition metal compounds.

    "abstract": "We show that the bilateral backward shift on $\\ell^p(\\mathbb{Z},ω)$ that has a projective orbit with a non-zero limit point is supercyclic. This phenomenon holds also for $Γ$-supercyclicity, which extends a result obtained for the first time by Chan and Seceleanu. Moreover, we show that if $K$ is a compact subset of $\\ell^p(\\mathbb{N},ω)$ such that its orbit under the unilateral backward shift $B$ on $\\ell^p(\\mathbb{N},ω)$ has a non-zero weak limit point, then $B$ is hypercyclic.",

    "abstract": "We first time show that a common solution to dark matter and the flavour problem of the standard model can be obtained in the framework of the $\\mathcal{Z}_{\\rm N} \\times \\mathcal{Z}_{\\rm M}$ flavour symmetry where the flavonic Goldstone boson of this flavour symmetry acts as a good dark matter candidate through the misalignment mechanism. Hierarchical mass pattern of quarks and charged leptons naturally follows from the discrete symmetry. For light active neutrinos, we construct the Dirac-type mass matrix which is preferred to fit the observed neutrino oscillation data with normal hierarchy.",

	abstract = {The Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides measurements over the wavelength range 5 to 28.5 μm. MIRI has, within a single “package,” four key scientific functions: photometric imaging, coronagraphy, single-source low-spectral resolving power (R ∼ 100) spectroscopy, and medium-resolving power (R ∼ 1500 to 3500) integral field spectroscopy. An associated cooler system maintains MIRI at its operating temperature of < 6.7 K. This paper describes the driving principles behind the design of MIRI, the primary design parameters, and their realization in terms of the “as-built” instrument. It also describes the test program that led to delivery of the tested and calibrated Flight Model to NASA in 2012, and the confirmation after delivery of the key interface requirements.}

We provide a short discussion of the principles of operation, design, and performance of the individual MIRI detectors, in support of a description of their operation in arrays provided in an accompanying paper. We then describe modeling of their response. We find that electron diffusion is an important component of their performance, although it was omitted in previous models. Our new model will let us optimize the bias voltage while avoiding avalanche gain. It also predicts the fraction of the IR-active layer that is depleted (and thus contributes to the quantum efficiency) as signal is accumulated on the array amplifier. Another set of models accurately predicts the nonlinearity of the detector-amplifier unit and has guided determination of the corrections for nonlinearity. Finally, we discuss how diffraction at the interpixel gaps and total internal reflection can produce the extended cross-like artifacts around images with these arrays at short wavelengths, ∼5 μm. The modeling of the behavior of these devices is helping optimize how we operate them and also providing inputs to the development of the data pipeline.}

By using true detector arrays in each band, it provides both critical sampling of the Spitzer point-spread function and relatively large imaging fields of view, allowing for substantial advances in sensitivity, angular resolution, and efficiency of areal coverage compared with previous space far-infrared capabilities. The 24 μm array has excellent photometric properties, and measurements with rms relative errors of about 1% can be obtained. The two longer-wavelength arrays use detectors with poor photometric stability, but a system of onboard stimulators used for relative calibration, combined with a unique data pipeline, produce good photometry with rms relative errors of less than 10%.}

We present the instrument optical and mechanical design. We show that the test data, as measured during the test campaigns undertaken at CEA-Saclay, at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, indicate that the instrument complies with its design requirements and goals. We also discuss the operational requirements (multiple dithers and exposures) needed for optimal scientific utilization of the MIRIM.}

Such targets might include stars that are orbited by exoplanets and circumstellar material, mass-loss envelopes around post-main-sequence stars, the near-nuclear environments in active galaxies, and the host galaxies of distant quasars. This paper describes the coronagraphic observing modes of MIRI, as well as performance estimates based on measurements of the MIRI flight model during cryo-vacuum testing. A brief outline of coronagraphic operations is also provided. Finally, simulated MIRI coronagraphic observations of a few astronomical targets are presented for illustration.}

The design is optimized for observations of compact sources, such as exoplanet host stars. We provide here an overview of the design of the LRS, and its performance as measured during extensive test campaigns, examining in particular the delivered image quality, dispersion, and resolving power, as well as spectrophotometric performance, flatfield accuracy, and the effects of fringing. We describe the operational concept of the slitless mode, which is optimally suited to transit spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. The LRS mode of the MIRI was found to perform consistently with its requirements and goals.}

title = {Calibration of the MIRI instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope},
year = {2021},
abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will detect faint heat signatures emitted from faraway celestial objects. The further the object, the longer it takes for the emitted light to reach us. Visible light that was once emitted from the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang gets red-shifted on its way here. Only a very sensitive infrared instrument may detect it. The water in the Earth's atmosphere blocks infrared light from reaching the surface, hence JWST will be sent to space, where its scientific instruments will be able to detect the light from faraway galaxies, as well as nearby exoplanet-hosting solar systems, and objects in our own solar system.
The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on-board JWST will provide imaging, coronagraphy, low-resolution spectroscopy and medium-resolution spectroscopy at unprecedented sensitivity levels in the 5 to 28 micron wavelength range. MIRI uses Si:As impurity band conduction detector arrays to detect infrared light. This type of detector was used in numerous past space missions, including the Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope. MIRI builds upon their legacy.
The aim of this thesis is to make use of data acquired with MIRI in multiple ground-based test campaigns to characterize and model instrument properties that allow to calibrate and process raw MIRI detector signals to calibrated spectra and spectral cubes. The calibration methods developed in this thesis are applicable to past, present, and future mid-infrared instruments.
We open this thesis with an introduction to the JWST mission, the JWST science goals, and the technical specifications of the instruments on-board JWST. We then focus on MIRI. We describe the MIRI raw data format and describe how a photon incident to the MIRI detectors gets turned into a digital signal at the amplifier output. Thereafter we focus on the MIRI medium-resolution integral field spectrometer (MRS). Optical distortions, optical transmission effects, and thermal effects impact the calibration of the MRS. Throughout the thesis we critically evaluate past methods to calibrate the MIRI instrumental effects and present novel calibration methods to improve science with MIRI and the MRS.},

abstract = {The detectors in the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are arsenic-doped silicon impurity band conduction (Si:As IBC) devices and are direct descendants of the Spitzer IRAC long wavelength arrays (channels 3 and 4). With appropriate data processing, they can provide excellent performance. In this paper we discuss the various non-ideal behaviors of these detectors that need to be addressed to realize their potential. We have developed a set of algorithms toward this goal, building on experience with previous similar detector arrays. The MIRI-specific stage 1 pipeline algorithms, of a three stage JWST calibration pipeline, were developed using pre-flight tests on the flight detectors and flight spares and have been refined using flight data. This paper describes these algorithms, which are included in the first stage of the JWST Calibration Pipeline for the MIRI instrument.}

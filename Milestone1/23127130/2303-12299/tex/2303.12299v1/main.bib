abstract = {Understanding the correct API usage sequences is one of the most important tasks for programmers when they work with unfamiliar libraries. However, programmers often encounter obstacles to finding the appropriate information due to either poor quality of API documentation or ineffective query-based searching strategy. To help solve this issue, researchers have proposed various methods to suggest the sequence of APIs given natural language queries representing the information needs from programmers. Among such efforts, Gu et al. adopted a deep learning method, in particular an RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture, to perform this task and obtained promising results on common APIs in Java. In this work, we aim to reproduce their results and apply the same methods for APIs in Python. Additionally, we compare the performance with a more recent Transformer-based method, i.e., CodeBERT, for the same task. Our experiment reveals a clear drop in performance measures when careful data cleaning is performed. Owing to the pretraining from a large number of source code files and effective encoding technique, CodeBERT outperforms the method by Gu et al., to a large extent.},

    abstract = "The basic concept in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is to train a large Neural Network that maximizes the translation performance on a given parallel corpus. NMT is then using a simple left-to-right beam-search decoder to generate new translations that approximately maximize the trained conditional probability. The current beam search strategy generates the target sentence word by word from left-to-right while keeping a fixed amount of active candidates at each time step. First, this simple search is less adaptive as it also expands candidates whose scores are much worse than the current best. Secondly, it does not expand hypotheses if they are not within the best scoring candidates, even if their scores are close to the best one. The latter one can be avoided by increasing the beam size until no performance improvement can be observed. While you can reach better performance, this has the drawback of a slower decoding speed. In this paper, we concentrate on speeding up the decoder by applying a more flexible beam search strategy whose candidate size may vary at each time step depending on the candidate scores. We speed up the original decoder by up to 43{\%} for the two language pairs German to English and Chinese to English without losing any translation quality.",

    abstract = "To achieve high translation performance, neural machine translation models usually rely on the beam search algorithm for decoding sentences. The beam search finds good candidate translations by considering multiple hypotheses of translations simultaneously. However, as the algorithm produces hypotheses in a monotonic left-to-right order, a hypothesis can not be revisited once it is discarded. We found such monotonicity forces the algorithm to sacrifice some good decoding paths. To mitigate this problem, we relax the monotonic constraint of the beam search by maintaining all found hypotheses in a single priority queue and using a universal score function for hypothesis selection. The proposed algorithm allows discarded hypotheses to be recovered in a later step. Despite its simplicity, we show that the proposed decoding algorithm enhances the quality of selected hypotheses and improve the translations even for high-performance models in English-Japanese translation task.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence are ubiquitous processes important for laboratory, space and astrophysical plasmas. Reconnection has been suggested to play an important role in the energetics and dynamics of turbulence by observations, simulations and theory for two decades. The fundamental properties of reconnection at kinetic scales, essential to understanding reconnection in turbulence, remain largely unknown at present. Here we present an application of the magnetic flux transport method that can accurately identify reconnection in turbulence to a three-dimensional simulation. Contrary to ideas that reconnection in turbulence would be patchy and unpredictable, highly extended reconnection X-lines, on the same order of magnitude as the system size, form at kinetic scales. Extended X-lines develop through bi-directional reconnection spreading, and satisfy critical balance characteristic of turbulence. This presents a new picture of fundamentally extended reconnection in kinetic-scale turbulence.",

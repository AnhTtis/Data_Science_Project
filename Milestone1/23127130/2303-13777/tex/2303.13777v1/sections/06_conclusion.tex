In this paper, we propose an effective framework to build generalizable model-based neural radiance fields (GM-NeRF) from sparse calibrated multi-view images of arbitrary performers. 
To improve generalization on novel poses and identities, we introduce SMPL as the structured geometric body embedding. However, inaccurate estimations of SMPL have a negative impact on the reconstruction results. 
To address this, we propose a novel geometry-guided multi-view attention mechanism that can effectively alleviate the misalignment between SMPL geometric prior feature and pixel-aligned feature.
Meanwhile, we propose strategies such as neural rendering and partial gradient backpropagation to efficiently train our network using perceptual loss. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms concurrent works.

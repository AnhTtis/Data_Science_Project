\section{Limitations}

There are some limitations of our method that need to be improved: i) Due to the minimal-clothed topology of SMPL, our model struggles to express extremely loose clothes and accessories. ii) When the testing pose is out-of-distribution, our method may produce some artifacts in results since 3D convolution in SparseConvNet\cite{spconv} is not rotation-invariant. iii) As the target view moves further away from the input views, artifacts tend to emerge in the unobserved areas.

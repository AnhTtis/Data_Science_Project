In the solar wind these two types of timescales may be directly compared using standard Kolmogorov-style analysis and observational data. The estimated local nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic cascade times, evaluated as relevant kinetic scales are approached, remain slower than the cyclotron period, but comparable to, or faster than, the typical timescales of instabilities, anisotropic waves, and wave damping. The variation with length scale of the turbulence timescales is supported by observations and simulations. On this basis the use of linear theory - which assumes constant parameters to calculate the associated kinetic rates - may be questioned. It is suggested that the product of proton gyrofrequency and nonlinear time at the ion gyroscales provides a simple measure of turbulence influence on proton kinetic behavior.},

	abstract = {Weakly collisional space plasmas are rarely in local thermal equilibrium and often exhibit non-Maxwellian electron and ion velocity distributions that lead to the growth of microinstabilities, that is, enhanced electric and magnetic fields at relatively short wavelengths. These instabilities play an active role in the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence induced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a 2.5 dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of Alfvenic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of turbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC simulation is of decaying turbulence which develops both coherent structures and anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic scale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular to the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory using the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the simulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show that strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the plasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially occur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may affect the plasma globally , they act locally and develop in response to extreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures. Further studies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation between linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.},

To assess effects of these two processes we compare results from a 3 dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of collisionless plasma turbulence against observations by the MMS spacecraft in the terrestrial magnetosheath and by the Wind spacecraft in the solar wind. The simulation develops coherent structures and anisotropic ion velocity distributions that can drive micro-instabilities. Temperature-anisotropy driven instability growth rates are compared with inverse nonlinear turbulence time scales. Large growth rates occur near coherent structures; nevertheless linear growth rates are, on average, substantially less than the corresponding nonlinear rates.

Statistical analysis of spacecraft observation data relates proton temperature anisotropy T⊥/T∥ and parallel plasma beta β∥, where subscripts refer to the ambient magnetic field direction. Here, this relationship is recovered using an ensemble of HVM simulations. By varying plasma parameters, such as plasma beta and fluctuation level, the simulations explore distinct regions of the parameter space given by T⊥/T∥ and β∥, similar to solar wind sub-datasets. Moreover, both simulation and solar wind data suggest that temperature anisotropy is not only associated with magnetic intermittent events, but also with gradient-type structures in the flow and in the density. This connection between non-Maxwellian kinetic effects and various types of intermittency may be a key point for understanding the complex nature of plasma turbulence.},

The large number of sources of free energy accessible to such nearly collisionless plasmas makes general modeling of unstable behavior, accounting for the temperatures, densities, anisotropies, and relative drifts of a large number of populations, analytically difficult. We therefore seek a general method of stability determination that may be automated for future analysis of solar wind observations. This work describes an efficient application of the Nyquist instability method to the Vlasov dispersion relation appropriate for hot, collisionless, magnetized plasmas, including the solar wind. The algorithm recovers the familiar proton temperature anisotropy instabilities, as well as instabilities that had been previously identified using fits extracted from in situ observations in Gary et al. (2016). Future proposed applications of this method are discussed.},

	abstract = {We observe the anisotropy of the power spectral tensor of magnetic field fluctuations in the fast solar wind for the first time. In heliocentric RTN coordinates the power in each element of the tensor has a unique dependence on the angle between the magnetic field and velocity of the solar wind ({\textbackslash}theta) and the angle of the vector in the plane perpendicular to the velocity ({\textbackslash}phi). We derive the geometrical effect of the high speed flow of the solar wind past the spacecraft on the power spectrum in the frame of the plasma P(k) to arrive at the observed power spectrum P(f,{\textbackslash}theta,{\textbackslash}phi) based on a scalar field description of turbulence theory. This allows us to predict the variation in the {\textbackslash}phi direction and compare it to the data. We then transform the observations from RTN coordinates to magnetic-field-aligned coordinates. The observed reduced power spectral tensor matches the theoretical predictions we derive in both RTN and field-aligned coordinates which means that the local magnetic field we calculate with wavelet envelope functions is an accurate representation of the physical axis of symmetry for the turbulence and implies that on average the turbulence is axi-symmetric. We also show that we can separate the dominant toroidal component of the turbulence from the smaller but significant poloidal component and that these have different power anisotropy. We also conclude that the magnetic helicity is anisotropic and mostly two-dimensional, arising from wavevectors largely confined to the plane perpendicular to B.},

It is argued that the linear and nonlinear dynamics of Alfvén waves are responsible, at a very fundamental level, for some of the key qualitative features of plasma turbulence that distinguish it from hydrodynamic turbulence, including the anisotropic cascade of energy and the development of current sheets at small scales. The first dynamical model of kinetic turbulence in the weakly collisional solar wind plasma that combines self-consistently the physics of Alfvén waves with the development of small-scale current sheets is presented and its physical implications are discussed. This model leads to a simplified perspective on the nature of turbulence in a weakly collisional plasma: the nonlinear interactions responsible for the turbulent cascade of energy and the formation of current sheets are essentially fluid in nature, while the collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations and the energy injection by kinetic instabilities are essentially kinetic in nature.},

We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a spectrum of large-scale, linearly polarized, random-phase Alfvénic fluctuations that have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations and vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent cascade rapidly develops; magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at ion scales. The turbulent cascade leads to an overall anisotropic proton heating, protons are heated in the perpendicular direction, and, initially, also in the parallel direction. The imposed expansion leads to generation of a large parallel proton temperature anisotropy which is at later stages partly reduced by turbulence. The turbulent heating is not sufficient to overcome the expansion-driven perpendicular cooling and the system eventually drives the oblique firehose instability in a form of localized nonlinear wave packets which efficiently reduce the parallel temperature anisotropy. This work demonstrates that kinetic instabilities may coexist with strong plasma turbulence even in a constrained 2D regime.},

	abstract = {A review of spectral anisotropy and variance anisotropy for solar wind fluctuations is given, with the discussion covering inertial range and dissipation range scales. For the inertial range, theory, simulations and observations are more or less in accord, in that fluctuation energy is found to be primarily in modes with quasi-perpendicular wavevectors (relative to a suitably defined mean magnetic field), and also that most of the fluctuation energy is in the vector components transverse to the mean field. Energy transfer in the parallel direction and the energy levels in the parallel components are both relatively weak. In the dissipation range, observations indicate that variance anisotropy tends to decrease towards isotropic levels as the electron gyroradius is approached; spectral anisotropy results are mixed. Evidence for and against wave interpretations and turbulence interpretations of these features will be discussed. We also present new simulation results concerning evolution of variance anisotropy for different classes of initial conditions, each with typical background solar wind parameters.},

In contrast, nonlinear mirror fluctuations are large compared to the ion Larmor scale and grow secularly in time; marginality is maintained by an increasing population of resonant particles trapped in magnetic mirrors.

Both instabilities drive sub-ion-Larmor--scale fluctuations, which appear to be kinetic-Alfv{\textbackslash}'\{e\}n-wave turbulence.

The principle of their nonlinear evolution is to generate secularly growing small-scale magnetic fluctuations that on average cancel the temporal change in the large-scale magnetic field responsible for the pressure anisotropies.

	abstract = {Weakly collisional magnetized cosmic plasmas have a dynamical tendency to develop pressure anisotropies with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field. These anisotropies trigger plasma instabilities at scales just above the ion Larmor radius ρi and much below the mean free path λmfp. They have growth rates of a fraction of the ion cyclotron frequency, which is much faster than either the global dynamics or even local turbulence. Despite their microscopic nature, these instabilities dramatically modify the transport properties and, therefore, the macroscopic dynamics of the plasma. The non-linear evolution of these instabilities is expected to drive pressure anisotropies towards marginal stability values, controlled by the plasma beta βi. Here this non-linear evolution is worked out in an ab initio kinetic calculation for the simplest analytically tractable example – the parallel (k⊥= 0) firehose instability in a high-beta plasma. An asymptotic theory is constructed, based on a particular physical ordering and leading to a closed non-linear equation for the firehose turbulence. In the non-linear regime, both the analytical theory and the numerical solution predict secular (∝t) growth of magnetic fluctuations. The fluctuations develop a k−3∥ spectrum, extending from scales somewhat larger than ρi to the maximum scale that grows secularly with time (∝t1/2); the relative pressure anisotropy (p⊥−p∥)/p∥ tends to the marginal value −2/βi. The marginal state is achieved via changes in the magnetic field, not particle scattering. When a parallel ion heat flux is present, the parallel firehose mutates into the new gyrothermal instability (GTI), which continues to exist up to firehose-stable values of pressure anisotropy, which can be positive and are limited by the magnitude of the ion heat flux. The non-linear evolution of the GTI also features secular growth of magnetic fluctuations, but the fluctuation spectrum is eventually dominated by modes around a maximal scale ∼ρilT/λmfp, where lT is the scale of the parallel temperature variation. Implications for momentum and heat transport are speculated about. This study is motivated by our interest in the dynamics of galaxy cluster plasmas (which are used as the main astrophysical example), but its relevance to solar wind and accretion flow plasmas is also briefly discussed.},

This renders them unstable to fast, small-scale mirror and firehose instabilities, which are capable of exerting feedback on the macroscale dynamics of the system. By way of a new asymptotic theory of the early non-linear evolution of the mirror instability in a plasma subject to slow shearing or compression, we show that the instability does not saturate quasi-linearly at a steady, low-amplitude level. Instead, the trapping of particles in small-scale mirrors leads to non-linear secular growth of magnetic perturbations, δB/B ∝ t2/3. Our theory explains recent collisionless simulation results, provides a prediction of the mirror evolution in weakly collisional plasmas and establishes a foundation for a theory of non-linear mirror dynamics with trapping, valid up to δB/B = O(1).},

	abstract = {A theoretical framework for low-frequency electromagnetic (drift-)kinetic turbulence in a collisionless, multi-species plasma is presented. The result generalises reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and kinetic RMHD (Schekochihin et al., Astrophys. J. Suppl. Ser., vol. 182, 2009, pp. 310–377) to the case where the mean distribution function of the plasma is pressure-anisotropic and different ion species are allowed to drift with respect to each other – a situation routinely encountered in the solar wind and presumably ubiquitous in hot dilute astrophysical plasmas such as the intracluster medium. Two main objectives are achieved. First, in a non-Maxwellian plasma, the relationships between fluctuating fields (e.g. the Alfvén ratio) are order-unity modified compared to the more commonly considered Maxwellian case, and so a quantitative theory is developed to support quantitative measurements now possible in the solar wind. Beyond these order-unity corrections, the main physical feature of low-frequency plasma turbulence survives the generalisation to non-Maxwellian distributions: Alfvénic and compressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled, with the latter passively advected by the former; the Alfvénic cascade is fluid, satisfying RMHD equations (with the Alfvén speed modified by pressure anisotropy and species drifts), whereas the compressive cascade is kinetic and subject to collisionless damping (and for a bi-Maxwellian plasma splits into three independent collisionless cascades). Secondly, the organising principle of this turbulence is elucidated in the form of a conservation law for the appropriately generalised kinetic free energy. It is shown that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function reduce the rate of phase mixing and the efficacy of magnetic stresses, and that these changes influence the partitioning of free energy amongst the various cascade channels. As the firehose or mirror instability thresholds are approached, the dynamics of the plasma are modified so as to reduce the energetic cost of bending magnetic-field lines or of compressing/rarefying them. Finally, it is shown that this theory can be derived as a long-wavelength limit of non-Maxwellian slab gyrokinetics.},

	abstract = {Numerous prior studies have shown that as proton beta increases, a narrower range of proton temperature anisotropy values is observed. This effect has often been ascribed to the actions of kinetic microinstabilities because the distribution of observational data aligns with contours of constant instability growth rates in the beta-anisotropy plane. However, the linear Vlasov theory of instabilities assumes a uniform background in which perturbations grow. The established success of linear-microinstability theories suggests that the conditions in regions of extreme temperature anisotropy may remain uniform for a long enough time so that the instabilities have the chance to grow to sufficient amplitude. Turbulence, on the other hand, is intrinsically nonuniform and nonlinear. Thin current sheets and other coherent structures generated in a turbulent plasma may quickly destroy the uniformity. It is, therefore, not a-priori obvious whether the presence of intermittency and coherent structures favors or disfavors instabilities. To address this question, we examined the statistical distribution of growth rates associated with proton temperature-anisotropy driven microinstabilities and local nonlinear time scales in turbulent plasmas. Linear growth rates are, on average, substantially less than the local nonlinear rates. However, at the regions of extreme values of temperature anisotropy, near the “edges” of the populated part of the proton temperature anisotropy-parallel beta plane, the instability growth rates are comparable or faster than the turbulence time scales. These results provide a possible answer to the question as to why the linear theory appears to work in limiting plasma excursions in anisotropy and plasma beta.},

We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a spectrum of large-scale, linearly polarized, random-phase Alfvénic fluctuations that have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations and a vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent cascade rapidly develops, magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at sub-ion scales. The imposed expansion (taking a strictly transverse ambient magnetic field) leads to the generation of an important perpendicular proton temperature anisotropy that eventually drives the mirror instability. This instability generates large-amplitude, nonpropagating, compressible, pressure-balanced magnetic structures in a form of magnetic enhancements/humps that reduce the perpendicular temperature anisotropy.},

	abstract = {Oblique fire hose instability is investigated using hybrid simulations for proton betas of the order of one and for proton parallel temperatures sufficiently greater than the perpendicular ones. The simulations confirm previous simulation results showing that this instability has self-destructing properties and efficiently reduces the proton temperature anisotropy. A parametric study using one-dimensional standard hybrid simulations shows that stronger changes in the temperature anisotropy and stronger wave emissions appear for larger initial temperature anisotropies. An ideal, slow plasma expansion, modeled by a two-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulation, leads to a generation of proton temperature anisotropy. The anisotropy leads first to destabilization of the dominant parallel fire hose, which interacts mainly with minor supra-Alfvénic protons, whereas the evolution of core protons is determined by expansion. Consequently, the effective anisotropy is only slightly reduced and the system eventually becomes unstable with respect to the oblique fire hose instability. The oblique fire hose strongly scatters the protons and removes the anisotropy disrupting the parallel fire hose. An important portion of the fluctuating wave energy is dissipated to protons, and only long wavelength waves remain in the system. The system with low wave activity then develops again larger temperature anisotropies, and the evolution repeats itself. It is concluded that both parallel and oblique proton fire hose instabilities constrain the proton temperature anisotropy in the expanding solar wind, with the latter one constituting a final frontier for the anisotropy. These results give a possible explanation of some apparent discrepancies between observations and linear predictions. In addition, a simple bounded anisotropy model is developed to include some of the kinetic effects of the fire hose instabilities in fluid models.},

The three different approaches converge toward the same instability threshold condition which is in good agreement with in situ observations, suggesting that such instability is relevant in the solar wind context. We investigate also the effect of the wave-particle interactions on shaping the proton distribution function and on the evolution of the spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations during the expansion. We find that the resonant interaction can provide the proton distribution function to depart from the bi-Maxwellian form.},

	abstract = {We use particle-in-cell simulations to study the nonlinear evolution of ion velocity space instabilities in an idealized problem in which a background velocity shear continuously amplifies the magnetic field. We simulate the astrophysically relevant regime where the shear timescale is long compared to the ion cyclotron period, and the plasma beta is β ∼ 1–100. The background field amplification in our calculation is meant to mimic processes such as turbulent fluctuations or MHD-scale instabilities. The field amplification continuously drives a pressure anisotropy with p⊥ {\textgreater} p∥ and the plasma becomes unstable to the mirror and ion cyclotron instabilities. In all cases, the nonlinear state is dominated by the mirror instability, not the ion cyclotron instability, and the plasma pressure anisotropy saturates near the threshold for the linear mirror instability. The magnetic field fluctuations initially undergo exponential growth but saturate in a secular phase in which the fluctuations grow on the same timescale as the background magnetic field (with δB ∼ 0.3 〈B〉 in the secular phase). At early times, the ion magnetic moment is well-conserved but once the fluctuation amplitudes exceed δB ∼ 0.1 〈B〉, the magnetic moment is no longer conserved but instead changes on a timescale comparable to that of the mean magnetic field. We discuss the implications of our results for low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Earth solar wind and low-luminosity accretion disks around black holes.},

	abstract = {One proposed mechanism for heating the solar wind, from close to the Sun to beyond ∼10 AU, invokes low-frequency, oblique, Alfvén-wave turbulence. Because small-scale oblique Alfvén waves (kinetic Alfvén waves, KAWs) are compressive, the measured density fluctuations in the solar wind place an upper limit on the amplitude of KAWs and hence an upper limit on the rate at which the solar wind can be heated by low-frequency, Alfvénic turbulence. We evaluate this upper limit for both coronal holes at 5 R☉ and the near-Earth solar wind. At both locations, the upper limit we find is consistent with models in which the solar wind is heated by low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence. At 1 AU, the upper limit on the turbulent heating rate derived from the measured density fluctuations is within a factor of 2 of the measured solar-wind heating rate. Thus, if low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence is the primary mechanism for heating the near-Earth solar wind, KAWs must be one of the dominant sources of solar-wind density fluctuations at frequencies ∼1 Hz. We also present a simple argument for why density-fluctuation measurements do appear to rule out models in which coronal holes are heated by non-turbulent high-frequency waves (“sweeping”), but are compatible with heating by low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence.},

The first instability is the fire hose (or whistler fire hose), generating low-frequency whistler waves at parallel propagation. We found a new, second instability, the Alfvén fire hose, that generates zero-frequency waves of the Alfvén branch at strongly oblique propagation. The Alfvén fire hose has a linear growth rate comparable to or even greater than that of the whistler fire hose. The two instabilities with the same initial plasma parameters are examined via one-dimensional hybrid simulations and turn out to have behavior very different from each other. The whistler fire hose has an overall quasi-linear evolution, while the evolution of the Alfvén fire hose is more complicated: Initially, unstable zero-frequency waves are gradually transformed into propagating Alfvén waves; during this process the waves are strongly damped and heat protons in a perpendicular direction. Consequently, the Alfvén fire hose is very efficient at destroying proton anisotropy.},

At large scales, where the turbulence is predominantly Alfvénic, measurements of critical balance, residual energy and three-dimensional structure are discussed, along with comparison to recent models of strong Alfvénic turbulence. At these scales, a few per cent of the energy is also in compressive fluctuations, and their nature, anisotropy and relation to the Alfvénic component is described. In the small-scale kinetic range, below the ion gyroscale, the turbulence becomes predominantly kinetic Alfvén in nature, and measurements of the spectra, anisotropy and intermittency of this turbulence are discussed with respect to recent cascade models. One of the major remaining questions is how the turbulent energy is dissipated, and some recent work on this question, in addition to future space missions which will help to answer it, are briefly discussed.},

Two major approximations of the previous work are eliminated: that of isotropic ion distributions, and that of nondispersive waves. The wave action flux of finite-amplitude Alfvén waves in a multi-ion, differentially flowing, gyrotropic plasma is derived. This quantity is incorporated into the wave-driven solar wind model of Isenberg and Hollweg, which is then applied to gyrotropic protons and alpha particles. It is found that allowing for nonisotropic ions yields enhanced preferential acceleration of alpha particles. However, when dispersion is included in the resonant interaction, the preferential effects are again reduced. These more realistic calculations show that the observations of solar wind alpha particles cannot be explained by a resonant cyclotron interaction.},

Here we briefly review some recent developments and observations on MHD fluctuations in the frequency range between some 10−6 and 10−2 Hz. Spectral analysis reveals that solar wind fluctuations represent ongoing turbulence, often with high Alfvénic correlations of coronal origin, which undergoes considerable spatial and spectral evolution in the radially expanding wind and is coupled to large-scale plasma structures and magnetic field inhomogeneities. Theoretical attempts to model the transport of magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations are discussed. Finally, the dissipation of turbulence and concurrent heating of the wind are addressed.},

	abstract = {We present a series of models for the plasma properties along open magnetic flux tubes rooted in solar coronal holes, streamers, and active regions. These models represent the first self-consistent solutions that combine (1) chromospheric heating driven by an empirically guided acoustic wave spectrum; (2) coronal heating from Alfvén waves that have been partially reflected, then damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade; and (3) solar wind acceleration from gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and Alfvén wave pressure. The only input parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for the waves and the radial dependence of the background magnetic field along the flux tube. We have not included multifluid or collisionless effects (e.g., preferential ion heating), which are not yet fully understood. For a single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models produce a realistic range of slow and fast solar wind conditions by varying only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a two-dimensional model of coronal holes and streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal bifurcation of slow and fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the Alfvén speed affects where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited below or above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a larger coronal "expansion factor" gives rise to a slower and denser wind, higher temperature at the coronal base, less intense Alfvén waves at 1 AU, and correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge states and FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These models offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar wind acceleration (in open magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave dissipation and turbulent cascade.},

This study used data from the Faraday cups on the Wind spacecraft to examine scalar temperature and temperature components of protons. Plasma unstable to the mirror or firehose instability was found to be about 3–4 times hotter than stable plasma. Since anisotropy-driven instabilities are not understood to heat the plasma, these results suggest that heating processes are more effective than cooling processes at creating and maintaining proton temperature anisotropy in the solar wind.},

Based on physical intuition gained from this framework, we address how the proton temperature anisotropy impacts the nonlinear dynamics of the Alfvénic fluctuations underlying the dominant cascade of energy from large to small scales and how the fluctuations driven by proton temperature anisotropy instabilities interact nonlinearly with each other and with the fluctuations of the large-scale cascade. We find that the nonlinear dynamics of the large-scale cascade is insensitive to the proton temperature anisotropy and that the instability-driven fluctuations are unlikely to cause significant nonlinear evolution of either the instability-driven fluctuations or the turbulent fluctuations of the large-scale cascade.},

We perform three-dimensional hybrid simulations with particle-in-cell protons and a quasi-neutralizing electron fluid to investigate the effect of the turbulence on a particular instability. The instability is driven by the proton temperature anisotropy and it would generate Alfvén/proton-cyclotron waves propagating nearly parallel to the mean magnetic field if the turbulence were not present. The turbulence in our simulations is approximately two-dimensional with wavevectors highly oblique to the magnetic field. We find that, first, the turbulence results in a considerable modification of the proton distribution function. This contributes to the properties of the instability, such as its growth rate and saturation level. Second, the spatial inhomogeneity associated with the turbulent fluctuations extends the spectrum of the unstable waves to higher perpendicular wavenumbers making them more oblique. This is similar to the effect exerted on an instability by a static nonuniform background. Despite the quantitative changes introduced by the turbulence, we conclude that the instability remains qualitatively the same.},

The angle dependencies suggest that perpendicular heating in Alfvénic wind may be responsible. We quantify the occurrence rate of the two instabilities as a function of the length of unstable intervals as they are convected over the spacecraft. This analysis indicates that mirror-mode and oblique firehose instabilities require a spatial interval of length greater than 2–3 unstable wavelengths in order to relax the plasma into a marginally stable state and thus closer to thermodynamic equilibrium in the solar wind. Our analysis suggests that the conditions for these instabilities to act effectively vary locally on scales much shorter than the correlation length of solar wind turbulence.},

Our discussion is based on Stix' well-known dispersion relation, but we depart from most previous analyses by assuming that the resonant protons lie near the peak of their distribution function. We find three instabilities, two of which are new. The first new instability is driven by anisotropic electrons in the same manner as is the firehose, and we believe that it represents an extension of the firehose instability to large wave numbers. The growth rates are large over a broad frequency range around Ωp. We suggest that the excitation of this instability results in a partial transfer of thermal energy from the electrons to the protons and, if it occurs in the solar wind, may therefore heat the solar-wind protons and reduce their anisotropy. The second, new instability is driven by anisotropic protons with T⊥p⪞3T∥p; it may occur in local regions of the solar wind. The third instability is not new; it represents a continuation of the unstable whistler mode near Ωp to those cases where there are many resonant protons. In contrast to earlier papers, in which it is assumed that the number of resonant protons is small, our work demonstrates that this instability can in fact be effective in destroying proton anisotropies of the type observed in the solar wind.},

Temperature anisotropy generated adiabatically by the plasma expansion (and consequent decrease in the mean magnetic-field strength) gradually reduces the effective elasticity of the field lines, causing reductions in the linear frequency and residual energy of the Alfvénic fluctuations. In response, these fluctuations modify their interactions and spatial anisotropy to maintain a scale-by-scale "critical balance" between their characteristic linear and nonlinear frequencies. Eventually the plasma becomes unstable to kinetic firehose instabilities, which excite rapidly growing magnetic fluctuations at ion-Larmor scales. The consequent pitch-angle scattering of particles maintains the temperature anisotropy near marginal stability, even as the turbulent plasma continues to expand. The resulting evolution of parallel and perpendicular temperatures does not satisfy double-adiabatic conservation laws, but is described accurately by a simple model that includes anomalous scattering. Our results have implications for understanding the complex interplay between macro- and microscale physics in various hot, dilute, astrophysical plasmas, and offer predictions concerning power spectra, residual energy, ion-Larmor-scale spectral breaks, and non-Maxwellian features in ion distribution functions that may be tested by measurements taken in high-beta regions of the solar wind.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a flurry of research activity focused on discerning the physics of kinetic scale turbulence in high-speed astrophysical plasma flows. By ‘kinetic’ we mean spatial scales on the order of or, in particular, smaller than the ion inertial length or the ion gyro-radius—the spatial scales at which the ion and electron bulk velocities decouple and considerable change can be seen in the ion distribution functions. The motivation behind most of these studies is to find the ultimate fate of the energy cascade of plasma turbulence, and thereby the channels by which the energy in the system is dissipated. This brief Introduction motivates the case for a themed issue on this topic and introduces the topic of turbulent dissipation and heating in the solar wind. The theme issue covers the full breadth of studies: from theory and models, massive simulations of these models and observational studies from the highly rich and vast amount of data collected from scores of heliospheric space missions since the dawn of the space age. A synopsis of the theme issue is provided, where a brief description of all the contributions is discussed and how they fit together to provide an over-arching picture on the highly topical subject of dissipation and heating in turbulent collisionless plasmas in general and in the solar wind in particular.},

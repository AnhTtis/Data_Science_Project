    "abstract": "We study a quasi-one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain with frustrated triangular form, in which the interaction is set to realize a glassy system with dipole-facilitated kinetic constraints. A notable feature of this concise model turns out to be the three disconnected subspaces, allowing us to comprehend entanglement dynamics with blocked structure of Hilbert space. Initially from the Bell state and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, it is found that the quantum entanglement, quantified by concurrence, fidelity and 2-Rényi entropy, exhibits a nonthermal dynamic behavior, i.e. the diffused entanglement can be spontaneously recovered which is absent in other spin models. This appealing periodic dynamics of entanglement manifests high fidelity against random flipping noise. Our work offers a sound way of ergodicity breaking and fault-tolerant quantum computations.",

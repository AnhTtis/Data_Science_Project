    "abstract": "We prove new lower bounds on the growth of robust quantum circuit complexity -- the minimal number of gates $C_δ(U)$ to approximate a unitary $U$ up to an error of $δ$ in operator norm distance -- in random quantum circuits. First, for $δ=Θ(2^{-n})$, we prove a linear growth rate: $C_δ\\geq d/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ for random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits with $d\\leq 2^{n/2}$ gates. Second, for $ δ=Ω(1)$, we prove a square-root growth of complexity: $C_δ\\geq \\sqrt{d}/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ for all $d\\leq 2^{n/2}$. Finally, we provide a simple conjecture regarding the Fourier support of randomly drawn Boolean functions that would imply linear growth for constant $δ$. While these results follow from bounds on the moments of random quantum circuits, we do not make use of existing results on the generation of unitary $t$-designs. Instead, we bound the moments of an auxiliary random walk on the diagonal unitaries acting on phase states. In particular, our proof is comparably short and self-contained.",

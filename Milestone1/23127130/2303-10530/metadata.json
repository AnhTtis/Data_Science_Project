    "abstract": "Denote by $\\mathcal{C}^-_{\\ell}$ the $3$-uniform hypergraph obtained by removing one hyperedge from the tight cycle on $\\ell$ vertices. It is conjectured that the Turán density of $\\mathcal{C}^-_{5}$ is $1/4$. In this paper, we make progress toward this conjecture by proving that the Turán density of $\\mathcal{C}^-_{\\ell}$ is $1/4$, for every sufficiently large $\\ell$ not divisible by $3$. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a forbidden-subhypergraph characterization of the hypergraphs, for which there exists a tournament on the same vertex set such that every hyperedge is a cyclic triangle in this tournament.\n  A byproduct of our method is a human-checkable proof for the upper bound on the maximum number of almost similar triangles in a planar point set, which recently was proved using flag algebra by Balogh, Clemen, and Lidický.",

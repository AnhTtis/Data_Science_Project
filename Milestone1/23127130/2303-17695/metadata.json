    "abstract": "Existing conversational models are handled by a database(DB) and API based systems. However, very often users' questions require information that cannot be handled by such systems. Nonetheless, answers to these questions are available in the form of customer reviews and FAQs. DSTC-11 proposes a three stage pipeline consisting of knowledge seeking turn detection, knowledge selection and response generation to create a conversational model grounded on this subjective knowledge. In this paper, we focus on improving the knowledge selection module to enhance the overall system performance. In particular, we propose entity retrieval methods which result in an accurate and faster knowledge search. Our proposed Named Entity Recognition (NER) based entity retrieval method results in 7X faster search compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we also explore a potential keyword extraction method which can improve the accuracy of knowledge selection. Preliminary results show a 4 \\% improvement in exact match score on knowledge selection task. The code is available https://github.com/raja-kumar/knowledge-grounded-TODS",

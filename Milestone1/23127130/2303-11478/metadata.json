    "abstract": "In recent years, several simulation codes for reproducing liquid metal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena have been validated and benchmarked. Accurate simulation codes are crucial to enhance our understanding of how flow behavior affects heat transport in liquid metal-based breeding blankets. Using heat transfer correlations, that model the influence of flow characteristics on the transport of heat, is especially interesting for system designers because it saves them the effort and time in completely simulating every design proposal. Our group has studied the buoyant MHD flow in poloidal channels on the EU Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) blanket geometry. Two different codes were used for this study: a 2D fully-developed code and a Q2D-fully-developed code. In this work, we explored the influence of different flow conditions in the heat transport phenomena parametrically. This article presents the results of the calculations performed using the two codes and provides heat transfer correlations for poloidal EU DCLL channels.",

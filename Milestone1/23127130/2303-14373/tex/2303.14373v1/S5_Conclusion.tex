In this paper, we propose a de-overlapping network (DoNet) to address the overlapping challenges in cytology instance segmentation. The proposed DoNet enhances the model’s perception of overlapping regions by implicitly and explicitly modeling the interaction between cellular regions and the integral instance. Extensive experiments reveal the superiorities of the proposed DoNet, which not only provides immense potential for overlapping object perception in the medical domain but also occluded instance segmentation in general vision application scenarios.

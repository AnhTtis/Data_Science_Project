    "abstract": "Oscillating scalar field condensates induce small amplitude oscillations of the Hubble parameter which can induce a decay of the condensate due to a parametric resonance instability [1]. We show that this instability can lead to the decay of the coherence of the condensate of axion-like particle (ALP) fields during the radiation phase of standard cosmology for rather generic ALP parameter values, with possible implications for certain experiments aiming to search for ALP candidates. As an example, we study the application of this instability to the QCD axion. We also study the magnitude of the induced entropy fluctuations.",

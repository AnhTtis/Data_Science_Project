\section{Conclusion}
We have presented \modelname, a system paradigm that synergizes multimodal reasoning and action to tackle complicated visual understanding problems. \modelname~presents a simple and flexible way to empower LLMs with a pool of vision experts. Extensive zero-shot experiments demonstrate \modelname's capabilities in solving a wide range of challenging understanding tasks, such as multi-image reasoning, multi-hop document understanding, open-world concept understanding, video summarization, and more.

\section{Group B Pulsar Tables, Models and Notes, Corrected}


%This appendix includes pulsars within the Arecibo sky that have usually had little study of their beam geometry but appear in the LOFAR High Band Survey \cite[hereafter BKK+, PHS+]{bilous2016, pilia2016}  or the \cite[KL99]{kuzmin1999}.  All are objects with ``J'' discovery names.  

%Here, our profile measurements follow directly from the 1.4-GHz or 327-MHz profiles in Figs.~\ref{figA1}-\ref{figA27} as well as the LOFAR High Band 100-200-MHz or Pushchino Observatory 102-MHz profiles. Table~\ref{tabA1} gives the sources for these profiles in both principal-bands as well as each pulsar's observational parameters.   Table~\ref{tabA2} gives the physical parameters that can be computed from the period $P$ and spindown $\dot P$---that is, the spindown energy $\dot E$, spindown age $\tau$, surface magnetic field $B_{surf}$, the acceleration parameter $B_{12}/P^2$ and Beskin \etal's (\citeyear{pulsar_magnetosphere_book}) parameter $1/Q$.  

%Following the analysis procedures of \cite{rankin93} and its Appendix \cite{rankin93b}; together, ET VI), we have measured outside conal half-power (3 db) widths and half-power core widths wherever possible. However, we do not plot these directly.  Rather we use the widths to model the core and conal beam geometry, but here emphasizing the 100-MHz frequency range.  The model results are given in Table~\ref{tabA3} for the 1-GHZ band and for the respective 100-200 and $<$100-MHz Band regimes.  

%The results of the model for each pulsar are then plotted along with the Arecibo profiles in Figures~\ref{figA1} to \ref{figA27}.  For each pulsar the plotted values represent the {\bf scaled} inner and outer conal beam radii and the core angular width, respectively.  The scaling plots each pulsar's beam dimensions as if it were an orthogonal rotator rotating with a 1-sec period---thus the conal beam radii are scaled by a factor of $\sqrt{P}$ and the core width (diameter) by $\sqrt{P}\sin{\alpha}$.  The outer and inner conal radii are plotted with blue and green lines and the core diameter in red.  The nominal values of the three beam dimensions at 1 GHz are shown in each plot by a small triangle.  

%Propagating the observational errors in the width values is very difficult.  They come from different sources at different frequencies and sometimes entail unknown instrumental errors and issues in addition to errors we have made in interpreting the profiles and measuring them.  Therefore, we have chosen rather to provide error bars reflecting the the beam-radii errors for a 10\% uncertainty in the width values and a 10\% uncertainty in the polarization position-angle (PPA) sweep rate.  The error bars shown reflect the {\it rms} of the two sources with the former indicated in the lower bar and the latter in the upper one.  For many pulsars one of the errors is so dominant that the bars corresponding to the two individual error sources are hard to see; however, B1633+24 provides a case where they can be seen quite clearly.  The errors shown for the core-beam angular diameters is uniformly 0.2\degr\ in the scaled width.  

%Scattering distorts and broadens pulsar profiles at low frequency and often goes from being hardly noticable to dominant within an octave or so of frequency.  Scattering also reduces the detectability of pulsars at low frequency to the end that the lowest frequency profiles available often entail significant scattering.  In that our beam modeling efforts require us to distinguish between intrinsic dimensions and those distorted by scattering, we must also estimate the level of measured or estimated scattering for each pulsar and show this in relation to our beam models at low frequency.  

%Fortunately, many of the pulsars in this group have published scattering or scintillation studies that can be used to accurately estimate the scattering time at a given frequency.  We are indebted to \cite{kuzmin_LL2007} for their extensive compendium of 100-MHz scattering times.  When these are available, they are shown on the model plots as double-hatched orange regions where the boundary reflects the scattering timescale at that frequency in degrees.  

%For pulsars where no scattering study is available, we have the option of using the mean scattering level determined for a large ensemble of pulsars as a function of dispersion measure (DM), where $t_{scatt}$ is some $480 DM^2/f(MHz)^4$ s \citep{kuzmin2001}.  While this relationship is well determined, a number of pulsars have scattering levels that are up to about 10 times greater or less than the average level.  Therefore, our model plots show the average scattering level (where applicable) as yellow single hatching and with an orange line indicating 10 times this value as a rough upper limit.


\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0006+1834}}: This pulsar has a wide, apparently double or conal quadruple profile with a strong leading pair of components and weak trailing power as seen at 327 MHz.  The longitude scales are different here to show this weak trailing power, and it cannot be detected either at 1.4 GHz or 149 MHz; however, the bright component is seen at 111 MHz \citep{prao}. The dimensions of the entire profile cannot then be measured accurately.  More difficult is that the PPA rate is close to --1\degr/\degr\ at 327 MHz, and the geometry depends critically on the sign of $\beta$.  If positive, $\rho$ increases dramatically with wavelength, but flattens at low frequency, so not in the usual manner.  If negative, $\rho = \alpha$ independent of the profile width. In short, little can be said of this pulsar's geometry.  The sinusoidal LOFAR 149-MHz profile provides little to go on, and scattering is expected to have negligible effect.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0030+0451}}: This 4.9 msec MSP was observed very nicely at 1.3 GHz by \citet{SBM+22}, and \citet{KTSD23} have used the LWA to obtain profiles down to 35 MHz.  The high frequency profile shows two broad features spaced by roughly half a rotation period with a PPA traverse suggestive of a single-pole interpulsar.  The central part of the stronger roughly triple ``main pulse'' is in turn suggestive of core emission but as usual is too narrow to reflect a dipolar polar cap.  We provide an aspirational triple model in order to show the evolution of the putative conal profile over the large band available. 
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0051+0423}}: PSR J0051+0423 has a three-component profile with some evidence of structure in the trailing component.  Fluctuation spectra often show a feature with a 2.4-$P$ period that modulates all three features.  We have thus explored whether a conal triple c{\bf T} beam geometry is compatible with the profile dimensions and find that it is so.  The pulsar is detected both at 111 MHz \citep{prao} and 20/25 MHz \citep{ZVKU13} but no measurements are possible.  However, the four LWA decameter observations \citep{KTSD23} provide high quality profiles down to 35 MHz.
%Joanna, McEwen et al? yes, our P-band is better
\vskip 0.1in    

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0122+1416}} has a well defined PPA rate and apparently a single profile in both bands with no evidence of width escalation.  We thus model it using an inner conal single geometry.  The pulsar is detected both at 111 MHz \citep{prao} where the width may be compatible with those at higher frequencies and at 20/25 MHz \citep{KZUS22} where the larger width may reflect scattering.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0137+1654}}: A broad double profile is seen in this pulsar at 1.4 GHz, with seemingly three components at 327 MHz, and a single component with a leading ``bump'' is seen at LOFAR frequencies.  The weak leading 327-MHz component is seen in several observations, so is definitely present. It clearly declines markedly with wavelength, thus only the trailing features are seen in the LOFAR profiles.  We thus model the profile as having a conal quadruple c{\bf Q} structure; but the inner and outer features are conflated at 1.4 GHz, no leading inner conal feature is discernible at 327 MHz, and the leading component is so weak in the LOFAR profiles that the outer conal geometry cannot be traced into the decameter region.  Single pulses show that the emission comes in bursts of a few 10s of pulses interspersed by long nulls.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0139+3336}}: Neither profile permits detailed interpretation; however, both suggest two conflated brighter features with possibly a further pair on the ``wings'' at 327 MHz---while  the main pair maintains about the same width.  The PPA rate appears to be about --6\degr/\degr.  We model the main features with an inner conal double configuration.  
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0152+0948}}: Two components are seen at all three frequencies with the leading feature having a steeper relative spectrum in this pulsar.  The linear polarization suggests a highly central PPA traverse.  We model this as a {\bf D} profile.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0245+1433 (formerly J0244+14; \cite{dsm+13})}}: The 327-MHz Arecibo profile in Fig.~\ref{figA102} seems to be the only one available, and it shows a double structure with a chaotic PPA behavior.  Striking is the substantial, symmetrical antisymmetric $V$ that is often characteristic of core emission and rare in conal profiles.  However, this pulsar falls well into the conal emission dominated region on the basis of its $\dot E$ of only about $10^{31}$ ergs/s.  More information is clearly needed to work out its beam structure.  This pulsar has been weakly detected at 111 MHz (Valerij Malofeev, private communication), so it is possible that more study will prove to be revealing.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0329+1654}}: PSR J0329+1645 has poor LOFAR and 1.4-GHz profiles, probably due to its being a RRAT \citep{BT21} where it is also seen at 111 MHz. It seems to have a single symmetrical component across the three bands, so we model it as having a {\bf S$_d$} structure.  Scattering seems minimal at 149 MHz.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0337+1715}} is the famous 2.7-ms MSP in a triple system \citep{Ransom_2014} that also seems to have a core/double-cone profile.  We report the analysis in \cite{Rankin_2017} where a central traverse is assumed given that no PPA slope can be determined.  The beam dimensions and model emission heights are smaller than for other pulsars in part because the velocity-or-light cylinder radius is only 130 km for this MSP.

\label{figA103}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0348+0432}}: Our profile is not suitable for exploring the geometry, so we have replicated the four-frequency, full period, total power profiles from \cite{lynch2013}.  Also, the polarization is very nicely measured in the \cite{antoniadis} Fig. 5, where the PPA rate is --8.45\degr/\degr.  The profile evolution suggests an outer cone, and this requires an $\alpha$ value near 56\degr.  This in turn requires a core width near 14\degr, which is plausible, but impossible to determine accurately from the profiles in Fig.~\ref{figA103}, but the \citet{mcewen} 350-MHz profile provides the best opportunity.  Apparently, this is another MSP with a cone-cone triple {\bf T} beam geometry. 
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0417+35}}: At LOFAR frequencies, the profile has two components, the leading much stronger than the trailing. At P-band, the trailing component decreases in height to become almost a "bump" on the side of the profile. We use a {\bf D} profile model.  The PPA rate is poorly determined, and scattering seems minimal at 149 MHz.
The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

\vskip 0.1in
\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0435+2749}}: Following on \citet{brinkman_freire_rankin_stovall}'s {\bf T} classification, we now see that the LOFAR profile shows a narrow third component, while the central one seems to be broader.  Close inspection of several 327-MHz profiles show dual central features that somewhat broaden the trailing component.  These can be seen in the weak $L$ curve.  Therefore, having explored the quantitative geometry, we now believe a conal quadruple c{\textbf{Q}} beam model is most appropriate for this pulsar.  The PPA rate is difficult to discern accurately, but a shallow negative traverse is most likely.  The LOFAR inner cone width cannot be measured accurately, but a value around 25\degr\ is compatible with those at the higher frequencies---though the fit in Fig.~\ref{figA104} gives a substantially narrower value.  
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0457+2333}}: The two profiles are only of moderate quality, but they suggest a ``boxy'' form at 1.4 GHz that may show a core/double cone at 327 MHz---similar to the evolution of many {\bf M} structures.  We  can only guess the PPA rate, but a central traverse is suggested at the lower frequency.  To support this model a core width of about 7\degr\ is needed, and this cannot be verified in the profile structure; nor can we clearly discern the inner cone width.  Higher quality profiles are needed to improve the beam model.
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0533+0402}}: This pulsar seems to be a conal single {\bf S$_d$} pulsar, but its geometry remains inaccurate.  The 1.4-GHz PPA traverse suggests a very central sightline traverse, which is incompatible with this classification; the 327-MHz one suggests an oblique traverse but gives no useful slope.  Fortunately, the \citet{JK18} profile shows a traverse that may be about  +11\degr/\degr, making $\alpha$ upwards of 90\degr\ for an outer cone.  This is then compatible with the Pushchino profile that shows clear bifurcation and a larger width suggesting an outer conal geometry.

\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0538+2817}} is a fast pulsar with broad, nearly fully linear polarized profiles.  Moreover, the two Lband profiles are very very different, reflecting the two quasi-stable profile forms identified by \citet{acj+96}. Similar moding seems to occur at 4.9 GHz \citep{vonHoensbroech1997}.  Moding is unusual in such an energetic pulsar, so this is a potentially important example.  Both of the profiles are comprised by a number of features, but we were barely able to distinguish the core and conal features or to trace their evolution.  Moreover, the core width can be accurately measured but appears incomplete, especially at the lower frequency, so we use a large 14\degr\ value.  Overall, the model is therefore aspirational.  This is an interesting pulsar that deserves detailed study.
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0540+3207}}: Our several profiles suggest three features at 327 MHz and four at 1.4 GHz.  The PPA rate is poorly determined, but the needed +10\degr/\degr\ is plausible.  We thus model the beam geometry with a {c\bf T}/{c\bf Q} geometry. The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0546+2441}}: All our profiles for this slow pulsars are narrow, and the best show clear structure with hints of core emission in $V$.  The features are too conflated to measure with any confidence and the PPA slopes are inconsistent and the rate thus uncertain.  We model the profiles in an exemplary manner as a core single while regarding its emission as a conflated mixture of core and conal radiation.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0609+2130}}: The 1.4-GHz profile of this MSP shows a squarish triple form with little indication of the PPA rate; whereas, the 327-MHz profile is single with a width of 20\degr\ or less.  The central feature seems to have a width just larger than the polar cap diameter---and the width at 327 MHz seems only a little greater.  If we interpret the middle component as a core with a width of about 14\degr---and assume a central sightline traverse with $\beta$ $\sim$ 0, the dimensions conform to a core/inner conal single {\bf S$_t$} beam geometry.  
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0611+30}}: Evidence of one component across all three bands with little change in width is seen in this pulsar.  We model it as a conal single {\bf S$_d$} configuration.  The pulsar is well detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but only crude width measurements are possible; the \citet{bilous2019} profiles give better values.  Scattering sets in at the very lowest frequencies.  
%Add Bilous profile
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0613+3731}}: With profiles only at 327-MHz and below, we conclude that this is an inner cone triple configuration.  No higher frequency profile seems to have been published.  The conal emission is conflated at all frequencies down to and including 25 MHz \citep{KZUS22}.  The \citet{prao} profile is not well resolved; however, a much better one was kindly supplied (Valerij Malofeev, private communication) the four decametric LWA profiles \citep{KTSD23} trace the core-component below 50 MHz where scattering sets in and becomes dominant.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0621+0336}} seems to have a barely resolved inner conal double {\bf D} profile.  The early edge linear polarization seems to be a different OPM than that prominent on the trailing part of the profile---thus the moderate positive PPA slope.  A 350-MHz profile is available in the \citet{mcewen} compendium which seems to show a compatible barely double form, but its scale cannot be measured more accurately than the nominal half width they tabulate.  
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0621+1002}}: the MSP has a very broad core-cone triple {\bf T} profile.  The PPA slope is negative, very shallow and difficult to determine accurately, but the earliest portion under the core is steepest and may have a slope near --0.7\degr/\degr.  A 410-MHz profile \citep{stairs99} shows a nearly identical width pointing to an inner cone geometry.  The about 25\degr\ L-band profile asymmetry suggest an aberration/retardation height ($c\Delta t/2$) of some 300 km.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0623+0340}} appears to have a double cone {c\bf T} profile, despite the PPA rate being difficult to estimate.  Interestingly, the emission comes in widely separated bursts of 50-100 pulses as shown in Fig.~\ref{figA105}.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0625+1015}}: Very probably dominant core emission, with possible weak conal emission on the profile edges.  No indication of the PPA rate is discernible.  We model the beam with a core-single geometry.  
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in


\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0627+0649}}: Our 1.4 GHz profiles are suggestive of a core/double-cone structure; however, we see only some inflections in our lone 327-MHz profile.  Further, the fractional linear $L/I$ is unusually large, and the PPA rate is both well defined and relatively shallow---resulting in an oblique rather than central sightline traverse.  We model only an outer conal geometry, and this would require a core width of about 11\degr, a possible but uncomfortably large value given the scale of the 1.4-GHz profile.  The higher frequency profile shows a potential core/double-cone structure, but additionally no reasonable inner cone solution can be achieve with such a shallow PPA rate. 
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0628+0909}}: Our three narrow 1.4-GHz profiles of this RRAT \citep{McLaughlin06} show slightly different variations of a similar three-component structure, where the central feature surprisingly shows strong hints of antisymmetric $V$, and putative conal outriders show as inflections in the total power profiles or structure in the $L/I$ one. Its PPA rate seems to be fairly steep and +ve.  If the core width is just larger that that of the polar cap, a core/inner conal model can be computed. One can however see that the profiles are formed of a small fraction of strong pulses, so its profiles of even several thousand pulses may not be very stable.  
%Joanna, try fluctspec
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0630--0046}} We have only the 1.4-GHz polarimetry to go on.  It seems dominated by the trailing conal component, and the leading component together with the PPA traverse suggest that they are conal.  The \citet{mcewen} profile suggests a larger width, but its poor quality provides no clarity.  We thus model it as an inner conal double, but weak core emission may occur in the saddle region.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0646+0905}}: we model the pulsar roughly with an inner conal single {\bf S$_d$} configuration, but it could also be outer conal with a larger $\alpha$ value.  No clear drift feature is seen in fluctuation spectra.  The $L$ and PPA traverse 
are asymmetric as in other B0809+74-like profiles, possibly suggesting some ``missing'' early emission.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0647+0913}}: One of our 3 observations shows a deep 3.9-$P$ 
modulation, whereas the other 2 do not, suggesting that the pulsar is conal and has 
several modes.  Single pulses show that the leading-edge ``kink'' on the profile is 
produced by two populations of subpulses at different longitudes.  The trailing part 
of the profile is too weak to see clearly, either in the pulse stack or the profile, but 
this strong leading/weak trailing behavior is seen in many conal quadruple pulsars.
Another issue is the unclear PPA traverse, but we guestimate the rate to be around 
+15\degr/\degr\ and model the geometry with a double cone {c\bf Q} configuration.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0658+0022}}: one can only guess that the pulsar has a core single 
{\bf S$_t$} configuration.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0711+0931}}: The pulsar shows a usual outer conal {\bf S$_d$} evolution and configuration.  Scattering may broaden the LOFAR profile slightly.  
%Haley: Fixed the incorrect value for the P-band width, Joanna.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0806+08}} has a double-cone structure and perhaps a weak core component, thus we model it. The PPA traverse seems to have the usual shallow edges and steep center, so we assume a highly central sightline traverse.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0815+0939}}: This pulsar became well known as the first four-component pulsar.  The double-cone model seems fairly successful here, and at 149 MHz we see that as usual the outer conal components are stronger than the inner conal ones. The conal quadruple c{\bf Q} classification seems inescapable here, however not without some problems:  the inner cone dimensions seem to vary substantially and other issues are discussed in \citet{teixeira}.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0843+0719}}: The pulsar seems to have a steep spectrum, so our several 1.4-GHz observations were all non-detections, but fortunately \citet{Burgay+06} provide a total power profile of about the same width as ours at 327 MHz.  The three features are clearly seen at 149 MHz as shown in Fig.~\ref{figA106}.  The PPA rate is very well defined, but no $\dot P$ has been measured. We thus model it with an inner conal single geometry.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0928+0614}}: Another pulsar with a steep spectrum, so there is little information in the 1.4-GHz profile.  Our two 328-MHz profiles show a complex structure with a central feature that seems to be labeled by $V$ in the core manner as well as features what could represent two cones (although no clear trailing inner cone feature is seen, but it is often conflated with the outer one).  The PPA rate is also uncertain but an estimate is possible.  We thus model the lower frequency profile asperationally as potentially having an {\bf M} configuration and assume that the high frequency geometry is similar.  The inner cone dimension is only a guess.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0943+2253}}: Noting \citet{brinkman_freire_rankin_stovall}'s {\bf D/T?} classification, this pulsar seems to have several conflated features at all three frequencies; see Fig.~\ref{figA106}.  We now see that its emission consists of bursts of several hundred pulses interspursed by nulls that can persist for similar intervals.  Fluctuation spectra within the bursts reveal a deep nearly odd-even (1.97 $P$) stationary modulation.  We thus model it as a conal triple c{\bf T}, and this structure is easiest to see at 327 MHz.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

At higher frequencies, the components seem to merge with the middle component remaining the strongest.  While the fluctuation spectra give no guidance, the structure seems to be that of a conal triple c{\bf T} profile.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1022+1001}}: This 16-ms pulsar seems to have a core-cone triple {\bf T} configuration in our profiles.  The central components have widths compatible with an orthogonal geometry---but narrow substantially at 4.9 GHz \citep{kkwj98}---and the conal widths, though difficult to measure accurately, show a consistent inner conal behavior.  The PPA rate is difficult to interpret and measure as different tracks are seen at different frequencies (see also the other polarimetry in \citep{xilouris98,stairs99,Dai2015}; however, a rate around +2\degr/\degr\ is compatible with an inner cone.  No core is discernible at 149 MHz or below, but the LWA profiles \citep{KTSD23} trace the overall width and onset of scattering at 35 MHz. The $t_{scatt}$ value seems much larger than the pulsar experiences.  The profile asymmetry could be the result of aberration/retardation.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1046+0304}}: The pulsar shows weak emission over much of its rotation cycle especially at the lower frequency.  Our poor 1.4-GHz profile seems to confirm the double form of the main feature but not the weaker possible postcursor seen in the \citet{Burgay+06} image.  Several 327-MHz observations show two broad dissimilar features, and we are at a loss about how these correspond to the 1.4-GHz profiles---and there is no reliable PPA signature to go on.  The pulsar needs further study before any model can be attempted.  
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1147+0829}}: The 1.4-GHz profiles are of poor quality but have about the same narrow widths as the lower frequency one, where the PPA rate can also be estimated.  All show some evidence of bifurcation.  We model the profiles using an inner conal single/double beam.

Single pulses show what appear to be weak drift bands with a $P_3$ of some 16 $P$.  We model it using a conal triple c{\bf T} beam geometry.   We see no evidence of scattering at the lowest frequencies.  The pulsar is detected at both 111 MHz \citep{prao} and 20/25 MHz \citep{ZVKU13} but no measurements are possible.

However, the 1.4-GHz profile has a triple structure as may the 327-MHz one as well. Fluctuation spectra show a 12-$P$ amplitude modulations, so we again find that a conal triple c{\bf T} beam model is most appropriate.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

The pulse sequences are modulated with an 11.6-$P$ period as shown in Fig.~\ref{figA109} and an apparently non-commensurate modulation at 3.8 $P$ is also seen.  This overall structure is seen in many conal quadruple c{\bf Q} profiles and we thus model it as such.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  It is also detected in three LWA bands \citep{KTSD23} but the profiles are too narrow to reflect the full profile structure, so we cannot know just what survives.

No doubt that the pulsar has a conal triple configuration, given the strong, regular drifting subpulses shown in Fig.~\ref{figA110}.  The pulsar is strongly detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} and the width seems compatible with those at higher frequency.

Therefore, we model it with a nominal conal double {\bf D} geometry.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao}, but not in a manner that the width can be determined.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1549+2113}}: Throughout the three bands, only one component is present in this pulsar's profile, so we model it as an inner conal single profile.  Scattering seems to have little effect.  The PPA rate, and thus $\alpha$ is poorly determined.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1612+2008}}: The LOFAR profile of this pulsar has two components with the trailing stronger than the leading; see Fig.~\ref{figA111}.  As frequency increases, the strength of the leading component weakens.  We see a hint of a central component with a roughly 4\degr\ width at 1.4 GHz.   We thus model it as a triple {\bf T} profile.  The inner cone geometry requires an $\alpha$ of 90\degr, and the above core width is compatible with this geometry.  The model shows some inner cone increase with wavelength and little effect of scattering.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1627+1419}}: This pulsar's profile shows three or four barely resolved components both in the AO and LOFAR profiles.  The structure suggests a c{\bf T} or c{\bf Q} classification, and we model it as such.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  Scattering may slightly broaden the LOFAR profile.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1645+1012}}: At LOFAR frequencies, two merged components are present in this pulsar, the leading slightly stronger than the trailing; as frequency increases, the leading component becomes ever less prominent.  We model this as an inner cone double {\bf D} profile, despite the poorly determined PPA rate.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  Scattering gradually broadens the profiles in the LWA observations down \citep{KTSD23} to 50 MHz.

It appears compatible with an inner conal single {\bf S$_d$} evolution, and we model it as such.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  Effects of scattering seem to be minimal.

This seems to reflect a conal quadruple c{\bf Q} geometry, and we model it as such; however, the inner conal dimensions are poorly determined.

See also \citet{kkwj98} and \citet{Dai2015}.

Like this pulsar the central core component is weak and conflated with the inner conal features, and the PPAs indicate a highly central sightline traverse. A plot showing fitted Gaussian components at 149 MHz is given in Fig.~\ref{figA113}.  We model it as a double cone {\bf M} structure, but the inner conal dimensions are estimates.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1739+0612}}: the four ``components" of linear polarization at 1.4 GHz are suggestive of a conal quadruple {c\bf Q} configuration, and the quantitative geometry seems to bear this out.  Moreover, we see an 11-$P$ fluctuation feature in the single pulses again indicating that the emission we see is conal.  The \citet{ATNF} 692-MHz profile, though noisy, may have a similar structure, though only guesses at the widths are possible.  In any case, we model it.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1741+2758}}: Three components over our full frequency range in this pulsar, and its single pulses seem to show little regularity.  The middle component seems to be a core feature, and its width at just over 2\degr\ gives an orthogonal geometry and a core/outer conal structure.  The beams show little growth at low frequency as can be seen at 111 MHz \citep{prao}; however, the Kharkiv 20/25-MHz profile \citep{ZVKU13} is clearly scattered. The evolution is seen in the LWA observations \citep{KTSD23} down to 50 MHz where the triple structure can be discerned.

Fluctuation spectra show features at some 5.3 and 32 $P$.  The inner cone seems discernible at 149 MHz, but its dimensions cannot be measured reliably.  We thus model the profiles as having a conal quadruple c{\bf Q} structure, and we note that any core would probably be missed in the resulting geometry because $\beta$ is larger than the core beam halfwidth.  We see no clear effect of scattering.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1746+2540}}: Though the pulsar's profile evolution from single at 1.4 GHz to double at the lower frequencies is usual in the conal single {\bf S$_d$} geometry, here the two lower frequency profiles have the same dimensions, so it seems that a part of the 1.4-GHz profile is missing, perhaps due to moding.  We have thus modeled the profile as an inner conal double.  Scattering seems minimal here.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1752+2359}}: This pulsar shows a single component with weak outriders and a flat PPA traverse. We thus model it as a core single {\bf S$_t$} profile.  However, the asymmetric core appears incomplete at both 1.4 GHz and 327 MHz, so we use the 149-MHz width that then squares with the usual inner cone geometry.  Other 327-MHz profiles show the trailing outrider better than this one with a poor baseline.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  Scattering seems to have a minimal effect.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1758+3030}}: A single component is seen at all frequencies.  We then model it as an inner conal single {\bf S$_d$} profile, although \citet{Weltevrede2007} found it has a flat (featureless) fluctuation spectrum.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.  The LWA profiles \citep{KTSD23} trace the profile width down to 35 MHz where scattering is clearly discernible. 
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1807+0756}}: The two somewhat broad profiles seem to show the usual conal evolution from single at high frequency to double at meter wavelengths---and the later is a little broader so we tilt to an outer conal geomettry.  Both profiles are so depolarized that no PPA traverse can be gleaned, but a guess of about 4\degr/\degr\ results in an appropriate grazing sightline geometry.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1811+0702}}: This pulsar has a closely-spaced, highly-polarized double profile at 1.4 GHz and a more separated one in Foster \etal's (\citeyear{foster}) 430-MHz profile.  The PPA rate is slight, implying a grazing sightline traverse, which here may miss the pulsar's core beam.  The single-peaked feature in MM10's profile is hard to interpret in terms of the double profile at higher frequencies.  Possibly only the trailing component is being seen at 102 MHz in that MM10's scattering values seems too small to produce a full conflation of the profile there.

\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1814+1130}}: The profile of this pulsar seems to have an inner conal single {\bf S$_d$} profile.  The LOFAR non-detection seems likely to have been the result of a usual level of scattering at 149 MHz.

The pulsar exhibits two modes, one of which illuminates only the leading components, thus the third component is often missing in its profiles; however, it is quite clearly visible in the LOFAR observations; see Fig.~\ref{figA113}.  Scattering may have some effect at 149 MHz.

The central component is always conflated, but its width at 327 MHz must be about 5\degr.  The value is too wide for a core but comfortable for an inner cone.  We therefore model the pulsar as a conal triple c{\bf T} structure.  Scattering seems to have little effect at 149 MHz.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1822+0705}}: PSR J1822+0705 seems to have an inner conal double {\bf D} profile.  However, the magnetic geometry is poorly determined because the PPA rate is ambiguous.  We model the pulsar with a positive rate and use \citet{foster}'s 430-MHz profile.  MM10's 102-MHz detection seems compatible with the two other observations, and the scattering seems to be only a few degrees. 
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1828+1359}}: An outer conal single profile is seen in this pulsar.  The LOFAR non-detection at 149 MHz could either be due to larger than average scattering or poor S/N.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1829+0000}}: despite this pulsar's wide profile, our timing seems adequate, and indeed the discovery profile \citet{lorimer2006} seems quite similar.  Its fluctuation spectra are featureless, so we tilt to modeling it as a core-single profile.  The poor \citet{mcewen} 350-MHz profile is narrower than the high frequency one, which also shows structure that can be interpreted as a core and outrider pair.  If the core width is a plausible 11-12\degr, and we interpret the PPA traverse as a central one, the overall width of the outrider pair is some 40\degr, and a core/inner conal {\bf S$_t$} results quantitatively.    
%Joanna, Han et al?

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1837+1221}}: This pulsar is most likely an inner cone double {\bf D}.  There is little linear polarization but the $R$ value seen at 327 MHz is supported by the 21-cms profile by \cite{JK18}.  As shown in the model plot, scattering is very likely to have quenched the profile at 149 MHz, making the LOFAR detection impossible.
\vskip 0.1in

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1837--0045}}: Our two 1.4-GHz profiles are tripartite with an unusually pointed central component and broad wings, and its single pulses show that it is dominated by a small number of very bright narrow subpulses; whereas the lower frequency profile shows a broad Gaussian form.  The PPA rate is unclear, a --6\degr/\degr\ value can be estimated from one of the higher frequency profiles, where the lower frequency suggests about half this.  Even using the steeper rate, the ``pointy'' putative central core features with widths of some 4\degr\ do not seem to measure $\alpha$ accurately.  We conjecture that these are incomplete and model the geometry with a 7\degr\ ``complete?'' (polarcap) width. The \citet{mcewen} 350-MHz halfwidth value is twice as large as our 1.4-GHz values, so we could also interpolate them to a 7\degr\ 1-GHz width.  Then, if the flared edges of the profile are conflated conal outriders, we can compute that they have about the right dimensions to represent an inner cone.  Our fluctuation spectra show ``red noise''  which also supports our interpretation of a core-single {\bf S$_t$} beam geometry.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1838+1650}}: Two prominent components are seen in this pulsar at 149 and 327 MHz and a single one at 1.4 GHz.  This is a usual outer conal single {\bf S$_d$} evolution, and we model it as such.  Scattering seems to have little effect at 149 MHz.  The pulsar is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

Our harmonic resolved fluctuation spectrum shows both a near odd-even response and its stronger harmonic; see Figure~\ref{figA115}.  This response is very similar to what is seen in pulsar B0943+10 \citep{deshpande} and begs to be followed up.  The single spike in the LOFAR 149-MHz profile could then be a marginal detection.

The disordered PPA traverse and significant Stokes $V$ suggests that this is a core component.  No spindown value has been measured for this pulsar, so we know nothing of the magnetic field strength, age or $\dot E$.  The pulsar was found at 1.4 GHz at a declination of 30\degr\ 56', and the AO feed has a beam size of about 3.5', so the improved declination error is about $\pm$2'.

This structure seems clearest in the 327-MHz profile, but the 1.4-GHz profile then seems incompatible.   Strangely the components are broader at 1.4 GHz, and this does not appear to be a timing issue.  If this model is correct, the core width shows a highly unusual behavior.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1903+2225}}: The pulsar has an asymmetric single profile at 1.4 GHz that evolves into a double form at 327 MHz, with the leading feature much weaker than the trailing one.  There is a hint of this leading feature at 1.4 GHz as well as in \citet{han2009} at 774 MHz, and this total width is roughly that at 327 MHz.  On this basis we model the profiles as an {\bf S$_d$} or {\bf D}, but more sensitive profiles are needed to confirm this interpretation.  Scattering may well account for the LOFAR non-detection at 149 MHz.

Scattering could contribute to the increased widths of the LOFAR profiles.

And at decameter wavelengths it has been detected at 20/25 MHz \citet{ZVKU13}.  The 1.5-GHz profile seems to have 4 features, but none of the observations are polarimetric, so no interpretation is possible.

Using the patch of significant linear at L-band to estimate $R$, the outer conal single {\bf S$_d$} solution shows a small increase of $\rho$ with wavelength.  A high quality 430-MHz profile \citep{camilo_nice} shows a clear central component, so it is possible that a conal triple c{\bf T} model would be more correct, but our observations fail to show this structure clearly enough.  Scattering seems unimportant at 149 MHz.

We then model it as an inner conal single {\bf S$_d$} profile.  The conal radii increase somewhat with wavelength, and here an outer cone is impossible because the inner one requires an $\alpha$ of 90\degr.  A nearly odd-even drift fluctuation feature in our 327-MHz observation confirms the conal character of the emission.  Scattering seems to have little effect on the LOFAR profiles.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1914+0219}} is probably a core-cone triple where the core is conflated with the conal components.  The PPA rate is well defined so we model it as a core/inner conal triple.  The \citet{mcewen} 350-MHz profile is useless due to poor resolution.  The putative width of the core is about 6\degr\ which squares well with the above.  An outer conal model would require a core width of some 4\degr, and this seems too narrow.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1915+0227}} seems to reflect a conal beam as 7.8-$P$ amplitude modulation is seen in the single pulses.  We model the geometry using an inner cone because the \citet{mcewen} poorly resolved 350-MHz profile indicated little growth with wavelength.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1915+0738}}: The two profiles have about the same widths but are asymmetric with a fast rise and slower falloff.  Its profiles almost look scattered, but the pulsar's small dispersion and \citet{camilo_nice} 430-MHz observation that shows a similar form and width make this unlikely.  One of the profiles also has a very flat PPA traverse.  Overall, the profiles appear to represent the leading portions of a conal double pair, but possible features trailing by 90\degr\ or more are too weak to interpret reliably.  It emits in clumps of a few to perhaps 20 pulses, at times alternating between emission in the leading and trailing parts of the profile.  Occasional drift bands may also be seen.   However, it is the flat PPA traverse that prevents modeling.

The only available observations are those of \citet{Janssen09} and are not polarimetric (Fig.~\ref{figA117a}). Most probably the pulsar has a conal double geometry with perhaps a hint of scattering at the lowest frequency---but without polarimetry no model is possible.

The triple profile structure is reiterated in \citet{han2009} and \citet{camilo_nice}.  An average scattering level at 149 MHz probably explains the LOFAR nondetection.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1957+2831}}: This energetic pulsar might well have a core component given the $V$ signature, but the apparent shallow PPA traverse suggests that the sightline might miss it.  We have tried to model the profile with a number of double-cone/core configurations, and none seem satisfactory.   The \citet{han2009} 774-MHz profile is similar to ours and seems to have 4 or 5 features, whereas the 350-MHz \citet{mcewen} profile may be single.  Another approach would be to interpret the five features as a core/double-cone beam configuration.  The core width could be close to the the 4.4\degr\ polar cap diameter as the 350-MHz latter profile suggests.  This produces the usual conal widths if $\beta$ is some 5/degr\ which in turn requires an 11\degr/degr\ PPA rate; however, this seems incompatible with the profiles that \textit{might} have a rate as low as 4\degr/\degr.  This is an interesting pulsar that would reward more investigation.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J1959+3620}}: The broad 1.4-GHz profile shows hints of a triple structure in the polarization; but the profile's quality does not facilitate pursuing this interpretation.  The \citet{barr} 21-cm profile seems to have a similar form and width, so we model it using a conal double {\bf D} geometry.  The pulsar was not detected by LOFAR at 149 MHz, and scattering may be an important reason.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J2002+1637}}: seems to have a triple {\bf T} profile, comprised of the central component and weaker conal features on its edges.  This said, the core widths in our profiles are too narrow to support this interpretation; however, the higher quality 430-MHz \citep{camilo_nice} shows a core width of 10.5\degr, the core in our profiles may be partial as is suggested particularly at 327 MHz.    Scattering at the average level seems to have little effect on the 149-MHz observation.

The outer conal dimensions are easily measured at all three frequencies, and the inner ones as well at the upper two bands.  The problem is that the PPA traverse gives little useful information.  For the double cone geometry model to be satisfactory an $R$ value of about 6\degr/\degr\ is required, and fortunately the \citet{han2009}'s 774-MHz profile confirms this.  Scattering seems minimal at 149 MHz.

The PPA traverse is steep, and the core width can be estimated at about 4\degr---the linear peak has about this width.  This implies an inner cone geometry, and there is no solution for an outer conal one with the observed PPA rate.

As 327 MHz there appears to be a bifurcated trailing component and a hint of bifurcation in the leading one with a further feature in between.  These five features can be interpreted as two cones and possibly a core.  The dimensions of this outer and inner cone can be estimated, and a satisfactory model results for an $\alpha$ of some 22\degr.  This implies a core width of about 7\degr, and the putative core seems to have this width.  At L-band, the inner and outer conal features merge into a double form, and the core all but disappears. A compatible structure can also be discerned at 149 MHz, but no inner cone width can be estimated.

%Haley, the geometry seems to work for this to be a core single.  So let us interpret it as mostly conal at L-band with a bright leading outrider and a weak trailing one (and the core so conflated as to be imperceptible.  The three components at P-band are clearer, and we can estimate the core width using twice the trailing half power point.  Then the LOFAR profile seems triple with a central core and visible outriders on both sides from which a 3db width can be estimated.

However, our 327-MHz observation has such a different shape that one wonders if it can be reconciled with the others.  Overall, this is a usual conal single evolution.  The steep PPA rate at P-band strongly suggests an OPM transition, and if so $R$ would be much flatter.   Were $R$ about --4\degr/\degr\ $\alpha$ would be about 30\degr, $\beta/\rho$ grazing at L-band, and perhaps enough less at lower frequencies to account for the increasing resolution of the components.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J2253+1516}}: Over the spectrum, this pulsar's profile has two well resolved components, the leading stronger than the latter.  We model it with an inner cone {\bf D} geometry.  Scattering at the 10X average level does no seem to affect the LOFAR profile.  A double form is detected at 111 MHz \citep{prao} but no measurements are possible.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J2307+2225}}: The rough single profile of this pulsar and its flat PPA traverse (also seen in \citet{han2009} at 774 MHz) make this pulsar's geometry difficult to model.  It seems to have two conal components with the second one weak over the entire band.  However, the LOFAR profile's poor S/N makes identification of the trailing component difficult. This double interpretation---together with assuming a central sightline traverse---provides a means of computing a model.  Scattering, even at the 10X average level, does not affect the LOFAR profile.  The pulsar is detected at 20/25 MHz \citep{ZVKU13}, but no measurements are possible.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{J2355+2246}}: The pulsar seems to have a steep spectrum and was detected in only a single 86-MHz band at 1420 MHz, showing a single form and a hint of a shallow PPA rate.  The 327-MHz profile is more complex with perhaps two conflated features---and thus similar to many conal single profiles.  While the PPA rate is poorly determined, we model the pulsar using an inner cone {\bf S$_d$} geometry.

Plotted values represent the \textit{scaled} inner (blue) and outer (cyan) conal beam radii and the core angular diameter (red), respectively, and are logarithmic on both axes (see text). The nominal values of the three beam dimensions at 1 GHz are shown in each plot by a small triangle. The yellow hatching indicates an average scattering level (with an orange 10X line), and the orange hatching indicates measured scattering times (both where applicable). The top panel in each of the average profiles (second two rows) is the average profile, with the solid line (black) showing the total intensity, the dashed line (green) showing the linear polarization, and dotted (red) line showing the circular polarization.

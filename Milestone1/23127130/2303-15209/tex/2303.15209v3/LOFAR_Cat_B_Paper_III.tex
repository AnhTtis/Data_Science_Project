% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This paper continues our study of radio pulsar emission-beam configurations with the primary intent of extending study to the lowest possible frequencies. Here we focus on a group of 133 more recently discovered pulsars, most of which were included in the (100-200 MHz) LOFAR High Band Survey, observed with Arecibo at 1.4 GHz and 327 MHz, and some observed at decameter wavelengths.  Our analysis framework is the core/double-cone beam model, and we took opportunity to apply it as widely as possible, both conceptually and quantitatively, while highlighting situations where modeling is difficult, or where its premises may be violated.  In the great majority of pulsars, beam forms consistent with the core/double-cone model were identified.  Moreover, we found that each pulsar's beam structure remained largely constant over the frequency range available; where profile variations were observed, they were attributable to different component spectra and in some instances to varying conal beam sizes.  As an Arecibo population, many or most of the objects tend to fall in the Galactic anticenter region and/or at high Galactic latitudes, so overall it includes a number of nearer, older pulsars.  We found a number of interesting or unusual characteristics in some of the pulsars that would benefit from additional study.  The scattering levels encountered for this group are low to moderate, apart from a few pulsars lying in directions more toward the inner Galaxy.

\section{Introduction}
The narrow emission beams of radio pulsars provide particular challenges because each shines toward the Earth only owing to a pulsar's accidental alignment.  Therefore, there is typically no direct means of discerning just what portion of the entire beam our sightline encounters.  Multiple efforts to understand pulsar beamforms began shortly after the discovery of pulsars, and this history is reviewed in recent publications by both \citet{paperI} and \citet{paperII}. Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding of pulsar beamforms has remained elusive, but crucial to comprehending the physical mechanisms of pulsar dynamics and emission.

In what follows we provide analyses intended to assess the efficacy of the core/double-cone beam model at frequencies down to the 100-MHz band, largely completing our efforts to study the population of Arecibo pulsars (declinations between about --1.\degr\ and 38\degr) surveyed using the LOFAR telescope's High Band by \citet{bilous2016}. Groups of Arecibo ``B'' pulsars were analysed in \citet[Paper I]{paperI} and \citet[Paper II]{paperII} using 1.4-GHz and 327-MHz observations, and this work similarly treats a remaining population of more recently discovered ``J'' objects.  Our overarching goal in these works is to identify the physical implications of pulsar beamform variations with radio frequency.    

The Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory (PRAO) has long pioneered 103/111-MHz studies of pulsar emission using their Large Phased Array (LPA).  Surveys by \citet[hereafter KL99]{kuzmin1999} and \citet[MM10]{malov2010} have provided a foundation for our overall work.  More recently, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in the Netherlands has produced an abundance of high-quality profiles with their High Band Survey \citep[hereafter BKK+, PHS+]{bilous2016, pilia2016} in the 100-200 MHz band as well as others in their Low Band \citep{Kondratiev16,bilous2019,Bondonneau}.  In addition decametric observations are available from the Kharkiv Array \citep{ZVKU13,KZUS22} as well as from the Long Wavelenth Array \citep{KTSD23}.

A radio pulsar emission-beam model with a central ``core'' pencil beam and two concentric conal beams has proven useful and largely successful both qualitatively and quantitatively in efforts to model the beam geometry at frequencies around 1 GHz \citep{rankin93} and its appendix \citep{rankin93b}, (together hereafter ET VI); see \S\ref{sec:ccbeams} below.  Few attempts, however, have been made to explore the systematics of pulsar beam geometry over the entire radio spectrum\footnote{\citet{Olszanski2019} studied the beam geometries of a group of Arecibo pulsars at 4.5 GHz}.  Here, we present analyses aimed at elucidating the multiband beam geometry of a brighter group of ``J'' pulsars within the Arecibo sky, most of which with observations down to the 100-MHz band.

%\tim{I think this section would benefit from a paragraph or so on the history of the sources. When and what surveys roughly they were discovered in, a rough history of observation -- i.e were they mostly l-band discoveries? I think this is useful in understanding the background of this subpopulation and how it's different from B pulsars to the reader}

In this work, \S\ref{sec:obs} describes the Arecibo observations, \S\ref{sec:ccbeams} reviews the geometry and theory of core and conal beams, \S\ref{sec:models} describes how our beaming models are computed and displayed,  \S\ref{sec:scattering} discusses scattering and its effects at low frequencies, \S\ref{sec:discussion} the overall analysis and conclusions, and \S\ref{sec:summary} gives a short summary. The main text of the paper reviews our analysis while the tables, model plots, and notes are given in the Appendix.  In this Appendix, we discuss the interpretation and beam geometry of each pulsar, and Figures~\ref{figA102}--\ref{figA120} show the results of analyses clarifying the beam configurations.  Figs.~\ref{figA1}--\ref{figA40} then give the beam-model plots (Fig. 1 provides an example) and (mostly) Arecibo profiles on which they are based.  The supplementary material provides the Appendix and ascii versions of the three tables.



\section{Observations}\label{sec:obs}
We present observations carried out using the upgraded Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico with its Gregorian feed system, 327-MHz (``P-band") or 1100-1700-MHz (``L-band") receivers, and either the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processors (WAPPs) or Mock spectrometer backends.  At P-band four 12.5-MHz bands were used across the 50 MHz available.  Four nominally 100-MHz bands centered at 1170, 1420, 1520  and 1620 MHz were used at L-band, and the lower three were usually free enough of radio frequency interference (RFI) such that they could be added together to give about 300-MHz bandwidth nominally at 1400 MHz.  The four Stokes parameters were calibrated from the auto- and cross-voltage correlations computed by the spectrometers, corrected for interstellar Faraday rotation, various instrumental polarization effects, and dispersion.  The resolutions of the observations are usually about a milliperiod as indicated by the sample numbers in Table~A1.  For the lower frequency observations, please consult the paper of origin as referenced in this table.  

Where our Arecibo observations were poor or missing we made use of other published compendia \citep{barr,foster,han2009,JK18,mcewen,sgg+95,Weltevrede2007} and other studies \citep{brinkman_freire_rankin_stovall,Janssen09,lorimer2006}.

The observations and geometrical models of the pulsars are presented in the tables and figures of the Appendix.  Table~A1 describes each pulsar's period, dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), and then gives the sources for the observations and measurements at each frequency (see the sample below in Table~\ref{tab1}).  Table~A2 gives the physical parameters of each pulsar, its period and spindown rate, energy loss rate, spindown age, surface magnetic field, the acceleration parameter {$B_{12}/P^2$} and the reciprocal of \citet{pulsar_magnetosphere_book}'s $Q$ parameter (1/Q=$0.5\ \dot P_{-15}^{0.4} P^{-1.1}$) as in Papers I and II. The Gaussian fits use Michael Kramer's bfit code \citep{kramer+94,kramer94}.  The geometrical models are given in Table~A3 as will be described below.  Plots then follow showing the behavior of the geometrical model over the frequency interval for which observations are available, as well as Arecibo polarized average profiles where available.



\section{Core and Conal Beams}
\label{sec:ccbeams}
A full recent discussion of the core/double-cone beam model and its use in computing geometric beam models is given in \citet{paperIV}.

Canonical pulsar average profiles are observed to have up to five components \citep{rankin1983a}, leading to the conception of the core/double-cone beam model \citep{backer}. Pulsar profiles then divide into two families depending on whether core or conal emission is dominant at about 1 GHz.  Core single {\textbf S$_{t}$} profiles consist of an isolated core component, often flanked by a pair of outriding conal components at high frequency, triple {\textbf T} profiles show a core and conal component pair over a wide band, or five-component {\textbf M} profiles have a central core component flanked by both an inner and outer pair of conal components. 

By contrast, conal profiles can be single {\textbf S$_{d}$} or double {\textbf D} when a single cone is involved, or triple c{\textbf T} or quadruple c{\textbf Q} when the sightline encounters both conal beams. Outer cones tend to have an increasing radius with wavelength, while inner cones tend to show little spectral variation.  Periodic modulation often associated with subpulse ``drift'' is a usual property of conal emission and assists in defining a pulsar's beam configuration \citep[\eg][]{et3}. 

Profile classes tend to evolve with frequency in  characteristic ways:  {\textbf S$_{t}$} profiles often show conal outriders at high frequency, whereas {\textbf S$_{d}$} profiles often broaden and bifurcate at low frequency.  {\textbf T} profiles tend to show their three components over a broad band, but their relative intensities can change greatly.  {\textbf M} profiles usually show their five components most clearly at meter wavelengths, while at high frequency they become conflated into a ``boxy'' form, and at low frequency they become triple because the inner cone often weakens relative to the outer one.

Application of spherical geometry to the measured profile dimensions provides a means of computing the angular beam dimensions---resulting in a quantitative emission-beam model for a given pulsar.  Two key angles describing the geometry are the magnetic colatitude (angle between the rotation and magnetic axes) $\alpha$ and the sightline-circle radius (the angle between the rotation axis and the observer’s sightline) $\zeta$, where the sightline impact angle $\beta$ = $\zeta-\alpha$.\footnote{$\alpha$ values are defined between 0\degr\ and 90\degr, as $\alpha$ cannot be distinguished from 90\degr\ -- $\alpha$ in the parlance of \citet{everett}.}  The three beams are found to have particular angular dimensions at 1 GHz in terms of a pulsar's polar cap angular diameter, {$\Delta_{PC}$} = $2.45\degr P^{-1/2}$ \citep[ET IV]{rankin1990}.  The outside half-power radii of the inner and outer cones, {$\rho_{i}$} and {$\rho_{o}$} are $4.33\degr P^{-1/2}$ and $5.75\degr P^{-1/2}$ (ET VIb).  

$\alpha$ can be estimated from the core-component width when present, as its half-power width at 1 GHz, $W_{\rm core}$ has been shown to scale as {$\Delta_{\rm PC}/\sin\alpha$} (ET IV).  The sightline impact angle $\beta$ can then be estimated from the polarization position angle (PPA) sweep rate $R$ [=$|d\chi/d\varphi|$ = $\sin\alpha/\sin\beta$]. Conal beam radii can similarly be estimated from the outside half-power width of a conal component or conal component pair at 1 GHz $W_{\rm cone}$ together with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using eq.(4) in ET VIa:  
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
    \rho_{i,o} = \text{cos} ^{-1} [ \text{cos }\beta  - 2\text{sin }\alpha \text{ sin }\zeta \text{ sin }^{2} (W_{i,o}/4)]
\end{equation}
where $W_{i,o}$ is the total half-power width of the inner or outer conal component or pair measured in degrees longitude.  The characteristic height of the emission can then be computed assuming dipolarity using eq.(6). 

The outflowing plasma responsible for a pulsar's emission is partly or fully generated by a polar ``gap" \citep{ruderman}, just above the stellar surface.  \citet{Timokhin} find that this plasma is generated in one of two pair-formation-front (PFF) configurations:  for the younger, energetic part of the pulsar population, pairs are created at some 100 m above the polar cap in a central, uniform (1-D) gap potential---thus a 2-D PFF, but for older pulsars the PFF has a lower, annular shape extending up along the polar fluxtube, thus having a 3-D cup shape.  

An approximate boundary between the two PFF geometries is plotted on the $P$-$\dot P$ diagram of Fig~\ref{fig1}, so that the more energetic pulsars are to the top left and those less so at the bottom right.  Its dependence is $\dot P=$3.95$\times$$10^{-15}P^{11/4}$.  Pulsars with dominant core emission tend to lie to the upper left of the boundary, while the conal population falls to the lower right.  In the parlance of ET VI, the division corresponds to an acceleration potential parameter $B_{12}/P^2$ of about 2.5, which in turn represents an energy loss $\dot E$ of 10$^{32.5}$ ergs/s.  This delineation also squares well with \citet{Weltevrede2008}'s observation that high energy pulsars have distinct properties and \citet{basu2016}'s demonstration that conal drifting occurs only for pulsars with $\dot E$ less than about $10^{32}$ ergs/s.  %Table~\ref{tab2} gives the physical parameters that can be computed from the period $P$ and spindown $\dot P$, including the $\dot E$ and $B_{12}/P^2$ (see the sample below in Table 2). 
As previously mentioned, a sample of physical parameters is given in Table~\ref{tab2} and in full in Table~A2. 

%\tim{(It may be worth a note about microstructure. Recall, microstructure periodicity scales with the pulsar period. There would seem to be a correlation between microstructure, and core/cone dominated radiation. What are things that could/would be responsible for both those things? Changes in magnetic field topology.}

\section{Computation and Presentation of Geometric Models} 
\label{sec:models}
Two observational quantities underlie the computation of conal radii at each frequency and thus the beam model overall:  the conal component width(s) and the polarization position angle (PPA) sweep rate $R$; the former gives the angular size of the conal beam(s) while the latter gives the impact angle $\beta$ [=$\sin\alpha/R$] showing how the sightline crosses the beam(s).  Figures~\ref{figA1}--\ref{figA40} show our Arecibo (or other) profiles and Table~A1 describes them as well as referencing any 100-MHz band or below published profiles.  Following the analysis procedures of ET VI, we have measured outside conal half-power (3 db or FWHM) widths and half-power core widths wherever possible. The measurements are given in Table~A3 for the 1.4-GHz and 327-MHz bands and for the decametric regime.  

These provide the bases for computing geometrical beaming models for each pulsar, which are also shown in the above figures and Table~A3.  However, we do not plot these directly.  Rather we use the widths to model the core and conal beam geometry as above, but here emphasizing as low a frequency range as possible. The model results are given in Table~A3 for the 1-GHz and  decameter band regimes.  $W_{c}$,  $\alpha$, $R$ and $\beta$ are the 1-GHz core width, the magnetic colatitude, the PPA sweep rate and the sightline impact angle;  $W_i$, $W_o$ and $\rho_i$, $\rho_o$ are the respective inner and outer conal component widths and the respective beam radii, at 1 GHz, 327 MHz, and the lowest frequency values in the 100-MHz or below bands.  
%The $\alpha$ values are bolded in Table~A3 when they could be determined as above by comparing the core width at around 1 GHz with the 2.45\degr/$P^{1/2}$ dipolar angular diameter of the polar polar cap.

Core radiation is found empirically to have a bivariate Gaussian (von Mises) beamform such that its 1-GHz (and often invariant) width measures $\alpha$ but provides no sightline impact angle information. If a pulsar has a core component, we attempt to use its width at around 1-GHz to estimate the magnetic colatitude $\alpha$, and when this is possible the $\alpha$ value is bolded in Appendix Tables~A3 (see the sample below in Table~\ref{tab3}).  $\beta$ is then estimated from $\alpha$ and $R$ as above. The outside half-power (3 db) widths of conal components or pairs are measured, and the spherical geometry above then used to estimate the outside half-power conal beam radii.  Where $\alpha$ can be measured, the value is used, when not an $\alpha$ value is estimated by using the established conal radius or characteristic emission height for an inner or outer cone.  These conal radii and core widths are then computed for different frequencies wherever possible.  

We present our results in terms of the core and conal beam dimensions as a function of frequency.  The results of the model for each pulsar are then plotted in Figures~\ref{figA1} to \ref{figA40} (Fig 1 provides an example).  The plots are logarithmic on both axes, and labels are given only for values in orders of 1, 2 and 5. For each pulsar the plotted values represent the {\textit scaled} inner and outer conal beam radii and the core angular width, respectively.  The scaling plots each pulsar's beam dimensions as if it were an orthogonal rotator with a 1-sec rotation period---thus the conal beam radii are scaled by a factor of $\sqrt{P}$ and the core width (diameter) by $\sqrt{P}\sin{\alpha}$. This scaling then gives each pulsar the same expected model beam dimensions, so that similarities and differences can more readily be identified.  The scaled outer and inner conal radii are plotted with blue and cyan lines and the core diameter in red.  The nominal values of the three beam dimensions at 1 GHz are shown in each plot by a small triangle.  Please see the text and figures of \citet{paperI} or \citet{paperII} for a fuller explanation. 

Estimating and propagating the observational errors in the width values is very difficult.  Instead of quoting the individual measurement errors, we provide error bars reflecting the beam radii errors for a 10\% uncertainties in the conal width values, the PPA sweep rate, and the error in the scaled core width.  The conal error bars shown reflect the {\it rms} of the first two sources with the former indicated in the lower bar and the latter in the upper one.

\section{Low Frequency Scattering Effects}\label{sec:scattering}
Interpretation of pulsar profiles at lower frequencies requires us to assess how severely they might be distorted by scattering in the interstellar medium---and this is best done on the basis of scattering measurements \citep[\eg][]{kuzmin_LL2007}, however these are available for only a handful of the pulsars under study here.  These are shown on the model plots as double-hatched orange regions where the boundary reflects the scattering timescale at that frequency in rotational degrees. For pulsars having no scattering study, we use the mean scattering level \citep{kuzmin2001} determined from the dispersion measure (DM), though some pulsars have scattering levels up to about 10 times greater or smaller than the average level.  Our model plots show the average scattering level (where applicable) as yellow single hatching and with an orange line indicating ten times this value as a rough upper limit.


 

\section{Analysis and Discussion} 
\label{sec:discussion}
\noindent\textit{\textbf{Augmented LOFAR High Band Survey Population}}:  \citet{bilous2016} surveyed 194 pulsars at declinations greater than 8\degr\ and ecliptic latitudes $>$3\degr\ and provided good quality decametric profiles for many.  Here, as in Papers I and II we include only pulsars within the Arecibo sky, but Appendix A of \citet{paperIV} treats objects elsewhere.  Of the BKK+ population, about 30 lack useful parallel observations at higher frequencies, and unsurprisingly, some 38 were not detected in the 100-MHz band.  However, the remaining 164 provide total power profiles to compare with observations at higher frequencies.
%Paper I 46 total; BKK16 29; PHS16 27; KL99 27; MM10 6
%Paper II 44 total; BKK+ 15; PHS+ 11; KL99 7; MM10 29
%Paper III 86 total; KL99 0; BKK+ 75; PHS+ 4; MM10 4
%Paper IV ??? total; KL99 62; BKK+ 45; PHS+ 40; MM10 67
%       Far South Multiband  ~12
%Total BKK+ 164
These substantially augment the PRAO 111/103-MHz profiles published first by \citet{kuzmin1999} (96) and as improved by \citet{malov2010} (106) with a number of duplications---and \citet{pilia2016} have provided LOFAR High Band profiles on another 80 pulsars.  
    
In total then, we have some 100-MHZ-band information on 225 pulsars down to 8\degr\ declination and on 54 more down to the Arecibo southern limit of --1.5\degr.  In addition, we have information on another 133 down to the --35\degr\ declination limit of the Jodrell Bank telescope as well as about a dozen that have been observed down to 200 MHz in the far south \citep[see][]{paperIV}.  This is the overall population we study and interpret in this and the three previous publications.  

A $P$-$\dot P$ diagram showing the characteristics of the LOFAR High Band population (augmented by 54 Arecibo objects studied in Papers I and II as well as this paper) is given in Fig.~\ref{fig1}. Drawing on the above information, this population includes pulsars missed by LOFAR but accessible using Arecibo down to its southern declination limit.  

The above diagram is striking by its lack of energetic core-dominated pulsars (shown by red triangles) and relatively rich in conal pulsars of all varieties.  One can compare a similar diagram showing the full sky population of ``B'' pulsars \citep[fig. 4]{paperIV} where roughly equal numbers of core and conal dominated pulsars are seen.

Clearly the core-emission dominated energetic objects lie both closer to the Galactic plane and Galactic Center than their less energetic conal cousins.}  
\label{fig2}

\end{figure}


\noindent\textit{\textbf{1-GHz Core/double-cone Modeling Results}}:  The 133 pulsars considered here show beam configurations across all of the core/double-cone model classes.  However, only about a dozen of this group have $\dot E$ values $\ge$ $10^{32.5}$ ergs/s and either core-cone triple \textbf{T} or core-single {\bf S$_t$} profiles.  The remainder tend to have profiles dominated by conal emission---that is, conal single \textbf{S$_d$}, double \textbf{D}, triple c\textbf{T}, or quadruple c\textbf{Q} geometries. Indeed, stars with c\textbf{T/Q} geometries are surprisingly abundant within this group, whether one or the other often very difficult to discern.  We were able to construct quantitative beam geometry models for almost all of the pulsars, though some are better established than others on the basis of the available information.  Lack of reliable PPA rate estimates was a limiting factor in a number of cases, either due to low fractional linear polarization or difficulty interpreting it.  Usually it was possible to trace a fixed number of profile components across the three bands, sometimes despite very different spectral behavior.  However, in a few cases the profiles were possibly dominated by different profile modes, and this may well account for our difficulties in identifying their beam configurations.  Conal profiles tend to show periodic modulation, so fluctuation spectral features can often be useful in identifying conal emission.

Core-emission-dominated pulsars tend to lie to the upper left of the \citet{Timokhin} boundary line, whereas those with mainly conal emission fall to the lower right (see text). Pulsars with core-cone triple {\textbf T} are distributed across both regions.  This population has a smaller proportion of energetic core-dominated pulsars (32\%) than seen in the sky overall.  Of particular interest are the two energetic pulsars that seem to be conal emitters, J0631+1036 and B1951+32.}
\label{fig1}

\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Emission Beam Evolution at Low Frequency}}:  A large fraction of the Augmented LOFAR High Band Survey pulsars 60\% (169) have been observed in the 100-200-MHz band, and scattering curtails detection of many in this regime.  Of these, a smaller number (64) have been observed in the decametric band below 100 MHz, and most of these lie in the Galactic anticenter direction. This population exhibits patterns of core and conal beam spectral evolution similar to those found earlier in other populations---
\begin{itemize}
\item Core beams are found to have angular sizes similar to those of a pulsar's polar cap.  These sizes tend to vary little with frequency, but the similarity is most marked around 1 GHz.  Scattering can broaden a core component's width at lower frequencies, whereas above 1 GHz conal power often seems to appear on the wings of core components.
\item Here again in this population we find that a few core beams narrow from their 1-GHz values in a mid-frequency range and sometime recover at lower frequencies.  The narrowing may represent the weakening or absence of half the component as if the differently polarized leading and trailing parts of the core have different spectra.  We saw earlier instances \citep[\eg]{paperIV} of these parts being displaced and partially resolved (\eg B1409--62), and in several cases (\eg B1046--58) the leading and trailing parts of the core have different amplitudes.   
\item Conal beams are found to assume their characteristic radii around 1 GHz when $\alpha$ is determined by a core component width.  Inner cones usually have fairly constant radii and outer ones often escalate with wavelength, but examples of inner conal growth with wavelength and outer conal constancy are also seen.  And we reemphasize that inner/outer cones can usually be distinguished in triple and five-component profiles where a core beam is present.  However, in a few cases outer cone models would require  $\alpha > 90\deg$, and thus an inner cone is indicated. 
\item Good examples of c\textbf{T} or c\textbf{Q} profiles then provide interesting opportunities to study the inner and outer cones in relation to each other.  In several cases neither cone shows much width increase with wavelength. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Galactic Distribution of LOFAR High Band Pulsars}}:  In an earlier paper \citep{paperIV} we considered the entire population of 487 ``B'' pulsars that represent surveys covering the entire sky, and its Fig.~2 shows the distribution centered on the Galactic Center direction with most pulsars lying close to the Galactic plane as expected.  

A similar distribution plot for the (augmented) LOFAR High Band Survey population is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}, and clearly a great deal of the sky was inaccessible to both the LOFAR and Arecibo instruments.  LOFAR was able to observe pulsars north of declination 8\degr\ (circles); whereas Arecibo was restricted to declinations between 37.5 and --1.5\degr.  Neither then had access to the rich southern Galactic plane or regions adjacent to the Galactic center.

Nonetheless, the \textit{rms} Galactic latitudes of this northern instrument population are not very different than those for core- and conal dominated pulsars over entire sky.  What is very different, however, is the proportion of core-dominated pulsars at only 32\% relative to about 50\% overall.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{New Decametric Population of Pulsars and RRATs}}:  In this work we have attempted to use meter- and decimeter- wavelength observations to better understand pulsar emission properties in the decameter band.  A possibility for taking the opposite approach seems to be emerging.  The second UTR-2 pulsar census recently published by \citet{KZUS22} provides a largely new population of pulsars detected at extremely low frequencies, a number of which have not been adequately studied at higher frequencies.  Moreover, the PRAO cite \citep{prao} lists several dozen new pulsars and RRATs, some of which have been timed well enough to have good positions.  Further, the LWA is coming into use and bridges these two regimes.  We have much to learn about objects that are strong enough to be discovered in the decameter band, some perhaps with steep spectra that preclude observation at higher frequencies.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Pulsars With Interesting Characteristics}}

\noindent{\textbf{J0245+1433}}:  The pulsar \citep{dsm+13} has a barely resolved double profile at 327 MHz that also exhibits strong antisymmetric circular polarization (Fig.~\ref{figA102}).  It is thus an unusual hybrid of core and conal properties, and observations over a broader band are needed to better understand it. 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0329+1654}} shows consistently poor profiles, probably due to its being a RRAT \citep{BT21}. 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0337+1715}}, the famous 2.7-ms MSP in a triple system \citep{Ransom_2014} seems to have a core/double-cone profile   \citep{Rankin_2017}. 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J0348+0432}} \citep{antoniadis,lynch2013} appears to be another MSP with a core-cone profile as many or most seem not to \citep[see][]{Rankin_2017}.  Further study in single pulses is needed to fully explore its different properties. 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J0538+2817}}:  We confirm the two modes of this pulsar at 1.4 GHz \citep{acj+96,vonHoensbroech1997}.  Moding is unusual in such an energetic pulsar, so further study is needed to try to understand what are the causes.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J0609+2130}} seems to be another MSP with a core-cone profile.  Detailed and sensitive single pulse study is needed to fully explore its characteristics.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J0628+0909}} is a RRAT \citep[see][]{McLaughlin06} that appears to have a core/cone profile.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J0815+0939}} is the well known four-component profile that seems to exhibit some bi-drifting \citep{teixeira}.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent\textit{\textbf{J0843+0719}} seems to have a steep spectrum, so our several 1.4-GHz observations were all non-detections.  While our 327-MHz profile is similar to that of \citet{Burgay+06} no observations seem to exist at lower frequencies.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1022+1001}} is a 16-ms MSP that again seems have a core/cone {\bf T} beam geometry \citep{xilouris98,kkwj98,stairs99,Dai2015} and can be detected down into the 100-MHz band.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1313+0931}} shows a probable conal quadruple profile with a strong 11.6-$P$ modulation; see Fig.~\ref{figA109}.  Such pulsars deserve further detailed study because their properties reflect the relationship of the inner and outer cones.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1404+1159}} exhibits at strong modulation of drifting subpulses with a 4.7-$P$ period; see  Fig.~\ref{figA110}.  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1649+2533}} seems to show both frequent nulls of a few pulses and a 2.5-$P$ modulation when emitting (Fig.~\ref{figA112}).  Can this be understood in terms of a carousel structure?  
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1720+2150}} has a clear five-component core/double-cone profile much like that of B1237+25---and shares some other properties as well.  Further detailed single-pulse study would be useful and rewarding. 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1819+1305}} is another excellent example of a conal quadruple profile, and it shows two modes \citep{RankinWright} in a manner similar to several other similar pulsars; see Fig.~\ref{figA113}.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1842+0257}} shows a complex mixture of organized 3-$P$ drifting and long nulls; see Fig.~\ref{figA114}.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1843+2024}}: The harmonic resolved fluctuation spectrum of this pulsar \citep{Champion2005} shows a bright narrow feature that is the harmonic of a weaker one (see Fig.~\ref{figA115}), reflecting a highly stable even-odd modulation as in pulsar B0943+10 \citep{deshpande}.  Could further study identify a carousel structure? 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J1908+0734}}: Strangely, no polarimetry has been published for this pulsar that is detectable from higher frequencies \citep{Bhat04,camilo_nice} down to 20/25 MHz \citep{ZVKU13}.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J2111+2106}}: This very slow pulsar shows surprising evidence of core emission in its otherwise conal profile.   
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent{\textbf{J2139+2242}} provides another fine example of a bright drifter with a conal quadruple profile (see Fig.~\ref{figA120}).  Detailed single pulse study will surely discover new effects and show the relationship between its two emission cones.
\vskip 0.1in


\noindent\textit{\textbf{Scattering Levels of LOFAR High Band Population}}: While rather few of the pulsars considered in this paper have measured scattering times, many more are available for the objects in Papers I. II and \citet{paperIV}.  From the perspective of northern instruments such as Arecibo, LOFAR or PRAO, a meaningful average scattering level can be computed as was done in \citet{kuzmin2001}.  However, for pulsars close to the Galactic Center direction, we saw in \citet[fig. 5]{paperIV} that scattering levels range over many orders of magnitude and no meaningful average can be obtained.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
We have analyzed the Arecibo 1.4-GHz and 327-MHz polarized profiles together with the available observations at lower (and occasionally higher) frequencies of 133 pulsars, most of which were included in the LOFAR High Band Survey \citep{bilous2016}.  This group of more recently discovered pulsars complements similar analyses of both the most studied pulsars within the Arecibo sky in Paper I, and a further group of less studied objects in Paper II, most of which appear in the LOFAR survey and thus have been observed down into the 100-MHz band or below by a variety of investigators.  A further large group of objects lying outside the Arecibo sky was similarly studied \citep{paperIV}, and a number of these are also included in the LOFAR High Band Survey.  These efforts then attempt to fully parallel the LOFAR High Band Survey with complementary observations at longer wavelengths wherever possible in order to study the frequency evolution of pulsar emission beams comprehensively.  

%Our analysis framework throughout is the core/double-cone beam model, and we took every opportunity apply it both conceptually and quantitatively but also to point out situations where the modeling is difficult or impossible.  Overall, quantitative core/double-cone models were applied successfully to most of the pulsars, limited by inadequate information in some cases and perplexing MSP profiles in a few others.  Beam structures at low frequency were found to be very largely consistent with those at 1 GHz and above.  

%As an Arecibo population, a great majority of the objects fell either in the Galactic anticenter region or at high Galactic latitudes, so most were nearer, older pulsars.  We found a number of interesting or unusual characteristics in some of the pulsars that would benefit from additional study.   Overall, few pulsars in this group have measured scattering levels, and most exhibited little scattering broadening in the lowest frequency profiles as estimated from a rough average scattering level for pulsars lying within this region of the sky.

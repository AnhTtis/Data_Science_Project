    "abstract": "We briefly review a number of major features of the approach to quantum measurement theory based on environment-induced decoherence of the measuring apparatus, and summarize our observations in the form of a couple of general principles that, unlike the wave function collapse hypothesis, emerge as ones consistent with the unitary Schrödinger evolution of wave functions. We conclude with a few observations of a philosophical nature, to the effect that that quantum theory does not purport to describe reality but constitutes an {\\it interpretation} of our phenomenal reality within a context -- one where the Planck scale is not crossed. Beyond the Planck scale, a radically new interpretation of reality is likely to emerge.",

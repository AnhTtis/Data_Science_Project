    "abstract": "The 2019/20 Black Summer bushfires in Australia demonstrated the brutal and disastrous consequences of changing the technological world without considering linkages with the biophysical, ecological or human worlds. An emerging more-than-human design philosophy encourages designers to consider such interrelations between humans and non-human entities. Yet, the design research community has focused on situated or embodied experiences for designers, rather than developing processes to legitimate the perspectives of non-human entities through participatory design. This paper explores how adopting the `intentional stance', a concept from philosophy, might provide a heuristic for more-than-human participatory design. Through experimentation with the intentional stance in the context of smart lighting systems, the paper demonstrates that the approach has potential for non-human entities from the ecological world, but less so for the biophysical world. The paper concludes by encouraging critique and evolution of the intentional stance, and of other approaches, to legitimate the perspectives of non-human entities in everyday design.",

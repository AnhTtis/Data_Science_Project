    "abstract": "We construct a functorial pushforward homomorphism in geometric Hodge filtered complex cobordism along proper holomorphic maps between arbitrary complex manifolds. This significantly improves previous results on such transfer maps and is a much stronger result than the ones known for differential cobordism of smooth manifolds. This enables us to define and provide a concrete geometric description of Hodge filtered fundamental classes for all proper holomorphic maps. Moreover, we give a geometric description of a cobordism analog of the Abel-Jacobi invariant for nullbordant maps which is mapped to the classical invariant under the Hodge filtered Thom morphism. For the latter we provide a new construction in terms of geometric cycles.",

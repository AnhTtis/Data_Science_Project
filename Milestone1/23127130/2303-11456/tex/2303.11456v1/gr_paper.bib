abstract = "A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology–from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids–can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via e-mail, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names—temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. This review covers different fields where temporal graphs are considered, but does not attempt to unify related terminology—rather, we want to make papers readable across disciplines."

abstract={Several observations indicate the existence of a latent hyperbolic space behind real networks that makes their structure very intuitive in the sense that the probability for a connection is decreasing with the hyperbolic distance between the nodes. A remarkable network model generating random graphs along this line is the popularity-similarity optimisation (PSO) model, offering a scale-free degree distribution, high clustering and the small-world property at the same time. These results provide a strong motivation for the development of hyperbolic embedding algorithms, that tackle the problem of finding the optimal hyperbolic coordinates of the nodes based on the network structure. A very promising recent approach for hyperbolic embedding is provided by the noncentered minimum curvilinear embedding (ncMCE) method, belonging to the family of coalescent embedding algorithms. This approach offers a high-quality embedding at a low running time. In the present work we propose a further optimisation of the angular coordinates in this framework that seems to reduce the logarithmic loss and increase the greedy routing score of the embedding compared to the original version, thereby adding an extra improvement to the quality of the inferred hyperbolic coordinates.},

abstract = "The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks."

Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of other groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an ill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions, which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem.

Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology.},

ABSTRACT = {High dimensional embeddings of graph data into hyperbolic space have recently been shown to have great value in encoding hierarchical structures, especially in the area of natural language processing, named entity recognition, and machine generation of ontologies. Given the striking success of these approaches, we extend the famous hyperbolic geometric random graph models of Krioukov et al. to arbitrary dimension, providing a detailed analysis of the degree distribution behavior of the model in an expanded portion of the parameter space, considering several regimes which have yet to be considered. Our analysis includes a study of the asymptotic correlations of degree in the network, revealing a non-trivial dependence on the dimension and power law exponent. These results pave the way to using hyperbolic geometric random graph models in high dimensional contexts, which may provide a new window into the internal states of network nodes, manifested only by their external interconnectivity.},

abstract={Physicists recently observed that realistic complex networks emerge as discrete samples from a continuous hyperbolic geometry enclosed in a circle: the radius represents the node centrality and the angular displacement between two nodes resembles their topological proximity. The hyperbolic circle aims to become a universal space of representation and analysis of many real networks. Yet, inferring the angular coordinates to map a real network back to its latent geometry remains a challenging inverse problem. Here, we show that intelligent machines for unsupervised recognition and visualization of similarities in big data can also infer the network angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model according to a geometrical organization that we term "angular coalescence." Based on this phenomenon, we propose a class of algorithms that offers fast and accurate "coalescent embedding" in the hyperbolic circle even for large networks. This computational solution to an inverse problem in physics of complex systems favors the application of network latent geometry techniques in disciplines dealing with big network data analysis including biology, medicine, and social science.},

Analysing artificial networks with patent geometry we discover that, different from current belief, hyperbolic networks do not show in general high GC and efficient greedy navigability (GN) with respect to the geodesics. The myopic transfer which rules GN works best only when degree-distribution power-law exponent is strictly close to two. Analysing real networks—whose geometry is often latent—GC overcomes GN as marker to differentiate phenotypical states in macroscale structural-MRI brain connectomes, suggesting connectomes might have a latent neurobiological geometry accounting for more information than the visible tridimensional Euclidean.}

abstract = {Networks are finite metric spaces, with distances defined by the shortest paths between nodes. However, this is not the only form of network geometry: two others are the geometry of latent spaces underlying many networks and the effective geometry induced by dynamical processes in networks. These three approaches to network geometry are intimately related, and all three of them have been found to be exceptionally efficient in discovering fractality, scale invariance, self-similarity and other forms of fundamental symmetries in networks. Network geometry is also of great use in a variety of practical applications, from understanding how the brain works to routing in the Internet. We review the most important theoretical and practical developments dealing with these approaches to network geometry and offer perspectives on future research directions and challenges in this frontier in the study of complexity},

However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems2. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks2,3,4,5, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

  abstract = "A representation and interpretation of the area under a receiver

              method, or by mathematical predictions based on patient
              characteristics, is presented. It is shown that in such a setting
              the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen
              diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater
              suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover,
              this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that
              is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon
              statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide
              rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of
              the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to
              accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in
              determining the size of the sample required to provide a
              sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine
              how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can
              statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic
              techniques.",

abstract = {Real networks often form interacting parts of larger and more complex systems. Examples can be found in different domains, ranging from the Internet to structural and functional brain networks. Here, we show that these multiplex systems are not random combinations of single network layers. Instead, they are organized in specific ways dictated by hidden geometric correlations between the layers. We find that these correlations are significant in different real multiplexes, and form a key framework for answering many important questions. Specifically, we show that these geometric correlations facilitate the definition and detection of multidimensional communities, which are sets of nodes that are simultaneously similar in multiple layers. They also enable accurate trans-layer link prediction, meaning that connections in one layer can be predicted by observing the hidden geometric space of another layer. And they allow efficient targeted navigation in the multilayer system using only local knowledge, outperforming navigation in the single layers only if the geometric correlations are sufficiently strong.},

    abstract = {Abstract Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) is used to precisely position core/thick-shell (“giant”) quantum dots (gQDs; ≥10 nm in diameter) exclusively on top of silicon nanodisk antennas (≈500 nm diameter pillars with a height of ≈200 nm), resulting in periodic arrays of hybrid nanostructures and demonstrating a facile integration strategy toward next-generation quantum light sources. A three-step reading-inking-writing approach is employed, where atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the pre-patterned substrate topography are used as maps to direct accurate placement of nanocrystals. The DPN “ink” comprises gQDs suspended in a non-aqueous carrier solvent, o-dichlorobenzene. Systematic analyses of factors influencing deposition rate for this non-conventional DPN ink are described for flat substrates and used to establish the conditions required to achieve small (sub-500 nm) feature sizes, namely: dwell time, ink-substrate contact angle and ink volume. Finally, it is shown that the rate of solvent transport controls the feature size in which gQDs are found on the substrate, but also that the number and consistency of nanocrystals deposited depends on the stability of the gQD suspension. Overall, the results lay the groundwork for expanded use of nanocrystal liquid inks and DPN for fabrication of multi-component nanostructures that are challenging to create using traditional lithographic techniques.},

    abstract = {In single particle spectroscopy, the degree of observed fluorescence anti-bunching in a second-order cross correlation experiment is indicative of its bi-exciton quantum yield and whether or not a particle is well isolated. Advances in quantum dot synthesis have produced single particles with bi-exciton quantum yields approaching unity. Consequently, this creates uncertainty as to whether a particle has a high bi-exciton quantum yield or if it exists as a cluster. We report on a time-gated anti-bunching technique capable of determining the relative contributions of both multi-exciton emission and clustering effects. In this way, we can now unambiguously determine if a particle is single. Additionally, this time-gated anti-bunching approach provides an accurate way for the determination of bi-exciton lifetime with minimal contribution from higher order multi-exciton states.},

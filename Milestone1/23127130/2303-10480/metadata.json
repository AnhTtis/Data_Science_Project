    "abstract": "Electron-positron pairs can be produced via the Schwinger mechanism in the presence of strong electric fields. In particular, the fields involved in $α$ decay and nuclear fission are strong enough to produce them. The energy of the $e^+e^-$ pair is related to the relative distance and velocity of the daughter nuclei. Thus, the energy distribution of the produced pairs can give information about the dynamics of the fission and $α$ decay processes. A neck model of nuclear fission is used to illustrate how the pairs can be used as a probe of the dynamics.",

\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose \projectname{}, a novel unknown word detecting method using the webcam for ESL learners. \projectname{} leverages the gaze data obtained from the webcam and introduces the transformer-based model to enhance the performance. \projectname{} can detect unknown words with the accuracy of 98.09\% and the F1-score of 75.73\%. We also conducted a user study to explore the design scope based on \projectname{}. The result shows that the design focus should be proper nouns, multi-meaning words, and long and complex sentences. Users show positive attitudes towards the design features based on unknown word detection. As the webcam becomes more ubiquitous with the prevalence of online working and studying, \projectname{} can enable a wide range of applications and benefit a large population of ESL learners in reading.

\begin{abstract}
%Identifying unknown words is the foundation of many reading applications that assist English as a Second Language (ESL) learners. 
Automatic unknown word detection techniques can enable new applications for assisting English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, thus improving their reading experiences. 
%Eye movement has a strong correlation with cognitive states in reading and the ubiquity of webcams shows the great potential of applying eye tracking in daily life. 
However, most modern unknown word detection methods require dedicated eye-tracking devices with high precision that are not easily accessible to end-users. 
In this work, we propose \projectname{}, an unknown word detection method only using a webcam. 
\projectname{} tracks the learner's gaze and then applies a transformer-based machine learning model that encodes the text information to locate the unknown word. 
We applied knowledge enhancement including term frequency, part of speech, and named entity recognition to improve the performance. 
The user study indicates that the accuracy and F1-score of our method were 98.09\% and 75.73\%, respectively. Lastly, we explored the design scope for ESL reading and discussed the findings. 
%We also explored the design space for ESL learners and proposed several potential applications.

%Eye movement can be used to predict users' reading states and predict unfamiliar words for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners to facilitate their reading. Webcam can track users' eye movement without additional costs. However, the low precision of eye tracking based on the webcam makes it difficult to extract valid eye movement features as proposed in infrared-based tracking. In this paper, we propose \projectname, integrating eye movement and language model to accurately predict unfamiliar words to facilitate ESL reading. \todo{We embed eye movement and text features by xxx and xxx them into a xxx model to predict unfamiliar words.} The accuracy and f1-score of our model are xxx and xxx, respectively. We also explore the design scope for ESL learners based on our model and proposed several potential applications.

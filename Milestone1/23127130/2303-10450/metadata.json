    "abstract": "Shock wave heating is a leading candidate for the mechanisms of chondrule formation. This mechanism forms chondrules when the shock velocity is in a certain range. If the shock velocity is lower than this range, dust particles smaller than chondrule precursors melt, while chondrule precursors do not. We focus on the low-velocity shock waves as the igneous rim accretion events. Using a semi-analytical treatment of the shock-wave heating model, we found that the accretion of molten dust particles occurs when they are supercooling. The accreted igneous rims have two layers, which are the layers of the accreted supercooled droplets and crystallized dust particles. We suggest that chondrules experience multiple rim-forming shock events.",

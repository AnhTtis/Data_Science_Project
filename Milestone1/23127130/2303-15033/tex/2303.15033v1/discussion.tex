threats to validity/limitations/validation vs. requirements for each workflow step

\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge base
\item Risk assessment
\begin{itemize}
    \item discuss why we analyze the vanilla version
    \item difficulties (i.e. why coarse attack steps = backward programming combinatorial explosion + no way to automatically model actual attack steps)
    \item validation vs. requirements
\end{itemize}
\item Asset protection: ref to analogous subsection in section IV
\item Asset hiding
\begin{itemize}
        \item excessive AH may decrease AP solution security level
        \item overhead
        \item AH refines a AP solution thus all AP difficulties also apply to AH
\end{itemize}

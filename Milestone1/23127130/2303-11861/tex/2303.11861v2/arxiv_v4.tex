		Primordial magnetic fields (PMF) can enhance baryon perturbations on scales below the photon mean free path. However, a magnetically driven baryon fluid becomes turbulent near recombination, thereby damping out baryon perturbations below the turbulence scale. In this letter, we show that the \pr{initial growth in baryon perturbations gravitationally induces growth in the dark matter perturbations}, which are unaffected by turbulence and eventually collapse to form $10^{-11}-10^3\ M_{\odot}$ dark matter minihalos. If the magnetic fields purportedly detected in the blazar observations are PMFs generated after inflation and have a Batchelor spectrum, then such PMFs \pr{could potentially} produce \pr{dark matter} minihalos.

	\noindent {\bf Introduction.}
	Magnetic fields are found to be ubiquitous in our observations of the universe. An intriguing possibility is that the observed cosmic magnetic fields are seeded by magnetic fields produced in the early universe, either during inflation or phase transition \cite{Vachaspati:2020blt,Subramanian:2015lua}. So far no direct evidence for the primordial nature of the magnetic fields has been obtained. However, the absence of GeV gamma-ray halos around TeV blazars might be a smoking gun signal for primordial magnetic fields \cite{doi:10.1126/science.1184192,HESS:2014kkl,Finke:2015ona,VERITAS:2017gkr, AlvesBatista:2021sln}. %More recently, it has been suggested that the discrepant measurement of $H_0$ from CMB and low redshift observations might be explained by primordial magnetic fields \cite{PhysRevLett.125.181302}.
	
	If magnetic fields have a primordial origin, then they tend to enhance baryon density perturbations after baryons decouple from photons in the early universe \cite{wasserman97,Kim:1994zh,Subramanian:1997gi,gopalsethi03,Jedamzik:2013gua}. This is because a stochastically distributed magnetic field has a compressible component of the Lorentz force acting on the baryon fluid. When baryons are strongly coupled with the photon bath, the relativistic photon pressure counteracts any growth in baryon density perturbations. But on scales below the photon mean free path, the baryon fluid is decoupled from the photon bath and the compressible Lorentz force can lead to the growth of baryon inhomogeneities.
	
	Earlier works that studied the impact of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) on the matter power spectrum focussed on length scales larger than the so called magnetic Jeans length and thereby focussed on structures bigger than $\sim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$  \cite{wasserman97,Kim:1994zh,gopalsethi03,Sethi:2004pe,Tashiro:2006,Schleicher:2008hc,sethi:2009,Shaw:2010ea,pandeysethi:2012,pandeysethi:2013,Chongchitnan:2013vpa,pandeysethi:2015,Minoda:2017iob,Sanati:2020,Katz:2021}. On scales smaller than the magnetic Jeans length, baryon perturbations tend to become non-linear prior to recombination \cite{Jedamzik:2013gua}. 
	%This fact has recently been utilized to alleviate the Hubble tension \cite{Jedamzik:2020krr}.
	However, the non-linearities in the baryon fluid eventually lead to turbulence at recombination and all signs of enhanced baryon density perturbations below the magnetic Jeans length are erased by today \cite{Jedamzik:2018itu,Trivedi:2018ejz}.
	
	In this letter, we show that even though the small-scale baryon density perturbations are erased, \pr{their growth history prior to recombination enhances the amplitude of dark matter (DM) density perturbations, solely through gravitational interactions}. Thus, searches for DM minihalos with masses smaller than $10^6 M_{\odot}$ can be used to probe PMFs.
	
	\noindent {\bf Magnetic fields in the photon drag regime.}  
	%
	We shall focus on scales smaller than the photon mean free path and on times before recombination. Moreover, we consider scales larger than 0.01 pc, where the baryon fluid can be approximated as a perfect fluid and a perfect conductor prior to recombination. Consequently, the motion of the baryon fluid under the influence of a PMF is given by \cite{Subramanian:1997gi}
	\begin{align}\label{eq:vb}
		\frac{\partial \vec{v}_b}{\partial t}+\left(H+\alpha\right)\vec{v}_b+\frac{c_b^2}{a}\nabla \delta_b&=\frac{\vec{L}_B}{a}-\frac{\nabla\phi}{a},
	\end{align}
	where $a$ is the scale factor, \pr{$t$ is the cosmic time,} $\vec{v}_b=ad\vec{x}_b/dt$ is the physical baryon velocity, $\delta=(\rho(x)-\bar{\rho})/\bar{\rho}$ is the fluid density perturbation, $\phi$ is the metric perturbation following the convention in \cite{Ma:1995ey}, $\alpha=4\rho_{\gamma}/(3\rho_bl_{\gamma})$ parametrizes the photon drag force with $l_{\gamma}$ being the photon mean free path, $\rho_{\gamma}$ is the photon energy density, $c_b^2$ is the baryon sound speed and parametrizes the baryon thermal pressure, $H$ is the Hubble rate, and $\vec{L}_B=(\nabla\times\vec{B})\times\vec{B}/[4\pi a^4\rho_b]$ is the Lorentz force with $\vec{B}=a^2\vec{B}_{\rm phys}$ being the comoving magnetic field and $\vec{B}_{\rm phys}$ being the physical magnetic field. The evolution of $B$ is determined by,
	\begin{align}\label{eq:induction}
		\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}&=\frac{1}{a}\nabla\times(\vec{v}_b\times \vec{B}).
	\end{align}
	We work in natural units where $\hbar=c=1$.
	
	In eq.~\eqref{eq:vb} we have ignored the contribution from convection, $(\vec{v}_b\cdot\nabla)\vec{v}_b/a$, because the viscous drag on baryons due to scattering with photons, $\alpha v_b$, is much larger than the convective term, \pr{or equivalently, the Reynolds number is much smaller than one} \cite{Banerjee:2004df}. One can verify this by using the fact that $\alpha$ is orders of magnitude larger than $H$ prior to recombination, $\alpha/H\sim 350 (a_{\rm rec}/a)^2$.
	%	Both eqs.~\eqref{eq:vb} and \eqref{eq:induction} assume ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, which is true for the length scales of our interest, $l>0.01$ pc \cite{Vachaspati:2020blt}.
	%	While the baryon Euler equation is linear, the PMF evolution equation, eq.~\eqref{eq:induction}, is non-linear and hence is hard to solve analytically. Fortunately, as we are primarily interested in the statistically averaged properties of PMFs, we can make further analytical progress.
	
	In this section, we are interested in computing the evolution of the PMF power spectrum, $P_B(k,t)$. \pr{For simplicity, we shall focus on non-helical PMFs, which have}
	\begin{align}\label{eq:def_M}
		\langle B_i(k) B^*_j(k')\rangle\!=\!\deltabar^3\!(k-k')\left(\delta_{ij}-\frac{k_ik_j}{k^2}\right)\frac{P_B(k)}{2},\!
	\end{align}
	where $B_i(k)=\int d^3x B_{i}(x) e^{ikx}$ and $\deltabar^3=(2\pi)^3\delta^3$ \pr{removed normalized delta}. With the above convention, PMF energy density is simply $\rho_B\equiv\langle B^2\rangle/[8\pi]=\int d\Pi_q P_B(q)/[8\pi]$, where $d\Pi_q=d^3q/(2\pi)^3$.
	
	Taking the time derivative of eq.~\eqref{eq:def_M} and replacing $\partial B/\partial t$ using eq.~\eqref{eq:induction} would yield the evolution equations for $P_B$. We can make further analytical progress by noting that in eq.~\eqref{eq:vb}, $(\alpha+H) v_b\gg \partial v_b/\partial t\sim Hv_b$ before recombination. Then if the Lorentz force dominates over thermal pressure and gravity, we have $a\vec{v}_b\approx \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$. Working in this large Lorentz force limit and neglecting non-Gaussianities in the distribution of $B$ (i.e. quasi-normal approximation), we obtain
	\begin{align}
		\frac{\partial P_B(k)}{\partial t}\!=&\frac{-4k^2P_B(k)}{3(\alpha+H)}\frac{\langle B^2\rangle}{4\pi\rho_{b}}.\!\label{eq:P_evolve}
	\end{align}
	\pr{Similar equation has been derived earlier for incompressible fluid in the viscous drag regime \cite{Campanelli:2013iaa} (for analytical treatments in the turbulence regime see for example Refs.~\cite{Campanelli:2007tc, Jedamzik:2010cy, Saveliev:2013uva}, and Ref.~\cite{Berger:2014wta} for analytical treatment of n-point correlations).}
	
	%To our knowledge, we are the first to provide a generic analytical solution for the evolution of $P_B$ with arbitrary helicity in the photon drag regime. Although we caution the reader that this is not a complete proof as we have assumed magnetic fields to always remain gaussian distributed, which may not be true.
	
	The solution to eq.~\eqref{eq:P_evolve} is given by
	\begin{align}\label{eq:PKi}
		P_B(k,k_D(t))=P_B(k,t_i)e^{-k^2/k_D^2},
	\end{align}
	where $k_D$ represents the damping scale due to photon drag, and $P_B(k,t_i)$ is the power spectra prior to the photon drag regime, i.e. when the PMF coherence length scale was larger than the photon diffusion length, $l_{\gamma D}\approx 1/4\sqrt{l_{\gamma}/[aH]}$. 
	
	\pr{Prior to the photon drag regime, the baryon-photon plasma exhibits high Reynolds numbers. Consequently, PMFs induce turbulence in the baryon-photon plasma on small scales, with $P_B(k,t_i)\propto k^{-11/3}$ according to Kolmogorov cascade. On large scales, the power-law dependence of $P_B(k,t_i)$ is set by the physics of magnetogenesis. In this letter, we consider PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum on large scales, $P_B(k,t_i)\propto k^2$, which is often encountered in magnetogenesis from phase transitions \cite{Durrer:2003ja,Vachaspati:2020blt,Subramanian:2015lua}.  We adopt the exact shape of $P_B(k,t_i)$ from Ref.~\cite{Mtchedlidze:2021bfy}, and we rescale it to achieve the desired initial PMF strength, $B_{I}\equiv \langle B^2(t_i)\rangle$, and the initial coherence length scale, $\xi_I\equiv B_I^{-2}\int d\Pi_q P_B(q,t_i)/q$. }
	
	\pr{In magnetogenesis from phase-transitions, $\xi_I$ is directly determined by $B_I$. In particular, if Alfv\'enic physics governs MHD turbulence, then  $\xi_I\sim V_{AI}/[aH]_i$, with $V_{AI}=B_I/\sqrt{4\pi a^4(\rho_b+4\rho_{\gamma}/3)}$ \cite{Kahniashvili:2012uj, Banerjee:2004df}. Recently, it has been argued that a reconnection-controlled MHD turbulence leads to a better agreement with simulations \cite{PhysRevX.11.041005, Zhou:2022xhk}, leading to $\xi_I\sim 0.1 V_{AI}/[aH]_i$ for $B_I$ values of our interest \cite{Hosking:2022umv}. Due to uncertainties in turbulence theory, we keep $\xi_I$ as a free parameter. This also allows us to consider inflationary magnetogenesis scenarios, which can produce $\xi_I\gg V_{AI}/[aH]_i$.}
	
	\pr{In the photon drag regime, the damping scale can become the new coherence scale if $k_D^{-1}$ exceeds $\xi_I$}. Substituting  eq.~\eqref{eq:PKi} back in eq.~\eqref{eq:P_evolve}, we obtain
	\begin{align}\label{eq:kd_evolve}
		a\frac{\partial }{\partial a} \left(\frac{1}{k_D^2}\right)=\frac{4V_A^2/3}{a^2H(\alpha+H)},
	\end{align}
	where $V_A^2=\langle B^2\rangle /(4\pi a^4\rho_b)$ is the Alfv\'en speed. Given that $a\vec{v}_b\approx \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$ and $L_B\sim k_DV_A^2$, eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_evolve} tells us that the damping scale is roughly the distance a baryon particle travels in a Hubble time, $ak_D^{-1}\sim v_b/H\sim k_DV_A^2/[aH(\alpha+H)]$. The above equation agrees with the free-streaming Alfv\'en damping scale derived for pre-recombination universe ($\alpha\gg H$) by Ref.~\cite{Jedamzik:1996wp}, as well as with the magnetic Jeans damping scale derived for post-recombination universe ($\alpha\ll H$) by Ref.~\cite{Kim:1994zh,Subramanian:1997gi}.
	
	We have neglected the effect of thermal pressure and gravity while deriving eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_evolve}. We find that even if thermal pressure dominates over the Lorentz force, the damping scale \pr{remains largely unchanged} \cite{supp} (see also \cite{Jedamzik:1996wp,Campanelli:2013iaa}). Furthermore, for PMFs that produce observable enhancement in the DM power spectrum, we find gravity to overcome the Lorentz force only after $k\gg k_D$. Consequently, we approximate the damping scale to be given by eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_evolve} in all regimes.
	
	In the top panel of figure~\ref{fig:delta_evolve}, \pr{removed paragraph} the green line shows the evolution of the damping scale, $k_D^{-1}$. We have solved the background cosmology parameters ($H$, $\alpha$, $\rho$, etc.) using CLASS \cite{CLASS}. One can see that $k_D^{-1}$ grows as $a^{3/2}$ when $k_D^{-1}\lesssim \xi_I$ and as $k_D^{-1}\propto a^{3/7}$ after $k_D^{-1}>\xi_I$. This transition occurs because when $k_D^{-1}<\xi_I$ the PMF is flux frozen (constant $\langle B^2\rangle$) but afterwards the PMF is damped as $\langle B^2\rangle\propto k_D^{5}\propto a^{-15/14}$. The sudden increase in $k_{D}^{-1}$ near recombination is due to the rapid decrease in photon drag, $\alpha$.
	
	
	\pr{After recombination, the rapid decrease in $\alpha$ causes the Reynolds number of the plasma to become larger than one \cite{Banerjee:2004df}.} Thus, the MHD fluid becomes turbulent and this turbulence is not captured in our formalism. Nevertheless, we extend eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_evolve} beyond recombination and find a logarithmic growth of $k_D^{-1}$, which is also expected from simulations \cite{Banerjee:2004df}. Consequently, our evaluation of present-day values of $B$ and $k_D$ should be accurate up to an order of magnitude.
	
	%To our knowledge, we are the first to provide an analytical solution for the evolution of helical magnetic field power spectra in the viscous drag regime. Although, we caution the reader that this is not a complete proof as we have assumed the magnetic fields to remain Gaussian distributed throughout the evolution, which may not be true. 
	
	\noindent {\bf Impact on baryon density perturbations.} The continuity equation for $\delta_b$ in the linear limit is
	\begin{align}
		\frac{\partial \delta_b}{\partial t}+\frac{\nabla\cdot\vec{v}_b}{a}=0.
	\end{align}
	%	$\partial \delta_b(x)/\partial t+(\nabla\cdot\vec{v}_b+\nabla\cdot(\delta_b\vec{v}_b))/a=0$.
	We find that the non-linear term in the continuity equation, $\nabla\cdot(\delta_b\vec{v}_b)/a$, tends to enhance the power spectrum of $\delta_b$ by $\sim10\%$ when baryons are driven by the Lorentz force \cite{supp}. We found this by taking the ensemble average of the continuity equation convolved with $\delta_b(x')$ and using the linear solution, $\delta_b\propto \nabla\cdot v_b /[aH]=a^{-2}\nabla\cdot L_B/[H(\alpha+H)]$. As we are not interested in a precision calculation of the DM power spectrum, we have ignored the non-linear term here.
	
	%Thus our results should be interpreted as a conservative estimate for the enhancement in matter power spectra.

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	In the bottom panel of figure~\ref{fig:delta_evolve}, we show the evolution of $\hat{\delta}_b\equiv\sqrt{k^3P_b(k)/(2\pi^2)}$ for two different Fourier modes, where $P_b$ is the baryon power spectrum. 
	%We have renormalized $\delta_b$ such that $\hat{\delta}_b\equiv\sqrt{k^3/[2\pi^2V]}\delta_b(k)$, where $V$ is the space-time volume, $V\equiv\deltabar^3(0)=\int d^3x$. Such a renormalization directly relates $\delta_b$ with the dimensionless power spectrum, $k^3P_b(k)/(2\pi^2)=\langle\hat{\delta}_b^2(k)\rangle$. 
	We start our computation when the photon mean free path exceeds the initial coherence length scale, $l_{\gamma}(t'_i)>\xi_I$. We set $\delta_b(t'_i)=v_b(t'_i)=0$, which is expected due to silk damping. Here $v_b$ is solved using eq.~\eqref{eq:vb}.
	
	The evolution of $\delta_b$ can roughly be classified into four regimes. 
	In the first regime, $\delta_b$ grows as $\sim a^3$ due to the Lorentz force. 
%	The growth eventually stops when the damping scale exceeds the length scale of the Fourier mode, $k_D^{-1}\gtrsim 3k^{-1}$, because the Lorentz force is damped out.
	\pr{made shorter} Growth stops when the damping scale exceeds the length scale of the Fourier mode, $k_D^{-1}\gtrsim 3k^{-1}$, as the Lorentz force is damped out.
	
	Our evaluation of $\hat{\delta}_b$ for $k_D^{-1}\gtrsim k$ is not completely accurate. This is because we have approximated the evolution of $L_B(k,t)$ to be the same as $\sqrt{\langle L^2_B(k,t)\rangle}$, which is not true due to non-linear processing between different Fourier modes of PMF.
%	However, for the purpose of calculating $P_b(k,t)$, this approximation is acceptable because when baryons are driven by $L_B$, we have $\delta_b\propto a^{-2}\nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$. Consequently, $P_b$ is directly determined by $\langle L^2_B(k,t)\rangle$. Furthermore, once $L_B$ is damped for $k\gg k_D$, $\delta_b$ is no longer sensitive to our approximation in $L_B(k)$. In the transition regime, we expect no more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $P_b$.
	\pr{made concise} However, this approximation is acceptable for calculating $P_b(k,t)$, as $\delta_b\propto a^{-2}\nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$ when baryons are driven by $L_B$. Consequently, $P_b$ is directly determined by $\langle L^2_B(k,t)\rangle$. Furthermore, once $L_B$ is damped for $k\gg k_D$, $\delta_b$ \pr{becomes} insensitive to our approximation in $L_B(k)$. In the transition regime, we expect no more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $P_b$.
	
	The second regime of $\delta_b$ evolution corresponds to saturation, where $v_b$ is quickly driven to zero by the photon drag and $\delta_b$ saturates to a constant. If baryon thermal pressure is ignored, $\delta_b$ asymptotes to $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ values for $k\gg k_D$. 
%	The $\mathcal{O}(1)$ asymptote is just a reflection of the fact that $k_D$ is determined by the distance travelled by a baryon particle in a Hubble time, $k_D^{-1}\sim v_b/(aH)$, which translates to $\delta_b\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ as $\delta_b\sim kv_b/(aH)$
	The $\mathcal{O}(1)$ asymptote \pr{reflects} the fact that $k_D$ is determined by the distance travelled by a baryon particle in a Hubble time, $k_D^{-1}\sim v_b/(aH)$, which translates to $\delta_b\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ as $\delta_b\sim kv_b/(aH)$.
	
	The third regime corresponds to the damping of $\delta_b$ by thermal pressure.
%	The thermal pressure becomes important when it becomes of the same order as the photon drag force, $c_b^2k\delta_b\sim (H+\alpha)v_b$.
	The thermal pressure becomes important when it is \pr{comparable to} the photon drag force, $c_b^2k\delta_b\sim (H+\alpha)v_b$. 
	Using $\delta_b\sim kv_b/(aH)$, we find the thermal pressure damping scale to be
	\begin{align}
		\lambda_{th}=\frac{c_b}{aH}\sqrt{\frac{H}{\alpha+H}}.
	\end{align}
	We plot this scale as a red line in the top panel of figure~\ref{fig:delta_evolve}.
	
	Finally, the fourth regime corresponds to turbulence damping near recombination. At recombination, the photon drag force almost instantaneously becomes negligible and the convective terms in the baryon Euler equation (eq.~\eqref{eq:vb}) can no longer be ignored \cite{Banerjee:2004df,Trivedi:2018ejz,Jedamzik:2018itu}. We model the impact of turbulence on $\delta_b$ by setting $\delta_b=0$ at recombination for all scales inside the magnetic damping scale.
	
	\noindent {\bf Impact on DM perturbations.} The rapid growth in $\delta_b$ gravitationally induces growth in DM perturbations, $\delta_{DM}$. We find that $\delta_{DM}$ largely remains in the perturbative regime before recombination even if $\delta_b$ reaches non-linear values. This is because the gravitational influence of baryons is suppressed by a factor of $\rho_b/\rho_{\rm tot}$. Consequently, the growth in $\delta_{DM}$ is well captured by the linear theory \pr{New ref} \cite{Hu:1995en,Meszaros:1974tb},
	\begin{multline}
		\frac{\partial^2 \delta_{DM}}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2+3y}{2y(y+1)}\frac{\partial \delta_{DM}}{\partial y}-\frac{3}{2y(y+1)}\frac{\Omega_{DM}}{\Omega_m}\delta_{DM}\\=\frac{3}{2y(y+1)}\frac{\Omega_{b}}{\Omega_m}\delta_{b}.
	\end{multline}
	\pr{Rewrote above equation in terms of more known form.}
	Here $\Omega$ corresponds to the present day fraction of species, with $\Omega_bh^2=0.022$, $\Omega_{DM}h^2=0.12$, $\Omega_m=\Omega_b+\Omega_{DM}$, and $y=a/a_{eq}$ with $a_{eq}$ being the scale factor at matter radiation equality \cite{Aghanim:2018eyx}. \pr{Removed radiation perturbation justification.}
	%The contribution of radiation perturbations have been neglected above because they are damped by free-streaming.
	
	Since $\delta_{DM}$ follows an ordinary differential equation, its solution can simply be written as a linear combination of the homogenous solution provided by the initial condition and the inhomogeneous solution indirectly sourced by PMF, $\delta_{DM}=(\delta_{DM})_{\Lambda CDM}+(\delta_{DM})_{B}$. As the PMF distribution is uncorrelated with the curvature perturbations determining initial conditions \cite{Aghanim:2018eyx}, the two solutions of $\delta_{DM}$ are uncorrelated as well \pr{new citation} \cite{Kunze:2022mlr}.
	
	%	In the bottom panel of figure~\ref{fig:delta_evolve}, the blue line and the black lines show the evolution of $(\delta_{DM})_{\Lambda CDM}$ and $(\delta_{DM})_{B}$, respectively. The gravitational influence of $\delta_b$ on $\delta_{DM}$ is most enhanced once the universe becomes matter-dominated, i.e. $a>a_{eq}$. Thus smaller scale modes for whom $\delta_b$ gets thermally damped prior to $a_{eq}$ will have smaller values of $\delta_b$.
	
	%We find the the maximum $\delta_{DM}$ growth typically occurs for the mode, $k_{pk}\sim \xi_I^{-1}$. On larger scales thermal pressure or turbulence at recombination suppresses the growth in baryon perturbations while on smaller scales the initial value of Lorentz force is suppressed.

	In figure~\ref{fig:Tk}, we show the DM transfer function, $T^2(k)=P_{DM}(k)/[P_{DM}(k)]_{\Lambda CDM}$, where $P_{DM}$ is the DM power spectrum, $\deltabar^3(k-k')P_{DM}(k)=\langle\delta_{DM}(k) \delta_{DM}(k')\rangle_B+\langle\delta_{DM}(k) \delta_{DM}(k')\rangle_{\Lambda CDM}$. The transfer function is quite narrowly peaked with the peak typically occurring at $k_{pk}\sim \xi_I^{-1}$. 
	For $k<k_{pk}$, thermal pressure or turbulence at recombination suppresses $\delta_b$ before it attains its maximum value due to the Lorentz force. The value of $k_{pk}$ for the black dashed line is shifted to $k_{pk}>\xi_I^{-1}$, because $\delta_b(k=\xi_I^{-1})$ is prematurely suppressed by turbulence at recombination. The value of $T(k)$ for $k>\xi_I$ is suppressed because the initial PMF is itself suppressed.

	\noindent {\bf Connecting PMFs with DM minihalos.}
	In figure~\ref{fig:param_space} we vary over different initial PMF configurations and plot the contours showing the maximum enhancement to the DM transfer function, $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$.
	%	The value of $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$ is directly related to when $\delta_{DM}$ first becomes non-linear, which in turn determines the collapse redshift of first minihalos \cite{Erickcek:2015jza}. 
	A large value of $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$ implies that the halos corresponding to the peak scale, $k_{pk}^{-1}$, collapse earlier than in the standard cosmology and consequently have much larger central densities \cite{Bullock:1999he,Wechsler:2001cs,Delos:2019mxl}. The mass of these first formed minihalos is approximately given by the DM mass enclosed in a radius of $ak_{pk}^{-1}$, i.e. $M_h=4\pi\rho_{DM}(a=1)k_{pk}^{-3}/3$.
	
	%	The mass of the first formed minihalos is approximately given by the DM mass enclosed in a radius of $k_{pk}^{-1}$. We show this first-formed minihalo mass, $M_h=4\pi\rho_{DM,0}k_{pk}^{-3}/3$, as white dashed lines in figure~\ref{fig:param_space}, where $\rho_{DM,0}$ is the present day DM energy density.
	
	The value of $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$ is suppressed for small $B_I$ and for both large and small $\xi_I$. When $B_{I}<0.05$ nG, the thermal presssure inhibits the growth in $\delta_b(k_{pk})$ before it attains its $\mathcal{O}(1)$ saturation value, which then limits the growth in $\delta_{DM}$. For $\xi_I<10^{-4}$ Mpc, $\delta_b(k_{pk})$ is suppressed by thermal pressure before $a_{eq}$. Consequently, the gravitational influence of baryons on DM is suppressed by a factor of $\sim a/a_{eq}$. Finally, for $\xi_I\gtrsim k_D^{-1}(a_{\rm rec})$, turbulence near recombination suppresses $\delta_b$ before it can attain $\mathcal{O}(1)$ values. Thus, we have restricted our analysis to $\xi_I<k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$.
	
	%	For $\xi_I$ larger than $k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$, which is roughly the magnetic Jeans length, turbulence at recombination does not affect perturbations on scale $\xi_I$. Thus, one can also obtain an enhancement in $T(k)$ for $\xi_I>k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$ \cite{Kim:1994zh,gopalsethi03,Shaw:2010ea}. In this letter, we have restricted our analysis to $\xi_I<k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$.
	%	Additionally, $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$ is also suppressed for small $\xi_I$ because 
	
	%	Away from the above-mentioned boundaries, $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$, increases gradually until it asymptotes to $\sim 10^4$. This asymptote is determined by the best case scenario where $\delta_b$ remains $\mathcal{O}(1)$ from $a_{eq}$ to $a_{\rm rec}$. For $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}\gtrsim 10^2$, we expect the first minihalos to form at redshift $z>10$, and to have high enough central densities to even survive in galaxies today, albeit after a significant mass loss \cite{2010PhRvD..81j3529B, Delos:2019lik, Delos:2019tsl, Shen:2022ltx}.
	
	Additionally, $\xi_I$ has a natural lower bound for a given value of $B_I$. In particular, prior to the photon drag regime, PMFs induce turbulent motion in the plasma and are damped by Kolmogorov cascade below the turbulence scale. Thus, $\xi_I$ has to be larger than the purple lines in figure~\ref{fig:param_space}, depending on the physics controlling MHD turbulence. \pr{Removed discussion.}
	
	%	In figure~\ref{fig:param_space}, we choose to show our results for $0.1 V_{AI}/[aH]_i<\xi_I<k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$. Impact on $T(k)$ for $\xi_I$ larger than $k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$, which is roughly the magnetic Jeans length, has already been studied \cite{gopalsethi03,Shaw:2010ea}. 
	
	%	Because of the uncertainty in the relation between $B_I$ and $\xi_I$, in figure~\ref{fig:param_space}, we vary over both $\xi_I$ and $B_I$ and plot the contours showing the maximum enhancement to the DM transfer function, $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$. We show our results for all $0.1 V_{AI}/[aH]_i<\xi_I<k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$. Impact on $T(k)$ for $\xi_I$ larger than $k_D^{-1}(2a_{\rm rec})$, which is roughly the magnetic Jeans length, has already been studied \cite{gopalsethi03,Shaw:2010ea}. 
	%	In figure~\ref{fig:param_space}, we see that PMF experiences some damping even for $\xi_I>k_D^{1}(2a_{\rm rec})$ because $k_D^{-1}$ continues to grow logarithmically for $a>2a_{\rm rec}$.
	
	%	One can see that PMFs cannot substantially enhance $\delta_{DM}$ if Alfv\'enic physics controls MHD turbulence. This is because the value of $\xi_I$ happens to be smaller than $ k_D^{-1}(a_{\rm rec})$. Consequently, turbulence at recombination damps $\delta_b$ before it can acquire its $\mathcal{O}(1)$ values at $k_{D}^{-1}\gg \xi_I$. This premature suppression of $\delta_b$ leads to a limited growth in $\delta_{DM}$. A similar suppression of  $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$ occurs when $B_{I}<0.05$ nG because the thermal pressure inhibits the growth in $\delta_b$ before it attains its $\mathcal{O}(1)$ value.\
	
	If PMFs are generated after inflation, then turbulence typically determines the coherence length scale of PMFs and $B_I$ and $\xi_I$ would lie on one of the purple lines. For instance, considering magnetogenesis at QCD phase transition, the largest value of $B$ is obtained by assuming $\rho_B=\rho_{SM}$ and $\xi=(aH)^{-1}$ at $T_{QCD}=150$ MeV. The subsequent turbulent evolution increases $\xi$ while conserving $B^4\xi^5$ ($B^2\xi^5$) for reconnection-controlled (Alf\'venic) turbulence \cite{PhysRevX.11.041005}.
	%	The red crosses (blue triangle) on the purple lines mark the largest values of $B_I$ from magnetogenesis at QCD phase transition. Similarly, the blue triangle corresponds to magnetogenesis at electroweak phase transition at $T_{EWPT}=160$ GeV.
	%For $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}\gtrsim 10^2$, we expect the first minihalos to form at redshift $z>10$, and to have high enough central densities to even survive in galaxies today, albeit after a significant mass loss \cite{2010PhRvD..81j3529B, Delos:2019lik, Delos:2019tsl, Shen:2022ltx}.\textbf{check}
	
	PMFs generated after inflation can explain the absence of GeV gamma-ray halos around TeV blazars, if their present day strength, $B_0=\langle B^2(a=1)\rangle$, is larger than $\sim 10^{-5}$ nG \cite{Taylor:2011bn}. One can see from figure~\ref{fig:param_space} that PMFs generated after EWPT can explain Blazar observations \cite{Hosking:2022umv} and also enhance $T^2(k)$ \pr{replaced small scal ematter power spectra with formula}.
	
	An enhancement in $T^2(k)$ implies an enhanced abundance of minihalos today.
	The presence of such minihalos in the Milkyway can potentially be observed by astrometric microlensing searches \cite{Erickcek:2010fc,Li:2012qha,VanTilburg:2018ykj}, caustic microlensing \cite{Oguri:2017ock,Diego:2017drh}, or by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) \cite{Siegel:2007fz,Clark:2015sha,Ramani:2020hdo,Lee:2020wfn}. 
	%The green shaded region in figure~\ref{fig:param_space} highlights the region whose $P_{DM}(k)$ lies in the observable window for GAIA \cite{VanTilburg:2018ykj}. 
	For instance, the region inside the green-dashed line has $P_{DM}(k)$ which is potentially in the observable window of future PTA measurements \cite{Lee:2020wfn}. Note that this is an \pr{optimistic} estimate \cite{Lee:2021zqw}, and a more detailed analysis is required to draw any definitive conclusion on observability.
	
	%	Note that Ref.~\cite{VanTilburg:2018ykj} translates the enhancement in $P_{DM}(k)$ to a spectrum of DM minihalos by assuming a gaussian distribution for $\delta_{DM}$. However, density perturbations sourced by PMFs are inherently non-gaussian even if the magnetic fields themselves are gaussian distributed. This is because the Lorentz force driving the growth in perturbations is a convolution of two $B$ fields. We leave the analysis for a non-gaussian distributed $\delta_{DM}$ to future work.
	%	The value of $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}$ is directly related to when $\delta_{DM}$ first becomes non-linear, which in turn determines the collapse redshift of first minihalos \cite{Erickcek:2015jza}. The initial mass of the first formed minihalos is approximately given by the DM mass enclosed in a radius of $ak_{pk}^{-1}$, i.e. $M_h=4\pi\rho_{DM}(a=1)k_{pk}^{-3}/3$.
	%	For $[T^2(k)]_{\rm max}\sim 10^3$, we expect the first minihalos to form at redshift $z\gtrsim 100$, and to have high enough central densities to even survive in galaxies today, albeit after a significant mass loss \cite{2010PhRvD..81j3529B, Delos:2019lik, Delos:2019tsl, Shen:2022ltx}.
	
	%	Note that one would need to introduce physics beyond the Standard Model to produce such large PMFs at QCD transition \cite{Aoki:2006we,Schwarz:2009ii,Miniati:2017kah}.
	\pr{Removed inflation discussion}
	The current strongest constraint restricts $B_0<0.06$ nG \pr{ at $95\%$ confidence level for PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum} \cite{Paoletti:2022gsn}. Further stringent constraint of $B_0<0.01$ nG can be applied if we take into account that non-linear values of $\delta_b$ can alter recombination \cite{Jedamzik:2018itu}. Recently, this fact has instead been utilized to help resolve the Hubble tension \cite{Jedamzik:2020krr}. Depending on the exact values of $B_I$ and $\xi_I$ that resolve the Hubble tension, it is possible that an observable abundance of DM minihalos is also produced. 
	%	A more detailed investigation is beyond the scope of this letter.
	
	\noindent {\bf Discussion.} 
	We have shown for the first time that primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can enhance the present-day matter power spectrum on scales below the magnetic Jeans length. This implies a larger abundance of DM minihalos today.
	
	The abundance of DM minihalos is determined not by the present-day strength of the PMF, but rather by its strength in the early universe when baryon perturbations on the PMF coherence scale decoupled from photons. As PMFs had underwent less dissipation at that time, they had a larger potential to overcome baryon thermal pressure and generate baryon inhomogeneities. DM acts as a ``memory foam" and preserves the growth history of these inhomogeneities. As a result, DM minihalos can probe PMFs with present-day strengths much below those probed by CMB and Faraday rotation.
	
	Considering non-helical PMFs that are generated after inflation with a Batchelor spectrum, we estimate that PMFs that can explain blazar observations should also produce DM minihalos heavier than $10^{-10}\ M_{\odot}$. These minihalos may be detectable through future PTA measurements. 
%	Note that these estimates are based on analytical calculations and an accurate prediction will require dedicated MHD and structure formation simulations. \pr{In particular, we expect the qualitative outcome of production of dark matter minihalos to remain unchanged even with specialized simulation. However, the expectation of the number of DM minihalos for a given present day value magnetic fields could change. We expect this change to remain within order of magnitude of our results.}

	\pr{Our results are based on analytical calculations, with the primary assumption that the distribution of PMFs remains Gaussian. Our analytical approach agrees with previous results in the literature, suggesting that non-Gaussian effects have a limited role in the photon drag regime. Consequently, even with dedicated MHD simulations, we anticipate that the qualitative relationship between the DM power spectrum and present-day PMF strengths will remain largely unchanged. However, there may be some variation in the quantitative relationship, possibly within an order of magnitude.}
	
	\pr{Even if non-gaussianities in the PMF distribution are significant, we expect the DM minihalos to still be produced below the magnetic jeans scale. This is simply because the magnetic jeans scale is set by the scale where baryon perturbations become large enough to feedback onto the magnetic fields. These large baryon perturbations gravitationally enhance DM perturbations. Subsequently, even after baryon perturbations are damped by PMFs, the gravitational potential from DM is sufficient to sustain the growth in DM perturbations and cause their eventual collapse into minihalos.}
%	\pr{Removed first claim.} The only major assumption in our analytical analysis is that we neglected non-gaussianities in the PMF distribution. \pr{Changed claim here too:} The fact that our analytical formalism can reproduce the expected behavior of magnetic damping scale seems to suggest that non-gaussianities are not playing a major role in the photon drag regime. However, if non-gaussianities somehow alter the PMF evolution through reconnection physics, we expect that would only further enhance the density perturbations. This is because reconnection typically leads to a slower damping of PMFs than expected, thereby allowing more time for perturbations to grow.
	
	Thus, a future detection of DM minihalos should serve as a smoking gun signal for a primordial origin of cosmic magnetic fields. It is rather ironic how we can utilize the invisible component of our universe to search for a component of the visible sector.

	\section{Magnetic damping scale for incompressible fluid}
	In this section we derive the evolution of non-helical magnetic field power spectrum for scenarios where the baryon thermal pressure dominates over the Lorentz force in the photon drag regime.
	
	In the main letter we showed that the baryon velocity is determined by the balance between the Lorentz force and the photon drag force, $a\vec{v}_b\approx \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$, when thermal pressure is negligible.
	In contrast, in the strong thermal pressure limit, compressible motion in the baryons is suppressed, $\nabla\cdot v_b\rightarrow 0$. However, the Lorentz force can \textbf{still} induce divergence free motion in the baryon fluid without hindrance.
	Consequently, one can write the Fourier transformed baryon velocity vector as
	\begin{align}\label{eq:vb_incomp}
		v_{b,j}(q)=\left(\delta_{lj}-\frac{q_lq_j}{q^2}\right)\frac{L_{B,l}(q)}{a(\alpha+H)}=\hat{p}_{lj}(q)\frac{L_{B,l}(q)}{a(\alpha+H)},
	\end{align}
	where $\vec{L}_B(q)$ is the Fourier transform of the Lorentz force, $\vec{L}_B(x)=(\nabla\times\vec{B})\times\vec{B}/[4\pi a^4\rho_b]$.
	
	The motion in the baryon fluid feedbacks onto the magnetic field via the induction equation, eq.~\eqref{eq:induction}. Taking the Fourier transform of eq.~\eqref{eq:induction} and replacing $v_b$ using eq.~\eqref{eq:vb_incomp}, we obtain
	\begin{multline}\label{eq:temp}
		\frac{\partial B_i(k)}{\partial t}=\frac{-k_m }{(4\pi\rho_{b})(\alpha+H)}[\delta_{ml}\delta_{ji}-\delta_{mj}\delta_{li}][\delta_{ab}\delta_{nc}-\delta_{bc}\delta_{na}]\int d\Pi_{q_1} d\Pi_{q_2}\hat{p}_{jn}(q_1)q_{2a}B_b(q_1-q_2)B_c(q_2) B_l(k-q_1),
	\end{multline}
	where $d\Pi_q=d^3q/(2\pi)^3$.
	
	To obtain the evolution of the power spectrum, we use the fact that 
	\begin{align}
		\deltabar^3(k-k')\frac{\partial P_B(k)}{\partial t}=\frac{1}{2} \left\langle\frac{\partial B_m(k)}{\partial t}B_m^{*}(k')\right\rangle.
	\end{align}
	Then replacing the derivative of $B$ using eq.~\eqref{eq:temp}, using $\langle B_i(k)B_j^*(k')\rangle\equiv \deltabar^3(k-k')M_{ij}(k')$, and assuming magnetic fields to be Gaussian distributed, we obtain
	\begin{multline}
		\frac{\partial P_B(k)}{\partial t}
		=\frac{-\deltabar^3(k-k')}{2(4\pi\rho_{b})(\alpha+H)}k_i[\delta_{il}\delta_{jm}-\delta_{ij}\delta_{lm}][\delta_{ab}\delta_{nc}-\delta_{bc}\delta_{na}]\\
		\times\int d\Pi_q\hat{p}_{jn}(k-q) [k_{a}M_{lb}(q)M_{cm}(k)-q_{a}M_{lc}(q)M_{bm}(k)].
	\end{multline}
	Next, considering non-helical fields, we replace $M$ using eq.~\eqref{eq:def_M} and set $h=0$. Doing so yields
	\begin{align}
		\frac{\partial P_B(k)}{\partial t}=\frac{-P_B(k)}{(4\pi\rho_{b})(\alpha+H)}\int d\Pi_q \left[-\frac{2}{3}(k^2+3q^2)+\frac{(k^4+k^2q^2+q^4)}{kq}\ln\left(\frac{k^2+q^2+kq}{k^2+q^2-kq}\right)\right]P_B(q).
	\end{align}
	
	To obtain a simple expression we can look at the asymptotic limit, $k\ll k_D$ or $k\gg k_D$. In these limits, the integral is dominated by the phase space where $q\sim k_D\gg k$ or $q\sim k_D\ll k$. Both limits yield
	\begin{align}\label{eq:kd_th}
		\frac{\partial P_B(k)}{\partial t}\approx-\frac{4k^2V_A^2}{3a^2(\alpha+H)}P(k),
	\end{align} 
	where $V_A^2=\langle B^2\rangle/[4\pi a^4\rho_b]$ is the Alfv\'en speed.
	
	Thus, we can see that the magnetic power spectrum evolution is well approximated by $P(k,t)=P(k,t_i)e^{-k^2/k_D^2}$ for $k$ values well separated from $k_D$. The evolution of the damping scale, $k_D^{-1}$, can be obtained by plugging this solution back in eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_th}. Doing so surprisingly yields the exact same equation as for compressible fluid, eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_evolve}.
	
	While deriving the power spectrum evolution here and in the main letter, we considered that $v_b\propto L_B$ on all scales. However, for $k>k_D$, the magnetic fields are being exponentially damped and for large enough $k$, the baryon flow should stop following the Lorentz force. However, as long as the scale where baryons stop following the Lorentz force is much smaller than $k_D^{-1}$ we can safely assume $v_b\propto L_B$ to always be valid for the purpose of evaluating $P_B(k,t)$. In particular, one can see that $L_B$ is roughly suppressed as $\sim k^2/k_D^2$ for $k>k_D$ while $v_b$ can at best decrease with a dimensionless rate of $(H+\alpha)/H$. Consequently, $v_b$ follows the Lorentz force until $k\gtrsim \sqrt{\alpha/H}k_D$. Prior to recombination, $\alpha$ is atleast 300 times larger than $H$, so baryons follow the Lorentz force deep into the damping regime.
	
	\section{Non-linear term in the baryon continuity equation}
	In this section we show that the non-linear term in the baryon continuity equation tends to enhance the baryon power spectrum when baryons are driven by magnetic fields.
	
	We begin with the baryon continuity equation,
	\begin{align}\label{eq:deltab_cont}
		\frac{\partial \delta_b}{\partial t}+\frac{\nabla\cdot\vec{v}_b}{a}+\frac{\nabla\cdot(\vec{v}_b\delta_b)}{a}&=0.
	\end{align}
	Taking the Fourier transform of the above equation and then ensemble averaging with $\delta_b^*(k')$, we obtain
	\begin{align}
		\langle\frac{\partial \delta_b(k)}{\partial t}\delta_b^*(k')\rangle+\frac{\langle \vec{k}\cdot\vec{v}_b(k)\delta_b^*(k')\rangle}{a}+\deltabar^3(k-k')\Xi(k)&=0,
	\end{align}
	where $\deltabar^3(k)=(2\pi)^3\delta(k)$ and 
	\begin{align}\label{eq:def_xi}
		\deltabar^3(k-k')\Xi(k)\equiv -\frac{i}{a}\int\frac{d^3q}{(2\pi)^3}\langle (\vec{k}\cdot \vec{v}_b(q))\delta_b(k-q)\delta_b^*(k')\rangle.
	\end{align}
	Here $\Xi(k)$ represents the contribution from the non-linear term in eq.~\eqref{eq:deltab_cont} to the evolution of the baryon density power spectrum.
	
	We are primarily interested in the regime where baryon perturbations become non-linear, i.e. where the Lorentz force dominates over the baryon thermal pressure and gravity. Consequently, $v_b$ is determined by the balance between the Lorentz force and the photon drag force, $a\vec{v}_b\approx \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$. Furthermore, assuming that $\delta_b$ is largely determined by the linear continuity equation, eq.~\eqref{eq:deltab_cont}, we have $\delta_b=-C \nabla\cdot v_b/[aH]=-C\nabla\cdot\vec{L}_B/[a^2H(\alpha+H)]$, where $C$ is some constant of motion. As both $v_b$ and $\delta_b$ are now expressed in terms of the Lorentz force, we can simplify eq.~\eqref{eq:def_xi} to obtain $\Xi$ in terms of the magnetic field power spectrum,
	\begin{multline}
		\Xi(k) 
		= \frac{-4C^2[\delta_{ml}k_{j}-\delta_{mj}k_{l}](k_{r}k_{s}-k^2\delta_{rs}/2)}{(4\pi a^4\rho_b)^3 a^{6}(H+\alpha)^3H^2}\int d\Pi_qd\Pi_{q_1} [(k-q-q_1)_{u}(k-q-q_1)_{v}-(k-q-q_1)^2\delta_{uv}/2]\\ \times(q_1-q)_mM_{jr}(q_1)M_{lu}(q)M_{vs}(k-q_1),
	\end{multline}
	where $M$ is defined through $\langle B_i(k)B_j^*(k')\rangle\equiv \deltabar^3(k-k')M_{ij}(k')$ and $d\Pi_q=d^3q/(2\pi)^3$. While obtaining the above expression, we assumed the magnetic fields to be Gaussian distributed. In what follows, we shall show that $\Xi$ is largely negative and hence leads to an enhancement of the baryon power spectrum.
	
	We can further simplify the above integral by considering non-helical magnetic fields with $M$ given by eq.~\eqref{eq:def_M} after setting $h(k)=0$. Then after contracting over all indices and integrating over $q$, we obtain
	\begin{multline}
		\Xi(k)= \frac{C^2}{(4\pi a^4\rho_b)^2 a^{6}(H+\alpha)^3H^2} \frac{1}{8}\frac{2V_A^2}{3}k^3\int d\Pi_{q_1}
		P_B(q_1)\frac{P_B(k-q_1)}{(\vec{k}-\vec{q}_1)^2}\\
		\bigg(kq_1\bigg[q_1^3(1-3x^2+2x^4)-kq_1^2x(1-5x^2+4x^4)+k^2q_1(1-5x^2+4x^4)+k^3x(1-x^2)\bigg]\\+k_{*2}^2k_D^2\bigg[2q_1^3x^3-2kq_1^2x^2(x^2+2)+3k^2q_1x(1+x^2)-k^3(1+x^2)\bigg]\bigg).
	\end{multline}
	where $x=(\vec{k}\cdot \vec{q}_1)/kq_1$, $V_A^2=\int d\Pi_q P_B(q)/[4\pi a^4\rho_b]$, and $k_{*n}$ represents the moments of the magnetic power spectrum,
	\begin{align}
		k_{*n}^n\equiv \frac{\int d\Pi_q q^nP_B(q)}{\int d\Pi_q P_B(q)}.
	\end{align}
	
	The integral in $\Xi(k)$ is similar to the integral in the power spectrum of the Lorentz force \cite{Planck:2015zrl},
	\begin{multline}\label{eq:LB_power}
		\langle \nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B(k) \nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B(k')\rangle=\deltabar^3(k-k')P_{\nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B}=\deltabar^3(k-k')\frac{k^4}{8(4\pi a^4\rho_b)^2}\int \frac{d^3q}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{P_B(q)P_B(k-q)}{(k-q)^2}\bigg[k^2(1+x^2)-4kqx^3\\+2q^2(1-2x^2+2x^4)\bigg].
	\end{multline}
	We have checked that our Lorentz force power spectrum matches to that used in literature \cite{Planck:2015zrl}.
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{J_evolve.pdf}
		\caption{Figure shows $J$, which is a dimensionless quantity that parametrizes the impact of the non-linear term in the baryon continuity equation, as a function of the damping scale, as a function of the damping scale, $k_D^{-1}$, for different values of $k$. The vertical dashed lines mark the points where $k_D=k$. We can see that $J$ is almost always negative, except for small region near $k=k_D$. The negative values of $J$ imply that the non-linear term enhances the linear baryon power spectrum.} \label{fig:J_evolve}
	\end{figure}
	
	Consequently, we rewrite $\Xi$ in terms of $P_{\nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B}$ and use the fact that we have assumed $\delta_b=-C\nabla\cdot\vec{L}_B/[a^2H(\alpha+H)]$, to obtain
	\begin{align}
		\Xi(k)=\frac{C^2P_{\nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B}}{a^{6}(H+\alpha)^3H^2}\frac{2k_D^2V_A^2}{3}J(k,k_D)=\frac{2P_{b}(k)}{3}\frac{k_D^2V_A^2}{a^{2}(H+\alpha)}J(k,k_D),
	\end{align}
	where $\deltabar^3(k-k')P_b(k)=\langle \delta_b(k)\delta_b^*(k')\rangle$, and $J$ is a dimensionless quantity that parametrizes the ratio of the integrals in $\Xi$ and $P_{\nabla\cdot \vec{L}_B}$.
	
	Since $\Xi$ is proportional to $P_b$, we can effectively rewrite the continuity equation for baryon as
	\begin{align}\label{eq:deltab_cont2}
		\frac{\partial \delta_b}{\partial t}+\frac{\nabla\cdot\vec{L}_B}{a(\alpha+H)}+\frac{2\delta_b}{3}\frac{k_D^2V_A^2}{a^{2}(H+\alpha)}J(k,k_D)&=0,
	\end{align}
	where we have used $a\vec{v}_b\approx \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$.
	The above equation would yield the same equation for $P_b$ as the original continuity equation when baryons are driven by the Lorentz force.
	
	The above equation also allows us to confirm our original assumption of $\delta_b=-C\nabla\cdot\vec{L}_B/[a^2H(\alpha+H)]$. To do so we simply substitute $\delta_b=-C\nabla\cdot\vec{L}_B/[a^2H(\alpha+H)]\propto a^{m}$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:deltab_cont2} to obtain,
	\begin{align}
		C=\frac{1}{m+\left[ \frac{2}{3}\frac{k_D^2V_A^2}{a^{2}(H+\alpha)}J(k,k_D)\right]}.
	\end{align}
	Note that $\frac{k_D^2V_A^2}{a^{2}(H+\alpha)}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ according to the definition of $k_D$ (eq.~\eqref{eq:kd_evolve}). Consequently, the non-linear term in the continuity equation simply provides a correction of order $J/m$ to the linear solution. In a radiation-dominated universe, we have $m=3$ prior to the damping of the magnetic fields.
	
	In figure~\ref{fig:J_evolve}, we show $J$ as a function of $k_D$ for different values of $k$. Note that $J$ is typically of order $-0.1$ for $k<k_D$. For $k\sim k_D$ we see $J$ to jump to a small positive value and then it again becomes negative. The large negative values of $J$ for $k\gg k_D$ have no physical significance because in that limit the magnetic fields and $v_b$ are exponentially damped. Consequently, our calculation of $\Xi$, which is based on the assumption of $\delta_b\propto \vec{v}_b/a$, is no longer applicable. We instead expect $\Xi$ to go to zero for $k\gg k_D$ because $\delta_b$ is no longer correlated with $\vec{v}_b\approx \vec{L}_B/(\alpha+H)$.
	
	%	Our analysis in this section is valid as long as the term in the square bracket above is larger than $-m$. Prior to damping of magnetic fields and assuming a radiation dominated universe, we obtain $m=3$.
	
	Hence, when the growth in $\delta_b$ is sourced by the magnetic fields, we expect the non-linear terms in the baryon continuity equation to provide a small enhancement to the baryon power spectrum obtained from linear analysis.

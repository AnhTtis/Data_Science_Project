    "abstract": "In this study, a small, inexpensive remotely driven underwater vehicle that can navigate in shallow water for the purpose of monitoring water quality and demonstrating vehicle control algorithms is presented. The vehicle is operated by an onboard micro-controller, and the sensor payload comprises a turbidity sensor for determining the quality of the water, a depth sensor, and a 9-axis inertial measurement unit. The developed vehicle is an open frame remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with a small footprint and a modular physical and electrical architecture. With a net weight of 1.6 kg, a maximum depth rating of 20 meters, and a development cost of around $80, the ROV frame is composed of polyvinyl chloride tubes and has a length of 0.35 meters. As a ground station, a dedicated laptop shows crucial vehicle data in real time and can send commands to the vehicle. Initial testing in the pool demonstrates that the vehicle is completely operational and effectively complies with pilot commands.",

    "abstract": "The process of neutrino interaction with $^{98}$Mo and $^{100}$Mo isotopes is studied taking into consideration the effect of charge-exchange resonances. The experimental data on the strength functions $S(E)$ obtained in charge-exchange reactions $(p; n)$ and $(^3\\mathrm{He}, t)$ and the strength functions $S(E)$ calculated within the theory of finite Fermi systems were used. We studied the effect of the resonance structure of $S(E)$ on the cross sections for solar-neutrino. We investigated the contribution of each high-lying resonance to the capture cross section $σ(E_ν)$. The contributions of all components of the solar neutrino spectrum are calculated. We estimate the contribution of different components of solar neutrinos as the background for the double-beta decay experiments on $^{100}$Mo.",

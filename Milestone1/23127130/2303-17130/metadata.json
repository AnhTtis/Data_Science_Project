    "abstract": "The study was designed to determine the entrepreneurial capability and engagement of persons with disabilities toward a framework for inclusive entrepreneurship. The researcher used descriptive and correlational approaches through purposive random sampling. The sample came from the City of General Trias and the Municipality of Rosario, registered under their respective Persons with Disabilities Affairs Offices (PDAO). The findings indicated that the respondents are from the working class, are primarily female, are mostly single, have college degrees, live in a medium-sized home, and earn the bare minimum. Furthermore, PWDs' perceived capability level in entrepreneurship was somehow capable, and the majority of engagement level responses were somehow engaged. Considerably, age and civil status have significant relationships with most of the variables under study. Finally, the perceived challenges of PWDs' respondents noted the following: lack of financial capacity, access to credit and other financial institutions, absence of business information, absence of access to data, lack of competent business skills, lack of family support, and lack of personal motivation. As a result, the author proposed a framework that emphasizes interaction and cooperation between national and local government units in the formulation of policies promoting inclusive entrepreneurship for people with disabilities.",

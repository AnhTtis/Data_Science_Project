    "abstract": "Dynamic networks have been increasingly used to characterize brain connectivity that varies during resting and task states. In such characterizations, a connectivity network is typically measured at each time point for a subject over a common set of nodes representing brain regions, together with rich subject-level information. A common approach to analyzing such data is an edge-based method that models the connectivity between each pair of nodes separately. However, such approach may have limited performance when the noise level is high and the number of subjects is limited, as it does not take advantage of the inherent network structure. To better understand if and how the subject-level covariates affect the dynamic brain connectivity, we introduce a semi-parametric dynamic network response regression that relates a dynamic brain connectivity network to a vector of subject-level covariates. A key advantage of our method is to exploit the structure of dynamic imaging coefficients in the form of high-order tensors. We develop an efficient estimation algorithm and evaluate the efficacy of our approach through simulation studies. Finally, we present our results on the analysis of a task-related study on social cognition in the Human Connectome Project, where we identify known sex-specific effects on brain connectivity that cannot be inferred using alternative methods.",

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing complexity of medical care, coupled with limits on resident work hours, has prompted consideration of extending Internal Medicine training. It is unclear whether further hour reductions and extension of training beyond the current duration of 3 years would be accepted by trainees.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine if further workhour reductions and extension of training would be accepted by trainees and whether resident burnout affects their opinions. DESIGN: A postal survey was sent to all 143 Internal Medicine residents at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in May 2004.
MEASUREMENTS: The survey contained questions related to opinions on work-hour limits using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, organized into three subscales: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment, with burnout defined as high EE or DP.
RESULTS: Seventy-four percent (106/143) of residents returned the survey. The vast majority (84\%) of residents disagreed or strongly disagreed with extending training to 4 or 5 years. Burnout residents were less averse to extending training (strongly agree or agree, 18.9\% vs 4.3\%, P=.04). The majority of residents (68.9\%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with establishing a 60-hour/week limit. Residents who met the criteria for burnout were more likely to agree that a 60-hour limit would be better than an 80-hour limit (strongly agree or agree, 22\% vs 8\%, P=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In this program, most Internal Medicine residents are strongly opposed to extending their training to 4 or 5 years and would prefer the current 80 hours/week cap. A longer, less intense pace of Internal Medicine training seems to be less attractive in the eyes of current trainees.},

	abstract = {Methods: We simultaneously surveyed samples of family practice residency directors, ﬁrst-year residents, and family physicians due for their ﬁrst board recertiﬁcation examination to determine, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, their opinions about the length and content of family practice residencies in the United States.
Results: Twenty-seven percent of residency directors, 32\% of residents, and 28\% of family physicians favored extending family practice residency to 4 years; very few favored 2- or 5-year programs. There was dispersion of opinions about possible changes within each group and among the three groups. Most in all three groups would be willing to extend residency for more training in ofﬁce-based procedures and sports medicine, but many were unwilling to extend residency for more training in surgery or hospital-based care. Residents expressed more willingness than program directors or family physicians to change training. Barriers to change included disagreement about the need to change; program ﬁnancing and opportunity costs, such as loss of income and delay in debt repayment; and potential negative impact on student recruitment.
Conclusion: Most respondents support the current 3-year model of training. There is considerable interest in changing both the length and content of family practice training. Lack of consensus suggests that a period of elective experimentation might be needed to assure family physicians are prepared to meet the needs and expectations of their patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The In-training Examination (ITE) is a frequently used method to evaluate family medicine residents' clinical knowledge. We compared  family medicine ITE scores among residents who trained in the 14 programs that  participated in the Preparing the Personal Physician for Practice (P4) Project to  national averages over time, and according to educational innovations. METHODS:  The ITE scores of 802 consenting P4 residents who trained in 2007 through 2011  were obtained from the American Board of Family Medicine. The primary analysis  involved comparing scores within each academic year (2007 through 2011),  according to program year (PGY) for P4 residents to all residents nationally. A  secondary analysis compared ITE scores among residents in programs that  experimented with length of training and compared scores among residents in  programs that offered individualized education options with those that did not.  RESULTS: Release of ITE scores was consented to by 95.5\% of residents for this  study. Scores of P4 residents were higher compared to national scores in each  year. For example, in 2011, the mean P4 score for PGY1 was 401.2, compared to the  national average of 386. For PGY2, the mean P4 score was 443.1, compared to the  national average of 427, and for PGY3, the mean P4 score was 477.0, compared to  the national PGY3 score of 456. Scores of residents in programs that experimented  with length of training were similar to those in programs that did not. Scores  were also similar between residents in programs with and without individualized  education options. CONCLUSIONS: Family medicine residency programs undergoing  substantial educational changes, including experiments in length of training and  individualized education, did not appear to experience a negative effect on  resident's clinical knowledge, as measured by ITE scores. Further research is  needed to study the effect of a wide range of residency training innovations on  ITE scores over time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Future of Family Medicine report advocated experimentation with 4-year residency training models. This study examines  residency applicants' opinions about extending the length of residency training  and seeks to determine which features of an extended program would be most  desirable to applicants. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive,  self-administered survey of residency applicant interviewees at Oregon's three  family medicine residency training programs in 2004-2005. The survey included  questions about demographics, factors influencing specialty choice, desirability  of longer training programs, and desirability of certain types of additional  training. RESULTS: A total of 155 surveys were returned, for an 89.1\% response  rate. Only 6\% of respondents indicated that length of training was "very  important" to their specialty choice; 85.0\% indicated a preference for a 4-year  program with or without specific experiences; 77.2\% indicated that extended  training would either increase their likelihood of choosing family medicine or  would not affect their decision; and 79.3\% indicated that a 4-year residency  would not make them less likely to choose family medicine over other primary care  specialties. Pregnancy care, trauma care, adolescent/child health, and procedural  skills were the most commonly desired areas for additional training. CONCLUSIONS:  Lengthening training to 4 years would have a neutral or positive effect on  applicants' interest in family medicine training in Oregon.},

This study compared applicant type, number of  applicants, match positions filled, matched applicant type, and ranks to fill  between 3-year (3YR) and 4-year (4YR) residencies. METHODS: The Length of  Training Pilot (LOTP) is a case-control study comparing 3YR (seven residencies)  and 4YR (six residencies) training models. We collected applicant and match data  from LOTP programs from 2012 to 2018 and compared data between 3YR and 4YR  programs. National data provided descriptive comparisons. An annual resident  survey captured resident perspectives on training program selection. Summary  statistics and corresponding t-tests and χ2 tests of independence were performed  to assess differences between groups. We used a linear mixed model to account for  repeated measures over time within programs. RESULTS: There were no differences  in the mean number of US MD, US DO, and international medical graduate applicants  between 3YR and 4YR programs. Both the 3YR and 4YR programs had a substantially  higher number of US MD and DO applicants compared to national averages. The  percentages of positions filled in the match and positions filled by US MDs, DOs  and IMGs were not different between groups. The percentage of residents in 4YR  programs who think training in family medicine requires a fourth year varied  significantly during the study period, from 35\% to 25\% (P\&lt;.001). The  predominant reasons for pursuing training in a 4YR program was a desire for more  flexibility in training and a desire to learn additional skills beyond clinical  skills. CONCLUSIONS: The applicant pool and match performance of the residencies  in the LOTP was not affected by length of training. Questions yet to be addressed  include length of training's impact on medical knowledge, scope of practice, and  clinical preparedness.},

	abstract = {Background General practice is becoming increasingly complex due to an ageing population with multiple morbidities and the shift of services from secondary to primary care, yet GP training remains largely the same. Extended training is now recommended, initially proposed as a fourth GP specialty trainee year, but more recently as a broad-based 4-year specialty training programme. Aim To explore the views of newly-qualified GPs about their training and preparedness for specific aspects of the GP’s role. Design and setting Qualitative study with newly-qualified GPs who qualified with Severn Deanery between 2007 and 2010.
Method Semi-structured interviews with 18 GPs between November 2011 and April 2012.
Results Gaining experience in a variety of primary care environments widens insight into patient populations as well as helping GPs develop adaptability and confidence, although this is not routinely part of GP training. However, alongside variety, having continuity with patients in practice remains important. Opportunities to be involved in the management of a practice or to take on substantial leadership roles also vary widely and this may limit preparedness and development of generalist skills.
Conclusion Extended training could help prepare GPs for the current challenges of general practice. It could ensure all trainees are exposed to a greater variety of primary care settings including those outside GP practice, as well as experience of business, finance, and leadership roles. Collectively, these changes have the potential to produce GPs with both generalist and enhanced skills, who are better prepared to work collaboratively across the organisational boundaries between primary, secondary, and community care.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

The primary outcome of ideal LoT was determined in two ways: 1) subjects provided the ideal total LoT in months and 2) then separately selected the type and number of rotations for an ideal EM residency curriculum by month, the sum of which provided an alternative measurement of their ideal LoT. We did not include vacation time. Descriptive statistics and an analysis of variance are reported.
Results: Response rate was 68.0\% (108/159) with 72\% of respondents (78/108) directing programs in the PGY 1–3 (36-month) format and 28\% directing PGY 1–4 (48-month) programs. More than half of subjects (51.9\%) have direct personal experience with both formats. When asked about ideal total LoT, PDs averaged 41.5 months (n = 107; SD = 5.5 months, range = 36–60 months). When asked to provide durations of individual clinical experiences for their ideal EM program, the sum total (n = 104) averaged 45.0 months. Results from a factorial analysis of variance revealed statistically signiﬁcant effects of PDs’ past training experiences: participants who trained in a 36-month program had statistically signiﬁcantly lower LoT (mean = 39.2 months) than participants who trained in a 48-month program (mean = 44.5 months). There was also a statistically signiﬁcant effect of current program format on ideal LoT: participants who directed a 36-month program had statistically signiﬁcantly lower LoT (mean = 39.8 months) than participants who directed a 48-month program (mean = 45.8 months).
Conclusions: PD opinion on ideal LoT averages between 36 and 48 months, but is longer when the sum of desired clinical rotations is considered. While half of the respondents reported direct experience with both PGY 1–3 and PGY 1–4 training programs, opinions on ideal LoT through both methods corresponded strongly with the length of the program the PDs trained in and the format of the program they currently direct. PD opinions may be too biased by their own experiences to provide objective input on the ideal LoT for EM residency programs.},

	abstract = {This article proposes doubly robust estimators for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in difference-in-differences (DID) research designs. In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

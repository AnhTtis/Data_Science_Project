    "abstract": "The multidimensionally-constrained covariant density functional theories (MDC-CDFTs) have been developed to study the influence of octupole and triaxial deformations on the ground state and fission properties. In this paper, we present a brief review of the applications of MDC-CDFTs and discuss the results of a systematical study of even-$A$ uranium isotopes with the MDC-RMF model which is one of MDC-CDFTs with pairing correlations treated by using the BCS approach. We examine in detail the two-dimensional potential energy surfaces $E(β_{20},β_{30})$ of these U isotopes and discuss the ground state and fission properties as well as third and fourth minima on the potential energy surfaces. The emphasis is put on the effects of octupole and triaxial deformations.",

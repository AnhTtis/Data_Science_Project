    "abstract": "We prove several universal properties of charge transport in generic CFTs holographic to nonminimal extensions of four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with exact electromagnetic duality invariance. First, we explicitly verify that the conductivity of these theories at zero momentum is a universal frequency-independent constant. Then, we derive their analytical expressions for non-zero momentum in any holographic duality-invariant theory for large frequencies and in the limit of small frequencies and momenta. Next, in the absence of terms that couple covariant derivatives of the curvature to gauge field strengths, two universal features are proven. On the one hand, it is shown that for a general-relativity neutral black-hole background the conductivities at any frequency and momentum are independent of the choice of duality-invariant theory, thus coinciding with those in the Einstein-Maxwell case. On the other hand, if higher-curvature terms affect the gravitational background, the conductivities get modified, but the contributions from nonminimal couplings of the gauge field to gravity are subleading. We illustrate this feature with an example.",

    "abstract": "Here we study the spectral radii of some linear hypergraphs, that is, the maximum moduli of the eigenvalues of their corresponding adjacency matrices. We determine the hypertrees having the largest to seventh-largest spectral radii. The hypertrees with the largest and the second-largest spectral radii among all those with a given diameter are identified here. Unicyclic hypergraphs with a fixed cycle length having the largest, the second-largest, and the third-largest spectral radii are also determined. Furthermore, we also find which bicyclic and tricyclic linear hypergraphs have the largest and the second-largest spectral radii.",

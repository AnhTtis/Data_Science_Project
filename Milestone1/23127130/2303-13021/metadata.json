    "abstract": "The pointwise space-time behaviors of the Green's function and the global solution to the modified Vlasov- Poisson-Boltzmann (mVPB) system in one-dimensional space are studied in this paper. It is shown that, the Green's function admits the diffusion wave, the Huygens's type sound wave, the singular kinetic wave and the remainder term decaying exponentially in space-time. These behaviors are similar to the Boltzmann equation (Liu and Yu in Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 57: 1543-1608, 2004). Furthermore, we establish the pointwise space-time nonlinear diffusive behaviors of the global solution to the nonlinear mVPB system in terms of the Green's function.",

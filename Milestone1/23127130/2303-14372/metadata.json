    "abstract": "This letter proposes a novel Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) traffic analysis and management model that estimates probable RAN traffic congestion and mitigate its effect by adopting a suitable handling mechanism. A computation approach is introduced to classify heterogeneous RAN traffic into distinct traffic states based on bandwidth consumption and execution time of various job requests. Further, a cloud-based traffic management is employed to schedule and allocate resources among user job requests according to the associated traffic states to minimize latency and maximize bandwidth utilization. The experimental evaluation and comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art methods reveal that it is effective in minimizing the worse effect of traffic congestion and improves bandwidth utilization and reduces job execution latency up to 17.07% and 18%, respectively.",

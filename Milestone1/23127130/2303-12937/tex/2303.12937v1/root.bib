   abstract = {In a disaster situation, the first 72 hours are very critical but most of times, the first responders are not able to contact those affected immediately. This can be due to lack of connectivity and communication in a disaster situation or due to network overloads or disasters taking place in a remote inaccessible area. The need for a reliable communication between those affected and those in line to rescue is of paramount importance. Traditional emergency communication methods prove to be efficient but they take at least 5 hours to fully establish, due to which the rescue operation is delayed. Nowadays, drones are used to survey the disaster situation and plan rescue operations. If the drones can be repurposed to provide a reliable communication network, it will help enabling the communication between responders and victims. This paper proposes a Ubiquity Network (UbiQNet) Architecture where drones are capable of forming a mesh network, and by using this the victims can communicate their situation and location to the responders. An ESP based system on chip is used along with a DJI drone to enable UbiQNet architecture. A communication algorithm to determine the neighbouring first responder nodes is also explained. This paper also demonstrates a mobile application to be used with the proposed UbiQNet architecture.},

   abstract = {For large-scale disasters, it is important to ensure communications to confirm the information about safety and disaster situation. Then, this paper focuses on an emergency communication system using drones. In this system, an important issue is to shorten the delay time of transmitting information. Since delay time depends highly on a flight scheme of the drones, we propose two flight schemes: a rebounding-flight scheme and a common-flight-path scheme. Moreover, we consider breaks of drones due to their battery exhaustion because it is impossible for the drones to fly permanently. We evaluate the delay time with and without drones' breaks for the proposed flight schemes. Our results show that the proposed flight schemes are effective to reduce the delay time even if the drones' breaks are considered.},

The demand for drone use has been increasing day by day due to their flexible design and easy installation that is customized for various applications. Accurate modeling of drone channels is essential for creating, development, and optimization of the drone-to-ground communication systems. In this study, the statistical properties of drone-to-ground channels are investigated via the measurements based on the received signal strength indicator (RSS/RSSI) provided by the IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi network standard. Using the measurements, the path loss exponent of the drone-ground channels is estimated. In addition, Rician, Nakagami-m and Log-normal distributions are adapted to the measurements obtained for different heights of the drone with the help of the maximum likelihood decision rule and the performance of these probability distributions in modeling the measured drone-ground channel statistics are compared with each other.},

The 80 flights fulfilled 26 missions for Debris/Damage/Flood Estimation, Strategic SA/Recon/Survey, and Ground Search covering response and recovery operations. The flights at Michael do not differ from other recent hurricanes, most notably Harvey. Besides the inclusion of night flights searching for victims, which appear to be a new task, Michael was very similar in terms of flight duration, when first person view (FPV) and preprogrammed (PP) control styles were used, and choice of platforms. In addition, the Hurricane Michael data set is available at <; hrail.crasar.org > for further analysis.},

   volume = {122},

   abstract = {The Internet of Drones (IoD) recently gained momentum due to its high adaptability to a wide variety of complex scenarios. Indeed, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can successfully be employed in different applications, such as agriculture, search and rescue missions, surveillance systems, mission-critical services, among others, thanks to some technological and practical advantages: high mobility, capability to extend wireless coverage areas, or ability to reach places inaccessible to humans. Moreover, the employment of drones promisingly improves the performance parameters of different network architectures, e.g., reliability, connectivity, throughput, and delay. Nevertheless, the adoption of networks of drones gives rise to several issues related to the intrinsic unreliability of the wireless medium, the duration of batteries, and the high mobility degree, which may cause frequent topology changes. Also security and privacy issues need to be properly investigated. This explains the very large number of works produced in the recent literature on IoD-related topics. With respect to other surveys on IoD-related topics, the goal of the present work is to categorize the multifaceted aspects of IoD, proposing a classification approach of the IoD environment that develops along two main directions. The IoD is initially introduced according to the possible applications and reference operating scenarios. On top of that, this work discussed with its applicability with a dedicated focus on the economical/social implications that the adoption of drones at scale may have. At a macroscopic level, it follows the structure of the Internet protocol stack, starting from the physical layer and extending to the upper layers, without neglecting cross-layer and optimization approaches. At a finer level, all the most relevant works belonging to each layer of the stack are further classified, according to the different issues that propose a peculiar challenges for each layer, and highlighting the most relevant differences with the other surveys present in literature. To provide a deeper insight, the present work embraces many facets of the IoD, with a thorough examination of privacy and security considerations. Finally, a discussion on the main research challenges and possible future directions is carried out, focusing on both open issues and the most promising technologies that deserve to be further developed in the IoD field.},

   abstract = {Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems with high-resolution cameras have been found useful for operations such as smart city and disaster management. These systems feature Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) that connect the computation edge with UAVs and a Ground Control Station (GCS) through air-to-ground wireless network links. Leveraging the edge/fog computation resources effectively with energy-latency-awareness, and handling intermittent failures of FANETs are the major challenges in supporting video processing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel “DroneCOCoNet” framework for drone video analytics that coordinates intelligent processing of large video datasets using edge computation offloading and performs network protocol selection based on resource-awareness. We present two edge computation offloading approaches, i.e., heuristic-based and reinforcement learning-based approaches. These approaches provide intelligent task sharing and co-ordination for dynamic offloading decision-making among UAVs. Our scheme handles the problem of computation offloading tasks in two separate ways: (i) heuristic decision-making process, and (ii) Markov decision process; wherein we aim to minimize the total computation costs as well as latency in the edge/fog resources while minimizing video processing times to meet application requirements. Our experimental results show that our heuristic-based offloading decision-making scheme enables lower scheduling time and energy consumption for low drone-to-ground server ratios. In comparison, our dynamic reinforcement learning-based decision-making approach increases the accuracy and saves overall time periodically. Notably, these results also hold in various other multi-UAV scenarios involving largely different numbers of detected objects in e.g., smart farming, transportation traffic flow monitoring and disaster response.},

    "abstract": "Consider two regions in the plane, bounded by an $n$-gon and an $m$-gon, respectively. At most how many connected components can there be in their intersection? This question was asked by Croft. We answer this asymptotically, proving the bounds $$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2}\\right\\rfloor \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\le f(n,m)\\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2}\\right\\rfloor \\cdot \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{m}{2} $$ where $f(n,m)$ denotes the maximal number of components and $m\\le n$. Furthermore, we give an exact answer to the related question of finding the maximal number of components if the $m$-gon is required to be convex: $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{m+n-2}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ if $n\\ge m+2$ and $n-2$ otherwise.",

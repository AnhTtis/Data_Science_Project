    "abstract": "Quantum teleportation can transfer an unknown quantum state between distant quantum nodes, which holds great promise in enabling large-scale quantum networks. To advance the full potential of quantum teleportation, quantum states must be faithfully transferred at a high rate over long distance. Despite recent impressive advances, a high-rate quantum teleportation system across metropolitan fiber networks is extremely desired. Here, we demonstrate a quantum teleportation system which transfers quantum states carried by independent photons at a rate of 7.1$\\pm$0.4 Hz over 64-km-long fiber channel. An average single-photon fidelity of $\\geqslant$ 90.6$\\pm$2.6% is achieved, which exceeds the maximum fidelity of 2/3 in classical regime. Our result marks an important milestone towards quantum networks and opens the door to exploring quantum entanglement based informatic applications for the future quantum internet.",

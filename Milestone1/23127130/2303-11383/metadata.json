    "abstract": "We show that every isomorphism between the lattice of topologies of two vector spaces such that vector topologies are maped to vector topologies is induced by a translation, a semilinear isomorphism and the complement map. If such an isomorphism exists, the coefficient fields are isomorphic as topological fields and these vector spaces have the same dimension. \\par Next, we show a similar result holds if there exists an isomorphism between the lattice of vector topologies which preserves Hausdorff vector topologies.",

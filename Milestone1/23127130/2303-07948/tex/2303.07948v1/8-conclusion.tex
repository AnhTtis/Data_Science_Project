\section{Conclusion}
We present VR Haptics at Home, where users repurpose common, existing objects and surfaces at home to provide casual, on-demand haptic feedback for more immersive VR experiences. We describe the rich design space using this method and developed a couple of applications. We conducted an in-the-wild study of our applications with VR users, from which we present design recommendations for future designers and developers that wish to use this technique.

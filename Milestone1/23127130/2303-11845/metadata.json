    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a group. We give a categorical definition of the $G$-equivariant $α$-induction for a neutral symmetric special $G$-equivariant Frobenius algebra in a $G$-braided multitensor category, which generalizes the $α$-induction for $G$-twisted representations of conformal nets. We define a new product of $G$-braided multitensor categories and introduce the notion of the neutral double of a split semisimple $G$-braided multitensor category. For a neutral symmetric special simple $G$-equivariant Frobenius algebra in a split spherical $G$-braided fusion category, we construct a $G$-equivariant Frobenius algebra, which we call a $G$-equivariant $α$-induction Frobenius algebra, in the neutral double. This construction generalizes Rehren's construction of $α$-induction Q-systems. Finally, we define the notion of the $G$-equivariant full center of a neutral symmetric special $G$-equivariant Frobenius algebra in a split spherical $G$-braided fusion category with nonzero dimension and show that it indeed coincides with the corresponding $G$-equivariant $α$-induction Frobenius algebra when both of them are well-defined, which generalizes a theorem of Bischoff, Kawahigashi and Longo.",

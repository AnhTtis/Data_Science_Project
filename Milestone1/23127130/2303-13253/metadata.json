    "abstract": "Understanding degrees of freedom is fundamental to characterizing physical systems. Counting them is usually straightforward, especially if we can assign them a clear meaning. For example, a particle moving in three-dimensional space has three degrees of freedom, one for each independent direction of motion. However, for more complex systems like spinning particles or coupled harmonic oscillators, things get more complicated since there is no longer a direct correspondence between the degrees of freedom and the number of independent directions in the physical space in which the system exists. This paper delves into the intricacies of degrees of freedom in physical systems and their relationship with configuration and phase spaces. We first establish the well-known fact that the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the dimension of the configuration space, but show that this is only a local description. A global approach will reveal that this space can have non-trivial topology, and in some cases, may not even be a manifold. By leveraging this topology, we gain a deeper understanding of the physics. We can then use that topology to understand the physics better as well as vice versa: intuition about the configuration space of a physical system can be used to understand non-trivial topological spaces better.",

\medskip

In this paper we established that the initial-value problem for the \textsc{KP}II equation with small enough initial data periodic in the $x$ direction and decaying in 
the $y$ direction is rigorously solved by using the \textsc{IST} method via a Riemann--Hilbert problem with shift on the boundary of infinite strips of the complex
plane. Regarding the existence of special solutions for \textsc{KP}II equation, semi-periodic in $x$ or $y$, we know that real but singular solutions were obtained in
\cite{DT21} with the $\conj{\partial}$-dressing method of Zakharov and Manakov. We leave for future study the investigation of other semi-periodic problems for
the \text{KP} equations.

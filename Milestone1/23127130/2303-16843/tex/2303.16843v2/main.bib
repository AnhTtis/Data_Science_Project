 abstract = {In dose—response studies, the dose range is often restricted because of concerns over drug toxicity and/or efficacy. We derive optimal designs for estimating the underlying dose—response curve for a restricted or unrestricted dose range with respect to a broad class of optimality criteria. The underlying curve belongs to a diversified set of link functions suitable for the dose—response studies and having a common canonical form. These include the fundamental binary response models—the logit and the probit, as well as the skewed versions of these models. Our methodology is based on a new geometric interpretation of optimal designs with respect to Kiefer's Φp criteria in regression models with two parameters, which is of independent interest. It provides an intuitive illustration of the number and locations of the support points of Φp-optimal designs. Moreover, the geometric results generalize the classical characterization of D-optimal designs by the minimum covering ellipsoid to the class of Kiefer's Φp criteria. The results are illustrated through the redesign of a dose ranging trial.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new Pareto-based coordinate exchange algorithm for populating or approximating the true Pareto front for multi-criteria optimal experimental design problems that arise naturally in a range of industrial applications. This heuristic combines an elitist-like operator inspired by evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms with a coordinate exchange operator that is commonly used to construct optimal designs. Benchmarking results from both a two-dimensional and three-dimensional example demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm can generate highly reliable Pareto fronts with less computational effort than existing procedures in the statistics literature. The proposed algorithm also utilizes a multi-start operator, which makes it readily parallelizable for high performance computing infrastructures.},

@article{CHEN199899,
	Abstract = {A supersaturated design investigates k factors in only n (<k+1) experimental runs. The goal for such a design is to identify, presumably only a few, relatively dominant effects with a cost as low as possible. While the construction of supersaturated designs has been widely explored, the data analysis aspect of such designs remains primitive. We study the following problem: How many dominant effects are allowed to make a meaningful data analysis possible for a supersaturated design with the maximum correlation ρ? The correlation here is defined as the cosine of the angle between two column vectors. The obtained results support the fundamental concern of the E(s2) criterion introduced by Booth and Cox (1962). Furthermore, under the normality assumption, we obtained a lower bound of the probability that the factor with the largest estimated effect has, indeed, the largest true effect. This bound depends on the relative size of the largest effect and the maximum correlation of the underlying design. Under some mild assumptions, we show that this probability is satisfactorily large. Consequently, by carefully constructing supersaturated designs, we not only save the cost of the experiment, but also make reliable inferences.},

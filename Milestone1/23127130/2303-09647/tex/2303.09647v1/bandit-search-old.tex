\begin{abstract}

Online anomaly search, also called sequential design of experiments, is a problem dating back at least to Chernoff (1959).  In it, multiple channels are available for sampling, one at a time, and any anomalous ones are to be identified.  The fundamental trade-off to be optimized is the trade-off between false-alarm rate and expected stopping time.  A particular challenge is a version of the problem in which the experimenter must suffer a time delay each time the observed channel index switches from one index to a different one.  Lambez and Cohen (2021) present a solution that is  asymptotically optimal as the false-alarm rate goes to zero, but only in the case where Bayesian prior probabilities of whether channels are anomalous are available.  In this paper, we propose a complementary algorithm for the non-Bayesian case, aiming to optimize worst-case, rather than average-case, expected detection delay subject to false-alarms.  Our algorithm makes use of recent work on multi-armed bandits by Rouyer et al. (2021). We present a theoretical bound on false-alarm rate and simulations indicating favorable performance relative to the round-robin quickest search algorithm of Lai et al. (2011).

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{A}{}fundamental problem in information theory and signal processing is online anomaly search.  With origins in Chernoff's sequential design of experiments \cite{chernoff1959sequential}, the aim of online anomaly search is to develop an efficient policy for sampling a subset of several channels over time that quickly and accurately identifies any anomalous ones.  An important application is clinical-trial design, where the drug tested in each trial depends on the drugs tested and outcomes obtained in all previous trials of the study.  
Another application is online search for an open channel in cognitive radio, where the sampling policy may depend on past observations.  
Many variations on Chernoff's method exist \cite{dragalin1996simple,nitinawarat2013controlled,naghshvar2013active,nitinawarat2015controlled,cohen2015active,huang2018active,tsopelakos2019sequential}, as do methods for handling an essentially infinite number of experiments \cite{lai2011quickest,malloy2012quickest,tajer2013quick,malloy2014sequential}.

Recently several authors have considered the problem of online anomaly search in which a delay is incurred any time the current channel sampled differs from the last one \cite{vaidhiyan2017neural, vaidhiyan2015active, lambez2021anomaly}.  This new formulation models online anomaly search more realistically than the traditional formulation because it accounts for possible switching delays in hardware or software.
% when a gimbeled radar searches two locations alternately with a switching time that is nonzero.  Another relevant scenario would be searching multiple locations for a target event using an autonomous platform, perhaps for disaster search-and-rescue.  
In a closely-related work to ours, Lambez and Cohen \cite{lambez2021anomaly} have proposed a method that balances false-alarm probability, sampling cost, and switching penalties/delays, and has state-of-the-art finite-sample performance.   However, their method relies upon the Bayesian assumption that each channel's prior probability of being anomalous is known,  and does not provide any insight in the case where no such priors are available.  In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a method that has desirable \emph{worst-case}, rather than average-case, performance. Our method is based on an algorithm designed for multi-armed bandits with switching costs \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}.  For simplicity we assume that the number of anomalous channels and the number of channels that can be sampled at each time is one.

In Section~\ref{sec:background} we provide some background and a formal problem statement.  In Section~\ref{sec:proposed} we present our method and a bound on its false-alarm rate.  In Section~\ref{sec:simulations} we present simulations comparing our method to a popular round-robin method. In Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we present our conclusions.

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

\subsection{Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits with Switching Costs} \label{subsec:bandits}

The stochastic multi-armed bandit problem is a model for many sequential decision making problems, including ad-serving and clinical-trial design.  In this paper, we consider a variation of it in which sampling from a different arm than the previous one results in a switching cost $\lambda \ge 0$, as formulated by \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}.  The problem setup is that there are $K$ arms, where arm~$i$ produces the i.i.d. stream $X_1^i, X_2^i, \dots$ in a sample space $\mathcal{X}$ ($i\in\{1,2,\dots, K\}$).  Each observation is associated with a \emph{loss} $\ell_{t,i} = \ell(X^i_t)$ for some measurable function $\ell: \mathcal{X}\to [0,1]$.  
Given the sampling-loss history of $(i_1, \ell_{1,i_1}, i_2, \ell_{2,i_2},\dots, i_t, \ell_{t,i_t})$, we would like to inductively select an index $i_{t+1}\in \{1,2,\dots, K\}$ to minimize the \emph{pseudo-regret}.  This pseudo-regret is defined as the expected value of the cumulative loss: the sum of the gaps between the ideal loss and the realized ones, plus $\lambda$ times the number of switches.  In other words, denoting the pseudo-regret by $R(T,\lambda)$, we have:
% and we wish to determine a function $J_t \in \{1,2,\dots, K\}$ so that the expected cumulative regret which arm to sample next based on all the arms and observations sampled so far.  In practice, this decision is usually based on \emph{losses} observed: given $\ell:\mathcal{X}\to [0,1]$ we observe losses $\ell_{t,i} = \ell(X^i_t)\in [0,1]$, and decide at time $t+1$ to sample an arm $J_{t+1}$ based only on the $\ell_{t, J_t}$, $s=1,2,\dots, t$.  At each time $t$, the algorithm may select an arm $J_t$ based on the losses and choices that have occured so far.  The goal is to minimize the  pseudo-regret
\begin{align*}
R(T,\lambda) & = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T\ell_{t,i_t}\right] - \min_i \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T\ell_{t,i}\right] \\
& + \lambda \sum_{t=1}^T \mathrm{Pr}(i_{t-1} \ne i_t).
\end{align*}

% there are several possible ``arms'' that a player may play one at a time, each of which yields a reward sampled from some unknown but stationary distribution.  Arm choices are sequential---meaning, they may depend on past arm choices and observations. The goal is choose arms so that the expected total reward is within some bound of the maximum possible expected total reward. In other words, we wish to find an allocation rule whose total expected reward approximates the total expected reward that would be earned by an ``oracle'' that knows the best arm a priori.

Optimal algorithms for minimizing $R(T,\lambda)$ over some fixed or receding time horizon are generally computationally intractable \cite{hero2007foundations}.  Instead, one often resorts to finding algorithms for which $R(T,\lambda)$ is sub-linear  in $T$. For $\lambda=0$ the UCB family of algorithms provides several examples \cite{lattimore2020bandit}. The case of $\lambda\ne 0$ is significantly more challenging, but fortunately a solution with sub-linear pseudo-regret exists and is provided in \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}.  Their solution, referred to as the Tsallis-Switch algorithm, can be obtained for time horizon $T$ by setting $b=\infty$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:tsallis-alg}.  The choice $b=\infty$ makes the functions $f_1$ and $f_0$ and the algorithm's output irrelevant, but they will become important in the next section.

% One strategy is to play each arm in succession until one has a reasonably good idea of the arm's payoff is obtained.  However, this strategy has the disadvantage that it can require a relatively large number of plays before the correct arm can be determined.  A better family of strategies is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) family.  This family is ``rate-optimal,'' meaning effectively that the number of incorrect arm choices is optimally small up to asymptotic constants \cite{lattimore2020bandit}.  

% When a sensing agent changes data streams to observe, there is often some time lag before the new stream can be sensed.  For example, data structures may have to be destroyed and re-initialized, a radar on a gimbel may have to rotate to a new position, or a robot may have to get near to its target.  In this case, the agent incurs an opportunity cost of however many samples could have been taken during the switch.  If $\lambda$ is the number of samples lost per switch, there is a recent generalization of the UCB algorithm that minimizes total expected sampling cost called Tsallis-Switch \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}. If each sample is drawn from a common sample space $\mathcal{X}$ and the stage-wise loss function is $\ell:\mathcal{X}\to[0,1]$, the Tsallis-Switch algorithm for time horizon $T$ can be obtained by setting $b=\infty$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:tsallis-alg}.  The choice $b=\infty$ makes the functions $f_1$ and $f_0$ and the algorithm's output irrelevant, but they will become important in the next section.

As promised, Tsallis-Switch induces a regret with a sub-linear bound in $T$, given to first order in the proposition below.
\begin{prop} \label{prop:main}
Suppose $\Delta_i = \mathbb{E}\ell_{1,i}- \min_i \mathbb{E}\ell_{1,i}$, and there is a constant $\Delta > 0$ so that $\Delta_i = \Delta$ for all but one $i$.  Then the pseudo-regret of Tsallis-Switch satisfies
\begin{align*}
R(T,\lambda)  = \frac{K-1}{\Delta}\mathcal{O}\left((\lambda K)^{2/3}T^{1/3}+\log T\right).
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
\noindent Indeed, \cite[Theorem~1]{rouyer2021algorithm} indicates the upper bound on $R(T,\lambda)$ can be taken to be the concave function of $T$
\begin{align*}
    & \left(66(\lambda K)^{2/3}T^{1/3} + 32\log T\right)\frac{K-1}{\Delta} \\
    & + \left(160\lambda^{2/3}T^{1/3}K^{1/6} + 160\lambda + 49\lambda^2+32\right)\frac{K-1}{\Delta} \\
    & + \frac{544\lambda}{\sqrt{K}} + \lambda + 66.
\end{align*}


% Notes on this section:




\subsection{Anomaly Search}

% For the purpose of the Research Objectives discussed below, we introduce here the quickest search for change point problem (QSC), which is modeled similarly to SQS.

In this section, we formally describe the problem of anomaly search with switching costs, which is closely related to the bandit problem above.  Assume as before there 
 are $K$ channels (previously referred to as arms), where channel~$i$ produces
 the i.i.d. stream $X_1^i, X_2^i, \dots$ in a sample space $\mathcal{X}$ ($i\in\{1,2,\dots, K\}$). 
% there are $K$ channels, each  producing independent observations $X^i_1, X^i_2,\dots$ in a sample space $\mathcal{X}$ for $i=1,2,\dots, K$, and that exactly one channel can be sampled at any given time.  
Assume the observations $X^{i^*}_t$ have distribution $F_1$ (p.d.f. $\effone$) and that for $i\ne i^*$, the observations $X^i_t$ have distribution $F_0$ (p.d.f. $f_0$).  
Given that $i_1, i_2, \dots, i_t$ were the previously sampled channel indices, we would like to inductively determine from  the \emph{sampling-observation history} $H_t = (i_1, X^{i_1}_1, i_2, X^{i_2}_2, \dots, i_t, X^{i_t}_t)$ whether to sample some channel $i_{t+1} = i_{t+1}(H_t)$ or stop sampling completely.    
Note that the sampling-observation history differs from the sample-loss history of Section~\ref{subsec:bandits} in that the sampling-observation history does not explicitly involve a loss function. If $\tau$ is the number of samples taken before stopping, we define $\tautilde$ to be $\tau + \sum_{t=1}^{\tau-1} \mathbf{1}(i_t \ne i_{t+1})$, the detection delay including switching costs.  Upon stopping, we make a terminal decision $\delta\in \{1,2,\dots, K\}$ based on the sampling history as to which channel is anomalous.  We define a \emph{sampling policy} to be a tuple $(\{i_t\}_{t=1}^\infty, \tau, \delta)$, also called a \emph{scanning rule} by Dragalin \cite{dragalin1996simple}, who considered the case where $\lambda = 0$.

Let $\mathrm{Pr}_i$ and $\mathbb{E}_i$ denote the probability and expectation given that the anomalous stream has index $i$.  Similarly to Dragalin \cite{dragalin1996simple}, we call a sampling policy \emph{worst-case optimal}  if it minimizes  $\max_i\mathbb{E}_i\tautilde$ subject to the constraints $\mathrm{Pr}_i(\delta \ne i) \le \gamma$ for $i=1,2,\dots, K$
and a given~$\gamma > 0$.  
This type of optimality, not Bayesian optimality, is the type that we aim to approximate in this paper.

\section{Proposed Method and False-Alarm Rate} \label{sec:proposed}

The proposed method makes use of a measurable loss function $\ell:\mathcal{X}\to[0,1]$, where the nominal channels are penalized more on average than the anomalous ones. The only difference between the proposed method and the Tsallis-Switch algorithm is that instead of infinite $b$ and finite $\myem$ in \proposed{}, we take $\myem$ to be infinite and $b$ to be finite.  This choice of an infinite time horizon  allows the algorithm to run until the detection threshold of $b$ is reached.

As in Proposition~\ref{prop:main}, let $\Delta > 0$ be the common value of $\mathbb{E}\ell_{1,i} - \mathbb{E}\ell_{1,i^*}$ for $i\ne i^*$.  The following theorem estimates the false-alarm rate of \proposed{} in terms of the error probabilities of a Wald sequential hypothesis ratio test (SPRT) \cite{wald1943tests,wald1945sequential}. 
\begin{thm} {\color{red} Ideal target theorem}
% Let $\Delta$ be the common value of $\mathbb{E}\ell(X^i_1) - \mathbb{E}\ell(X^{i^*}_1)$ for $i\ne i^*$. 
Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the type-I and type-II error probabilities of an SPRT of $F_0$ versus $F_1$ with thresholds $0$ and $b$.  Then the false-alarm rate $P_{FA}$ of \proposed{} is bounded above according to
\[
P_{FA} \le 1 - (1-\beta)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \beta^{n-1} \left(1-\alpha\right)^{\min\{(K-1)n,\phi(n)\}},
\]
where $\phi(n)$ is the (concave) function that satisfies the functional equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:thm-main}
\phi(n) = C\frac{K-1}{\Delta^2} \left(\lambda\sqrt{K(\phi(n) + n)}+\log\left(\phi(n) + n\right)\right)
\end{equation}
for some absolute constant $C$ determined by Proposition~\ref{prop:main}.
% for $n\ge 1$ and some $C$ depending only on $F_0$ and $F_1$.
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
We note that, by a perturbative analysis, $\phi(n)$ is to first order $C\frac{K-1}{\Delta^2}\left(\lambda\sqrt{Kn}+\log n\right)$.  For the exact value of $\phi(n)$ required by the theorem, a numerical solver can be employed.  We also note that this bound is stronger than the bound found in \cite[Theorem~1]{dragalin1996simple}.
%We further note that the false-alarm bound for the algorithm of \cite{dragalin1996simple} (which is essentially equivalent to the algorithm in \cite{lai2011quickest}) can be recovered if the exponent of $1-\alpha$ is weakened to $(K-1)n$.
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
Observe from \proposed{} that the procedure uses block sampling with block lengths of $B_1, B_2, \dots$.  
% We consider the probability of detection $P_D= 1-P_{FA}$. 
Let the random integer $N$ be the number of blocks from channel $i^*$ and $M$ be the number of blocks from other channels that are observed before a decision.  % By the law of total probability 
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:total-prob-N}
%     P_D = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathrm{Pr}_{i^*}[\delta = i^* \mid N = n]\Pr[N=n].
% \end{equation}
% Consider $\mathrm{Pr}_{i^*}[\delta=i^*, M=m \mid N=n]$.  Since $\delta=i^* $ precisely when $m$ SPRTs of nominal channels fail to cross the detection threhsold, and since the outcomes of these SPRTs are independent of $M$ and $N$, this probability is $(1-\alpha)^m \Pr[M=m\mid N=n]$. {\color{red} this is actually not true ... }
% Summing over $m$ and using Jensen's inequality yields
% \begin{align}
%     \mathrm{Pr}_{i^*}[\delta = i^*, N=n] & = \mathbb{E}[(1-\alpha)^M \mid N = n] \nonumber \\
%     & \ge (1-\alpha)^{E_n}, \label{eq:jensen-cond}
% \end{align}
% where $E_n = \mathbb{E}[M \mid N=n]$.
% Combining \eqref{eq:total-prob-N} and \eqref{eq:jensen-cond} yields
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:second-pd}
% P_D \ge \sum_{n=1}^\infty (1-\alpha)^{E_n} \mathrm{Pr}[N=n].
% \end{equation}

% Let $N_1$ be the number of anomalous blocks sampled before a decision when there are no nominal arms (i.e., when $K=1$).  Then \begin{equation} \label{eq:bd-pr-N}
%     \beta^{n-1} = \mathrm{Pr}[N_1 \ge n] \ge \Pr[N \ge n \mid N \ge 1] ,
% \end{equation} for $n\ge 1$, since false alarms are possible when $K > 1$.  
% Since $M$ and $N$ are positively correlated, $E_n$ is increasing.  Using the fact that $\Pr[N=n] = \Pr[N \ge n] - \Pr[N \ge n+1]$ and re-grouping terms in the summation in \eqref{eq:second-pd}, we get that the right hand side of \eqref{eq:second-pd} is equal to
% \begin{align*}
% & (1-\alpha)^{E_1}\Pr[N \ge 1] \\
% &+ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \Pr[N \ge n] [(1-\alpha)^{E_n}-(1-\alpha)^{E_{n-1}}].
% \end{align*}
% Dividing by $\Pr[N\ge 1]$ and using \eqref{eq:bd-pr-N} and the fact that equality is achieved in \eqref{eq:bd-pr-N} when $n=1$, the above is greater than or equal to 
% \begin{align*}
% & (1-\alpha)^{E_1}\Pr[N_1 \ge 1] \\ 
% & + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \Pr[N_1 \ge n] [(1-\alpha)^{E_n}-(1-\alpha)^{E_{n-1}}],
% \end{align*}
% Re-grouping terms again and using $\Pr[N_1=n] = \beta^{n-1}(1-\beta)$, this is equal to
% \[
% \sum_{n=1}^\infty (1-\alpha)^{E_n} \beta^{n-1}(1-\beta).
% \]
% Thus,
% \[
% P_D \ge \Pr[N \ge 1] \sum_{n=1}^\infty (1-\alpha)^{E_n}\beta^{n-1}(1-\beta).
% \]


% Using \eqref{eq:bd-pr-N} and the fact that the coefficients of $\mathrm{Pr}[N=n]$ in \eqref{eq:second-pd} are decreasing in $n$, it is an exercise in summation by parts to show that
% \begin{equation*}\label{eq:third-pd}
% P_D \ge \sum_{n=1}^\infty (1-\alpha)^{E_n}\beta^{n-1}(1-\beta).
% \end{equation*}

Consider $E_n = \mathbb{E}[M\mid N=n]$. A simple upper bound for $M$ is the sum of the number of incorrect samples up to the terminal number of blocks $M + N$.  This follows from the fact that the number of nominal blocks observed is smaller than the number of nominal samples taken before the procedure terminates.  The time of termination is bounded above by $\psi(M+N) := \sum_{j=1}^{M+N} B_j$, which is of order $(M+N)^{3/2}\lambda /\sqrt{K}$, using an approximation by the integral $\int_1^{M+N} B(x)\, dx$ with $B(x) = (3\lambda/2)\sqrt{x/K}$. We will bound $E_n$ from above in two ways. %: first, by conditioning on $T_n$ and using Proposition~\ref{prop:main}.

For the first estimate, since the pseudo-regret is $\Delta$ times the expected number of incorrect samples plus the expected switching costs, an upper bound for $\mathbb{E}[M \mid M+N]$ is $\Delta^{-1} R(\psi(M+N),\lambda)$.  It follows  from Proposition~\ref{prop:main} that $\Delta^{-1} R(\psi(M + N), \lambda)$ is order
\begin{align*}
    & \frac{K-1}{\Delta^2}\left\{ (\lambda K)^{2/3}\left((M + N)^{3/2}\lambda/\sqrt{K}\right)^{1/3} + \log(M + N)\right\} \\
    & = \frac{K-1}{\Delta^2}\left(\lambda\sqrt{K(M+N)}+\log(M+N)\right).
\end{align*}
Thus, by taking the expectation given $N=n$, using the tower law, and using concavity,
\begin{align*}
& E_n \\
&\le C \frac{K-1}{\Delta^2} \mathbb{E}\left[\lambda\sqrt{K(M + N)}+\log(M +N) \mid N=n\right], \\
    % \mathbb{E}[M_n] & \le \frac{1}{\Delta} \mathbb{E} R(\psi(M_n+n),\lambda) \\
    % & \le \frac{1}{\Delta} R(\psi(\mathbb{E}M_n + n), \lambda) \\
    & \le C \frac{K-1}{\Delta^2} \left(\lambda\sqrt{K(E_n+ n)}+\log(E_n + n)\right),
\end{align*}
for some absolute constant $C$.  It follows that $E_n$ is bounded above by $\phi(n)$, where $\phi(n)$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:thm-main}.  

We now bound $E_n$ a second way.  The algorithm \proposed{} treats all channels equally initially, and tends to favor sampling from the anomalous channel over the nominal ones on average over any fixed number of blocks.  It must therefore be that if $n$ anomalous blocks are sampled, the expected number of blocks allocated to each nominal channel is at most $n$.  This means that $E_n \le (K-1)n$.

% From the argument above, we have that $$1-P_{FA} \ge (1-\beta)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \beta^{n-1}(1-\alpha)^{\min\{(K-1)n,\phi(n)\}},$$
% which, by rearrangement of terms, is the same as the desired result.

% Assume that a correct detection is made the $(n+1)^\text{th}$ time a block of samples from arm $i^*$ is observed.  Then, the first $n$ blocks resulted in a miss, each with probability $\beta$, and the final block resulted in a detection, with probability $1-\beta$.  Assume further $N_n$ is the (random) number of blocks observed from arms with $i\ne i^*$ before detection.  

% We iterate over the number of times a block from channel $i^*$ is observed but no detection occurs.  Given that this number is $n$, the number of prior blocks from channels other than $i^*$ that are observed is a random integer $N_n$.  
% \[
% \mathrm{Pr}_i[\delta = i \mid N_1, N_2, \dots] = (1-\beta)\sum_{n=0}^\infty \beta^n (1-\alpha)^{N_n}
% \]
% Taking the expectation of both sides and using convexity gives
% \[
% \mathrm{Pr}_i[\delta = i] \ge (1-\beta)\sum_{n=0}^\infty \beta^n (1-\alpha)^{\mathbb{E}N_n}
% \]
% Using the upper bound of $R(\sum_{i=1}^n B_i, \lambda)$ on $\Delta\mathbb{E}N_n$ gives the desired result.
\end{proof}


\section{Simulations} \label{sec:simulations}

In this section we simulate our algorithm and a baseline one.  We choose $X^i_t\sim \mathcal{N}(-\mu,1)$ for $i < K$ and $\mathcal{N}(\mu,1)$ for $i=K$.  (In other words, $i^*=K$.) We choose $\ell$ to be the map $1-\Phi$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$, where $\Phi$ is the standard normal c.d.f., although it is possible improved maps exist.  A competing algorithm is the round-robin algorithm of \cite{lai2011quickest}, which is essentially identical to the one in \cite{dragalin1996simple}.  Although this algorithm is designed for the case where the number $K$ of channels goes to infinity, it provides a reasonable baseline for other algorithms when $K$ is finite as well.  The cyclical algorithm, \laipoor{}, is presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:linear-qs}.

We compare the two algorithms in two settings: one ``hard'' and one ``easy.''  For the hard setting, we set $\lambda=1$, $\mu=0.1$, and $K=22$, in which case $\Delta \approx 0.05$.  This is similar to, but more difficult than, the hard setting in \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}, in which $\Delta$ is $0.05$ and $K=8$.  For the easy setting, we set $\lambda=0.025$, $\mu=0.4$, and $K=8$, in which case $\Delta \approx 0.2$.  This is analogous to the easy setting in \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}.  
% (For $\mu = 0.1$, $\Delta \approx 0.0528$, which is considered the ``hard'' case in \cite{rouyer2021algorithm}.)  
For each setting and several values of the threshold $b$, 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to estimate the false-alarm probability and expected stopping time.  The results, in Figures~\ref{fig:ROC} and~\ref{fig:ROC-easy}, indicate a savings of roughly 33\% of the samples needed for a decision.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have proposed a method for anomaly search using recent developments in multi-armed bandit theory.  We have shown through simulations that the method appears to dominate a round-robin method that is common in the anomaly-search literature.  Further, we have shown in Theorem~\ref{eq:thm-main} that the false-alarm rate of our method is bounded above by a nontrivial quantity that is numerically efficient to compute in terms of the detection threshold $b$.

A natural question for future research is whether a similar bound can be obtained for the expected stopping time.  Although we have given this question some consideration, the answer appears to be a challenge: for example, summations involving the number of samples taken during various intervals appear not to be easily analyzable using Wald's identity, due to the dependency of the later samples on earlier ones.  Another question is whether the function $\phi(n)$ in Theorem~\ref{eq:thm-main} is order-optimal.  That is, could it be replaced with a slower-growing function, such as a logarithmic function.  And if $\phi(n)$ is order-optimal, it would be beneficial to optimize constants such as $C$ subject to computational constraints.

% The IEEEtran\_HOWTO.pdf is the complete guide of \LaTeX\ for manuscript preparation included with this stuff. 


% \subsection{Information for Authors}

% {\em IEEE Signal Processing Letters} allows only four-page articles. A fifth page is allowed for ``References'' only, though ``References'' may begin before the fifth page. Author biographies or photographs are not allowed in Signal Processing Letters. Please review the Information for Authors at for {\em IEEE Signal Processing Letters:} https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-signal-processing-letters/information-authors-spl



% \section{Guidelines for Graphics Preparation and Submission}
% \label{sec:guidelines}

% \subsection{Types of Graphics}
% The following list outlines the different types of graphics published in 
% {\it IEEE Signal Processing Letters}. They are categorized based on their construction, and use of 
% color/shades of gray:

% \subsubsection{Color/Grayscale figures}
% {Figures that are meant to appear in color, or shades of black/gray. Such 
% figures may include photographs, illustrations, multicolor graphs, and 
% flowcharts.}

% \subsubsection{Line Art figures}
% {Figures that are composed of only black lines and shapes. These figures 
% should have no shades or half-tones of gray, only black and white.}

% \subsubsection{Tables}
% {Data charts which are typically black and white, but sometimes include 
% color.}



% \subsection{Multipart figures}
% Figures compiled of more than one sub-figure presented side-by-side, or 
% stacked. If a multipart figure is made up of multiple figure
% types (one part is lineart, and another is grayscale or color) the figure 
% should meet the stricter guidelines.

% \subsection{File Formats For Graphics}\label{formats}
% Format and save your graphics using a suitable graphics processing program 
% that will allow you to create the images as PostScript (PS), Encapsulated 
% PostScript (.EPS), Tagged Image File Format (.TIFF), Portable Document 
% Format (.PDF), Portable Network Graphics (.PNG), or Metapost (.MPS), sizes them, and adjusts 
% the resolution settings. When 
% submitting your final paper, your graphics should all be submitted 
% individually in one of these formats along with the manuscript.

% \subsection{Sizing of Graphics}
% Most charts, graphs, and tables are one column wide (3.5 inches/88 
% millimeters/21 picas) or page wide (7.16 inches/181 millimeters/43 
% picas). The maximum depth a graphic can be is 8.5 inches (216 millimeters/54
% picas). When choosing the depth of a graphic, please allow space for a 
% caption. Figures can be sized between column and page widths if the author 
% chooses, however it is recommended that figures are not sized less than 
% column width unless when necessary.

% \end{table}


% \subsection{Resolution }
% The proper resolution of your figures will depend on the type of figure it 
% is as defined in the ``Types of Figures'' section. Author photographs, 
% color, and grayscale figures should be at least 300dpi. Line art, including 
% tables should be a minimum of 600dpi.

% \subsection{Vector Art}
% In order to preserve the figures' integrity across multiple computer 
% platforms, we accept files in the following formats: .EPS/.PDF/.PS. All 
% fonts must be embedded or text converted to outlines in order to achieve the 
% best-quality results.


% \subsection{Accepted Fonts Within Figures}
% When preparing your graphics IEEE suggests that you use of one of the 
% following Open Type fonts: Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, Cambria, and 
% Symbol. If you are supplying EPS, PS, or PDF files all fonts must be 
% embedded. Some fonts may only be native to your operating system; without 
% the fonts embedded, parts of the graphic may be distorted or missing.

% A safe option when finalizing your figures is to strip out the fonts before 
% you save the files, creating ``outline'' type. This converts fonts to 
% artwork what will appear uniformly on any screen.

% \subsection{Using Labels Within Figures}

% \subsubsection{Figure Axis labels }
% Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than 
% symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization,'' or 
% ``Magnetization M,'' not just ``M.'' Put units in parentheses. Do not label 
% axes only with units. As in Fig. 1, for example, write ``Magnetization 
% (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization (A$\cdot$m$^{-1}$),'' not just ``A/m.'' Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and 
% units. For example, write ``Temperature (K),'' not ``Temperature/K.'' 

% Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization (kA/m)'' or 
% ``Magnetization (10$^{3}$ A/m).'' Do not write ``Magnetization 
% (A/m)$\,\times\,$1000'' because the reader would not know whether the top 
% axis label in Fig. 1 meant 16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be 
% legible, approximately 8 to 10 point type.

% \subsubsection{Subfigure Labels in Multipart Figures and Tables}
% Multipart figures should be combined and labeled before final submission. 
% Labels should appear centered below each subfigure in 8 point Times New 
% Roman font in the format of (a) (b) (c). 

% \subsection{File Naming}
% Figures (line artwork or photographs) should be named starting with the 
% first 5 letters of the author's last name. The next characters in the 
% filename should be the number that represents the sequential 
% location of this image in your article. For example, in author 
% ``Anderson's'' paper, the first three figures would be named ander1.tif, 
% ander2.tif, and ander3.ps.

% Tables should contain only the body of the table (not the caption) and 
% should be named similarly to figures, except that `.t' is inserted 
% in-between the author's name and the table number. For example, author 
% Anderson's first three tables would be named ander.t1.tif, ander.t2.ps, 
% ander.t3.eps.

% \subsection{Referencing a Figure or Table Within Your Paper}
% When referencing your figures and tables within your paper, use the 
% abbreviation ``Fig.'' even at the beginning of a sentence. Do not abbreviate 
% ``Table.'' Tables should be numbered with Roman Numerals.

% \subsection{Checking Your Figures: The IEEE Graphics Analyzer}
% The IEEE Graphics Analyzer enables authors to pre-screen their graphics for 
% compliance with IEEE Transactions and Journals standards before submission. 
% The online tool, located at
% \underline{http://graphicsqc.ieee.org/}, allows authors to 
% upload their graphics in order to check that each file is the correct file 
% format, resolution, size and colorspace; that no fonts are missing or 
% corrupt; that figures are not compiled in layers or have transparency, and 
% that they are named according to the IEEE Transactions and Journals naming 
% convention. At the end of this automated process, authors are provided with 
% a detailed report on each graphic within the web applet, as well as by 
% email.

% For more information on using the Graphics Analyzer or any other graphics 
% related topic, contact the IEEE Graphics Help Desk by e-mail at 
% graphics@ieee.org.

% \subsection{Submitting Your Graphics}
% Because IEEE will do the final formatting of your paper,
% you do not need to position figures and tables at the top and bottom of each 
% column. In fact, all figures, figure captions, and tables can be placed at 
% the end of your paper. In addition to, or even in lieu of submitting figures 
% within your final manuscript, figures should be submitted individually, 
% separate from the manuscript in one of the file formats listed above in 
% Section \ref{formats}. Place figure captions below the figures; place table titles 
% above the tables. Please do not include captions as part of the figures, or 
% put them in ``text boxes'' linked to the figures. Also, do not place borders 
% around the outside of your figures.

% \subsection{Color Processing/Printing in IEEE Journals}
% All IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters allow an author to publish 
% color figures on IEEE Xplore\textregistered\ at no charge, and automatically 
% convert them to grayscale for print versions. In most journals, figures and 
% tables may alternatively be printed in color if an author chooses to do so. 
% Please note that this service comes at an extra expense to the author. If 
% you intend to have print color graphics, include a note with your final 
% paper indicating which figures or tables you would like to be handled that 
% way, and stating that you are willing to pay the additional fee.


% \section{Conclusion}

% A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in American English is without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Use the singular heading even if you have many acknowledgments. Avoid expressions such as ``One of us (S.B.A.) would like to thank . . . .'' Instead, write “F. A. Author thanks ... .” In most cases, sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are placed in the unnumbered footnote on the first page, not here.

% \section*{References and Footnotes}

% \subsection{References}

% References need not be cited in text. When they are, they appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation.  Multiple references are each numbered with separate brackets. When citing a section in a book, please give the relevant page numbers. In text, refer simply to the reference number. Do not use ``Ref.'' or ``reference'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference [3] shows . . . .'' Please do not use automatic endnotes in {\em Word}, rather, type the reference list at the end of the paper using the ``References'' style.

% Reference numbers are set flush left and form a column of their own, hanging out beyond the body of the reference. The reference numbers are on the line, enclosed in square brackets. In all references, the given name of the author or editor is abbreviated to the initial only and precedes the last name. Use them all; use {\em et al.} only if names are not given. Use commas around Jr., Sr., and III in names. Abbreviate conference titles.  When citing IEEE transactions, provide the issue number, page range, volume number, year, and/or month if available. When referencing a patent, provide the day and the month of issue, or application. References may not include all information; please obtain and include relevant information. Do not combine references. There must be only one reference with each number. If there is a URL included with the print reference, it can be included at the end of the reference.

% Other than books, capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols. For papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation. See the end of this document for formats and examples of common references. For a complete discussion of references and their formats, see the IEEE style manual at www.ieee.org/authortools.

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts (Insert $\mid$ Footnote).\footnote{It is recommended that footnotes be avoided (except for the unnumbered footnote with the receipt date on the first page). Instead, try to integrate the footnote information into the text.}  Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited; do not put footnotes in the reference list (endnotes). Use letters for table footnotes (see Table I).

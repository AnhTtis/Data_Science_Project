 abstract = {Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a popular data-analytic tool for studying the relationship between a set of predictors and a categorical response. In this paper we describe a penalized version of LDA. It is designed for situations in which there are many highly correlated predictors, such as those obtained by discretizing a function, or the grey-scale values of the pixels in a series of images. In cases such as these it is natural, efficient and sometimes essential to impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the coefficients, both for improved prediction performance and interpretability. We cast the classification problem into a regression framework via optimal scoring. Using this, our proposal facilitates the use of any penalized regression technique in the classification setting. The technique is illustrated with examples in speech recognition and handwritten character recognition.},

 abstract = {Let x(1) denote the square of the largest singular value of an n × p matrix X, all of whose entries are independent standard Gaussian variates. Equivalently, x(1) is the largest principal component variance of the covariance matrix X'X, or the largest eigenvalue of a p-variate Wishart distribution on n degrees of freedom with identity covariance. Consider the limit of large p and n with n/p = γ ≥ 1. When centered by $\mu_p = (\sqrt{n - 1} + \sqrt p)^2$ and scaled by $\sigma_p = (\sqrt{n - 1} + \sqrt p)(1/\sqrt{n - 1} + 1/ \sqrt p)^{1/3}$, the distribution of x(1) approaches the Tracy-Widom law of order 1, which is defined in terms of the Painleve II differential equation and can be numerically evaluated and tabulated in software. Simulations show the approximation to be informative for n and p as small as 5. The limit is derived via a corresponding result for complex Wishart matrices using methods from random matrix theory. The result suggests that some aspects of large p multivariate distribution theory may be easier to apply in practice than their fixed p counterparts.},

@article{12637108320171201,
Abstract = {Markowitz (1952) portfolio selection requires an estimator of the covariance matrix of returns. To address this problem, we promote a nonlinear shrinkage estimator that is more flexible than previous linear shrinkage estimators and has just the right number of free parameters (i.e., the Goldilocks principle). This number is the same as the number of assets. Our nonlinear shrinkage estimator is asymptotically optimal for portfolio selection when the number of assets is of the same magnitude as the sample size. In backtests with historical stock return data, it performs better than previous proposals and, in particular, it dominates linear shrinkage. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

\caption{\small \emph{Layout Extension.} We adapt the procedure in SOAT~\cite{chong2021stylegan} for 2D layout extension. Operating on each layer of the generator, we take the incoming feature grid $\Feature_l$, and construct the outgoing feature grid using the generator weights conditioned on each corner latent code $\LatentCode$ (the conditioning uses weight modulation on the mapping network outputs in StyleGAN2~\cite{karras2020analyzing}). Then, these four outgoing feature maps are multiplied with bilinear weights $\Bilinear$ and the result is summed, to obtain the blended feature for the next layer $\Feature_{l+1}$. }

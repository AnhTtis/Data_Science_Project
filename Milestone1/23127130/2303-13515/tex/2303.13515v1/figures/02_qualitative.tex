\caption{\small \emph{Visualization of nearby and extrapolated camera motion.} Each row shows a set of sampled viewpoints, shown in an overhead view in the first column, and the corresponding rendered images in the other columns. Our model enables 3D-consistent view synthesis, visible under rotating or translating camera trajectories. We can also extrapolate the layout features at inference time, enabling camera motions outside of the training camera distribution (shown as a black square in the last two rows) with a consistent scene style.}\label{fig:qualitative}\vspace{-12pt}

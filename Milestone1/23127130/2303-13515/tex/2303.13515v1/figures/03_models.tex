\caption{\small \emph{Comparison to auto-regressive and bounded-volume 3D generative models.} Each row shows results for a given method on two generated scenes under different camera motion, along with a disparity map. Compared to InfiniteNature-Zero, our model enables long-range view synthesis by rendering a global scene description from different viewpoints, rather than auto-regressively predicting successive frames. 3D generative models like EG3D and GSN do not support view extrapolation on unbounded scenes. See our webpage for animated results. }\label{fig:models}\vspace{-10pt}

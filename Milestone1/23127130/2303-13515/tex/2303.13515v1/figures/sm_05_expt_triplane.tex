\caption{\small \emph{Diagram of Extended Triplane Representation.} The extended triplane representation adds a sequence of orthogonal vertical feature planes outlined in pink in addition to the ground plane features outlined in white \textbf{(left)}. Each unit consists of a triplane representation~\cite{chan2022eg3D} generated from three independent generators -- $\Generator_{XY}$, $\Generator_{XZ}$, and $\Generator_{YZ}$ -- tied to the same latent code and mapping network \textbf{(right)}. At inference time, the features of each generator are stitched along the appropriate dimensions using the SOAT procedure~\cite{chong2021stylegan}.}

\small Our approach enables unconditional synthesis of unbounded 3D nature scenes with a persistent scene representation (\textbf{left}), using a scene layout grid representing a large-scale terrain model (depicted above as the checkered ground plane). This representation enables us to generate arbitrary camera trajectories, such as the six numbered views shown along a cyclic camera path
(\textbf{center}).
The \emph{persistence} inherent to our representation stands in contrast to prior auto-regressive methods~\cite{li2022infinitenature} that do not preserve consistency under circular camera trajectories (\textbf{right}); 
while the two images shown on the right are at the start and end of a cyclic path, the terrain depicted is completely different. Our method %
is trained solely from unposed, single-view landscape photos.

\caption{\small \emph{Overview of scene layout decoding.} The layout generator $\GeneratorLand$ samples a random latent code to produce a 2D 
scene layout grid 
$\FeatureLand$ representing the shape and appearance of a terrain map, and which can be spatially extended using a grid of latent codes (see \S~\ref{sec:extension}).
To render an image from a given camera, 
sampled points along camera rays passing over the feature plane are decoded via an MLP into a color feature $\FeatureColor$ and density $\sigma$, which are then volume rendered. This produces a low-resolution image, mask, depth, image features, and a projected noise pattern, which are provided to a refinement network $\GeneratorUpsample$ to produce final image, mask, and depth outputs.

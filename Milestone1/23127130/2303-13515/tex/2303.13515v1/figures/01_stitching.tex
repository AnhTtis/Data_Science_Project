\caption{\small \emph{Layout extension procedure.} To extend the layout at inference time, we sample noise codes \LatentCode in a grid arrangement. %
To smoothly transition between adjacent feature grids, we use the SOAT (StyleGAN of All Trades) procedure~\cite{chong2021stylegan} in 2D. Operating on a $2\times 2$ sub-grid, we apply each generator layer four times in fully convolutional manner over the entire sub-grid, each time conditioned on a different corner latent code \LatentCode, before multiplying by bilinear blending weights. This process is repeated for each layer of the generator and each sub-grid. Each $2\times 2$ sub-grid produces a $2H \times 2W$ feature grid, and sub-grids are blended together in an overlapping fashion to obtain an extended feature grid $\FeatureLand$ of arbitrary spatial size.

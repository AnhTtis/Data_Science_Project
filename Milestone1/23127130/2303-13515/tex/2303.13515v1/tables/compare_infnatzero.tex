\caption{\small \emph{Comparison with InfiniteNature-Zero.} Using camera motions from InfiniteNature-Zero, we evaluate image quality as FID on 5K images after moving 100 steps forward ($C_\text{forward}$), one-step consistency as the L1 error when backwards warping one camera step, and cycle consistency as the L1 error between the original frame and the result after a pair of forward/backward steps. InfiniteNature-Zero is more consistent for a single step, but it has non-zero cyclic consistency error, and image quality degrades after repeated model applications. L1 values are multiplied by 100 throughout.}

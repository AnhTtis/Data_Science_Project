\caption{\small \emph{Extended Layout vs. Extended Triplane}
While the extended layout representation presented in the main paper attains better image quality (lower FID scores), the extended triplane representation offers improved consistency (lower one-step consistency error) and dramatically faster video rendering (as the layout model requires supersampling for video smoothness). We hypothesize that inference-time camera adjustments and interpolation between vertical feature planes may negatively impact FID for the extended triplane model, despite its ability to generate more complex and diverse landscape geometry.

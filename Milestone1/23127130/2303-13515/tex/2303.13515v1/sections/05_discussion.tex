\section{Discussion and conclusion}

\myparagraph{Limitations.}
A few drawbacks of our model include costly volume rendering limiting the resolution of $\ImageLR$, imperfect 3D consistency due to image-space refinement, and imperfect or repeating geometry decoded from the scene layout features. We elaborate in the supplemental. 

\myparagraph{Conclusion.}
We present an unconditional world generator for unbounded synthesis of persistent 3D nature scenes.
We build persistent world representation by modeling scene content with a spatially extendable layout feature grid which can be decoded via volume rendering to form a terrain image.
This rendered terrain is combined with a separate skydome, representing infinitely far content, to synthesize novel viewpoints supporting nearby and distant camera motions.
Altogether, our model enables 3D consistent image generation and view synthesis of unbounded scenes learned from single-view, unposed landscape photos.

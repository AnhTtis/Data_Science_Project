In supplemental materials, we investigate an alternative 3D feature representation based on extendable triplane units~\ref{sec:sm_triplane}. We provide additional implementation details of our method in Section~\ref{sec:sm_method}, additional ablations in Section~\ref{sec:sm_experiment}, and 
we provide further discussion on our model in Section~\ref{sec:sm_discussion}.

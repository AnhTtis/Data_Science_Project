    "abstract": "We propose a new way to measure inequalities such as the glass ceiling effect in attributed networks. Existing measures typically rely solely on node degree distribution or degree assortativity, but our approach goes beyond these measures by using mutual information (based on Shannon and more generally, Renyi entropy) between the conditional probability distributions of node attributes given node degrees of adjacent nodes. We show that this mutual information measure aligns with both the analytical structural inequality model and historical publication data, making it a reliable approach to capture the complexities of attributed networks. Specifically, we demonstrate this through an analysis of citation networks. Moreover, we propose a stochastic optimization algorithm using a parameterized conditional logit model for edge addition, which outperforms a baseline uniform distribution. By recommending links at random using this algorithm, we can mitigate the glass ceiling effect, which is a crucial tool in addressing structural inequalities in networks.",

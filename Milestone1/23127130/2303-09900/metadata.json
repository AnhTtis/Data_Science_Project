    "abstract": "Given a split classical group of symplectic type and a split general linear group over a local field $F$, we use Langlands-Shahidi method to construct their Rankin-Selberg local $γ$-factors and prove the corresponding analytic stability for generic representations. The idea generalizes the work of J. Cogdell, F. Shahidi, T.-L. Tsai in 2017 and D. She in 2023 in the study of asymptotic behaviors of partial Bessel functions. Different from the known cases, suppose $P=MN$ is the maximal parabolic subgroup with Levi component $M\\simeq \\mathrm{GL}_r\\times\\mathrm{Sp}_{2m}$ that defines the local factors, the action of the maximal unipotent subgroup of $M$ on $N$ have non-trivial stabilizers, and the space of integration for the corresponding local coefficient is no longer isomorphic to a torus. We will separate its toric part out in our cases and show that it plays the same role as the torus over which the integral representing the local coefficient is taken in the known cases. This is a new phenomenon with sufficient generality and we believe that it may provide us with a possible direction towards a uniform proof of stability of Langlands-Shahidi $γ$-factors in our future work.",

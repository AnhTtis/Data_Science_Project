    "abstract": "We study hypersurfaces of the four-dimensional Thurston geometry $\\text{Sol}^4_0$, which is a Riemannian homogeneous space and a solvable Lie group. In particular, we give a full classification of hypersurfaces whose second fundamental form is a Codazzi tensor, including totally geodesic hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces with parallel second fundamental form, and of totally umbilical hypersurfaces of $\\text{Sol}^4_0$. We also give a closed expression for the Riemann curvature tensor of $\\text{Sol}^4_0$, using two integrable complex structures.",

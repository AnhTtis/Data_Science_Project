abstract = {The online precision mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE/CERN was recently upgraded by adding a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separator/ spectrometer (MR-ToF MS) between the linear radio-frequency ion trap and the two Penning traps already in place. As a mass separator, the MR-ToF device has improved significantly ISOLTRAP's capability of purification of contaminated ion beams. In addition, the MR-ToF MS can be operated as a mass spectrometer, either to analyze the ISOLDE ion beam or for precision mass measurements of nuclides that are shorter-lived or that have lower yields than those accessible for Penning-trap mass spectrometry. The MR-ToF MS and corresponding components, its integration into ISOLTRAP, and its various operation modes are reviewed. Furthermore, a precision measurement of the 137Eu mass is presented, determined with the help of the MR-ToF device as a mass separator. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Resonance ionization mass spectroscopy (RIMS) in the presence of an external static electric field has been used for the determination of photoionization thresholds. Extrapolation of the thresholds obtained with different electric field strengths to zero field strength directly leads to the first ionization potential (IP). The ionization potentials of the transplutonium elements americium, curium, berkelium and californium could be measured for the first time. Due to the high sensitivity of RIMS, samples of only 1012 atoms have been used. The results are: IPAm = 5.9738(2) eV, IPCm = 5.9915(2) eV, IPBk = 6.1979(2) eV and IPCf = 6.2817(2) eV. The same technique was applied to thorium, neptunium and plutonium, yielding IPTh = 6.3067(2) eV, IPNp = 6.2655(2) eV and IPPu = 6.0258(2) eV. Plotted as a function of the number of electrons N, the actinide ionization potentials can be approximated by two straight lines joining at the half-filled shell when normalized to ionization from the lowest fNS2 level to the lowest fNs level. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Useful yields from resonance ionization mass spectrometry can be extremely high compared to other mass spectrometry techniques, but uranium analysis shows strong matrix effects arising from the tendency of uranium to form strongly bound oxide molecules that do not dissociate appreciably on energetic ion bombardment. We demonstrate a useful yield of 24% for metallic uranium. Modeling the laser ionization and ion transmission processes shows that the high useful yield is attributable to a high ion fraction achieved by resonance ionization. We quantify the reduction of uranium oxide surface layers by Ar+ and Ga+ sputtering. The useful yield for uranium atoms from a uranium dioxide matrix is 0.4% and rises to 2% when the surface is in sputter equilibrium with the ion beam. The lower useful yield from the oxide is almost entirely due to uranium oxide molecules reducing the neutral atom content of the sputtered flux. We demonstrate rapid isotopic analysis of solid uranium oxide at a precision of <0.5% relative standard deviation using relatively broadband lasers to mitigate spectroscopic fractionation.},

@article{Schmidt2018,
abstract = {An overview is given on some of the main advances in the experimental methods, experimental results, theoretical models and ideas of the last few years in the field of nuclear fission. New approaches have considerably extended the availability of fissioning systems for the experimental study of nuclear fission, and have provided a full identification of all fission products in A and Z for the first time. In particular, the transition from symmetric to asymmetric fission around 226 Th, some unexpected structures in the mass distributions in the fission of systems around Z = 80-84, and an extended systematics of the odd-even effect in the fission fragment Z distributions have all been measured (Andreyev et al 2018 Rep. Prog. Phys. 81 016301). Three classes of model descriptions of fission presently appear to be the most promising or the most successful. Self-consistent quantum-mechanical models fully consider the quantum-mechanical features of the fission process. Intense efforts are presently being made to develop suitable theoretical tools (Schunck and Robledo 2016 Rep. Prog. Phys. 79 116301) for modeling the non-equilibrium, large-amplitude collective motion leading to fission. Stochastic models provide a fully developed technical framework. The main features of the fission-fragment mass distribution have been well reproduced from mercury to fermium and beyond (M{\"{o}}ller and Randrup 2015 Phys. Rev. C 91 044316). However, limited computer resources still impose restrictions, for example, on the number of collective coordinates and on an elaborate description of the fission dynamics. In an alternative semi-empirical approach (Schmidt et al 2016 Nucl. Data Sheets 131 107), considerable progress in describing the fission observables has been achieved by combining several theoretical ideas, which are essentially well known. This approach exploits (i) the topological properties of a continuous function in multidimensional space, (ii) the separability of the influence of fragment shells and the macroscopic properties of the compound nucleus, (iii) the properties of a quantum oscillator coupled to a heat bath of other nuclear degrees of freedom, (iv) an early freeze-out of collective motion, and (v) the application of statistical mechanics for describing the thermalization of intrinsic excitations in the nascent fragments. This new approach reveals a high degree of regularity and allows the calculation of high-quality data that is relevant to nuclear technology without specifically adjusting the empirical data of individual systems. },

In particular, we analyze the importance of nuclear physics input such as beta-decay rates; nuclear masses; neutron-capture cross sections; beta-delayed neutron emission; probability of spontaneous fission, beta-and neutron-induced fission, fission fragment mass distributions; neutrino-induced reaction cross sections, etc. We highlight the effects on models for r-process nucleosynthesis of newly measured $\beta$-decay half-lives, masses, and spectroscopy of neutron-rich nuclei near the r-process path. We overview r-process nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind above the proto-neutron star in core collapse supernovae along with the possibility of magneto-hydrodynamic jets from rotating supernova explosion models. We also consider the possibility of neutron star mergers as an r-process environment. A key outcome of newly measured nuclear properties far from stability is the degree of shell quenching for neutron rich isotopes near the closed neutron shells. This leads to important constraints on the sites for r-process nucleosynthesis in which freezeout occurs on a rapid timescale.},

From the initial population of a compound nucleus after $\beta$-decay, we follow the statistical decay taking into account competition between neutrons, $\gamma$-rays, and fission. We find a region of the chart of nuclides where the probability of $\beta$-delayed fission is $\sim100$%, that likely prevents the production of superheavy elements in nature. For a subset of nuclei near the neutron dripline, neutron multiplicity and the probability of fission are both large, leading to the intriguing possibility of multi-chance $\beta$-delayed fission, a new decay mode for extremely neutron-rich heavy nuclei. In this new decay mode, $\beta$-decay can be followed by multiple neutron emission leading to subsequent daughter generations which each have a probability to fission. We explore the impact of $\beta$-delayed fission in rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) nucleosynthesis in the tidal ejecta of a neutron star--neutron star merger and show that it is a key fission channel that shapes the final abundances near the second $r$-process peak.},

We investigate the source of these actinide differences in order to determine whether these variations are due to natural differences in astrophysical sites, or due to the uncertain nuclear properties that are accessed in r-process sites. We find that variations between relative stellar actinide abundances is most likely astrophysical in nature, owing to how neutron-rich the ejecta from an r-process event may be. Furthermore, if an r-process site is capable of generating variations in the neutron-richness of its ejected material, then only one type of r-process site is needed to explain all levels of observed relative actinide enhancements.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, through technological, experimental and theoretical advances, the situation in experimental fission studies has changed dramatically. With the use of advanced production and detection techniques both much more detailed and precise information can now be obtained for the traditional regions of fission research and, crucially, new regions of nuclei have become routinely accessible for fission studies. This work first of all reviews the recent developments in experimental fission techniques, in particular the resurgence of transfer-induced fission reactions with light and heavy ions, the emerging use of inverse-kinematic approaches, both at Coulomb and relativistic energies, and of fission studies with radioactive beams. The emphasis on the fission-fragment mass and charge distributions will be made in this work, though some of the other fission observables, such as prompt neutron and $\gamma$-ray emission will also be reviewed. A particular attention will be given to the low-energy fission in the so far scarcely explored nuclei in the very neutron-deficient lead region. They recently became the focus for several complementary experimental studies, such as $\beta$-delayed fission with radioactive beams at ISOLDE(CERN), Coulex-induced fission of relativistic secondary beams at FRS(GSI), and several prompt fusion-fission studies. The synergy of these approaches allows a unique insight in the new region of asymmetric fission around 180 Hg, recently discovered at ISOLDE. Recent extensive theoretical efforts in this region will also be outlined. The unprecedented high-quality data for fission fragments, completely identified in Z and A, by means of reactions in inverse kinematics at FRS(GSI) and VAMOS(GANIL) will be also reviewed. These experiments explored an extended range of mercury-to-californium elements, spanning from the neutron-deficient to neutron-rich nuclides, and covering both asymmetric, symmetric and transitional fission regions. Some aspects of heavy-ion induced fusion-fission and quasifission reactions will be also discussed, which reveal their dynamical features, such as the fission time scale. The crucial role of the multi-chance fission, probed by means of multinucleon-transfer induced fission reactions, will be highlighted. The review will conclude with the discussion of the new experimental fission facilities which are presently being brought into operation, along with promising 'next-generation' fission approaches, which might become available within the next decade.},

abstract = {The interest to perform laser spectroscopy in the heaviest elements arises from the strong impact of relativistic effects, electron correlations and quantum electrodynamics on their atomic structure. Once this atomic structure is well understood, laser spectroscopy also provides access to nuclear properties such as spins, mean-square charge radii and electromagnetic moments in a nuclear-model independent way. This is of particular interest for the heaviest actinides around N=152, a region of shell-stabilized deformed nuclei. The experimental progress of laser spectroscopy in this region benefitted from continuous methodological and technical developments such as the introduction of buffer-gas-stopping techniques that enabled the access to ever more exotic nuclei far-off stability. The key challenges faced in this endeavor are small yields, nuclides with rather short half-lives and the need to search for atomic transitions in a wide spectral range guided by theoretical predictions. This paper describes the basics of the most common experimental methods and discusses selected recent results on the atomic and nuclear properties of the actinides up to nobelium where pioneering experiments were performed at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum f{\"{u}}r Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany.},

abstract = {Long-lived isotopes of plutonium were studied using two complementary techniques, high-resolution resonance ionization spectroscopy (HR-RIS) and collinear laser spectroscopy (CLS). Isotope shifts have been measured on the 5f67s27F0→5f56d27s(J=1) and 5f67s27F1→5f67s7p(J=2) atomic transitions using the HR-RIS method and the hyperfine factors have been extracted for the odd mass nuclei Pu239,241. CLS was performed on the 5f67s8F1/2→J=1/2(27523.61cm-1) ionic transition with the hyperfine A factors measured for Pu239. Changes in mean-squared charge radii have been extracted and show a good agreement with previous nonoptical methods, with an uncertainty improvement by approximately one order of magnitude. Plutonium represents the heaviest element studied to date using collinear laser spectroscopy.},

In order to identify these atomic states extensive laser spectroscopy has to be performed. The lasers employed at TRIUMF's laser ion source are birefringent filter tuned titanium:sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers which are designed for long term frequency stability rather than continuous tuning. The design and characteristics of a grating tuned, high repetition rate, pulsed Ti:Sa laser for spectroscopy applications are presented. This laser allows fast scans of up to 40 THz with a laser linewidth of approximately 6 GHz.

@article{Fedosseev2017,
abstract = {At ISOLDE the majority of radioactive ion beams are produced using the resonance ionization laser ion source (RILIS). This ion source is based on resonant excitation of atomic transitions by wavelength tunable laser radiation. Since its installation at the ISOLDE facility in 1994, the RILIS laser setup has been developed into a versatile remotely operated laser system comprising state-of-the-art solid state and dye lasers capable of generating multiple high quality laser beams at any wavelength in the range of 210-950 nm. A continuous programme of atomic ionization scheme development at CERN and at other laboratories has gradually increased the number of RILIS-ionized elements. At present, isotopes of 40 different elements have been selectively laser-ionized by the ISOLDE RILIS. Studies related to the optimization of the laser-atom interaction environment have yielded new laser ion source types: the laser ion source and trap and the versatile arc discharge and laser ion source. Depending on the specific experimental requirements for beam purity or versatility to switch between different ionization mechanisms, these may offer a favourable alternative to the standard hot metal cavity configuration. In addition to its main purpose of ion beam production, the RILIS is used for laser spectroscopy of radioisotopes. In an ongoing experimental campaign the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of long isotopic chains have been measured by the extremely sensitive in-source laser spectroscopy method. The studies performed in the lead region were focused on nuclear deformation and shape coexistence effects around the closed proton shell Z = 82. The paper describes the functional principles of the RILIS, the current status of the laser system and demonstrated capabilities for the production of different ion beams including the high-resolution studies of short-lived isotopes and other applications of RILIS lasers for ISOLDE experiments.},

In many cases the ISOL (Isotope Separation On-Line) method can provide beams of high intensity and purity. Limitations in terms of accessible chemical species and minimum half-life are driven mainly by chemical reactions and physical processes inside of the thick target. A wide range of materials are in use, ranging from thin metallic foils and liquids to refractory ceramics, while poly-phasic mixed uranium carbides have become the reference target material for most ISOL facilities world-wide. Target material research and development is often complex and especially important post-irradiation analyses are hindered by the high intrinsic radiotoxicity of these materials. However, recent achievements have proven that these investigations are possible if the effort of different facilities is combined, leading to the development of new material matrices that can supply new beams of unprecedented intensity and beam current stability.},

	abstract = {The properties of exotic nuclei on the verge of existence play a fundamental part in our understanding of nuclear interactions. Exceedingly neutron-rich nuclei become sensitive to new aspects of nuclear forces. Calcium, with its doubly magic isotopes 40 Ca and 48 Ca, is an ideal test for nuclear shell evolution, from the valley of stability to the limits of existence. With a closed proton shell, the calcium isotopes mark the frontier for calculations with three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. Whereas predictions for the masses of 51 Ca and 52 Ca have been validated by direct measurements, it is an open question as to how nuclear masses evolve for heavier calcium isotopes. Here we report the mass determination of the exotic calcium isotopes 53 Ca and 54 Ca, using the multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer of ISOLTRAP at CERN. The measured masses unambiguously establish a prominent shell closure at neutron number N = 32, in excellent agreement with our theoretical calculations. These results increase our understanding of neutron-rich matter and pin down the subtle components of nuclear forces that are at the forefront of theoretical developments constrained by quantum chromodynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Investigation into the properties and structure of unstable nuclei far from stability is a key avenue of research in modern nuclear physics. These efforts are motivated by the continual observation of unexpected structure phenomena in nuclei with unusual proton-to-neutron ratios. In recent decades, laser spectroscopy techniques have made significant contributions in our understanding of exotic nuclei in different mass regions encompassing almost the entire nuclear chart. This is achieved through determining multiple fundamental properties of nuclear ground and isomeric states, such as nuclear spins, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments and charge radii, via the measurement of hyperfine structures and isotope shifts in the atomic or ionic spectra of the nuclei of interest. These properties offer prominent tests of recently developed state-of-the-art nuclear theory and help to stimulate new developments in improving the many-body methods and nucleon–nucleon interactions at the core of these models. With the aim of exploring more exotic short-lived nuclei located ever closer to the proton and neutron driplines, laser spectroscopy techniques, with their continuous technological developments towards higher resolution and higher sensitivity, are extensively employed at current- and next-generation radioactive ion beam facilities worldwide. Ongoing efforts in parallel promise to improve the availability of these even more exotic species at next-generation facilities. Very recently, an innovative application of laser spectroscopy on molecules containing short-lived nuclei has been demonstrated offering additional opportunities for several fields of research, e.g. fundamental symmetry studies and astrophysics. In this review, the basic nuclear properties measurable with laser spectroscopy will be introduced. How these observables are associated with nuclear structure and nucleon–nucleon interactions will be discussed. Following this, a general overview of different laser spectroscopy methods will be given with particular emphasis on technical advancements reported in recent years. The main focus of this article is to review the numerous highlights that have resulted from studying exotic nuclei in different mass regions with laser spectroscopy techniques since the last edition in this series. Finally, the challenges facing the field in addition to future opportunities will be discussed.},

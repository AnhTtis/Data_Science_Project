    "abstract": "Particles with masses much larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$, can be pair-produced non-adiabatically during inflation. Due to their large masses, the produced particles modify the curvature perturbation around their locations. These localized perturbations eventually give rise to localized signatures on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in particular, pairwise hotspots (PHS). In this work, we show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) provide a powerful tool for identifying PHS on the CMB. While for a given hotspot profile a traditional Matched Filter Analysis is known to be optimal, a Neural Network learns to effectively detect the large variety of shapes that can arise in realistic models of particle production. Considering an idealized situation where the dominant background to the PHS signal comes from the standard CMB fluctuations, we show that a CNN can isolate the PHS with $\\mathcal{O}(10)\\%$ efficiency even if the hotspot temperature is $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ times smaller than the average CMB fluctuations. Overall, the CNN search is sensitive to heavy particle masses $M_0/H_I=\\mathcal{O}(200)$, and constitutes one of the unique probes of very high energy particle physics.",

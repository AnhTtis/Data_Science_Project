    "abstract": "Detecting malicious activity within an enterprise computer network can be framed as a temporal link prediction task: given a sequence of graphs representing communications between hosts over time, the goal is to predict which edges should--or should not--occur in the future. However, standard temporal link prediction algorithms are ill-suited for computer network monitoring as they do not take account of the peculiar short-term dynamics of computer network activity, which exhibits sharp seasonal variations. In order to build a better model, we propose a source separation-inspired description of computer network activity: at each time step, the observed graph is a mixture of subgraphs representing various sources of activity, and short-term dynamics result from changes in the mixing coefficients. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

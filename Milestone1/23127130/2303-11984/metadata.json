    "abstract": "We consider a certain class of simplicial complexes which includes the independence complexes of forests. We show that if a simplicial complex $K$ belongs to this class, then the polyhedral join $\\mathcal{Z}^*_{K}(\\underline{X}, \\emptyset)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of CW complexes of the form $Σ^r X_{i_1} * X_{i_2} * \\cdots * X_{i_k}$, where $\\underline{X}$ is a family $\\{X_i\\}_{i \\in V(K)}$ of CW complexes and $Σ$ denotes the unreduced suspension. This result is applied to study the homotopy type of the independence complex of the lexicographic product $G[H]$ of a graph $H$ over a forest $G$. We denote by $L_m$ a tree on $m$ vertices with no branches. We show that the geometric realization of the independence complex of $L_m [H]$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres if $m \\neq 2,3$ and the geometric realization of the independence complex of $H$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of same dimensional spheres.",

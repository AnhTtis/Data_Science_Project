%\subsection*{Verse and Song Translation}
\noindent
\textbf{Lyrics and Song translations} have recently drawn attention from the NLP community. 
Automatic lyrics translation has been approached by rule-based methods, statistical machine translation methods, finite-state methods with rhythmic and lexical constraints~\citep{spanish_verse, Manurung2004AnEA, He_Zhou_Jiang_2012}, and more recently by neural methods~\citep{ghazvininejad-etal-2016-generating,ghazvininejad-etal-2017-hafez, ghazvininejad-etal-2018-neural}. 
Traditional song translation research has made progress in terms of lyrics translation and lyrics-melody alignment through linguistic knowledge~\citep{interplay_lyrics_melody,low_2003,low2008translating,low_2022,three_d_of_singability,trans_of_music}. 
Often, the object of these research was artificial songs. 
These methods pursue lyrics-melody alignment and lyrics translation in separate tracks.

Previous works~\citep{hokamp-liu-2017-lexically,lakew-etal-2019-controlling,li-etal-2020-rigid,zou_controllable} on constraining the decoding process are shown to be effective in performance and convenient in implementation. 
Others that impose constraints during training, such as adding format embedding ~\citep{li-etal-2020-rigid}, introducing special tags and rescoring length control ~\citep{lakew-etal-2019-controlling,saboo-baumann-2019-integration}, are data-driven methods and show good performance. 
In this paper, we propose the lyrics translation model with lyrics-melody alignments for domain shift and length control, and overcome the problem of domain mismatch and data sparsity by using monolingual data. 

%\subsection*{Lyrics Generation and Alignment Prediction}
\noindent
\textbf{Lyrics Generation with Alignment Prediction}, one of the most important tasks in automatic song production, has received much attention recently. 
Most of the current works~\citep{lee-etal-2019-icomposer,Chen2020MelodyConditionedLG,songmass,telemelody,ai_lyricist,xue-etal-2021-deeprapper} adopt the sequence generation method, but with different objectives. 
Some constrain rhythmic alignment, others theme and target genre. 
Other works~\citep{songmass,telemelody} apply the attention mechanism and find the lyrics-melody alignment via dynamic programming on the attention weights matrix. 
This method sometimes results in non-monotonic output. 
% and requires relatively large amounts of data in training
% Most importantly, perhaps, is that its alignment component is akin to a rule-based fixed constraint rather than an integrated unit that learns the dynamic alignment during training.

In our proposal, we take advantage of the monotonic nature of the lyrics-melody alignments and design a light neural network for alignment prediction in parallel to the translation process.

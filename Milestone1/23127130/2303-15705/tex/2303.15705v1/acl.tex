Song translation requires both translation of lyrics and alignment of music notes so that the resulting verse can be sung to the accompanying melody, which is a challenging problem that has attracted some interests in different aspects of the translation process. In this paper, we propose \underline{L}yrics-Melody \underline{T}ranslation with \underline{A}daptive \underline{G}rouping (\modelname), a holistic solution to automatic song translation by jointly modeling lyrics translation and lyrics-melody alignment. It is a novel encoder-decoder framework that can simultaneously translate the source lyrics and determine the number of aligned notes at each decoding step through an adaptive note grouping module. To address data scarcity, we commissioned a small amount of training data annotated specifically for this task and used large amounts of augmented data through back-translation. Experiments conducted on an English-Chinese song translation data set show the effectiveness of our model in both automatic and human evaluations.\footnote{The audio and score samples can be found at \href{LTAG2023.github.io}{\texttt{LTAG2023.github.io}}}

% Lyrics translation, in fact, is a part of song translation which requires other important considerations such as alignment to the music notes so that the result is not just a piece of text of any length or number of syllables but a verse that can be sung to the accompanying melody.

% In this paper, we consider the problem of song translation in a holistic manner by jointly modeling the translation of the lyrics and the alignment to the melody. We propose a novel encoder-decoder framework that can simultaneously translate the lyrics and predict the appropriate alignment between the text tokens and music notes. 
% Our \underline{L}yrics-Melody \underline{T}ranslation with \underline{A}daptive \underline{G}rouping (\modelname) framework is an adaptive note grouping model that dynamically determines the number of aligned notes at each decoding step. 
% Because data in this domain are especially scarce, we use both larger amounts of back-translated data and smaller amounts of supervised data commissioned specially for this purpose. 
% Experiments on English-Chinese bilingual song data set show the effectiveness and the potential of our model both in automatic and human evaluations. Both the audio and score samples can be found at \href{LTAG.github.io}{\texttt{LTAG.github.io}}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose \modelname, a lyrics translation model with lyrics-melody alignments that allows simultaneous generation of target text and alignment to the music notes. 
We propose an adaptive grouping method that fits in the auto-regressive translation process. 
To better train and evaluate our model, we also annotate a new song translation data set \datasetname~containing English and Chinese songs with their cover version in both languages and with lyrics-melody alignments. 
For training, we also employ back-translation to leverage the more abundantly available monolingual lyrics data with lyrics-melody alignments in a curriculum learning way. 
Evaluations with both the automatic and human metrics show that \modelname~is capable of producing natural, singable and enjoyable translation results.

\section{Concerns of the Ethical Impacts}
This work develops a possible automatic method for song translation. 
Therefore, if we release our repository and data set, there is the potential of abusing to synthesize score sheets and texts, especially may cause copyright issues. 
Thus, we choose the dataset license: CC by-nc-sa 4.0.
In this paper, we thoroughly discuss strengths and shortcomings of our proposed model and perform a series of experiments to support them. Codes, model checkpoints and data set will be released upon acceptance after desensitization and compliance examination.

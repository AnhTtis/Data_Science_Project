\begin{abstract}

Stable ultracold ensembles of dipolar molecules hold great promise for many-body quantum physics, but high inelastic loss rates have been a long-standing challenge. Recently, it was shown that gases of fermionic molecules can be effectively stabilized through external fields. However, many quantum applications will benefit from molecular ensembles with bosonic statistics. Here, we stabilize a bosonic gas of strongly dipolar NaCs molecules against inelastic losses via microwave shielding, decreasing losses by more than a factor of 200 and reaching lifetimes on the scale of 1 second. We also measure high elastic scattering rates, a result of strong dipolar interactions, and observe the anisotropic nature of dipolar collisions. Finally, we demonstrate evaporative cooling of a bosonic molecular gas to a temperature of 36(5) nK, increasing its phase-space density by a factor of 20. This work is a critical step towards the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of dipolar molecules.

\section{Introduction}

Ultracold gases of atoms and molecules have revolutionized the experimental exploration of many-body quantum systems \cite{bloch2008many,carr2009cold,lahaye2009physics,gross2017quantum,bohn2017cold}. In recent years, systems with dipolar long-range interactions have gained rapid traction, enabling the creation of new types of strongly correlated and highly entangled quantum matter. Magnetic atoms  \cite{chomaz2022dipolar}, operating in a regime of relatively weak dipole-dipole interactions, have allowed the realization of quantum ferrofluids \cite{lahaye2007strong, kadau2016observing} and the creation of droplet \cite{schmitt2016self,chomaz2016quantum} and supersolid phases \cite{bottcher2019transient,norcia2021two}. Rydberg atoms \cite{browaeys2020many}, operating in a regime of extremely strong interactions, have given rise to phases with crystalline order \cite{schauss2015crystallization,bernien2017probing}, simulation of quantum magnetic models \cite{labuhn2016tunable,guardado2018probing, semeghini2021probing}, and the controlled creation of entanglement \cite{levine2019parallel,madjarov2020high}. Dipolar molecules \cite{baranov2012condensed} are expected to operate in an intermediate regime where kinetic energy and interaction energy are on a similar scale, giving rise to nontrivial correlations and self-organization. Predicted phases include strongly interacting superfluids \cite{baranov2002superfluid,wang2006quantum,cooper2009stable}, supersolids \cite{pollet2010supersolid,trefzger2009pair,schmidt2022self}, dipolar crystals \cite{buchler2007strongly,rabl2007molecular}, and Mott insulators with fractional filling \cite{Capogrosso2010}. However, molecules have been found to be prone to strong inelastic loss \cite{ospelkaus2010quantum,julienne2011universal,bause2023ultracold}. Suppression of losses has emerged as a critical prerequisite to realize stable many-body quantum systems of dipolar molecules.

Quantum statistics plays an important role in molecular loss dynamics \cite{quemener2012ultracold}. Fermionic molecules are intriniscally less prone to inelastic loss than bosonic ones. For indistinguishable fermions, the probability of reaching short range in a two-body collision is suppressed by the $p$-wave centrifugal barrier \cite{ni2008high,park2015ultracold,de2019degenerate}. For bosons, such a barrier is absent and the rate of two-body loss is typically one to two orders of magnitude larger than for fermions \cite{julienne2011universal}. To reduce loss below the natural rate, shielding techniques have been proposed that utilize external electric fields to engineer a repulsive barrier for intermolecular collisions, leveraging the rich internal state structure of molecules \cite{avdeenkov2006suppression,gorshkov2008suppression,gonzalez2017adimensional,karman2018microwave,lassabliere2018controlling}. Microwave shielding was demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment for two bosonic CaF molecules in an optical tweezer trap \cite{anderegg2021observation}. For bulk gases of fermionic molecules, shielding with d.c.~electric fields was shown for KRb \cite{valtolina2020dipolar,matsuda2020resonant,li2021tuning} and microwave shielding for NaK~\cite{schindewolf2022evaporation,chen2023field}, suppressing inelastic loss by about an order of magnitude, sufficient to demonstrate evaporative cooling. Whether loss in bosonic molecular gases can be sufficiently suppressed to enable evaporative cooling has remained an open question. 

Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of a gas of bosonic sodium-cesium (NaCs) molecules against inelastic loss via microwave shielding. NaCs is strongly dipolar, with a permanent dipole moment of $d_0 = 4.75(20)$~D \cite{dagdigian1972molecular}, which enhances losses of unshielded molecules~\cite{julienne2011universal}, but in turn makes shielding more effective.  We suppress two-body loss by more than a factor of 200, increasing the lifetime of dense ensembles, with an interparticle spacing of about 1 $\mu$m, from 16(2) ms to 1.0(1) s. The microwave field also induces a dipole moment of up to 1.3 D, leading to dipolar interactions that enhance elastic collisions. In a cross-thermalization experiment, we measure strong elastic interactions and obtain a ratio of elastic-to-inelastic collisions of up to $\gamma = 4 (1) \times 10^3$. Under these conditions, we demonstrate the evaporative cooling of the bosonic molecular gas, increasing its phase-space density (PSD) by a factor of 20 and reaching a temperature of $36(5)$ nK.

\section{Shielding}

Our experiment begins with a gas of $3.0(5) \times 10^4$ NaCs molecules prepared in their rovibrational ground state at a temperature of 750(50) nK. The molecules are held in an optical dipole trap (ODT) with trap frequencies $(\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z) / (2 \pi) = (60, \, 65, \, 140)$~Hz at a magnetic field of about 864 G (Fig.~\ref{fig:1}A) which sets the quantization axis. Details on the sample preparation can be found in \cite{stevenson2023ultracold,warner2023pathway,SI}. Initially, the molecules are in the rotational ground state $|J, \ m_J\rangle = |0, \ 0\rangle$, where $J$ denotes the total angular momentum excluding nuclear spin and $m_J$ its projection onto the quantization axis. Then, a circularly polarized microwave field is applied at a frequency that is blue-detuned by an amount $\Delta$ from the resonance $\omega_\mathrm{res}$ with the excited state $|J, \ m_J\rangle = |1, \ 1\rangle$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:1}B). The field is created by a phased-array antenna~\cite{yuan2023circular}, ensuring a high purity of polarization. The intensity of the microwave field is adiabatically increased within 40~$\mu$s, transferring each molecule into the state $|+\rangle = \cos(\phi) |0, \ 0\rangle + \sin(\phi) |1, \ 1\rangle$, where the mixing angle  $\phi$ is defined by $\sin(2 \phi) = 1 / \sqrt{1 + (\Delta / \Omega)^2}$ and $\Omega$ denotes the Rabi frequency. The orthogonal dressed state, $|-\rangle = \sin(\phi) |0, \, 0\rangle - \cos(\phi) |1, \, 1\rangle$, remains unpopulated. Fig.~\ref{fig:1}C shows the energy splitting between the dressed states as a function of Rabi coupling.  

In a semiclassical picture, the dressed states represent dipoles rotating in the $xy$-plane at a frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{res}} + \Delta$. Due to the superposition of opposite parity states $|0,0\rangle$ and $|1,1\rangle$, the dressed states feature an induced dipole moment. The effective dipole moment, $d_\mathrm{eff}$, as a function of $\Delta/\Omega$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}D.  At large intermolecular distances, shielded molecules interact through the long-range dipole-dipole interaction $V_{\rm dd} = d_\mathrm{eff}^2 (3 \cos^2\theta-1)/(4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^3)$ \cite{yan2020resonant,karman2022resonant}, where $\theta$ denotes the angle between the rotation axis of the dipole and the intermolecular axis, $\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity, and $R$ the intermolecular distance. When approaching each other, molecules in the $|+\rangle$ state mutually align the orientation of their dipoles and repel each other \cite{karman2018microwave}. This is illustrated by the dressed intermolecular potentials shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}E. The repulsion prevents the molecules from reaching short range and suppresses loss from inelastic collisions \cite{karman2018microwave}.  The shielding efficiency is limited by residual loss channels, such as tunneling of the molecule pair through the microwave barrier, reaching short range, as well as non-adiabatic transitions to other scattering channels between $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ and the spectator states $|J, \ m_J\rangle = |1, \ 0\rangle$ and $|1, \ -1\rangle$, collectively labeled $|0\rangle$.

For optimal parameters of microwave shielding, we observe an enhancement of the lifetime from 16(2) ms to \mbox{1.0(1) s} for ensembles with an initial peak density of $1.0(2)\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. Fig.~\ref{fig:2}A displays lifetime data of unshielded and shielded molecules, illustrating this dramatic change. As a function of hold time in the dipole trap, $t_\mathrm{hold}$, we track both the molecule number and temperature, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}A and B, and fit the data with a kinetic model that includes one-body, two-body and evaporative losses \cite{SI}.

\section{Inelastic Collisions}

We record lifetime data under different microwave parameters, which allows us to extract the two-body loss rate coefficient, $\beta_\mathrm{2B}$, as a function of $\Delta/\Omega$. Our study is conducted at $\Omega / (2 \pi) = 4.0(4)$ MHz. This value was chosen after we measured a plateau in the shielding quality as a function of Rabi frequency between $\Omega / (2 \pi) = 4$ MHz and $\Omega / (2 \pi) = 10$ MHz, with loss rates increasing on either side of this range \cite{SI}. The measured loss rate coefficients are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}C. For $\Delta / \Omega > 1$, the trend of the data agrees well with the results of a coupled-channel calculation that takes into account our measured microwave ellipticity of $\xi = 3(2)^\circ$~\cite{SI,yuan2023circular}. At $\Delta / \Omega = 1$, the data shows a 225-fold reduction in the loss rate coefficient compared to the unshielded case, going from $\beta_\mathrm{2B} = 450(50) \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^3$/s to $\beta_\mathrm{2B} = 2.0(5) \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^3$/s. For $\Delta / \Omega < 1$, the data deviates from the theoretical expectations. We compare the data taken at 750(50)~nK to a second run at 160(10)~nK. While for $\Delta / \Omega > 2$ the two runs are practically indistinguishable, there is a marked difference for $\Delta / \Omega < 2$ with a significant uptick of the inelastic rate coefficient for colder temperatures. Based on the coupled-channels calculation, which only takes into account two-body physics, such a temperature dependence is not expected. Three-body effects, not accounted for in the calculation, may be a driver of this physics, potentially in conjunction with heating caused by microwave-induced loss. A detailed understanding of these effects in future work may allow reaching even lower loss rates, as predicted by theory.

\section{Elastic Collisions}

In addition to the suppression of inelastic collisions, the dipole moment induced by the microwave field enhances elastic collisions. The effective dipole moment depends on the microwave parameters as $d_\mathrm{eff} = d_0 / \sqrt{12 ( 1 + (\Delta / \Omega)^2 ) }$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:1}D), and the resulting dipole-dipole interactions vary as a function of the shielding parameter, $\Delta/\Omega$. For example, for small $\Delta/\Omega$ the dressed state approaches an equal superposition of $|0,0\rangle$ and $|1,1\rangle$, leading to a maximal induced dipole moment and an enhancement of the dipolar contribution to the elastic collisions. 

As the shielding parameter $\Delta / \Omega$ is varied, the molecular gas probes two different regimes of dipolar scattering depending on the relative magnitude of the thermal energy, $k_\mathrm{B} T$, and the dipolar energy, $E_\mathrm{d} = d_\mathrm{eff}^2 / ( 4\pi\epsilon_0 \,a_\mathrm{d}^3 )$ \cite{bohn2009quasi}, where $a_\mathrm{d} = M d_\mathrm{eff}^2 / (8 \pi \hbar^2 \epsilon_0)$ is the dipolar length and $M$ the molecular mass. The elastic scattering cross section, $\sigma_\mathrm{el}$, varies in magnitude, temperature dependence, and anisotropy depending on which of these energies is dominant. For $k_\mathrm{B} T \gg E_\mathrm{d}$, collisions are semiclassical and $\sigma_\mathrm{sc} =  8\pi \, a_\mathrm{d}/ (3 k) $, where $k =  \sqrt{ \pi \, M \, k_{\mathrm{B}} T} / \hbar$ is the thermally-averaged collisional $k$-vector. For $k_\mathrm{B} T \leq E_\mathrm{d}$, i.e.~as the thermal deBroglie wavelength, $\lambda_\mathrm{th} = h / \sqrt{2\pi M k_\mathrm{B} T }$, approaches or exceeds the length scale of dipole-dipole interactions, the collisional properties are modified and the cross section enters the threshold regime, becoming $\sigma_\mathrm{th} = 32 \pi \, a_\mathrm{d}^2/ 45 + 8 \pi a_s^2$, where $a_s$ is the $s$-wave scattering length of the molecules \cite{bohn2009quasi}. Since $d_\mathrm{eff}$ is a function of $\Delta / \Omega$, our experiment accesses both regimes, with $k_\mathrm{B} T \approx E_\mathrm{d}$ at large microwave detunings and $k_\mathrm{B} T \gg E_\mathrm{d}$ close to resonance.

We measure the elastic collision cross section via a cross-thermalization experiment (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}). For these measurements we keep the peak density below $0.2 \times 10^{12}$~cm$^{-3}$ to avoid entering the hydrodynamic regime, where the thermalization rate would be limited to the mean trap frequency \cite{schindewolf2022evaporation}. At constant ODT depth, fast heating of the cloud to a set temperature is induced, followed by evaporative cooling along the vertical $z$-axis and cross-thermalization in the $xy$-plane. During the sequence, we follow the temperature evolution of the cloud in $x$-direction, as shown in  Fig.~\ref{fig:3}A. Via the kinetic model \cite{SI}, we extract the thermalization rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{th} = \sigma_\mathrm{el}\, \bar{n} \,v_\mathrm{th} / N_\mathrm{col}$ \cite{schindewolf2022evaporation}, where $v_\mathrm{th} = 4\sqrt{k_\mathrm{B} T / (\pi M) }$ is the molecules' mean thermal velocity, $\bar{n}$ the mean density of the cloud, and $N_\mathrm{col}$ the average number of collisions required for cross-thermalization between the $z$-axis and the $xy$-plane. Smaller $N_\mathrm{col}$ means more efficient energy transfer. From $\Gamma_\mathrm{th}$ we obtain the elastic scattering cross section $\sigma_\mathrm{el}$.

The anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions has a profound impact on the thermalization dynamics via the value of $N_\mathrm{col}$. Close to resonance, where the molecular gas is in the semiclassical regime and $E_\mathrm{d}$ is small, forward collisions that do not deflect the molecules' trajectories by a large angle are favored, thus limiting the transverse energy transfer. More efficient energy redistribution is achieved in the threshold regime at larger detunings, when the induced dipole moment is lower and $E_\mathrm{d}$ becomes larger. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}B, in which a calculation of $N_\mathrm{col}$ for cross-thermalization between the $x$ and $z$ (or $x$ and $y$) axes is provided. Unlike experiments on fermionic dipoles~\cite{aikawa2014anisotropic,li2021tuning} where there is only the dipole-dipole interaction, bosonic systems also have an $s$-wave van der Waals contribution to elastic scattering. The scattering length, $a_s$, is not known for NaCs and we obtain a value of $a_s = 1200$~$ a_0$ from a fit to our data~\cite{SI}. With $a_s$ being the only free fitting parameter, we find excellent agreement for $\sigma_\mathrm{el}$ between the experiment and a coupled channel calculation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}C.

From the measured elastic and inelastic collision rates, we calculate the ratio of elastic-to-inelastic collisions, $\gamma$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}D. We observe a peak value of $\gamma \approx 4 (1) \times 10^{3}$ at $\Delta / \Omega = 1 $. The quantity $\gamma$ is typically used as a key parameter to characterize the efficacy of forced evaporative cooling \cite{davis1995analytical,luiten1996kinetic}. However, evaporative cooling with dipolar elastic collisions in the semiclassical regime is qualitatively different from evaporation in systems with $s$-wave or threshold dipolar interactions, as is typically the case in atomic and molecular systems, including the recent demonstrations of evaporative cooling in fermionic dipolar molecules \cite{valtolina2020dipolar,schindewolf2022evaporation}. In our case the reduced quantity $\gamma / N_\mathrm{col}$, rather than $\gamma$, sets the thermalization rate, and thus the evaporation efficiency. Our highest value of $\gamma / N_\mathrm{col} \approx 250$ is still favorable for efficient evaporation \cite{anderegg2021observation,schindewolf2022evaporation}. 

\section{Evaporation}

We demonstrate evaporative cooling in the stabilized ultracold gas of NaCs molecules. We start with a gas at a temperature of $750(50)$~nK and a PSD of $5(1) \times 10^{-3}$. Then, the depth of the ODT is continuously reduced over 1.5 s, while the molecular cloud is shielded at $\Omega / (2\pi) = 4$~MHz and $\Delta / (2\pi) = 6$~MHz. At different stages of the evaporation, we measure the molecule number and temperature, and extract the phase-space density of the cloud, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}. At the end of the cooling sequence, we reach a temperature of $36(5)$~nK and a corresponding PSD of $0.10(3)$. For small molecule numbers, the measured phase-space density seems to show a plateau, likely the result of the limited signal-to-noise of our detection system. The extracted evaporation efficiency, $- d {\rm ln}({\rm PSD}) / d {\rm ln}(N)$, is $1.0(1)$. This efficiency is similar to those found in recent work on evaporative cooling of fermionic ground state molecules \cite{valtolina2020dipolar,li2021tuning,schindewolf2022evaporation}. We note that, besides the prospect of cooling the molecular gas to degeneracy, evaporative cooling allows the preparation of molecular samples at well-defined temperatures over a wide dynamic range, which will facilitate studies of quantum chemistry and collisional physics in bosonic molecular gases \cite{bause2023ultracold}.

\section{Outlook}

In this work, we have demonstrated that ultracold gases of bosonic ground state molecules can be effectively stabilized via microwave shielding, reaching low inelastic loss rates similar to shielded fermionic molecules despite the absence of a $p$-wave barrier. Our data on anisotropic cross-thermalization shows that, even above quantum degeneracy, the strongly dipolar character of our gas leads to nontrivial thermodynamic behavior. Dipolar liquids similar to our system have recently been predicted to show anisotropic thermal conductivity \cite{wang2022thermal} and viscosity \cite{wang2022thermoviscous}. Thanks to the rapid tunability of microwave parameters $\Omega$ and $\Delta$, allowing the quasi-instantaneous tuning of inelastic and elastic scattering properties, novel non-equilibrium measurement protocols can be envisioned to probe such thermodynamics. 

A key question that emerges from this work is whether Bose-Einstein condensation of microwave-shielded dipolar molecules can be achieved. The measured gain in phase-space density brings us to the brink of Bose-Einstein condensation. Following the observed trend in evaporation, a BEC with 100 molecules would be expected. This is currently below the signal-to-noise level of our imaging system, but straightforward upgrades will provide the necessary improvements. In addition, further reduction of microwave noise and a better understanding of inelastic loss at small detunings may allow us to reach even lower loss levels, as predicted by theory. Field-linked resonances \cite{avdeenkov2006suppression,chen2023field}, which should be accessible for NaCs at low microwave ellipticity and moderate microwave intensity \cite{chen2023field}, allow for independent tuning of $a_\mathrm{d}$ and $a_\mathrm{s}$ \cite{lassabliere2018controlling} and  offer a tuning knob to further improve on the scattering properties of our molecules. Using field-linked resonances to tailor interactions may also tune $N_\mathrm{col}$  close to or below the $s$-wave value of 2.5~\cite{wang2021anisotropic}, increasing the thermalization rate by an order of magnitude, enhancing our evaporation. 

Starting from shielded three-dimensional bulk samples of bosonic molecules, efficient transfer with minimal loss to lower dimensional systems comes within reach. In two-dimensional systems, microwave shielding and d.c.~electric fields should enable the realization of strongly correlated phases \cite{buchler2007strongly}, such as supersolidity and self-organized crystallization of dipoles, both in single layers \cite{schmidt2022self} and multilayers \cite{wang2006quantum}. NaCs molecules are a highly promising platform for such explorations due their large dipole moment, which allows a characteristic range of dipolar interactions, $a_\mathrm{d}$, of tens of micrometers. Shielded loading of optical lattices, in particular from a BEC of molecules, may offer a way to reach unity filling, necessary to realize extended Hubbard models \cite{Capogrosso2010,dutta2015non}, and enabling studies of many-body spin models in defect-free molecular arrays \cite{yan2013observation,christakis2023probing,micheli2006toolbox,gorshkov2011tunable}.

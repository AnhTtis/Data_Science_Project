    "abstract": "This paper proposes an extension of regression trees by quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Regression trees are very popular prediction models that are trainable with tabular datasets, but their accuracy is insufficient because the decision rules are too simple. The proposed method extends the decision rules in decision trees to multi-dimensional boundaries. Such an extension is generally unimplementable because of computational limitations, however, the proposed method transforms the training process to QUBO, which enables an annealing machine to solve this problem.",

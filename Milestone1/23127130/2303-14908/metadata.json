    "abstract": "Several effective methods have been developed recently to demonstrate simultaneous high energy and high power density in Li - carbon fluoride (CF$_x$) batteries. These methods can achieve as high as 1000 Wh/kg energy density at 60-70 kW/kg power density (40-50 C rate) in coin cells and 750 Wh/kg energy density at 12.5 kW/kg power density (20 C rate) in pouch cells. This performance is made possible by ingenious nano-architecture design, controlled porosity, boron doping and electrolyte additives. In the present study, we show that a similarly great performance, 931 Wh/kg energy density at 59 kW/kg power density, can be achieved by using a polyacrylonitrile binder and a LiBF4 electrolyte in Li - graphite fluoride coin cells. We also demonstrate that the observed effect is the result of the right combination of the binder and the electrolyte. We propose that the mechanistic origin of the observed phenomena is an electro-catalytic effect by the polyacrylonitrile binder. While our proposed method has a competitive performance, it also offers a simple implementation and a scalable production of high energy and high power primary Li-CF$_x$ cells.",

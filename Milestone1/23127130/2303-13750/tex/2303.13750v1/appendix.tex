\section{Details of Experiments}
\label{sec:app-details-exp}

\stitle{Baselines.} 
We directly report the results of JacobiConv following ~\cite{icml22jacobi}, and the results of other baselines are from ~\cite{nips21bernnet}.

\stitle{Hyperparameter Search.}
For the experiments on real-world datasets and fitting filters, we use optuna~\cite{kdd19optuna} to search the best hyperparameters for spectral GNNs with orthonormal basis.
We choose the best parameters with minimum average square loss for fitting filter experiments and maximum average accuracy on validation datasets for real-world datasets.
Following ~\cite{icml22jacobi}, the learning rate and weight decay for parameters are chosen from $\{\expnumber{5}{-4}, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05\}$ and $\{0.0, \expnumber{5}{-5}, \expnumber{1}{-4}, \expnumber{5}{-04}, 0.001\}$, respectively.
We choose $a$ and $b$ in Jacobi polynomials from $[-1,2]$.

For fitting filter experiments, we simply fix the best parameters of other parameters and search the learning rate of $a$ and $b$ from $\{0.01, 0.001, \expnumber{5}{-4}, \expnumber{2}{-4}, \expnumber{1}{-4} \}$ in fitting filter experiments.
For real-world datasets, we also search the learning rate of $a$ and $b$ in optuna, whose values are also chosen from $\{\expnumber{5}{-4}, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05\}$. 
The weight decay of $a$ and $b$ is fixed to $0.0$.

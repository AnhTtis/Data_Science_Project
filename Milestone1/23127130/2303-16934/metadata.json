    "abstract": "In the second paper of this series, we developed a new distance determination method using the median $J$ magnitude of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars (CS) as standard candles and the Magellanic Clouds as the fundamental calibrators. The $J$-band CS luminosity function was modeled using a modified Lorentzian distribution whose parameters were used to determined whether the LMC or SMC was the most suitable calibrator. In this third paper of the series, we expand our sample of galaxies and introduce a more robust method to determine the parameters of the Lorentzian model. The new fitting method uses an un-binned maximum likelihood estimator to determine the parameters of the Lorentzian model resulting in parameter errors that are significantly smaller compared to the second paper. We test our method in NGC 6822, IC 1613, NGC 3109 and WLM. We also estimate the distances to the same sample of galaxies via the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) detection method. Our results from the CS measurements agree well with those obtained from the TRGB.",

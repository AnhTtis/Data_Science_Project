    "abstract": "Phonon anharmonicity plays a crucial role in determining the stability and vibrational properties of high-pressure hydrides. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can render phonon quasiparticle picture obsolete. In this work, we show the effects of non-Lorentzian phonon lineshapes on the superconductivity of high-pressure solid hydrogen. We calculate the superconducting critical temperature T$_\\mathrm{C}$ \\emph{ab initio} considering the full anharmonic lineshape of the phonon spectral function and show that it substantially enhances T$_\\mathrm{C}$. Despite previous anharmonic calculations estimating a weak anharmonicity in atomic hydrogen, considering the full spectral function enhances the critical temperature by 100 K, pushing it above 400 K. Our calculations also reveal that superconductivity emerges in hydrogen in the Cmca-12 molecular phase VI at pressures between 450 and 500 GPa.",

title = {Eliashberg theory with ab-initio Coulomb interactions: a minimal numerical scheme applied to layered superconductors},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Materials},
abstract = {We present a minimal approach to include static Coulomb interactions in Eliashberg theory of superconductivity from first principles. The method can be easily implemented in any existing Eliashberg code (isotropic or anisotropic) to avoid the standard use of the semiempirical parameter , which adds unnecessary uncertainty to T c predictions. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of the method by simulating the superconducting properties of a set of layered superconductors, which feature unconventional Coulomb effects: CaC6, MgB2, Li-doped β-ZrNCl and YNi2B2C. We find that the estimated critical temperatures are consistent with those from ab-initio density functional theory for superconductors, and in close agreement with the experimental values.}

	abstract = {Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe. However, understanding the properties of dense hydrogen is still an open challenge because—under megabar pressures—the quantum nature of both electrons and protons emerges, producing deviations from the common behaviour of condensed-matter systems. Experiments are challenging and can access only limited observables, and the interplay between electron correlation and nuclear quantum motion makes standard simulations unreliable. Here we present the computed phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at low temperatures and high pressures using state-of-the-art methods to describe both many-body electronic correlation and quantum anharmonic motion of protons. Our results show that the long-sought atomic metallic hydrogen phase—predicted to host room-temperature superconductivity—forms at 577(4) GPa. The anharmonic vibrations of nuclei pushes the stability of this phase towards pressures much larger than previous estimates or attained experimental values. Before atomization, molecular hydrogen transforms from a metallic phase (phase III) to another metallic structure that is still molecular (phase VI) at 410(20) GPa. Isotope effects increase the pressures of both transitions by 63 and 32 GPa, respectively. We predict signatures in optical spectroscopy and d.c. conductivity that can be experimentally used to distinguish between the two structural transitions.},

abstract={The discovery of superconductivity at 260{\thinspace}K in hydrogen-rich compounds like LaH10 re-invigorated the quest for room temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the temperature dependence of the upper critical fields $\mu$0Hc2(T) of superconducting H3S under a record-high combination of applied pressures up to 160{\thinspace}GPa and fields up to 65{\thinspace}T. We find that Hc2(T) displays a linear dependence on temperature over an extended range as found in multigap or in strongly-coupled superconductors, thus deviating from conventional Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) formalism. The best fit of Hc2(T) to the WHH formalism yields negligible values for the Maki parameter $\alpha$ and the spin--orbit scattering constant $\lambda$SO. However, Hc2(T) is well-described by a model based on strong coupling superconductivity with a coupling constant $\lambda$ {\textasciitilde} 2. We conclude that H3S behaves as a strong-coupled orbital-limited superconductor over the entire range of temperatures and fields used for our measurements.},

    abstract = "{ We performed simulations for solid molecular hydrogen at high pressures (250 GPa ≤ P ≤ 500 GPa) along two isotherms at T = 200 K (phase III) and at T = 414 K (phase IV). At T = 200 K, we considered likely candidates for phase III, the C2c and Cmca12 structures, while at T = 414 K in phase IV, we studied the Pc48 structure. We employed both Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo (CEIMC) and Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD). The latter is based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the van der Waals approximation (vdW-DF). The comparison between the two methods allows us to address the question of the accuracy of the exchange-correlation approximation of DFT for thermal and quantum protons without recurring to perturbation theories. In general, we find that atomic and molecular fluctuations in PIMD are larger than in CEIMC which suggests that the potential energy surface from vdW-DF is less structured than the one from quantum Monte Carlo. We find qualitatively different behaviors for systems prepared in the C2c structure for increasing pressure. Within PIMD, the C2c structure is dynamically partially stable for P ≤ 250 GPa only: it retains the symmetry of the molecular centers but not the molecular orientation; at intermediate pressures, it develops layered structures like Pbcn or Ibam and transforms to the metallic Cmca-4 structure at P ≥ 450 GPa. Instead, within CEIMC, the C2c structure is found to be dynamically stable at least up to 450 GPa; at increasing pressure, the molecular bond length increases and the nuclear correlation decreases. For the other two structures, the two methods are in qualitative agreement although quantitative differences remain. We discuss various structural properties and the electrical conductivity. We find that these structures become conducting around 350 GPa but the metallic Drude-like behavior is reached only at around 500 GPa, consistent with recent experimental claims. }",

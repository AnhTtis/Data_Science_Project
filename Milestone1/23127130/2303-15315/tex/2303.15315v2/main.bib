	abstract = {The development of low-threshold detectors for the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and for the search for light dark matter necessitates methods of low-energy calibration. We suggest this can be provided by the nuclear recoils resulting from the γ emission following thermal neutron capture. In particular, several MeV-scale single-γ transitions induce well-defined nuclear recoil peaks in the 100 eV range. Using the FIFRELIN code, complete schemes of γ-cascades for various isotopes can be predicted with high accuracy to determine the continuous background of nuclear recoils below the calibration peaks. We present a comprehensive experimental concept for the calibration of CaWO4 and Ge cryogenic detectors at a research reactor. For CaWO4 the simulations show that two nuclear recoil peaks at 112.5 eV and 160.3 eV should be visible above background simply in the spectrum of the cryogenic detector. Then we discuss how the additional tagging for the associated γ increases the sensitivity of the method and extends its application to a wider energy range and to Ge cryogenic detectors.}

abstract = {The CRESST cryogenic direct dark matter search at Gran Sasso, searching for WIMPs via nuclear recoil, has been upgraded to CRESST-II by several changes and improvements. The upgrade includes a new detector support structure capable of accommodating 33 modules, the associated multichannel readout with 66 SQUID channels, a neutron shield, a calibration source lift, and the installation of a muon veto. We present the results of a commissioning run carried out in 2007. The basic element of CRESST-II is a detector module consisting of a large (∼300g)CaWO4 crystal and a very sensitive smaller (∼2g) light detector to detect the scintillation light from the CaWO4. The large crystal gives an accurate total energy measurement. The light detector permits a determination of the light yield for an event, allowing an effective separation of nuclear recoils from electron–photon backgrounds. Furthermore, information from light-quenching factor studies allows the definition of a region of the energy-light yield plane which corresponds to tungsten recoils. A neutron test is reported which supports the principle of using the light yield to identify the recoiling nucleus. Data obtained with two detector modules for a total exposure of 48kg-days are presented. Judging by the rate of events in the “all nuclear recoils” acceptance region the apparatus shows a factor ∼10 improvement with respect to previous results, which we attribute principally to the presence of the neutron shield. In the “tungsten recoils” acceptance region three events are found, corresponding to a rate of 0.063per kg-day. Standard assumptions on the dark matter flux, coherent or spin independent interactions, then yield a limit for WIMP-nucleon scattering of 4.8×10-7pb, at MWIMP∼50GeV.}

abstract = {The Evaluated Gamma-ray Activation File (EGAF) is the result of a 2000–2007 IAEA Coordinated Research Project to develop a database of thermal, prompt γ-ray cross sections, σγ, for all elemental and selected radioactive targets. No previous database of this kind had existed. EGAF was originally based on measurements using guided neutron beams from the Budapest Reactor on all elemental targets from Z=1–82, 90 and 92, except for He and Pm. The EGAF σγ data were published in the Database of Prompt Gamma Rays from Slow Neutron Capture for Elemental Analysis [1]. An international collaboration has formed to continue the EGAF measurements with isotopically enriched targets, derive total radiative thermal neutron cross sections, σ0, extend the σγ data from thermal to 20 MeV neutrons, compile a completed activation data file, improve sections of the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL) with more complete and up to date level and γ-ray data, evaluate statistical γ-ray data from reaction studies, and determine recommended neutron separations energies, Sn, for atomic mass evaluations. A new guided neutron beam facility has become available at the Garching (Munich) FRM II Reactor, and high energy neutron experimental facilities are being developed by a Berkeley area collaboration where 5–33 MeV neutron beams are available at the LBNL 88” cyclotron, 2.5 and 14 MeV beams at the University of California, Berkeley neutron generator laboratory, and high flux, 1027–33 n⋅cm⋅−2 s−1, neutron pulses available from the LLNL National Ignition Facility (NIF).}

abstract = {We describe the new ENDF/B-VIII.0 evaluated nuclear reaction data library. ENDF/B-VIII.0 fully incorporates the new IAEA standards, includes improved thermal neutron scattering data and uses new evaluated data from the CIELO project for neutron reactions on 1H, 16O, 56Fe, 235U, 238U and 239Pu described in companion papers in the present issue of Nuclear Data Sheets. The evaluations benefit from recent experimental data obtained in the U.S. and Europe, and improvements in theory and simulation. Notable advances include updated evaluated data for light nuclei, structural materials, actinides, fission energy release, prompt fission neutron and γ-ray spectra, thermal neutron scattering data, and charged-particle reactions. Integral validation testing is shown for a wide range of criticality, reaction rate, and neutron transmission benchmarks. In general, integral validation performance of the library is improved relative to the previous ENDF/B-VII.1 library.}

abstract = {An account is given of the method of extended maximum likelihood. This differs from the standard method of maximum likelihood in that the normalisation of the probability distribution function is allowed to vary. It is thus applicable to problems in which the number of samples obtained is itself a relevant measurement. If the function is such that its size and shape can be independently varied, then the estimates given by the extended method are identical to the standard maximum likelihood estimators, though the errors require care of interpretation. If the function does not have this property, then extended maximum likelihood can give better results.}

abstract = {Statistical modeling is a key element in many scientific fields and especially in
High-Energy Physics (HEP) analysis. The standard framework to perform this task in HEP is the
C++ ROOT/RooFit toolkit; with Python bindings that are only loosely integrated into the
scientific Python ecosystem. In this paper, zfit, a new alternative to RooFit written in pure Python,
is presented. Most of all, zfit provides a well defined high-level API and workflow
for advanced model building and fitting, together with an implementation on top of TensorFlow,
allowing a transparent usage of CPUs and GPUs. It is designed to be extendable in a
very simple fashion, allowing the usage of cutting-edge developments from
the scientific Python ecosystem in a transparent way. The main features of zfit are introduced,
and its extension to data analysis, especially in the context of HEP experiments, is discussed.}

@article{2007_CRESST_Squid,
	abstract = {A 66-channel readout system has been developed for the second phase of the CRESST dark matter search, to read out the signals from 33 phonon and 33 light detectors. The system consists of 66 SQUID sensors and control electronics connected by woven cables. It was installed in the CRESST cryostat at the  Gran Sasso laboratory during the upgrade to CRESST II and has been extensively tested to characterise the heatload and crosstalk in the cables, and the noise, drift, and slew rate of the SQUIDs. These tests have shown the performance of the system meets the requirements of the experiment, and it is now being used to take data for CRESST II.},

    "abstract": "Yao graphs are geometric spanners that connect each point of a given point\nset to its nearest neighbor in each of $k$ cones drawn around it. Yao graphs\nwere introduced to construct minimum spanning trees in $d$ dimensional spaces.\nMoreover, they are used for instance in topology control in wireless networks.\nAn optimal \\Onlogn time algorithm to construct Yao graphs for given point set\nhas been proposed in the literature but -- to the best of our knowledge --\nnever been implemented. Instead, algorithms with a quadratic complexity are\nused in popular packages to construct these graphs. In this paper we present\nthe first implementation of the optimal Yao graph algorithm. We develop and\ntune the data structures required to achieve the O(n log n) bound and detail\nalgorithmic adaptions necessary to take the original algorithm from theory to\npractice. We propose a priority queue data structure that separates static and\ndynamic events and might be of independent interest for other sweepline\nalgorithms. Additionally, we propose a new Yao graph algorithm based on a\nuniform grid data structure that performs well for medium-sized inputs. We\nevaluate our implementations on a wide variety synthetic and real-world\ndatasets and show that our implementation outperforms current publicly\navailable implementations by at least an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Short range order is a critical driver of properties in multicomponent alloys, complex concentrated alloys (CCAs). Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is a powerful technique, well suited for quantifying this short range order. However, CCAs have some characteristics that make the already challenging analysis of EXAFS data even more difficult. We identify paths towards robust and scalable quantitative SRO analysis to accelerate scientific understanding and development of complex, technologically relevant CCA systems.",

NIST announced ASCON as the chosen method that will be published as NIST’s lightweight
cryptography standard later in 2023. The performance benchmarks as stated in this article put Xoodyak and Sparkle look better in terms of performance. But, there are other assessments, such as security, energy footprint, and memory footprint that were taken into consideration from NIST when choosing the strongest and most efficient lightweight algorithm.

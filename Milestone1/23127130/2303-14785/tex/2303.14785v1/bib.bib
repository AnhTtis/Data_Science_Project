abstract="Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a peer-to-peer electronic payment system in the paper ``Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System'' [12] in 2009. The payment system introduced in this paper (now known as blockchain technology) had a big impact on digital data transfer in a point that using blockchain technology, digital data transfer can be done without having third parties to give trust to the transfer process. In this paper, we focus on one of the key components of the blockchain technology, ``consensus algorithm''. We propose a consensus algorithm ``Proof-of-Achievement (PoA)'' which is an algorithm optimized for blockchain games, focusing on the number of tasks achieved in the game. Using the PoA algorithm, we aim to increase the motivation for playing blockchain games. Through a user study, this paper discusses the effects of the PoA algorithm.",

abstract="As more applications are built on top of blockchain and public ledger, different approaches are developed to improve the performance of blockchain construction. Recently Intel proposed a new concept of proof-of-elapsed-time (PoET), which leverages trusted computing to enforce random waiting times for block construction. However, trusted computing component may not be perfect and 100{\%} reliable. It is not clear, to what extent, blockchain systems based on PoET can tolerate failures of trusted computing component. The current design of PoET lacks rigorous security analysis and a theoretical foundation for assessing its strength against such attacks. To fulfill this gap, we develop a theoretical framework for evaluating a PoET based blockchain system, and show that the current design is vulnerable in the sense that adversary can jeopardize the blockchain system by only compromising {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varTheta ({\backslash}log {\backslash}log n/{\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}fraction of the participating nodes, which is very small when n is relatively large. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also propose methods to mitigate these vulnerabilities.",

abstract="When training a machine learning model, it is standard procedure for the researcher to have full knowledge of both the data and model. However, this engenders a lack of trust between data owners and data scientists. Data owners are justifiably reluctant to relinquish control of private information to third parties. Privacy-preserving techniques distribute computation in order to ensure that data remains in the control of the owner while learning takes place. However, architectures distributed amongst multiple agents introduce an entirely new set of security and trust complications, including data poisoning and model theft. This paper outlines a distributed infrastructure which can be used to facilitate peer-to-peer trust between entities; collaboratively performing a privacy-preserving workflow. Our outlined prototype enables the initialisation of industry gatekeepers and governance bodies as credential issuers under a certain application domain. Before participating in the distributed learning workflow, malicious actors must first negotiate valid credentials from these gatekeepers. We detail a proof of concept using Hyperledger Aries, Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to establish a distributed trust architecture during a privacy-preserving machine learning experiment. Specifically, we utilise secure and authenticated DID communication channels in order to facilitate a federated learning workflow related to mental health care data.",

ABSTRACT = {A common privacy issue in traditional machine learning is that data needs to be disclosed for the training procedures. In situations with highly sensitive data such as healthcare records, accessing this information is challenging and often prohibited. Luckily, privacy-preserving technologies have been developed to overcome this hurdle by distributing the computation of the training and ensuring the data privacy to their owners. The distribution of the computation to multiple participating entities introduces new privacy complications and risks. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving decentralised workflow that facilitates trusted federated learning among participants. Our proof-of-concept defines a trust framework instantiated using decentralised identity technologies being developed under Hyperledger projects Aries/Indy/Ursa. Only entities in possession of Verifiable Credentials issued from the appropriate authorities are able to establish secure, authenticated communication channels authorised to participate in a federated learning workflow related to mental health data.},

abstract="The recent policy and regulatory initiatives of the EU, such as Digital Single Market Strategy, Single Digital Gateway, European Interoperability Framework and eIDAS, identify the need for digital cross-border integration in the EU. The achievement of the digital single market within the EU is challenging governments at all levels to transform or update their governance systems in order to establish the cross-border e-governance. The existing stage models in the e-Government literature, do not address the cross-border integration in the evolution phase of the e-Government. The heterogeneity and the legacy systems of the cross-border data exchange infrastructures hinders the process of seamless cross-border data exchange. This heterogeneity of cross-border data exchange infrastructures and complexity of the cross-border integration in the EU requires high level of interoperability in the legal, organisational, technical and semantic environment. Therefore, we explore the cross-border data infrastructures and its state of play in the EU by following the predominant framework that ensures the interoperability of the digital public services, EIF. We found that the most successful approach for cross-border e-governance and the cross-border integration might be the federated approach.",

abstract = {Blockchain technology provides us a new tool to solve the product traceability problem in supply chain management. This research focuses on the cross-border e-commerce context, to propose a blockchain-based framework, and develop a set of corresponding techniques and methods for achieving traceable products and transactions in supply chain management. A general blockchain-based product traceability framework is introduced. This framework is based on a cross-border e-commerce supply chain context, incorporating a series of blockchain-based models, including multi-chain structure model, data management model and block structure model. Several core methods and algorithms are also developed, such as information anchoring method, key distribution method, information encryption algorithm and anti-counterfeiting method. The framework, models and methods form a complete and comprehensive solution, which are evaluated by applying to several typical problems and attack cases. The case analysis results show that the framework, models and methods can successfully deal with key recover problem, and protect against clone attack, counterfeit tag attack and counterfeit product attack. The effectiveness, extendibility, security, implementation and governance issues of applying these solutions are also discussed. This research contributes to the theoretical and practical literatures on blockchain technology, cross-border e-commerce and supply chain management research fields.}

ABSTRACT = {Electronic health record (EHR) management systems require the adoption of effective technologies when health information is being exchanged. Current management approaches often face risks that may expose medical record storage solutions to common security attack vectors. However, healthcare-oriented blockchain solutions can provide a decentralized, anonymous and secure EHR handling approach. This paper presents PREHEALTH, a privacy-preserving EHR management solution that uses distributed ledger technology and an Identity Mixer (Idemix). The paper describes a proof-of-concept implementation that uses the Hyperledger Fabric’s permissioned blockchain framework. The proposed solution is able to store patient records effectively whilst providing anonymity and unlinkability. Experimental performance evaluation results demonstrate the scheme’s efficiency and feasibility for real-world scale deployment.},

abstract="Our world due to the technological progress became fast-paced and is constantly evolving, thus changing every single day. Consequently, the most valuable asset on earth is not gold or oil anymore but data. Big data companies try to take advantage of this situation and maximise their profits using people's data. It is common to offer free of charge services to collect vast amounts of data that most of the times are considered personal and sensitive. On the other hand, their users, everyday and ordinary people without any technological background, take the opportunity to communicate with their friends and family freely and use their services without hesitation and second thoughts. But, if we take a step back and observe these free of charge services, the first concern that comes out of our mind is how all these companies are profitable since they offer a free product/platform/service. Most of the times, big data companies sell their users' data to advertisers to offer personalised ads. There is an innovative technology that can securely store the aforementioned data but also enable its monetisation to the actual producers of it, the people. This technology is the blockchain and its variants.",

abstract = {Abstract
Digital identity (eID) systems are a crucial piece in the digital services ecosystem. They connect individuals to a variety of socioeconomic opportunities but can also reinforce power asymmetries between organizations and individuals. Data collection practices can negatively impact an individual’s right to privacy, autonomy, and self-determination. Protecting individual rights, however, may be at odds with imperatives of profit maximization or national security. The use of eID technologies is hence highly contested. Current approaches to governing eID systems have been unable to fully address the trade-offs between the opportunities and risks associated with these systems. The responsible innovation (RI) literature provides a set of principles to govern disruptive innovations, such as eID systems, toward societally desirable outcomes. This article uses RI principles to develop a framework to govern eID systems in a more inclusive, responsible, and user-centered manner. The proposed framework seeks to complement existing practices for eID system governance by bringing forth principles of deliberation and democratic engagement to build trust amongst stakeholders of the eID system and deliver shared socioeconomic benefits.},

Various approaches have been proposed in past to build a secure Identity Management (IdM) System. This is a novel systematic literature mapping of IdM in blockchain. This paper provides an extensive review on IdM with emphasis on how the emergence of blockchain has addressed the IdM challenges faced over the years. A thorough study has been done on the existing literature. The primary and secondary “search string” were identified and search was conducted on five databases; and after screening the analysis was done. Out of the total studied literature, 30 primary studies published from 2009 to 2020 were selected. Through this paper, the researchers will be able to: 1) find out the research trends in IdM using blockchain, 2) understand the challenges in IdM and report whether blockchain can solve the IdM challenges, 3) scrutinize and understand how the different frameworks of IdM would deal with security, integrity and privacy problems, 4) know about initiatives taken for IdM using blockchain, 5) which consensus algorithms are popular among blockchains, 6) know about the research projects going on in the field of IdM using blockchain.}

    "abstract": "Attractive colloids diffuse and aggregate to form gels, solid-like particle networks suspended in a fluid. Gravity is known to strongly impact the stability of gels once they are formed. However, its effect on the process of gel formation has seldom been studied. Here, we simulate the effect of gravity on gelation using both Brownian dynamics and a lattice-Boltzmann algorithm that accounts for hydrodynamic interactions. We work in a confined geometry to capture macroscopic, buoyancy-induced flows driven by the density mismatch between fluid and colloids. These flows give rise to a stability criterion for network formation, based on an effective accelerated sedimentation of nascent clusters at low volume fractions that disrupts gelation. Above a critical volume fraction, mechanical strength in the forming gel network dominates the dynamics: the interface between the colloid-rich and colloid-poor region moves downward at an ever decreasing rate. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic state, the colloidal gel-like sediment, which we find not to be appreciably impacted by the vigorous flows that can occur during the settling of the colloids. Our findings represent the first steps toward understanding how flow during formation affects the life span of colloidal gels.",

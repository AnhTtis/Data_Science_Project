abstract = {Switched reluctance motors are appealing because they are inexpensive in both construction and maintenance. The aim of this paper is to develop a commutation function that linearizes the nonlinear motor dynamics in such a way that the torque ripple is reduced. To this end, a convex optimization problem is posed that directly penalizes torque ripple in between samples, as well as power consumption, and Gaussian Process regression is used to obtain a continuous commutation function. The resulting function is fundamentally different from conventional commutation functions, and closed-loop simulations show significant reduction of the error. The results offer a new perspective on suitable commutation functions for accurate control of reluctance motors.}

abstract="One of the important roles of cytoskeleton is to maintain global mechanical strength of the cell. It is expected the effect of environmental mechanical stimulations appears in cell morphology. An environment of cultured cells in an ordinary incubator might be inappropriate, because those are normally free from mechanical stimulations such as fluid flow shear stress, tensile strain, compression and vibration. In this study, a three-dimensional micro vibration stage, to exert vibration stimulation non-invasively and three-dimensionally onto cultured cells, is developed. This vibration stage is assumed to be installed and operated in a CO2 incubator, so it has a compact and simple cantilever structure. In order to excite vibrations in each direction of orthogonal coordinate system, it has made from one stainless steel strip into a V-shaped vibrator, which is kinetically designed. Three piezoelectric ceramics were bonded on the vibrator, so that it is able to apply the three-dimensional vibration stimulation onto the cells on the culture dish. By using the developed stage, the effect of vibration stimulation was investigated morphologically. The experimental result shows that the vibration stimulation decreases the projected area and increases the slenderness ratio. In other words, the dynamic stimulation inhibits the progression of morphological change according to cell senescence. This might suggest that the stimulation affects gene expression pattern. Also, the most effective condition of vibration was horizontal direction of 10 Hz. It is found that the developed micro vibration stage is quite useful as a control device for cell culture.",

Each piezo actuator is developed by a new type of stroke magnifying mechanism incorporated with a multi-stacked PZT (lead zirconate titanate) and it is capable of performing micro vibrating motion. The flexure hinge, used to connect the piezo actuators, is designed to reduce the mutual interference of the linear motion of piezo actuators between two orthogonal directions and realize the in-plane parallel kinematic 2D vibration. According to the experimental results, the micro-vibration stage can generate large vibration amplitude up to 100μm in two orthogonal directions independently at a frequency of 1100Hz, and the vibration traces like line, circle and ellipse are acquired.}

abstract = {This paper presents a control strategy for the suppression of vibration due to unknown disturbance forces in large, nonlinear flexible structures. The control action proposed, based on the modal approach, consists of two contributions. The first is the well-known Independent Modal-Space Control, which increases system damping and improves its behavior close to the resonance frequencies. The second is a disturbance estimator, which calculates the modal components of the external forces acting on the system and compensates for them using actuator forces. The system modal coordinates, required by both logics, are estimated through a modal state observer. The proposed control logic is tested on a flexible boom. The paper reports the numerical and experimental results both for the linear and nonlinear (large motion) boom configuration.}

Increasingly stringent requirements for motion systems lead to a situation where the positioning performance can often not be measured directly and therefore has to be estimated. A typical example is a wafer stage, where the performance is desired at the point-of-exposure on the wafer but the sensors are located at the edge of the wafer stage. Increasingly stringent performance requirements necessitate taking structural deformations, caused by actuation or disturbance forces, into account. The aim of this paper is to develop a disturbance observer approach including an observer relevant model identification approach and to experimentally validate this approach on a prototype motion system. The experimental results confirm that the proposed disturbance observer approach leads to an improved estimation of the unmeasured performance variables.}

abstract = "Manufacturing equipment and scientific instruments, including wafer scanners, printers, microscopes, and medical imaging scanners, require accurate and fast motions. An increase in such requirements necessitates enhanced control performance. The aim of this paper is to identify several challenges for advanced motion control originating from these increasing accuracy, speed, and cost requirements. For instance, flexible mechanics must be explicitly addressed through overactuation, oversensing, inferential control, and position-dependent control. This in turn requires suitable models of appropriate complexity. One of the main advantages of such motion systems is the fact that experimenting and collecting large amounts of accurate data is inexpensive, paving the way for identifying and learning of models and controllers from experimental data. Several ongoing developments are outlined that constitute part of an overall framework for control, identification, and learning of complex motion systems. In turn, this may pave the way for new mechatronic design principles, leading to fast lightweight machines where spatio-temporal flexible mechanics are explicitly compensated through advanced motion control.",

The proposed method builds on recent tensor decomposition methods. The potential of the method is shown both in a simulation and using experimental data. When applied on noisy data and on real-life systems, which are not possible to be exactly decoupled, the proposed method typically performs better compared to eigen-decomposition based method.}

To handle such position-dependent behavior, the framework of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems offers powerful tools in terms of control synthesis with many successful practical applications. However, to achieve the desired performance, a low complexity but accurate LPV model of the underlying plant is of crucial importance. Obtaining LPV models for positioning devices based on first principle laws is a rigorous and costly process often resulting in models with inadequate accuracy. Therefore a data driven-modeling approach using Orthonormal Basis Functions (OBF's) is studied for the control oriented modeling of xy-positioning table dynamics. Through a simulation study it is demonstrated that the proposed modeling procedure, using only measurement data, can provide models whose accuracy is very close to the analytic models derived with the full knowledge of the system.",

abstract = {A procedure for sequential design of decentralized controllers for linear systems is presented. It is shown how to include a simple estimate of the effect of closing subsequent loops into the design problem for the loop which is to be closed. In the examples the robust performance in terms of the structured singular value is used as the measure of control performance, but the procedure may be applied also for other performance measures.}

abstract = {Industrial feedback motion controllers are tuned using manual loopshaping, according to certain design rules. This controller tuning serves as a benchmark for robust control research as applied to optical and magnetic disk drive storage systems. The design and implementation of robust controllers for the focus servo of a compact disk and the tracking servo of a hard disk mechanism is investigated. The design objective is to achieve good track-following performance in the presence of disk disturbances. H∞ robust control is used to systematically include disturbance and specification models in the standard plant framework. The control design iteration is based on disturbance identification, including implementation within the design cycle. The industrial relevance of robust control is discussed and areas for academic research in robust control are indicated, as feedback from industry.}

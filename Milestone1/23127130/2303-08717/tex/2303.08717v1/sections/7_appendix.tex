Next, we present the Supplementary Materials for the paper ``Re-ReND: Real-time Rendering of NeRFs across Devices''.
Specifically, in addition to the results reported in the paper, we report results of \methodname w.r.t. Image Quality~(Section~\ref{sec:im_qual}) and (Section~\ref{sec:quali}), Rendering Speed~(Section~\ref{sec:fps}), Mesh Size~(Section~\ref{sec:mesh_size} and Section~\ref{sec:meshi}), Disk Space~(Section~\ref{sec:disk_space}), validation of view-dependent effects (Section~\ref{sec:val}),  sensitivity to geometry variations (Section~\ref{sec:geo}) and Photo-metric quality w.r.t. embedding dimensionality $D$ (Section~\ref{sec:dim}).
Furthermore, we encourage the reviewers to watch the \textbf{associated video}, \texttt{Re-ReND.mp4}, demonstrating \methodname's capabilities of real-time rendering across devices.
% In particular, please refer to .
This video demonstrates how \methodname can render, in real time, a scene composed of tens (\Figure{composit}) or even thousands (\Figure{many_objects}) of objects. % , respectively. %  , or even with thousands of . %  in an AR headset.
\Figure{composit} illustrates such a scene, composed of moving chairs, hotdogs, the drumset, and a microphone.


% Finally, we also provide the PyTorch~\cite{NEURIPS2019_9015} and GLSL implementations of our method inside the folders called \texttt{Re-ReND\_Pytorch\_code} and \texttt{Re-ReND\_GLSL\_code}.

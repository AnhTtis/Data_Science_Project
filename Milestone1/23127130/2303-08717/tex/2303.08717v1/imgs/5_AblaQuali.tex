    \textbf{Qualitative Effect of Varying Number of Texels.} 
    We show renderings of synthetic and real scenes with an increasing number of texels per triangle face.
    Higher texels per face result in crispier renderings, although it is possible to appreciate directional effects such as specular highlights even with low texel counts.

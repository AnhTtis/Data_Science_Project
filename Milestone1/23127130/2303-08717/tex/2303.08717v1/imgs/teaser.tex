     \textbf{Rendering NeRFs in real-time on resource-constrained devices, such as AR/VR headsets and mobiles.}
     We present \methodname, a method for rendering a pre-trained NeRF in real-time on a variety of devices with constrained computational resources.
     \methodname preserves remarkable photo-metric quality even when rendering at over 1,013 FPS on a desktop browser, or at the capped 74 FPS of a VR headset. % (top).
     %Our method's speed also unlocks powerful applications, such as rendering thousands of objects real-time (bottom left), and allowing mix-reality on headsets (bottom right). %  \sara{correct?}
     % \albert{TODO add text related to new figures}
     Please, refer to the accompanying video for a demonstration of \methodname's capacities.

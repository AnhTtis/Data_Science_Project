    "abstract": "In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the implementation of a recently proposed robust and state-independent heat-bath algorithmic cooling (HBAC) method [1] on an NMR quantum processor. While HBAC methods improve the purity of a quantum system via iterative unitary entropy compression, they are difficult to implement experimentally since they use sort operations that are different for each iteration. The new robust HBAC method proved that optimal HBAC is possible without prior state information and using a single fixed operation. We modified the protocol to experimentally perform efficient cooling of 13C and 15N spins and provide an optimal decomposition of this modified protocol in terms of quantum gates. This is the first time that optimal HBAC has been experimentally demonstrated on 15N spins. We examined the relaxation dynamics of these algorithmically cooled spins, in order to ascertain the effect of decoherence on the cooled states.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model based on the interplay between the type-II seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generation mechanisms. The setup features a $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ discrete flavour symmetry which is broken down to a residual $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ responsible for stabilising dark matter. A singlet scalar field is introduced to implement spontaneous CP violation. The effective neutrino mass matrix two-texture zero structure leads to sharp neutrino sector predictions. We analyse the constraints imposed on the model by current and future charged lepton flavour violation experiments. This framework provides two viable dark matter candidates, scalar or fermion. We investigate the scalar dark matter scenario considering relic density, direct-detection and collider constraints.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the relationship between Temperley-Lieb immanants, which were introduced by Rhoades and Skandera, and %-immanants, an immanant based on a concept introduced by Chepuri and Sherman-Bennett. Our main result is a classification of when a Temperley-Lieb immanant can be written as a linear combination of %-immanants. This result uses a formula by Rhoades and Skandera to compute Temperley-Lieb immanants in terms of complementary minors. Using this formula, we also derive an explicit expression for the coefficients of a Temperley-Lieb immanant coming from a $321$-, $1324$-avoiding permutation $w$ containing the pattern $2143,$ which we use to derive our main result.",

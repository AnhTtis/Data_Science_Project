	Abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation--dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

	Abstract = {The interference pattern arising from light or particles passing through a double slit is a simple experiment that belies the subtleties of interpretation when attempting to describe and understand the effect. For example, determining {\textquotedblleft}which path{\textquotedblright} the light or particles travel can result in the interference pattern disappearing. Margalit et al. present a new take on interferometry using time (see the Perspective by Arndt and Brand). A clock{\textemdash}i.e., the internal state of a cold atom condensate{\textemdash}was coherently split and brought back together to interfere. Making one-half of the clock tick at a different rate resulted in a change in the interference pattern, possibly as a consequence of the time being a {\textquotedblleft}which path{\textquotedblright} witness.Science, this issue p. 1205; see also p. 1168In Einstein{\textquoteright}s general theory of relativity, time depends locally on gravity; in standard quantum theory, time is global{\textemdash}all clocks {\textquotedblleft}tick{\textquotedblright} uniformly. We demonstrate a new tool for investigating time in the overlap of these two theories: a self-interfering clock, comprising two atomic spin states. We prepare the clock in a spatial superposition of quantum wave packets, which evolve coherently along two paths into a stable interference pattern. If we make the clock wave packets {\textquotedblleft}tick{\textquotedblright} at different rates, to simulate a gravitational time lag, the clock time along each path yields {\textquotedblleft}which path{\textquotedblright} information, degrading the pattern{\textquoteright}s visibility. In contrast, in standard interferometry, time cannot yield {\textquotedblleft}which path{\textquotedblright} information. This proof-of-principle experiment may have implications for the study of time and general relativity and their impact on fundamental effects such as decoherence and the emergence of a classical world.},

Twenty years after the first realization of the BEC and 15 years after the realization of the atom chip, the latter has been found to enable extraordinary feats: from producing BECs at a rate of several per second, through the realization of matter-wave interferometry, and all the way to novel probing of surfaces and new forces. In addition, technological applications are also being intensively pursued. This review will describe these developments and more, including new ideas which have not yet been realized. },

	Abstract = {Thermodynamics is a highly successful macroscopic theory widely used across the natural sciences and for the construction of everyday devices, from car engines to solar cells. With thermodynamics predating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws that govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects. Recent theoretical breakthroughs include the characterisation of the efficiency of quantum thermal engines, the extension of classical non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to the quantum regime and a new thermodynamic resource theory has led to the discovery of a set of second laws for finite size systems. These results have substantially advanced our understanding of nanoscale thermodynamics, however putting a finger on what is genuinely quantum in quantum thermodynamics has remained a challenge. Here we identify information processing tasks, the so-called projections, that can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show that the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial thermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with information erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic work cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike. Repercussions on quantum work fluctuation relations and thermodynamic single-shot approaches are also discussed.},

@article{wang2017,
	Abstract = {We revisit the problem of work extraction from a system in contact with a heat bath to a work storage system, and the reverse problem of state formation from a thermal system state in single-shot quantum thermodynamics. A physically intuitive and mathematically simple approach using only elementary majorization theory and matrix analysis is developed, and a graphical interpretation of the maximum extractable work, minimum work cost of formation, and corresponding single-shot free energies is presented. This approach provides a bridge between two previous methods based respectively on the concept of thermomajorization and a comparison of subspace dimensions. In addition, a conceptual inconsistency with regard to general work extraction involving transitions between multiple energy levels of the work storage system is clarified and resolved. It is shown that an additional contribution to the maximum extractable work in those general cases should be interpreted not as work extracted from the system, but as heat transferred from the heat bath. Indeed, the additional contribution is an artifact of a work storage system (essentially a suspended `weight' that can be raised or lowered) that does not truly distinguish work from heat. The result calls into question the common concept that a work storage system in quantum thermodynamics is simply the quantum version of a suspended weight in classical thermodynamics.},

	Abstract = {The fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems are under intense theoretical and experimental investigation. Topical `fluctuation relations' describe symmetries of the statistical properties of certain observables, in a variety of models and phenomena. They have been derived in deterministic and, later, in stochastic frameworks. Other results first obtained for stochastic processes, and later considered in deterministic dynamics, describe the temporal evolution of fluctuations. The field has grown beyond expectation: research works and different perspectives are proposed at an ever faster pace. Indeed, understanding fluctuations is important for the emerging theory of nonequilibrium phenomena, as well as for applications, such as those of nanotechnological and biophysical interest. However, the links among the different approaches and the limitations of these approaches are not fully understood. We focus on these issues, providing: (a) analysis of the theoretical models; (b) discussion of the rigorous mathematical results; (c) identification of the physical mechanisms underlying the validity of the theoretical predictions, for a wide range of phenomena.},

	Abstract = {I review single-molecule experiments (SMEs) in biological physics. Recent technological
developments have provided the tools to design and build scientific instruments of high
enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate and visualize individual molecules and
measure microscopic forces. Using SMEs it is possible to manipulate molecules one at a
time and measure distributions describing molecular properties, characterize the
kinetics of biomolecular reactions and detect molecular intermediates. SMEs provide
additional information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes.
This complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SMEs it is
also possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in
biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize the basic
foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a very introductory level,
emphasizing the importance of SMEs to scientists interested in knowing the common
playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary topics accessible by these techniques.
The review discusses SMEs from an experimental perspective, first exposing the most
common experimental methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where
such techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as
atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOTs), magnetic tweezers (MTs),
biomembrane force probes (BFPs) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I then present
several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA and DNA
condensation) and proteins (protein--protein interactions, protein folding and molecular
motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SMEs to the study of the nonequilibrium
thermodynamics of small systems and the experimental verification of fluctuation
theorems. I conclude with a discussion of open questions and future perspectives.},

focused on first-principles computations for simple fragile glasses,
starting from the two-body interatomic potential. A replica
formulation translates this problem into that of a gas of
interacting molecules, each molecule being built of m atoms, and
having a gyration radius (related to the cage size) which vanishes
at zero temperature. We use a small-cage expansion, valid at low
temperatures, which allows us to compute the cage size, the specific
heat (which follows the Dulong and Petit law), and the
configurational entropy. The no-replica interpretation of the
computations is also briefly described. The results, particularly
those concerning the Kauzmann temperature and the configurational
entropy, are compared to recent numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {The grand canonical ensemble lies at the core of quantum and classical statistical mechanics. A small system thermalizes to this ensemble while exchanging heat and particles with a bath. A quantum system may exchange quantities represented by operators that fail to commute. Whether such a system thermalizes and what form the thermal state has are questions about truly quantum thermodynamics. Here we investigate this thermal state from three perspectives. First, we introduce an approximate microcanonical ensemble. If this ensemble characterizes the system-and-bath composite, tracing out the bath yields the system's thermal state. This state is expected to be the equilibrium point, we argue, of typical dynamics. Finally, we define a resource-theory model for thermodynamic exchanges of noncommuting observables. Complete passivity---the inability to extract work from equilibrium states---implies the thermal state's form, too. Our work opens new avenues into equilibrium in the presence of quantum noncommutation.},

In the limit of many such systems, passivity leads in turn to the concept of complete passivity, thermal states and the emergence of a thermodynamic temperature. Here we only consider a single system and show that every passive state except the thermal state is unstable under a weaker form of reversibility. Indeed, we show that given a single copy of any athermal quantum state, an optimal amount of energy can be extracted from it when we utilise a machine that operates in a reversible cycle. This means that for individual systems, the only form of passivity that is stable under general reversible processes is complete passivity, and thus provides a physically motivated identification of thermal states when we are not operating in the thermodynamic limit.},

	Abstract = {The presence of correlations in physical systems can be a valuable resource for many quantum information tasks. They are also relevant in thermodynamic transformations, and their creation is usually associated to some energetic cost. In this work, we study the role of correlations in the thermodynamic process of state formation in the single-shot regime, and find that correlations can also be viewed as a resource. First, we show that the energetic cost of creating multiple copies of a given state can be reduced by allowing correlations in the final state. We obtain the minimum cost for every finite number of subsystems, and then we show that this feature is not restricted to the case of copies. More generally, we demonstrate that in the asymptotic limit, by allowing a logarithmic amount of correlations, we can recover standard results where the free energy quantifies this minimum cost.},

	Abstract = {Steam locomotives, cars, and the drinking bird toy all convert heat into useful work as it cycles between two reservoirs at different temperatures. Usually, the working substance where the heat-work conversion occurs is a liquid or a gas, consisting of many molecules. Roβnagel et al. have made a working substance of a single calcium ion in a tapered ion trap. A laser-cooling beam plays the part of a cold reservoir for the calcium ion, and in turn, electric field noise acts as a hot reservoir.Science, this issue p. 325Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work and generally involve a large number of particles. We report the experimental realization of a single-atom heat engine. An ion is confined in a linear Paul trap with tapered geometry and driven thermally by coupling it alternately to hot and cold reservoirs. The output power of the engine is used to drive a harmonic oscillation. From direct measurements of the ion dynamics, we were able to determine the thermodynamic cycles for various temperature differences of the reservoirs. We then used these cycles to evaluate the power P and efficiency ηof the engine, obtaining values up to P = 3.4 ×10--22 joules per second and η= 0.28{\%}, consistent with analytical estimations. Our results demonstrate that thermal machines can be reduced to the limit of single atoms.},

	Abstract = {In the standard framework of thermodynamics, work is a random variable whose average is bounded by the change in free energy of the system. This average work is calculated without regard for the size of its fluctuations. Here we show that for some processes, such as reversible cooling, the fluctuations in work diverge. Realistic thermal machines may be unable to cope with arbitrarily large fluctuations. Hence, it is important to understand how thermodynamic efficiency rates are modified by bounding fluctuations. We quantify the work content and work of formation of arbitrary finite dimensional quantum states when the fluctuations in work are bounded by a given amount c. By varying c we interpolate between the standard and minimum free energies. We derive fundamental trade-offs between the magnitude of work and its fluctuations. As one application of these results, we derive the corrected Carnot efficiency of a qubit heat engine with bounded fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Quantum thermodynamics is a research field that aims at fleshing out the ultimate limits of thermodynamic processes in the deep quantum regime. A complete picture of thermodynamical processes naturally allows for auxiliary systems dubbed `catalysts', i.e., any physical systems facilitating state transformations while remaining essentially intact in their state, like an auxiliary system, a clock, or an actual catalyst. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the power and limitation of such thermal catalysis. Specifically, we provide a family of optimal catalysts that can be returned with minimal trace distance error after facilitating a state transformation process. To incorporate the genuine physical role of a catalyst, we identify very significant restrictions on arbitrary state transformations under dimension or mean energy bounds, using methods of convex relaxations. We discuss the implication of these findings on possible thermodynamic state transformations in the quantum regime.},

The traditional Carnot argument limits the conversion of heat to work; here we critically assess the problem of converting coherence to work. Through a careful account of all resources involved in the thermodynamic transformations within a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we show that there exist thermal machines extracting work from coherence arbitrarily well. Such machines only need to act on individual copies of a state and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal machine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted as work. However, even bounded thermal machines can be reused infinitely many times in the process of work extraction from coherence.},

	Abstract = {Thermal operations are an operational model of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics. In the absence of coherence between energy levels, exact state transition conditions under thermal operations are known in terms of a mathematical relation called thermo-majorization. But incorporating coherence has turned out to be challenging, even under the relatively tractable model wherein all Gibbs state-preserving quantum channels are included. Here we find a mathematical generalization of thermal operations at low temperatures, `cooling maps', for which we derive the necessary and sufficient state transition condition. Cooling maps that saturate recently discovered bounds on coherence transfer are realizable as thermal operations, motivating us to conjecture that all cooling maps are thermal operations. Cooling maps, though a less-conservative generalization to thermal operations, are more tractable than Gibbs-preserving operations, suggesting that cooling map-like models at general temperatures could be of use in gaining insight about thermal operations.},

The idea of exploiting this effect for creating coherent momentum superpositions for matter-wave interferometry appeared shortly after its discovery, almost a century ago, but was judged to be far beyond practical reach. Here we demonstrate a viable version of this idea. Our scheme uses pulsed magnetic field gradients, generated by currents in an atom chip wire, and radio-frequency Rabi transitions between Zeeman sublevels. We transform an atomic Bose--Einstein condensate into a superposition of spatially separated propagating wavepackets and observe spatial interference fringes with a measurable phase repeatability. The method is versatile in its range of momentum transfer and the different available splitting geometries. These features make our method a good candidate for supporting a variety of future applications and fundamental studies.},

Here we show that free energy relations cannot properly describe quantum coherence in thermodynamic processes. By casting time-asymmetry as a quantifiable, fundamental resource of a quantum state, we arrive at an additional, independent set of thermodynamic constraints that naturally extend the existing ones. These asymmetry relations reveal that the traditional Szil{\'a}rd engine argument does not extend automatically to quantum coherences, but instead only relational coherences in a multipartite scenario can contribute to thermodynamic work. We find that coherence transformations are always irreversible. Our results also reveal additional structural parallels between thermodynamics and the theory of entanglement.},

In 1997, Jarzynski proved an equality relating the irreversible work to the equilibrium free energy difference, ΔG. This remarkable theoretical result states that it is possible to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters from processes carried out arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We test Jarzynski{\textquoteright}s equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the ΔG profile of the stretching process to withink B T/2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching. The implementation and test of Jarzynski{\textquoteright}s equality provides the first example of its use as a bridge between the statistical mechanics of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. This work also extends the thermodynamic analysis of single molecule manipulation data beyond the context of equilibrium experiments.},

	Abstract = { The reason we never observe violations of the second law of thermodynamics is in part a matter of statistics: When ∼1023 degrees of freedom are involved, the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against the possibility of seeing significant deviations away from the mean behavior. As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law. },

Considering a collection of initially uncorrelated thermal quantum systems, we ask how much classical and quantum correlations can be obtained via a cyclic Hamiltonian process. We derive bounds on both the mutual information and entanglement of formation, as a function of the temperature of the systems and the available energy. While for a finite number of systems there is a maximal temperature allowing for the creation of entanglement, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement---the strongest form of entanglement in multipartite systems---can be created at any finite temperature when sufficiently many systems are considered. This approach may find applications, e.g. in quantum information processing, for physical platforms in which thermodynamic considerations cannot be ignored.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between thermodynamics and statistical physics is valid in the thermodynamic limit---when the number of particles becomes very large. Here we study thermodynamics in the opposite regime---at both the nanoscale and when quantum effects become important. Applying results from quantum information theory, we construct a theory of thermodynamics in these limits. We derive general criteria for thermodynamical state transitions, and, as special cases, find two free energies: one that quantifies the deterministically extractable work from a small system in contact with a heat bath, and the other that quantifies the reverse process. We find that there are fundamental limitations on work extraction from non-equilibrium states, owing to finite size effects and quantum coherences. This implies that thermodynamical transitions are generically irreversible at this scale. As one application of these methods, we analyse the efficiency of small heat engines and find that they are irreversible during the adiabatic stages of the cycle.},

	Abstract = {Two approaches to small-scale and quantum thermodynamics are fluctuation relations and one-shot statistical mechanics. Fluctuation relations (such as Crooks' theorem and Jarzynski's equality) relate nonequilibrium behaviors to equilibrium quantities such as free energy. One-shot statistical mechanics involves statements about every run of an experiment, not just about averages over trials. We investigate the relation between the two approaches. We show that both approaches feature the same notions of work and the same notions of probability distributions over possible work values. The two approaches are alternative toolkits with which to analyze these distributions. To combine the toolkits, we show how one-shot work quantities can be defined and bounded in contexts governed by Crooks' theorem. These bounds provide a new bridge from one-shot theory to experiments originally designed for testing fluctuation theorems.},

@article{gore2003,
	Abstract = {In 1997, Jarzynski proved a remarkable equality that allows one to compute the equilibrium free-energy difference ΔF between two states from the probability distribution of the nonequilibrium work W done on the system to switch between the states, e{\textendash}ΔF/kT = 〈e{\textendash}W/kT〉, [Jarzynski, C. (1997) Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 2690{\textendash}2693]. The Jarzynski equality provides a powerful free-energy difference estimator from a set of N irreversible experiments and is closely related to free-energy perturbation, a common computational technique for estimating free-energy differences. Despite the many applications of the Jarzynski estimator, its behavior is only poorly understood. In this article we derive the large N limit for the Jarzynski estimator bias, variance, and mean square error that is correct for arbitrary perturbations. We then analyze the properties of the Jarzynski estimator for all N when the probability distribution of work values is Gaussian, as occurs, for example, in the near-equilibrium regime. This allows us to quantitatively compare it to two other free-energy difference estimators: the mean work estimator and the fluctuation{\textendash}dissipation theorem estimator. We show that, for near-equilibrium switching, the Jarzynski estimator is always superior to the mean work estimator and is even superior to the fluctuation{\textendash}dissipation estimator for small N. The Jarzynski-estimator bias is shown to be the dominant source of error in many cases. Our expression for the bias is used to develop a bias-corrected Jarzynski free-energy difference estimator in the near-equilibrium regime.},

@article{gemmer2015,
	Abstract = {This paper considers work extraction from a quantum system to a work storage system (or weight) following Horodecki and Oppenheim (2013 Nat. Commun. 4 2059). An alternative approach is here developed that relies on the comparison of subspace dimensions without a need to introduce thermo-majorization used previously. Optimal single shot work for processes where a weight transfers from (a) a single energy level to another single energy level is then re-derived. In addition we discuss the final state of the system after work extraction and show that the system typically ends in its thermal state, while there are cases where the system is only close to it. The work of formation in the single level transfer setting is also re-derived. The approach presented now allows the extension of the single shot work concept to work extraction (b) involving multiple final levels of the weight. A key conclusion here is that the single shot work for case (a) is appropriate only when a resonance of a particular energy is required. When wishing to identify `work extraction' with finding the weight in a specific available energy or any higher energy a broadening of the single shot work concept is required. As a final contribution we consider transformations of the system that (c) result in general weight state transfers. Introducing a transfer-quantity allows us to formulate minimum requirements for transformations to be at all possible in a thermodynamic framework. We show that choosing the free energy difference of the weight as the transfer-quantity one recovers various single shot results including single level transitions (a), multiple final level transitions (b), and recent results on restricted sets of multi-level to multi-level weight transfers.},

We consider a bipartite quantum system and we show that it is possible to optimize the process of work extraction, thanks to the correlations between the two parts of the system, by using an appropriate feedback protocol based on the concept of ergotropy. We prove that the maximum gain in the extracted work is related to the existence of quantum correlations between the two parts, quantified by either quantum discord or, for pure states, entanglement. We then illustrate our general findings on a simple physical situation consisting of a qubit system.},

@article{faist2015,
	Abstract = {In this brief paper, we compare two frameworks for characterizing possible operations in quantum thermodynamics. One framework considers thermal operations---unitaries which conserve energy. The other framework considers all maps which preserve the Gibbs state at a given temperature. Thermal operations preserve the Gibbs state; hence a natural question which arises is whether the two frameworks are equivalent. Classically, this is true---Gibbs-preserving maps are no more powerful than thermal operations. Here, we show that this no longer holds in the quantum regime: a Gibbs-preserving map can generate coherent superpositions of energy levels while thermal operations cannot. This gap has an impact on clarifying a mathematical framework for quantum thermodynamics.},

	Abstract = {The use of the von Neumann entropy in formulating the laws of thermodynamics has recently been challenged. It is associated with the average work whereas the work guaranteed to be extracted in any single run of an experiment is the more interesting quantity in general. We show that an expression that quantifies majorization determines the optimal guaranteed work. We argue it should therefore be the central quantity of statistical mechanics, rather than the von Neumann entropy. In the limit of many identical and independent subsystems (asymptotic i.i.d) the von Neumann entropy expressions are recovered but in the non-equilbrium regime the optimal guaranteed work can be radically different to the optimal average. Moreover our measure of majorization governs which evolutions can be realized via thermal interactions, whereas the non-decrease of the von Neumann entropy is not sufficiently restrictive. Our results are inspired by single-shot information theory.},

This occurs when carrying out irreversible operations, thus releasing heat to the environment. For example, in electronics, heat generation is a major obstacle to circuitry miniaturization. Del Rio et al. show that the situation is completely different in the presence of quantum information about the system, and the implications of Landauer's principle are invalid. The more that is known about a system, the less it costs to erase it. An observer who is strongly correlated with a system may even gain work while erasing it, therefore cooling the environment. The quantum systems needed to experimentally demonstrate these results are, in principle, accessible with current technology.},

	Abstract = {Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular interactions, by exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such as unfolding or dissociation. These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects---features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems1,2,3,4,5 allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements6 and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin7,8. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem9 can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers10 to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin11 and an RNA three-helix junction12. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.},

	Abstract = {We propose a feasible experimental scheme to direct measure heat and work in cold atomic setups. The method is based on a recent proposal which shows that work is a positive operator valued measure (POVM). In the present contribution, we demonstrate that the interaction between the atoms and the light polarization of a probe laser allows us to implement such POVM. In this way the work done on or extracted from the atoms after a given process is encoded in the light quadrature that can be measured with a standard homodyne detection. The protocol allows one to verify fluctuation theorems and study properties of the non-unitary dynamics of a given thermodynamic process.},

	Abstract = {We study an interferometric method for measuring the statistics of work performed on a driven quantum system, which has been put forward recently (Dorner et al 2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 230601, Mazzola et al 2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 230602). This method allows the replacement of two projective measurements of the energy of the driven system with qubit tomography of an ancilla that is appropriately coupled to it. We highlight that this method could be employed to obtain the work statistics of closed as well as open driven system, even in the strongly dissipative regime. We then illustrate an implementation of the method in a circuit QED setup, which allows one to experimentally obtain the work statistics of a parametrically driven harmonic oscillator. Our implementation is an extension of the original method, in which two ancilla-qubits are employed and the work statistics are retrieved through two-qubit state tomography. Our simulations demonstrate the experimental feasibility.},

	Abstract = {In ordinary thermodynamics, transitions are governed by a single quantity--the free energy. Its monotonicity is a formulation of the second law. Here, we find that the second law for microscopic or highly correlated systems takes on a very different form than it does at the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but many. We find a family of quantum free energies which generalize the standard free energy, and can never increase. The ordinary second law corresponds to the nonincreasing of one of these free energies, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, these additional second laws become equivalent to the standard one. We also prove a strengthened version of the zeroth law of thermodynamics, allowing a definition of temperature.The second law of thermodynamics places constraints on state transformations. It applies to systems composed of many particles, however, we are seeing that one can formulate laws of thermodynamics when only a small number of particles are interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies.},

We first illustrate two paradigmatic schemes that allow one to measure the work distribution: a Ramsey technique to measure the characteristic function and a positive operator valued measure (POVM) scheme to directly measure the work probability distribution. Then, we show that these two ideas can be understood in a unified framework for assessing work fluctuations through a generic quantum detector and describe two protocols that are able to yield complementary information. This allows us also to highlight how quantum work is affected by the presence of coherences in the system's initial state. Finally, we describe physical implementations and experimental realisations of the first two schemes.",

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that in a standard thermo-electric nanodevice the current and heat flows are not only dictated by the temperature and potential gradient, but also by the external action of a local quantum observer that controls the coherence of the device. Depending on how and where the observation takes place, the direction of heat and particle currents can be independently controlled. In fact, we show that the current and heat flow in a quantum material can go against the natural temperature and voltage gradients. Dynamical quantum observation offers new possibilities for the control of quantum transport far beyond classical thermal reservoirs. Through the concept of local projections, we illustrate how we can create and directionality control the injection of currents (electronic and heat) in nanodevices. This scheme provides novel strategies to construct quantum devices with application in thermoelectrics, spintronic injection, phononics, and sensing among others. In particular, highly efficient and selective spin injection might be achieved by local spin projection techniques.},

	Abstract = {The laws of thermodynamics, despite their wide range of applicability, are known to break down when systems are correlated with their environments. Here we generalize thermodynamics to physical scenarios which allow presence of correlations, including those where strong correlations are present. We exploit the connection between information and physics, and introduce a consistent redefinition of heat dissipation by systematically accounting for the information flow from system to bath in terms of the conditional entropy. As a consequence, the formula for the Helmholtz free energy is accordingly modified. Such a remedy not only fixes the apparent violations of Landauer's erasure principle and the second law due to anomalous heat flows, but also leads to a generally valid reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics. In this information-theoretic approach, correlations between system and environment store work potential. Thus, in this view, the apparent anomalous heat flows are the refrigeration processes driven by such potentials.},

Although experimental tests of the equality have been performed in the classical regime, the quantum Jarzynski equality has not yet been fully verified owing to experimental challenges in measuring work and work distributions in a quantum system. Here, we report an experimental test of the quantum Jarzynski equality with a single 171Yb+ ion trapped in a harmonic potential. We perform projective measurements to obtain phonon distributions of the initial thermal state. We then apply a laser-induced force to the projected energy eigenstate and find transition probabilities to final energy eigenstates after the work is done. By varying the speed with which we apply the force from the equilibrium to the far-from-equilibrium regime, we verify the quantum Jarzynski equality in an isolated system.},

These fluctuations can be of the same order as the expected work content per se, in which case the extracted energy is unpredictable, thus intuitively more heat-like than work-like. This raises the question of the `truly'work-like energy that can be extracted. Here we consider an alternative that corresponds to an essentially fluctuation-free extraction. We show that this quantity can be expressed in terms of a one-shot relative entropy measure introduced in information theory. This suggests that the relations between information theory and statistical mechanics, as illustrated by concepts like Maxwell's demon, Szilard engines and Landauer's principle, extends to the single-shot regime.},

	Abstract = {The most accepted version of the third law of thermodynamics, the unattainability principle, states that any process cannot reach absolute zero temperature in a finite number of steps and within a finite time. Here, we provide a derivation of the principle that applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any temperature, and translate these resources into the minimal time or number of steps, by considering the notion of a thermal machine that obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the unattainability principle and the heat theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased.},

	Abstract = {A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in computation time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.},

	Abstract = {A suitable way of quantifying work for microscopic quantum    systems has been constantly debated in the field of quantum thermodynamics.      One natural approach is to measure the average increase in energy of an      ancillary system, called the battery, after a work extraction protocol.      The quality of energy extracted is usually argued to be good by      quantifying higher moments of the energy distribution, or by restricting      the amount of entropy to be low. This limits the amount of heat      contribution to the energy extracted, but does not completely prevent it.      We show that the definition of `work' is crucial. If one allows for a      definition of work that tolerates a non-negligible entropy increase in      the battery, then a small scale heat engine can possibly exceed the      Carnot efficiency. This can be done without using any additional      resources such as coherence or correlations, and furthermore can be      achieved even when one of the heat baths is finite in size.},

	Abstract = {Thermodynamics is traditionally constrained to the study of macroscopic systems whose energy fluctuations are negligible compared to their average energy. Here, we push beyond this thermodynamic limit by developing a mathematical framework to rigorously address the problem of thermodynamic transformations of finite-size systems. More formally, we analyse state interconversion under thermal operations and between arbitrary energy-incoherent states. We find precise relations between the optimal rate at which interconversion can take place and the desired infidelity of the final state when the system size is sufficiently large. These so-called second-order asymptotics provide a bridge between the extreme cases of single-shot thermodynamics and the asymptotic limit of infinitely large systems. We illustrate the utility of our results with several examples. We first show how thermodynamic cycles are affected by irreversibility due to finite-size effects. We then provide a precise expression for the gap between the distillable work and work of formation that opens away from the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we explain how the performance of a heat engine gets affected when one of the heat baths it operates between is finite. We find that while perfect work cannot generally be extracted at Carnot efficiency, there are conditions under which these finite-size effects vanish. In deriving our results we also clarify relations between different notions of approximate majorisation.},

	Abstract = {A set λ of stochastic variables, y1,y2, {\ldots}, yn, is grouped into subsets, µ1, µ2, ..., µk. The correlation existing in λ with respect to the µ's is adequately expressed by an equation where S(ν) is the entropy function defined with reference to the variables y in subset ν. For a given λ, C becomes maximum when each µiconsists of only one variable, (n = k). The value C is then called the total correlation in λ, Ctot(λ). The present paper gives various theorems, according to which Ctot(λ) can be decomposed in terms of the partial correlations existing in subsets of λ, and of quantities derivable therefrom. The information-theoretical meaning of each decomposition is carefully explained. As illustrations, two problems are discussed at the end of the paper: (1) redundancy in geometrical figures in pattern recognition, and (2) randomization effect of shuffling cards marked ``zero'' or ``one.''},

@article{gour2015,
	Abstract = {We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies, and that of quantifying the gap between the nonuniformity one must expend to achieve a single-shot state preparation or state conversion and the nonuniformity one can extract in the reverse operation. Quantum state-conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.},

	Abstract = {Building upon work by Matsumoto, we show that the quantum relative entropy with full-rank second argument is determined by four simple axioms: i) Continuity in the first argument, ii) the validity of the data-processing inequality, iii) additivity under tensor products, and iv) super-additivity. This observation has immediate implications for quantum thermodynamics, which we discuss. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under reasonable restrictions, the free energy is singled out as a measure of athermality. In particular, we consider an extended class of Gibbs-preserving maps as free operations in a resource-theoretic framework, in which a catalyst is allowed to build up correlations with the system at hand. The free energy is the only extensive and continuous function that is monotonic under such free operations.},

	Abstract = {Many fields of science investigate states and processes as resources. Chemistry, thermodynamics, Shannon's theory of communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are prominent examples. Questions addressed by these theories include: Which resources can be converted into which others? At what rate can many copies of one resource be converted into many copies of another? Can a catalyst enable a conversion? How to quantify a resource? We propose a general mathematical definition of resource theory. We prove general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes with a subclass of processes that are freely implementable. These define the means by which costly states and processes can be interconverted. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework, which is a first step in a project of identifying universal features and principles of resource theories. We develop a few general results concerning resource convertibility.},

@article{woods2019,
	Abstract = {Sadi Carnot's theorem regarding the maximum efficiency of heat engines is considered to be of fundamental importance in thermodynamics. This theorem famously states that the maximum efficiency depends only on the temperature of the heat baths used by the engine, but not on the specific structure of baths. Here, we show that when the heat baths are finite in size, and when the engine operates in the quantum nanoregime, a revision to this statement is required. We show that one may still achieve the Carnot efficiency, when certain conditions on the bath structure are satisfied; however if that is not the case, then the maximum achievable efficiency can reduce to a value which is strictly less than Carnot. We derive the maximum efficiency for the case when one of the baths is composed of qubits. Furthermore, we show that the maximum efficiency is determined by either the standard second law of thermodynamics, analogously to the macroscopic case, or by the non increase of the max relative entropy, which is a quantity previously associated with the single shot regime in many quantum protocols. This relative entropic quantity emerges as a consequence of additional constraints, called generalized free energies, that govern thermodynamical transitions in the nanoregime. Our findings imply that in order to maximize efficiency, further considerations in choosing bath Hamiltonians should be made, when explicitly constructing quantum heat engines in the future. This understanding of thermodynamics has implications for nanoscale engineering aiming to construct small thermal machines.},

	abstract = {A central topic in the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is the definition of thermodynamic work in the quantum regime. One widely used solution is to define work for a closed system undergoing non-equilibrium dynamics according to the two-point energy measurement scheme. However, due to the invasive nature of measurement the two-point quantum work probability distribution cannot describe the statistics of energy change from the perspective of the system alone. We here introduce the quantum histories framework as a method to characterise the thermodynamic properties of the unmeasured, closed dynamics. Constructing continuous power operator trajectories allows us to derive an alternative quantum work distribution for closed quantum dynamics that fulfils energy conservation and is time-reversal symmetric. This opens the possibility to compare the measured work with the unmeasured work, contrasting with the classical situation where measurement does not affect the work statistics. We find that the work distribution of the unmeasured dynamics leads to deviations from the classical Jarzynski equality and can have negative values highlighting distinctly non-classical features of quantum work.}}

Moreover, the positivity is closely related to the quantum fluctuation theorem, while the monotonicity leads to a quantum version of the Hatano-Sasa inequality for nonequilibrium steady states. Based on the monotonicity, we also discuss the data processing inequality for the quantum mutual information, which has a similar mathematical structure to that of the second law. Moreover, we derive a generalized second law with quantum feedback control. In addition, we review a proof of the monotonicity in line with Petz.}}

As converting heat to work is one of the fundamental concerns in thermodynamics, the platform of quantum thermal machines sheds light on thermodynamics in the quantum regime. This chapter focuses on the basic features of quantum mechanics, such as energy quantization, the uncertainty principle, quantum coherence and correlations, and their manifestation in microscopic thermal devices. In addition to indicating the peculiar behaviors of thermal-machines due to their non-classical aspects, we present quantum-thermodynamic signatures of these machines. Any violation of the classical thermodynamic bounds observed in the outcome of measurements on theses machines is a sufficient condition to conclude that quantum effects are present in the operation of that thermal machine. Experimental setups demonstrating some of these results are also presented.",

  abstract="Resource theories are a generic approach used to manage any valuable resource, such as entanglement, purity, and asymmetry. Such frameworks are characterized by two main elements: a set of predefined (free) operations and states, that one assumes to be easily obtained at no cost. Given these ground rules, one can ask: what is achievable by using such free operations and states? This usually results in a set of state transition conditions, that tell us if a particular state {\$}{\$} {\backslash}rho {\$}{\$}$\rho$may evolve into another state {\$}{\$} {\backslash}rho ' {\$}{\$}$\rho${\textasciiacutex}via the usage of free operations and states. We shall see in this chapter that thermal interactions can be modelled as a resource theory. The state transition conditions arising out of such a framework, are then referred to as ``second laws''. We shall also see how such state transition conditions recover classical thermodynamics in the i.i.d. limit. Finally, we discuss how these laws are applied to study fundamental limitations to the performance of quantum heat engines.",

	abstract = {Although nonequilibrium work and fluctuation relations have been studied in detail within classical statistical physics, extending these results to open quantum systems has proven to be conceptually difficult. For systems that undergo decoherence but not dissipation, we argue that it is natural to define quantum work exactly as for isolated quantum systems, using the two-point measurement protocol. Complementing previous theoretical analysis using quantum channels, we show that the nonequilibrium work relation remains valid in this situation, and we test this assertion experimentally using a system engineered from a trapped ion, adding external noise to produce the effects of decoherence. Our experimental results reveal the work relation's validity over a variety of driving speeds, decoherence rates, and effective temperatures and represent the first confirmation of the work relation for evolution described by a non-unitary master equation.}}

The most important of these are trace-preserving maps, also known as quantum channels. We discuss those conditions on quantum channels under  which the Jarzynski equality and related fluctuation theorems hold. It is essential that the representing quantum channel be unital. Under this condition, we first derive the corresponding Jarzynski equality. For a bistochastic map and its adjoint, we further formulate a theorem of Tasaki–Crooks type. In the context of unital channels, some notes on heat transfer between two quantum systems are given. We also consider the case of a finite system operated on by an external agent with feedback control. When unital channels are applied at the first stage and, for a mutual-information form, at the further ones, we obtain quantum Jarzynski–Sagawa–Ueda relations. These are extensions of the previously given results to unital quantum operations.}}

This fundamental restriction, known as Landauer's principle, is increasingly relevant today, as the energy dissipation of computing devices impedes the development of their performance. Here we determine the minimal work required to carry out any logical process, for instance a computation. It is given by the entropy of the discarded information conditional to the output of the computation. Our formula takes precisely into account the statistically fluctuating work requirement of the logical process. It enables the explicit calculation of practical scenarios, such as computational circuits or quantum measurements. On the conceptual level, our result gives a precise and operational connection between thermodynamic and information entropy, and explains the emergence of the entropy state function in macroscopic thermodynamics.},

	Abstract = {Noether's theorem is a fundamental result in physics stating that every symmetry of the dynamics implies a conservation law. It is, however, deficient in several respects: for one, it is not applicable to dynamics wherein the system interacts with an environment; furthermore, even in the case where the system is isolated, if the quantum state is mixed then the Noether conservation laws do not capture all of the consequences of the symmetries. Here we address these deficiencies by introducing measures of the extent to which a quantum state breaks a symmetry. Such measures yield novel constraints on state transitions: for nonisolated systems they cannot increase, whereas for isolated systems they are conserved. We demonstrate that the problem of finding non-trivial asymmetry measures can be solved using the tools of quantum information theory. Applications include deriving model-independent bounds on the quantum noise in amplifiers and assessing quantum schemes for achieving high-precision metrology.},

Here we develop a resource theory, analogous to the theory of entanglement, that is relevant for fault-tolerant stabilizer computation. We introduce two quantitative measures—monotones—for the amount of non-stabilizer resource. As an application we give absolute bounds on the efficiency of magic state distillation. One of these monotones is the sum of the negative entries of the discrete Wigner representation of a quantum state, thereby resolving a long-standing open question of whether the degree of negativity in a quasi-probability representation is an operationally meaningful indicator of quantum behavior.}}

	Abstract = {Entanglement is central both to the foundations of quantum theory and, as a novel resource, to quantum information science. The theory of entanglement establishes basic laws that govern its manipulation, in particular the non-increase of entanglement under local operations on the constituent particles. Such laws aim to draw from them formal analogies to the second law of thermodynamics; however, whereas in the second law the entropy uniquely determines whether a state is adiabatically accessible from another, the manipulation of entanglement under local operations exhibits a fundamental irreversibility, which prevents the existence of such an order. Here, we show that a reversible theory of entanglement and a rigorous relationship with thermodynamics may be established when considering all non-entangling transformations. The role of the entropy in the second law is taken by the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement in the basic law of entanglement. We show the usefulness of this approach to general resource theories and to quantum information theory.},

Here we suggest that the main postulate of statistical mechanics, the equal a priori probability postulate, should be abandoned as misleading and unnecessary. We argue that it should be replaced by a general canonical principle, whose physical content is fundamentally different from the postulate it replaces: it refers to individual states, rather than to ensemble or time averages. Furthermore, whereas the original postulate is an unprovable assumption, the principle we propose is mathematically proven. The key element in this proof is the quantum entanglement between the system and its environment. Our approach separates the issue of finding the canonical state from finding out how close a system is to it, allowing us to go even beyond the usual boltzmannian situation.},

@article{visscher1999,
  Abstract = {Kinesin is a two-headed, ATP-driven motor protein that moves
    processively along microtubules in discrete steps of 8 nm, probably by
    advancing each of its heads alternately in sequence1,2,3,4. Molecular
    details of how the chemical energy stored in ATP is coupled to mechanical
    displacement remain obscure. To shed light on this question, a force clamp
    was constructed, based on a feedback-driven optical trap capable of
    maintaining constant loads on single kinesin motors5. The instrument
    provides unprecedented resolution of molecular motion and permits
    mechanochemical studies under controlled external loads. Analysis of
    records of kinesin motion under variable ATP concentrations and loads
    revealed several new features. First, kinesin stepping appears to be
    tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis over a wide range of forces, with a
    single hydrolysis per 8-nm mechanical advance. Second, the kinesin stall
    force depends on the ATP concentration. Third, increased loads reduce the
    maximum velocity as expected, but also raise the apparent Michaelis--Menten
    constant. The kinesin cycle therefore contains at least one load-dependent
    transition affecting the rate at which ATP molecules bind and subsequently
    commit to hydrolysis. It is likely that at least one other load-dependent
    rate exists, affecting turnover number.  Together, these findings will
    necessitate revisions to our understanding of how kinesin motors
    function.},

@article{seifert2008,
  Abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics provides a framework for describing
    small systems like colloids or biomolecules driven out of equilibrium but
    still in contact with a heat bath. Both, a first-law like energy balance
    involving exchanged heat and entropy production entering refinements of the
    second law can consistently be defined along single stochastic
    trajectories. Various exact relations involving the distribution of such
    quantities like integral and detailed fluctuation theorems for total
    entropy production and the Jarzynski relation follow from such an approach
    based on Langevin dynamics. Analogues of these relations can be proven for
    any system obeying a stochastic master equation like, in particular,
    (bio)chemically driven enzyms or whole reaction networks. The perspective
    of investigating such relations for stochastic field equations like the
    Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation is sketched as well.},

@article{cerisola2017,
  Abstract = {Work is an essential concept in classical thermodynamics, and in
    the quantum regime, where the notion of a trajectory is not available, its
      definition is not trivial. For driven (but otherwise isolated) quantum
      systems, work can be defined as a random variable, associated with the
      change in the internal energy. The probability for the different values
      of work captures essential information describing the behaviour of the
      system, both in and out of thermal equilibrium. In fact, the work
      probability distribution is at the core of ``fluctuation theorems''in
      quantum thermodynamics. Here we present the design and implementation of
      a quantum work meter operating on an ensemble of cold atoms, which are
      controlled by an atom chip. Our device not only directly measures work
      but also directly samples its probability distribution. We demonstrate
      the operation of this new tool and use it to verify the validity of the
      quantum Jarzynksi identity.},

    "abstract": "In this article we introduce a quasiprobability distribution of work that is based on the Wigner function. This construction rests on the idea that the work done on an isolated system can be coherently measured by coupling the system to a quantum measurement apparatus. In this way, a quasiprobability distribution of work can be defined in terms of the Wigner function of the apparatus. This quasidistribution contains the information of the work statistics and also holds a clear operational definition. Moreover, it is shown that the presence of quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis is related with the appearance of characteristics related to non-classicality in the Wigner function such as negativity and interference fringes. On the other hand, from this quasiprobability distribution it is straightforward to obtain the standard two-point measurement probability distribution of work and also the difference in average energy for initial states with coherences.",

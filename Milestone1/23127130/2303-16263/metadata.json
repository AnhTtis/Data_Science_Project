    "abstract": "In this short note we develop new methods toward the ultimate goal of classifying geproci sets in $\\mathbb P^3$. We apply these method to show that among sets of $16$ points distributed evenly on $4$ skew lines, up to projective equivalence there are only two distinct geproci sets. We give different geometric distinctions between these sets. The methods we develop here can be applied in a more general set-up; this is the context of follow-up work in progress.",

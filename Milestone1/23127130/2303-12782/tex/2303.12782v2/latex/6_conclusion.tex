\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present Tube-Link, a simple yet flexible universal video segmentation framework. Our key insight is to perform cross-tube matching rather than cross-frame matching. By equipping the Mask2Former architecture with the proposed cross-tube learning, Tube-Link achieves new state-of-the-art results in all three major video segmentation tasks (VSS, VIS, VPS) using one unified architecture.

\noindent
\textbf{Limitation and Future Work.}
Tube-Link is pretrained on image datasets, and it requires re-training for each new video dataset. In the future, we hope to develop a model that can be trained only once to unify universal image and video segmentation tasks. One potential solution can be training our Tube-Link with the merged image and video datasets using CLIP~\cite{radford2021learning} text embedding to unify labels.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to study the natural action of the real symplectic group, $\\operatorname{Sp}(4, \\mathbb{R})$, on the algebraic set of $4$-dimensional Lie algebras admitting symplectic structures and to give a complete classification of orbit closures.\n  We present some applications of such classification to the study of the Ricci curvature of left-invariant almost Kähler structures on four dimensional Lie groups.",

\section{Discussion}
Object rearrangement offers an intuitive setting for studying how an agent can learn reusable abstractions from its sensorimotor experience.
This paper takes a first step toward connecting the world of symbolic planning with human-defined abstractions and the world of representation learning with deep networks by introducing~\methodname.
\methodname is a method for controlling an agent that plans over and acts with state transition graph constructed with entity representations learned from raw sensorimotor transitions, without any other supervision.
We showed that factorizing the entity representation into action-invariant and action-dependent features are important for solving the correspondence and combinatorial problems that make the object rearrangement difficult, and enable~\methodname to significantly outperform existing methods on combinatorial generalization in object rearrangement.
The implementation of~\methodname provides a proof-of-concept for how learning reusable abstractions might be done, which we hope inspires future work to engineer methods like~\methodname for real-world settings.

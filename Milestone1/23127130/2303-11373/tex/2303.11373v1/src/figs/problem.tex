    \caption{\small{\textbf{Solving object rearrangement requires solving two challenges}. 
    (a) The \textbf{correspondence problem} is the problem of abstracting raw sensorimotor signal into representations of entities such that there is a correspondence between how an agent intervenes on an entity and how its action affects an object in the environment.
    $k$ denotes the index of the entity, $z$ denotes its type (shown with solid colors), and $s$ denotes its state (shown with textures).
    The entity representing the moved object is in black.
    (b) The \textbf{combinatorial problem} is the problem of representing the combinatorial task space in a way that enables an agent to transfer knowledge of a given state transition (indicated by the dotted circle) to different contexts.

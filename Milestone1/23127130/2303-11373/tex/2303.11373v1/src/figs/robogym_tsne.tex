  \textbf{Nodes as equivalent classes over states.}
  We show a clustering of states inferred for \emph{robogym-rearrange}, where each cluster centroid is treated as a node in our transition graph.
  We label some clusters with an attention mask computed by averaging the slot attention masks for the entities associated with the cluster.

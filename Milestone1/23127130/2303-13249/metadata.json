    "abstract": "The reconstruction of trajectories of charged particles is a key computational challenge for current and future collider experiments. Considering the rapid progress in quantum computing, it is crucial to explore its potential for this and other problems in high-energy physics. The problem can be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and solved using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In this work the effects of dividing the QUBO into smaller sub-QUBOs that fit on the hardware available currently or in the near term are assessed. Then, the performance of the VQE on small sub-QUBOs is studied in an ideal simulation, using a noise model mimicking a quantum device and on IBM quantum computers. This work serves as a proof of principle that the VQE could be used for particle tracking and investigates modifications of the VQE to make it more suitable for combinatorial optimization.",

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

We have presented efficient SMC algorithms based on DPOR for transactional programs running under standard isolation levels. These algorithms are instances of a generic schema, called swapping-based algorithms, which is parametrized by an isolation level. Our algorithms are sound and complete, and have a polynomial space complexity. Additionally, we have identified a class of isolation levels, including $\RC$, $\RA$, and $\CC$, for which our algorithms are strongly optimal, and we have shown that swapping-based algorithms cannot be strongly optimal in the case of the stronger levels $\SI$ and $\SER$ (but just optimal). It is interesting to observe that for the isolation levels we considered, there is an intriguing coincidence between the existence of a strongly optimal swapping-based algorithm and the complexity for checking if a given history is consistent with that level. Indeed, checking consistency is polynomial time for $\RC$, $\RA$, and $\CC$, and NP-complete for $\SI$ and $\SER$. 
%for RC, RA, and CC, , and for both SI and SER, there are no strongly optimal swapping-based algorithms and checking consistency is NP-complete. 
Investigating further the relationship between strong optimality and polynomial-time consistency checks is an interesting direction for future work. 
%An interesting question to investigate is the characterization of isolation levels for which strong optimality can be ensured (under the swapping-based paradigm), and whether this characterization is related to the complexity of checking consistency.

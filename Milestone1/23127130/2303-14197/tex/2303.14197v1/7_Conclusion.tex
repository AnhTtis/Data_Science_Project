\section{Conclusions}\label{s:conclusion}
In this work, we aim to develop an optimal smoothing distribution for backdoor neutralization in deep learning-based traffic systems. To achieve this, we leverage a neural network to represent the value function (unnormalized density function) and propose a sampling strategy for generating desired noise from this function. We ensure that optimal noise is obtained by selecting the sample with the highest probability from the unnormalized density function. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by testing it on a traffic system simulated with a microscopic traffic simulator. Presented results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully neutralize backdoors in DRL models used in AVs without affecting the original performance of the controller.


%For our future work, we have two main directions. Firstly, we plan to investigate the use of multiple noise distributions for backdoor neutralization. This will allow us to determine which noise distribution is most effective in preventing backdoors in machine learning models. Secondly, we will focus on certifying the robustness of the optimal smoothing distribution in regression problems. This will enable us to better understand the reliability of the optimal smoothing distribution and provide greater confidence in the results obtained using this approach.

    "abstract": "The combination of microfluidic technology and optical fluids characterization techniques has been recently applied to produce lab-on-a-chip systems. In the present work, bringing together the imaging technique called photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and microfluidic technology were implemented to obtain micro-scale imaging. Laser-induced ultrasound signals were measured from microdroplets produced in a simple T-junction microfluidic system. Single pulse laser images were produced as a result of the combination of the aforementioned techniques, allowing to obtain of geometrical information of the microdroplets and its spatial position.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system describing the motion of a compressible, viscous and heat-conducting fluid on a domain perforated by tiny holes. First, we identify a class of dissipative solutions to the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation as a low Mach number limit of the primitive system. Secondly, by proving the weak-strong uniqueness principle, we obtain strong convergence to the target system on the lifespan of the strong solution.",

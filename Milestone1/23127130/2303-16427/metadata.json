    "abstract": "Autonomous excavation is a challenging task. The unknown contact dynamics between the excavator bucket and the terrain could easily result in large contact forces and jamming problems during excavation. Traditional model-based methods struggle to handle such problems due to complex dynamic modeling. In this paper, we formulate the excavation skills with three novel manipulation primitives. We propose to learn the manipulation primitives with offline reinforcement learning (RL) to avoid large amounts of online robot interactions. The proposed method can learn efficient penetration skills from sub-optimal demonstrations, which contain sub-trajectories that can be ``stitched\" together to formulate an optimal trajectory without causing jamming. We evaluate the proposed method with extensive experiments on excavating a variety of rigid objects and demonstrate that the learned policy outperforms the demonstrations. We also show that the learned policy can quickly adapt to unseen and challenging fragmented rocks with online fine-tuning.",

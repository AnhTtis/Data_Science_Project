    "abstract": "We consider the expansion of wave packets governed by the free Schrödinger equation. This seemingly simple task plays an important role in simulations of various quantum experiments and in particular in the field of matter-wave interferometry. The initial tight confinement results in a very fast expansion of the wave function at later times which significantly complicates an efficient and precise numerical evaluation. In many practical cases the expansion time is too short for the validity of the stationary phase approximation and too long for an efficient application of Fourier collocation-based methods. We develop an alternative method based on a discretization of the free-particle propagator. This simple approach yields highly accurate results which readily follows from the exceptionally fast convergence of the trapezoidal rule approximation of integrals involving smooth and rapidly decaying functions. We discuss and analyze our approach in detail and demonstrate how to estimate the numerical error in the one-dimensional setting. Furthermore, we show that by exploiting the separability of the Green's function, the numerical effort of the multi-dimensional approximation is considerably reduced. Our method is very fast, highly accurate, and easy to implement on modern hardware.",

abstract = {Abstract We introduce a numerical method for the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a smooth potential, based on its reformulation as a Volterra integral equation. We present versions of the method both for periodic boundary conditions, and for free space problems with compactly supported initial data and potential. A spatially uniform electric field may be included, making the solver applicable to simulations of light-matter interaction. The primary computational challenge in using the Volterra formulation is the application of a spacetime history dependent integral operator. This may be accomplished by projecting the solution onto a set of Fourier modes, and updating their coefficients from one time step to the next by a simple recurrence. In the periodic case, the modes are those of the usual Fourier series, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to alternate between physical and frequency domain grids. In the free space case, the oscillatory behavior of the spectral Green's function leads us to use a set of complex-frequency Fourier modes obtained by discretizing a contour deformation of the inverse Fourier transform, and we develop a corresponding fast transform based on the FFT. Our approach is related to pseudospectral methods, but applied to an integral rather than the usual differential formulation. This has several advantages: it avoids the need for artificial boundary conditions, admits simple, inexpensive, high-order implicit time marching schemes, and naturally includes time-dependent potentials. We present examples in one and two dimensions showing spectral accuracy in space and eighth-order accuracy in time for both periodic and free space problems. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

We find that the methods are mathematically and numerically distinct: ECS is complex stretching that rotates the operator's spectrum into the complex plane, 
whereas PML is a complex gauge transform which shifts the spectrum. Consequently, the schemes differ in their time-stability. Numerical examples are given.}

As one of those approaches for designing ABCs, perfectly matched layer (PML) has achieved great success for both linear and nonlinear wave equations. In this paper we apply PML to the nonlinear Schrödinger wave equations. The idea involved is stimulated by the good performance of PML for the linear Schrödinger equation with constant potentials, together with the time-transverse invariant property held by the nonlinear Schrödinger wave equations. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our PML approach for both nonlinear Schrödinger equations and some Schrödinger-coupled systems in each spatial dimension.}

Complex coordinate extension is based upon the relative sign between the surface-normal

This ensures selective damping of propagating and counter-propagating modes at the simulation boundaries. 
Moreover, the technical complexity of the PML method can be inferred

The PML transform is derived for selected Schrödinger-type (i.e. first-order-in-time)

Spectral analysis demonstrates proper damping behaviour of out-propagating modes. 
Results are presented for the Schrödinger equation for particles and holes,

The electron flow through quantum waveguides is modeled by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with absorbing boundary conditions, which are realized by a negative imaginary potential. 
The Schrödinger equation is discretized by a time-splitting spectral method, 
and the quantum waveguides are fed by a mono-energetic incoming plane wave pulse. 
The resulting algorithm is extremely efficient due to the Fast Fourier Transform 
implementation of the spectral scheme. 
Numerical convergence rates for a one-dimensional scattering problem are calculated. 
The transmission rates of a two-dimensional T-stub quantum waveguide and a single-branch coupler are numerically computed. 
Moreover, the transient behavior of a three-dimensional T-stub waveguide is simulated.}

The comparison includes scattering state, wave packet, and transient scattering state simulations in one and two space dimensions. The Schrödinger equation is discretized by a second-order Crank–Nicolson method in case of DTBC. For the discretization with PML, symmetric second-, fourth-, and sixth-order spatial approximations as well as Crank–Nicolson and classical Runge–Kutta time-integration methods are employed. In two space dimensions, a ring-shaped quantum waveguide device is simulated in the stationary and transient regime. As an application, a simulation of the Aharonov–Bohm effect in this device is performed, showing the excitation of bound states localized in the ring region. The numerical experiments show that the results obtained from PML are comparable to those obtained using DTBC, while keeping the high numerical efficiency and flexibility as well as the ease of implementation of the former method.}

  Abstract                 = {A spectral multidomain penalty method model has been developed for the simulation of high Reynolds number localized stratified turbulence. This is the first time that a penalty method, with a particular focus on subdomain interface treatment, has been used with a multidomain scheme to simulate incompressible flows. The temporal discretization ensures maximum temporal accuracy by combining third order stiffly stable and backward differentiation schemes with a high-order boundary condition for the pressure. In the non-periodic vertical direction, a spectral multidomain discretization is used and its stability for under-resolved simulations at high Reynolds numbers is ensured through use of penalty techniques, spectral filtering and strong adaptive interfacial averaging. The penalty method is implemented in different formulations for both the explicit non-linear term advancement and the implicit treatment of the viscous terms. The multidomain model is validated by comparing results of simulations of the mid-to-late time stratified turbulent wake with non-zero net momentum to the corresponding laboratory data for a towed sphere. The model replicates correctly the characteristic vorticity and internal wave structure of the stratified wake and exhibits robust agreement with experiments in terms of the temporal power laws in the evolution of mean profile characteristic velocity and lengthscales. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operato derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (seperated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work.}

Tailored mathematical models are important for the transient and the stationary analysis of such plants. A comprehensive mathematical model of a variable speed operated pumped storage power plant, which incorporates reversible pump turbines in combination with doubly fed induction machines, is developed in this paper. Special emphasis is laid on an accurate description of important dynamic effects (e.g., water hammer) and of the energy losses of the system. Based on this model, optimal stationary operating points are determined, which minimize the overall system losses and systematically take into account the operating constraints.},

In turn, this causes large pressure and subpressure oscillations in turbine hydraulic system and it must be evaluated to avoid mechanical failures. In this context, this work analyses the discrete hydraulic systems with emphasis on hydraulic parameter analysis. The simulation used was developed based on analog mathematical models of transient phenomenon equations and on a hydro turbine model. The results were obtained by using a nonlinear analog-digital simulation method. Comparisons between results of a theoretical simulation of a literature example using the characteristics method and the results obtained with the present method are presented. Theoretical simulation results obtained from a 360 MW turbine and experimental results are also confronted.},

  Abstract                 = {A framework for studying the amplitude and phase errors for discontinuous spectral element methods applied to wave propagation problems is presented. In this framework, boundary conditions can be accounted for and the spatial distribution of the errors within individual elements can be obtained. This is of importance for spectral element discretizations, for which it might be convenient to have the element size larger than the wavelength. When applied to multiple element discretizations, this allows identification of criteria for reducing the errors. While these criteria depend in general on the particular application and the discretization itself, an attempt is made to obtain optimal methods for the case when the wave propagation takes place over a large number of elements. Unfortunately, such optimization leads in the most general case to full mass matrices, and hence is useful mainly for linear problems.},

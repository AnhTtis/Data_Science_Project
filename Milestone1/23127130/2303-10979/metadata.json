    "abstract": "The ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6 attracts attention because of a recently discovered colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) with unique magnetic field properties. An improved magnetic structure for the material has emerged from a neutron diffraction study linked to understanding the CMR. A deeper theoretical investigation of the magnetic structure has now revealed anapole, chiral and orbital states of manganese ions not previously mentioned. Moreover, it is shown that existence of these states in the low temperature form of Mn3Si2Te6, with a magnetic field applied, can be tested by neutron and resonant x-ray diffraction.",

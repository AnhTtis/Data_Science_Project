    "abstract": "The energy-water demands of metropolitan regions and agricultural ecosystems are ever-increasing. To tackle this challenge efficiently and sustainably, the interdependence of these interconnected resources has to be considered. In this work, we present a holistic decision-making framework which takes into account simultaneously a water and energy supply system with the capability of satisfying metropolitan and agricultural resource demands. The framework features: (i) a generic large-scale planning and scheduling optimization model to minimize the annualized cost of the design and operation of the energy-water supply system, (ii) a mixed-integer linear optimization formulation, which relies on the development of surrogate models based on feedforward artificial neural networks and first-order Taylor expansions, and (iii) constraints for land and water utilization enabling multi-objective optimization. The framework provides the operational profiles of all energy-water system elements over a given time horizon, which uncover potential synergies between the essential food, energy, and water resource supply systems.",

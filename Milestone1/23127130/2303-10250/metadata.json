    "abstract": "We propose a new discrete-time online parameter estimation algorithm that combines two different aspects, one that adds momentum, and another that includes a time-varying learning rate. It is well known that recursive least squares based approaches that include a time-varying gain can lead to exponential convergence of parameter errors under persistent excitation, while momentum-based approaches have demonstrated a fast convergence of tracking error towards zero with constant regressors. The question is when combined, will the filter from the momentum method come in the way of exponential convergence. This paper proves that exponential convergence of parameter is still possible with persistent excitation. Simulation results demonstrated competitive properties of the proposed algorithm compared to the recursive least squares algorithm with forgetting.",

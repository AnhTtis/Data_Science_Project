    "abstract": "We consider the implementation of the transduction of automatic sequences, and their generalizations, in the Walnut software for solving decision problems in combinatorics on words. We provide a number of applications, including (a) representations of n! as a sum of three squares (b) overlap-free Dyck words and (c) sums of Fibonacci representations. We also prove results about iterated running sums of the Thue-Morse sequence.",

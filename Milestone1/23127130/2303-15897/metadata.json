    "abstract": "We classify the pairs of group morphisms $Γ\\rightarrow {\\rm Spin}(7)$ which are element conjugate but not globally conjugate. As an application, we study the case where $Γ$ is the Weil group of a $p$-adic local field, which is relevant to the recent approach to the local Langlands correspondence for ${\\rm G}_2$ and ${\\rm PGSp}_6$ by Gan and Savin. As a second application, we improve some result of Kret and Shin about ${\\rm GSpin}_7$-valued Galois representations.",

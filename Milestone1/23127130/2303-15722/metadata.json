    "abstract": "Two-dimensional magnets could potentially revolutionize information technology, but their potential application to cooling technology and magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in a material down to the monolayer limit remain unexplored. Herein, we reveal through multiscale calculations the existence of giant MCE and its strain tunability in monolayer magnets such as CrX$_3$ (X=F, Cl, Br, I), CrAX (A=O, S, Se; X=F, Cl, Br, I), and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The maximum adiabatic temperature change ($ΔT_\\text{ad}^\\text{max}$), maximum isothermal magnetic entropy change, and specific cooling power in monolayer CrF$_3$ are found as high as 11 K, 35 $μ$Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, and 3.5 nWcm$^{-2}$ under a magnetic field of 5 T, respectively. A 2% biaxial and 5% $a$-axis uniaxial compressive strain can remarkably increase $ΔT_\\text{ad}^\\text{max}$ of CrCl$_3$ and CrOF by 230% and 37% (up to 15.3 and 6.0 K), respectively. It is found that large net magnetic moment per unit area favors improved MCE. These findings advocate the giant-MCE monolayer magnets, opening new opportunities for magnetic cooling at nanoscale.",

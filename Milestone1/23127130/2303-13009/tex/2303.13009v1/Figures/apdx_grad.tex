    \caption{\textbf{Gradient by embedding type.} The gradient of MELTR output with respect to each task loss is plotted for different input embedding types. 
    (a) Gradient values are generally similar across tasks, and only those with distinct loss scales are distinguished. 
    (b) Gradients are different across tasks, but stay constant along loss scale, as loss scale information is not provided. 
    (c) MELTR learned to effectively consider both loss scale and task information.

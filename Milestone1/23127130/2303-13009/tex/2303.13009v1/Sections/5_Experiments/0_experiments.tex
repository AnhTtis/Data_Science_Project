\section{Experiments}
To verify the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to multiple video foundation models (UniVL~\cite{luo2020univl}, Violet~\cite{fu2021violet}, All-in-one~\cite{wang2022all}), and evaluate them on four downstream tasks: text-to-video retrieval, video question answering, video captioning, and multimodal sentiment analysis. 
For the tasks, we use five benchmark datasets: YouCook2~\cite{zhou2018towards}, MSRVTT~\cite{xu2016msr}, TGIF-QA~\cite{jang2017tgif}, MSVD-QA~\cite{xu2017video}, CMU-MOSI~\cite{zadeh2016mosi}.
We conduct experiments and analyze the results to answer the following research questions:\\
\textbf{Q1.} Does the learned combination of auxiliary losses benefit the primary task?\\
\textbf{Q2.} What does MELTR learn from auxiliary learning?\\
\textbf{Q3.} Is the proposed optimization method efficient for MELTR?

\noindent \textbf{Datasets.} 
For video retrieval, we use YouCook2 and MSRVTT.
For video question answering, TGIF-QA and MSVD-QA datasets are used, and YouCook2 and MSRVTT are used for video captioning.
Finally, we use CMU-MOSI for multi-modal sentiment analysis.
Further dataset details are provided in the supplement.

\noindent \textbf{Implementation details.}
MELTR is adapted to UniVL~\cite{luo2020univl}, Violet~\cite{fu2021violet}, and All-in-one~\cite{wang2022all} for main experiments and we conduct ablation studies and qualitative analyses on UniVL.
As for UniVL, we use five auxiliary loss functions ($\Ljoint$, $\Lalign$, $\Lcmlm$, $\Lcmfm$, and $\Ldecoder$), which were introduced in Section~\ref{subsec:univl}.
We additionally adopt three advanced auxiliary loss functions, $\Lmjoint$, $\Lmalign$, and $\Lmdecoder$, which leverage masked language and masked visual features obtained by converting some of the language or visual tokens into [MASK] or random tokens, along with the five objectives described above.
For text-to-video retrieval and video captioning, $\Lalign$ and $\Ldecoder$ are used as the primary loss functions, respectively.
Further implementation details including Violet and All-in-one are in the supplement.

\section{Effectiveness of advanced loss of UniVL}

For video captioning on YouCook2, in order of importance, the losses can be sorted as $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Decoder}$, $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Joint}$, and $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Align}$. 
Table~\ref{tab:univl_advanced} shows the additional ablation study on newly added losses.
First, using all three newly added losses improves the performance with both MTL (+0.91) and MELTR (+0.74) on average.
As for the individual loss, by adding $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Decoder}$, the average performance gain of MELTR is 0.47.
On the other hand, with $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Joint}$ or $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Align}$, the performance gap is decreased to 0.37 and 0.26 respectively, implying that they are relatively less effective for video captioning than $\mathcal{L}_\text{M-Decoder}$ as observed in Sec. 5.2 of the main paper.

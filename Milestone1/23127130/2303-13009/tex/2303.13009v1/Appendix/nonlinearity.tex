\section{Non-linearity of MELTR}

MELTR provides more flexible and effective transformations beyond a simple linear combination of losses through transformer architecture.
Table 8 of the main paper evidences that MELTR outperforms two linear combinations, the sum of losses (multi-task learning, MTL) and an adaptive and learned linear combination (Meta-Weight Net), by 2.4 and 1.3 R@1 in MSRVTT for text-to-video retrieval.
Qualitatively, Figure~\ref{fig:nonlinearity} shows the non-linearity of MELTR in contrast to the multi-task learning (MTL) by visualizing their outputs given two input losses: $\Ldecoder$ and $\Lcmfm$.

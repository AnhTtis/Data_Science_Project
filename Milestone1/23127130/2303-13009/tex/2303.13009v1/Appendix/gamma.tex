\section{Effectiveness of the Regularization Term}

We proposed the regularization term $\Lreg$ in Section 4.1 of the main paper.
Eq. (6) of the main paper encourages the learned loss $\text{MELTR}(\Ell;\phi)$ to stay within a reasonable range to avoid meta-overfitting.
Table~\ref{tab:apdx_gamma} shows the ablation study for $\Lreg$ by adjusting the regularization strength $\gamma$ on the text-to-video retrieval of MSRVTT-7k.
Without the regularization term, \textit{i.e.}, $\gamma = 0$, it shows the performance of 27.6\% on R@1 metric.
The performance improves at $\gamma = 1$ or $\gamma = 10$ by a margin of 1\% than without $\Lreg$.

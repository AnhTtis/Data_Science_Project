    "abstract": "Projection-based model order reduction of dynamical systems usually introduces an error between the high-fidelity model and its counterpart of lower dimension. This unknown error can be bounded by residual-based methods, which are typically known to be highly pessimistic in the sense of largely overestimating the true error. This work applies two improved error bounding techniques, namely (a) a hierarchical error bound and (b) an error bound based on an auxiliary linear problem, to the case of port-Hamiltonian systems. The approaches rely on a second approximation of (a) the dynamical system and (b) the error system. In this paper, these methods are for the first time adapted to port-Hamiltonian systems by exploiting their structure. The mathematical relationship between the two methods is discussed both, theoretically and numerically. The effectiveness of the described methods is demonstrated using a challenging three-dimensional port-Hamiltonian model of a classical guitar with fluid-structure interaction.",

    "abstract": "In the last years, optical readout of Micromegas gaseous detectors has been achieved by implementing a Micromegas detector on a glass anode coupled to a CMOS camera. Effective X-ray radiography was demonstrated using integrated imaging approach. High granularity values have been reached for low-energy X-rays from radioactive sources and X-ray generators.\n  Detector characterization with X-ray radiography has led to two applications: neutron imaging for non-destructive examination of highly gamma-ray emitting objects and beta imaging for the single cell activity tagging in the field of oncology drug studies.\n  First measurements investigating the achievable spatial resolution of the glass Micromegas detector at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility with a high-intensity and flat irradiation field will be shown in this article.",

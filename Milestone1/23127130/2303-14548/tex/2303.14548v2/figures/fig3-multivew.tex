    \caption{\textbf{Multi-view consistency enforced at training time.} According to multi-view geometry, the observations of the same box in different views should only differ by the relative transformation. Therefore, when a 3D query point is paired with multiple query views (3 in this illustration) to construct queries, the predictions in each respective view are \textit{combined} to match and regress the ground truth counterparts \textit{jointly}.

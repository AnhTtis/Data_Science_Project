    \caption{\textbf{Effectiveness of the view equivariant regularization.} Simply adding more queries and duplicating box targets without introducing view equivariance only helps model optimization at an early stage and does not help the final detection performance as shown by the \textcolor{orange}{orange curves} compared to the \textcolor{blue}{blue curves}. VEDet is able to leverage richer geometric signals brought by the view equivariance objective with the help of view-conditioned queries, which leads to a performance boost shown by \textcolor{violet}{purple curves}.

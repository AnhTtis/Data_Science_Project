\mypar{Camera parameter robustness.} \Acronym leverage implicit geometric encodings to learn 3D geometry in a data-driven way, therefore the robustness of \Acronym against camera parameters is critical and worth investigating in future works.
\mypar{Depth information.} This work mainly leverages geometric signals generated from the ground truth 3D bounding boxes and generic pose information of both cameras and object queries, while some concurrent works \cite{li2022bevdepth, huang2022bevdet4d} explicitly use depth to guide the 3D feature construction and hence the interaction between the heads and features. Incorporating depth information into the framework, such as enhancing the geometric positional encodings or guiding spatial attention, will be explored for future works.
\mypar{Temporal modeling.} The current VEDet follows existing works to simply concatenate features from multi-sweeps along the token dimension. While this is effective, the concatenation has two main issues: it throws away the temporal ordering, and has difficulty in modeling long sequences due to memory and computation constraints. Investigation on a better temporal modeling such as recurrent processing will be valuable for future works.

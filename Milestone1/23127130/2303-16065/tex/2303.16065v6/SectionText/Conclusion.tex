\section*{Conclusion}

Widely used algorithms (e.g. Naismith's rule) for estimating walking/hiking speed are simple to understand, very easy to calculate but are based on limited observations. Here we curated a dataset of almost 88,000 km of walking and hiking data. We found that the existing algorithms perform quite well against the dataset but they tend to overestimate ascent time, underestimate descent time and most ignore terrain obstruction and hill slope both of which we found to be significant factors. We used the data to derive a new model that takes into account these variables. We demonstrated that the model provides more accurate walking speeds than the existing methods in all scenarios, and particularly in off-road regions. By providing improved walking speed predictions in these off-road regions, we have enabled more accurate calculations of the fastest route to or from any given location, which could save minutes in an emergency situation where every second is important.

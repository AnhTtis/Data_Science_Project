    "abstract": "Recent advances in laser technology have enabled tremendous progress in photochemistry, at the heart of which is the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. Such progress has been greatly facilitated by the development of accurate quantum-mechanical simulation method, which, however, does not necessarily accompany clear dynamical scenarios and is rather often a black box, other than being computationally heavy. Here, we develop a wave-packet surface propagation (WASP) approach to describe the molecular bond-breaking dynamics from a hybrid quantum-classical perspective. Via the introduction of quantum elements including state transitions and phase accumulations to the Newtonian propagation of the nuclear wave-packet, the WASP approach naturally comes with intuitive physical scenarios and accuracies. It is carefully benchmarked with the H2+ molecule and is shown to be capable of precisely reproducing experimental observations. The WASP method is promising for the intuitive visualization of strong-field molecular dynamics and is straightforwardly extensible toward complex molecules.",

It is an effective way to extract the detail information of the visible image and target regions of the infrared image in the final fused result. In this paper, a detail preserved fusion algorithm of visible and infrared images is proposed based on the regional saliency extraction technique and multi scale image decomposition. The multi-scale image decomposition is firstly applied to the infrared and visible images under the image smoothing framework using L1 fidelity with L0 gradient. Then for each decomposition layer the saliency map is extracted by the frequency-tuned saliency map extraction algorithm. The final fused result is reconstructed by synthesizing different levels with proper weight values. Experiments are implemented to test the performance of the proposed fusion approach compared with other excellent fusion methods. Both the subjective perception and quantitative index results demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains better performance in preserving the edge detail information as well as enhancing the infrared targert signals."

In this paper, a multi-resolution image fusion metric using visual information fidelity (VIF) is presented to assess fusion performance objectively. This method has four stages: (1) Source and fused images are filtered and divided into blocks. (2) Visual information is evaluated with and without distortion information in each block. (3) The visual information fidelity for fusion (VIFF) of each sub-band is calculated. (4) The overall quality measure is determined by weighting the VIFF of each sub-band. In our experiment, the proposed fusion assessment method is compared with several existing fusion metrics using the subjective test dataset provided by Petrovic. We found that VIFF performs better in terms of both human perception matching and computational complexity."

    abstract = "Infrared and visible image fusion has been a hot issue in image fusion. In this task, a fused image containing both the gradient and detailed texture information of visible images as well as the thermal radiation and highlighting targets of infrared images is expected to be obtained. In this paper, a novel Bayesian fusion model is established for infrared and visible images. In our model, the image fusion task is cast into a regression problem. To measure the uncertainty in a better manner, we formulate the model in a hierarchical Bayesian manner. Aiming at making the fused image satisfy the human visual system, the model incorporates the total-variation (TV) penalty. Subsequently, the model is efficiently inferred by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, where the fusion weight can be automatically inferred and adaptive to the source images. The performance of our algorithm is investigated and compared with several state-of-the-art approaches on TNO and NIR image fusion datasets. In comparison with other methods, the novel model can generate better fused images with highlighting targets and rich texture details, which may potentially improve the reliability of the target automatic detection and recognition system."

	abstract = {Traditionally, runaway stars are O- and B-type stars with large peculiar velocities. We would like to extend this definition to young stars (up to ≈50 Myr) of any spectral type and to identify those present in the Hipparcos catalogue by applying different selection criteria, such as peculiar space velocities or peculiar one-dimensional velocities. Runaway stars are important for studying the evolution of multiple star systems or star clusters, as well as for identifying the origins of neutron stars. We compile the distances, proper motions, spectral types, luminosity classes, V magnitudes and B-V colours, and we utilize evolutionary models from different authors to obtain star ages. We study a sample of 7663 young Hipparcos stars within 3 kpc from the Sun. The radial velocities are obtained from the literature. We investigate the distributions of the peculiar spatial velocity and the peculiar radial velocity as well as the peculiar tangential velocity and its
one-dimensional components and we obtain runaway star probabilities for each star in the sample. In addition, we look for stars that are situated outside any OB association or OB cluster and the Galactic plane as well as stars for which the velocity vector points away from the median velocity vector of neighbouring stars or the surrounding local OB association/cluster (although the absolute velocity might be small). We find a total of 2547 runaway star candidates (with a contamination of normal Population I stars of 20 per cent at most). Thus, after
subtracting these 20 per cent, the runaway frequency among young stars is about 27 per cent. We compile a catalogue of runaway stars, which is available via VizieR.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical analysis of the first 300 stars observed by the 
Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey. This subsample includes six
detected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these detections and our
contrast curves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar
companions with respect to their mass, semimajor axis, and host stellar
mass. We uncover a strong correlation between planet occurrence rate and
host star mass, with stars M * {\textgreater} 1.5 M ⊙
more likely to host planets with masses between 2 and 13M Jup
and semimajor axes of 3-100 au at 99.92\% confidence. We fit a double
power-law model in planet mass (m) and semimajor axis (a) for planet
populations around high-mass stars (M * {\textgreater} 1.5 M
⊙) of the form \{d\}2N/(\{dm\} \{da\}){\textbackslash}propto
\{m\}α \{a\}β , finding α = -2.4
± 0.8 and β = -2.0 ± 0.5, and an integrated
occurrence rate of \{9\}-4+5\% between 5-13M
Jup and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate is
obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with
\{0.8\}-0.5+0.8\% of stars hosting a brown dwarf
companion between 13-80M Jup and 10-100 au. Brown dwarfs also
appear to be distributed differently in mass and semimajor axis compared
to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a bottom-heavy mass
distribution and favor smaller semimajor axes, brown dwarfs exhibit just
the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant
planets from the radial velocity method, our results are consistent with
a peak in occurrence of giant planets between ∼1 and 10 au. We
discuss how these trends, including the preference of giant planets for
high-mass host stars, point to formation of giant planets by core/pebble
accretion, and formation of brown dwarfs by gravitational instability.},

This has been interpreted as the first detection of an eclipsing ring system circling a substellar object (dubbed J1407b). We report on a search for this companion with Sparse Aperture Mask imaging and direct imaging with both the UT4 VLT and Keck telescopes. Radial velocity measurements of J1407 provide additional constraints on J1407b and on short period companions to the central star. Follow-up
photometric monitoring using the Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes (PROMPT)-4 and ROAD observatories during 2012-2014 has not yielded any additional eclipses. Large regions of mass-period space are ruled out for the companion. For circular orbits the companion period is constrained to the range 3.5-13.8 yr (a ≃ 2.2-5.6 au), and stellar masses ({\textgreater}80MJup) are ruled out at 3σ significance over these periods. The complex ring system
appears to occupy more than 0.15 of its Hill radius, much larger than its Roche radius and suggesting a ring structure in transition. Further, we demonstrate that the radial velocity of J1407 is consistent with membership in the Upper Cen-Lup subgroup of the Sco-Cen association, and constraints on the rotation period and projected rotational velocity of J1407 are consistent with a stellar inclination of i⋆ ≃ 68° ± 10°.},

	abstract = {Context. The 16 Myr old star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) 
underwent a series of complex eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the
transit of a giant Hill sphere filling debris ring system around a
secondary companion, J1407b. No other eclipses have since been detected,
although other measurements have constrained but not uniquely determined
the orbital period of J1407b. Finding another eclipse towards J1407 will
help determine the orbital period of the system, the geometry of the
proposed ring system and enable planning of further observations to
characterize the material within these putative rings. Aims: We
carry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of J1407 with
the aim of constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods: We
present photometry from archival photographic plates from the Harvard
DASCH survey, and Bamberg and Sonneberg Observatories, in order to place
additional constraints on the orbital period of J1407b by searching for
other dimming and eclipse events. Using a visual inspection of all 387
plates and a period-folding algorithm we performed a search for other
eclipses in these data sets. Results: We find no other deep
eclipses in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent
time-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions: We rule out a
large fraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 yr.
These limits are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere
filling ring system surrounding a brown dwarf companion in a bound
elliptical orbit about J1407. Issues with the stability of any rings
combined with the lack of detection of another eclipse, suggests that
J1407b may not be bound to J1407.},

putative exoring system responsible for the complex deep transits
observed in the light curve for the young Sco-Cen star 1SWASP
J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen, hereafter J1407), confirming it as the
occulter seen in May 2007, and to determine its orbital parameters with
respect to the star. Methods: We used the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the field centred on
J1407 in the 340 GHz (Band 7) continuum in order to determine the flux
and astrometric location of the ring system relative to the star. We
used the VLT/NACO camera to observe the J1407 system in March 2019 and
to search for the central planetary mass object at thermal infrared
wavelengths. Results: We detect no point source at the expected
location of J1407, and derive an upper limit 3σ level of 57.6
μJy. There is a point source detected at an angular separation
consistent with the expected location for a free-floating ring system
that occulted J1407 in May 2007, with a flux of 89 μJy consistent
with optically thin dust surrounding a massive substellar companion. At
3.8 μm with the NACO camera, we detect the star J1407 but no other
additional point sources within 1.3 arcsec of the star, with a lower
bound on the sensitivity of 6 MJup at the location of the
ALMA source, and down to 4 MJup in the sky background limit.
 Conclusions: The ALMA upper limit at the location of J1407
implies that a hypothesised bound ring system is composed of dust
smaller than 1 mm in size, implying a young ring structure. The detected
ALMA source has multiple interpretations, including: (i) it is an
unbound substellar object surrounded by warm dust in Sco-Cen with an
upper mass limit of 6 MJup, or (ii) it is a background
galaxy.

of detected sources, the method enables forward modeling of
astrophysical sources. This alleviates the biases in the astrometry and
photometry of discovered faint sources, which are usually associated
with LOCI-based PSF subtractions schemes. We illustrate the algorithm
performance using archival Hubble Space Telescope images, but the

system (MagAO) to obtain very high spatial resolution observations in
"visible light" with MagAO's VisAO CCD camera. In the good-median seeing
conditions of Magellan (0.''5-0.''7), we find MagAO delivers individual
short exposure images as good as 19 mas optical resolution. Due to
telescope vibrations, long exposure (60 s) r' (0.63 μm) images are
slightly coarser at FWHM = 23-29 mas (Strehl {\textasciitilde}28\%) with bright (R {\textless} 9
mag) guide stars. These are the highest resolution filled-aperture
images published to date. Images of the young ({\textasciitilde}1 Myr) Orion Trapezium
θ1 Ori A, B, and C cluster members were obtained with
VisAO. In particular, the 32 mas binary θ1 Ori C
1 C 2 was easily resolved in non-interferometric
images for the first time. The relative positions of the bright
trapezium binary stars were measured with {\textasciitilde}0.6-5 mas accuracy. We are
now sensitive to relative proper motions of just {\textasciitilde}0.2 mas
yr-1 ({\textasciitilde}0.4 km s-1 at 414
pc)—this is a {\textasciitilde}2-10 × improvement in orbital velocity
accuracy compared to previous efforts. For the first time, we see clear
motion of the barycenter of θ1 Ori B 2 B
3 about θ1 Ori B 1. All five
members of the θ1 Ori B system appear likely to be a
gravitationally bound "mini cluster," but we find that not all the
orbits can be both circular and co-planar. The lowest mass member of the
θ1 Ori B system (B 4; mass {\textasciitilde}0.2 M
⊙) has a very clearly detected motion (at 4.1 ±
1.3 km s-1 correlation = 99.9\%) w.r.t. B 1.
Previous work has suggested that B 4 and B 3 are
on long-term unstable orbits and will be ejected from this "mini
cluster." However, our new "baseline" model of the θ1
Ori B system suggests a more hierarchical system than previously
thought, and so the ejection of B 4 may not occur for many
orbits, and B 3 may be stable against ejection in the
long-term. This "ejection" process of the lowest mass member of a "mini
cluster" could play a major role in the formation of low-mass stars and
brown dwarfs.

	abstract = {Binaries are typically excluded from direct imaging exoplanet surveys. However, the recent findings of Kepler and radial velocity programs show that planets can and do form in binary systems. Here, we suggest that visual binaries offer unique advantages for direct imaging. We show that Binary Differential Imaging (BDI), whereby two stars are imaged
simultaneously at the same wavelength within the isoplanatic patch at a high Strehl ratio, offers improved point spread function (PSF)
subtraction that can result in increased sensitivity to planets close to each star. We demonstrate this by observing a young visual binary separated by 4″ with MagAO/Clio-2 at 3.9 μm, where the Strehl
ratio is high, the isoplanatic patch is large, and giant planets are bright. Comparing BDI to angular differential imaging (ADI), we find that BDI’s 5σ contrast is ∼0.5 mag better than
ADI’s within ∼1″ for the particular binary we observed.
Because planets typically reside close to their host stars, BDI is a promising technique for discovering exoplanets in stellar systems that are often ignored. BDI is also 2-4× more efficient than ADI and
classical reference PSF subtraction, since planets can be detected around both the target and PSF reference simultaneously. We are
currently exploiting this technique in a new MagAO survey for giant planets in 140 young nearby visual binaries. BDI on a space-based telescope would not be limited by isoplanatism effects and would therefore be an even more powerful tool for imaging and discovering planets.

extrasolar planet β Pic b, which is 9 AU from and embedded in the
debris disk of the young nearby A6V star β Pictoris. We observed
the system with first light of the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO)

the first observation in the fundamental CH4 band. To remove
systematic errors from the spectral energy distribution (SED), we
re-calibrate the literature photometry and combine it with our own data,
for a total of 22 independent measurements at 16 passbands from 0.99 to
4.8 μm. Atmosphere models demonstrate the planet is cloudy but are
degenerate in effective temperature and radius. The measured SED now
covers {\textgreater}80\% of the planet’s energy, so we approach the
bolometric luminosity empirically. We calculate the luminosity by
extending the measured SED with a blackbody and integrating to find
log(\{\{L\}\}\{bol\}/\{\{L\}\}⊙ ) {\textbackslash}={\textbackslash}-3.78+/- 0.03.
From our bolometric luminosity and an age of 23 ± 3 Myr,

	abstract = {The heart of the 6.5 Magellan AO system (MagAO) is a 585 actuator 
adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) with {\textless}1 msec response times (0.7 ms
typically). This adaptive secondary will allow low emissivity and
high-contrast AO science. We fabricated a high order (561 mode) pyramid
wavefront sensor (similar to that now successfully used at the Large
Binocular Telescope). The relatively high actuator count (and small
projected {\textasciitilde}23 cm pitch) allows moderate Strehls to be obtained by MagAO
in the “visible” (0.63-1.05 μm). To take advantage of
this we have fabricated an AO CCD science camera called "VisAO".
Complete “end-to-end” closed-loop lab tests of MagAO achieve
a solid, broad-band, 37\% Strehl (122 nm rms) at 0.76 μm (i’)
with the VisAO camera in 0.8” simulated seeing (13 cm ro at V)
with fast 33 mph winds and a 40 m Lo locked on R=8 mag artificial star.
These relatively high visible wavelength Strehls are enabled by our
powerful combination of a next generation ASM and a Pyramid WFS with 400
controlled modes and 1000 Hz sample speeds (similar to that used
successfully on-sky at the LBT). Currently only the VisAO science camera
is used for lab testing of MagAO, but this high level of measured
performance (122 nm rms) promises even higher Strehls with our IR
science cameras. On bright (R=8 mag) stars we should achieve very high
Strehls ({\textgreater}70\% at H) in the IR with the existing MagAO Clio2
(λ=1-5.3 μm) science camera/coronagraph or even higher ({\textasciitilde}98\%
Strehl) the Mid-IR (8-26 microns) with the existing BLINC/MIRAC4 science
camera in the future. To eliminate non-common path vibrations,
dispersions, and optical errors the VisAO science camera is fed by a
common path advanced triplet ADC and is piggy-backed on the Pyramid WFS
optical board itself. Also a high-speed shutter can be used to block
periods of poor correction. The entire system passed CDR in June 2009,
and we finished the closed-loop system level testing phase in December
2011. Final system acceptance (“pre-ship” review) was passed
in February 2012. In May 2012 the entire AO system is was successfully
shipped to Chile and fully tested/aligned. It is now in storage in the
Magellan telescope clean room in anticipation of “First
Light” scheduled for December 2012. An overview of the design,
attributes, performance, and schedule for the Magellan AO system and its
two science cameras are briefly presented here.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding confidence levels (CLs) in high-contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly toward small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically affects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal
hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at fixed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases toward very small inner working angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm
probabilities can be significantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis that ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical effect has a significant impact on current coronagraphic and future high-contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},

Detecting and characterizing substellar companions for which the luminosity, mass, and age can be determined independently is of utter importance to test and calibrate the evolutionary models due to uncertainties in their formation mechanisms. HD 19467 is a bright and nearby star hosting a cool brown dwarf companion detected with RV and imaging, making it a valuable object for such studies. Aims. We aim to further characterize the orbital, spectral, and physical properties of the HD 19467 system. Methods. We present new high-contrast imaging data with the SPHERE and NaCo instruments. We also analyze archival data from HARPS, NaCo, HIRES, UVES, and ASAS. We also use proper motion data of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia. Results. We refine the properties of the host star and derive an age of 8.0\${\textasciicircum}\{+2.0\}\_\{-1.0\}\$ Gyr based on isochrones, gyrochronology, and chemical and kinematic arguments. This estimate is slightly younger than previous estimates of {\textasciitilde}9-11 Gyr. No orbital curvature is seen in the current imaging, RV, and astrometric data. From a joint fit of the data, we refine the orbital parameters for HD 19467B: period 398\${\textasciicircum}\{+95\}\_\{-93\}\$ yr, inclination 129.8\${\textasciicircum}\{+8.1\}\_\{-5.1\}\$ deg, eccentricity 0.56\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.09, longitude of the ascending node 134.8\${\textbackslash}pm\$4.5 deg, and argument of the periastron 64.2\${\textasciicircum}\{+5.5\}\_\{-6.3\}\$ deg. We assess a dynamical mass of 74\${\textasciicircum}\{+12\}\_\{-9\}\$ MJ. The fit with atmospheric models of the spectrophotometric data of HD 19467B indicates an atmosphere without clouds or with very thin clouds, an effective temperature of 1042\${\textasciicircum}\{+77\}\_\{-71\}\$ K, and a large surface gravity of 5.34\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.09\}\$ dex.

We predict that the stellar companion is located roughly 0.18 arcsec from the central star towards the east-southeast, above the plane of the disc. Should this companion be detected in the near future, our model indicates that it should be moving away from the primary star at a rate of 6 mas/yr on the plane of the sky. Since our companion is inclined, we also predict that the spiral structure will appear to change with time, and not simply co-rotate with the companion.},

The ubiquity of planets found around single stars raises the question if and how planets in binary systems may form. Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and their characterization is crucial in order to understand the planet formation process. Our aim is to characterize the morphology of the GG Tau A disk, one of the largest and most massive circumbinary disks, and trace evidence for binary-disk interactions. We obtained observations in polarized scattered light of GG Tau A using the SPHERE/IRDIS instrument in the H-band filter. We analyze the observed disk morphology and substructures. We run 2D hydrodynamical models simulating the evolution of the circumbinary ring over the lifetime of the disk. The disk, as well as the cavity and the inner region are highly structured with several shadowed regions, spiral structures, and streamer-like filaments, some of them detected for the first time. The streamer-like filaments appear to connect the outer ring with the northern arc. Their azimuthal spacing suggests that they may be generated by periodic perturbations by the binary, tearing off material from the inner edge of the outer disk once during each orbit. By comparing observations to hydrodynamical simulations we find that the main features, in particular the gap size, as well as the spiral and streamer filaments, can be qualitatively explained by the gravitational interactions of a binary with semi-major axis of \${\textbackslash}sim\$35 au on an orbit coplanar with the circumbinary ring.},

	abstract = {Context. Planet formation is expected to take place in the first million years of a planetary system through various processes, which remain to be tested through observations. Aims. With the recent discovery, using ALMA, of two gaseous spiral arms inside the 120 au cavity and connected to dusty spirals, the famous protoplanetary disk around AB Aurigae presents a strong incentive for investigating the mechanisms that lead to giant planet formation. A candidate protoplanet located inside a spiral arm has already been claimed in an earlier study based on the same ALMA data. Methods. We used SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to perform near-infrared (IR) high-contrast imaging of AB Aur in polarized and unpolarized light in order to study the morphology of the disk and search for signs of planet formation. Results. SPHERE has delivered the deepest images ever obtained for AB Aur in scattered light. Among the many structures that are yet to be understood, we identified not only the inner spiral arms, but we also resolved a feature in the form of a twist in the eastern spiral at a separation of about 30 au. The twist of the spiral is perfectly reproduced with a planet-driven density wave model when projection effects are accounted for. We measured an azimuthal displacement with respect to the counterpart of this feature in the ALMA data, which is consistent with Keplerian motion on a 4-yr baseline. Another point sxce is detected near the edge of the inner ring, which is likely the result of scattering as opposed to the direct emission from a planet photosphere. We tentatively derived mass constraints for these two features. Conclusions. The twist and its apparent orbital motion could well be the first direct evidence of a connection between a protoplanet candidate and its manifestation as a spiral imprinted in the gas and dust distributions.},

F-type stars in the Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL),
and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC) subgroups of Scorpius-Centaurus
(Sco-Cen), the nearest OB association. Our parent sample is the
kinematically selected Hipparcos sample of de Zeeuw et al., restricted
to the 138 F-type members. We have obtained classification-resolution
optical spectra and have also determined the spectroscopic accretion
disk fraction. With Hipparcos and 2MASS photometry, we estimate the
reddening and extinction for each star and place the candidate members
on a theoretical H-R diagram. For each subgroup we construct empirical
isochrones and compare to published evolutionary tracks. We find that
(1) our empirical isochrones are consistent with the previously
published age-rank of the Sco-Cen subgroups; (2) subgroups LCC and UCL
appear to reach the main-sequence turn-on at spectral types {\textasciitilde}F4 and {\textasciitilde}F2,
respectively. An analysis of the A-type stars shows US reaching the main
sequence at about spectral type {\textasciitilde}A3. (3) The median ages for the
pre-main-sequence members of UCL and LCC are 16 Myr and 17 Myr,
respectively, in agreement with previous studies, however we find that
(4) Upper Sco is much older than previously thought. The luminosities of
the F-type stars in US are typically a factor of {\textasciitilde}2.5 less luminous than
predicted for a 5 Myr old population for four sets of evolutionary
tracks. We re-examine the evolutionary state and isochronal ages for the
B-, A-, and G-type Upper Sco members, as well as the evolved M
supergiant Antares, and estimate a revised mean age for Upper Sco of 11
± 1 ± 2 Myr (statistical, systematic). Using radial
velocities and Hipparcos parallaxes we calculate a lower limit on the
kinematic expansion age for Upper Sco of {\textgreater}10.5 Myr (99\% confidence).
However, the data are statistically consistent with no expansion. We
reevaluate the inferred masses for the known substellar companions in
Upper Sco using the revised age and find that the inferred masses are
typically {\textasciitilde}20\%-70\% higher than the original estimates which had assumed
a much younger age; specifically, we estimate the mass of 1RXS
J1609-2105b to be 14+2 -3 M Jup,
suggesting that it is a brown dwarf rather than a planet. Finally, we
find the fraction of F-type stars exhibiting Hα emission and/or a
K-band excess consistent with accretion to be 0/17 ({\textless}19\% 95\% CL) in
US at {\textasciitilde}11 Myr, while UCL has 1/41 (2+5 -1\% 68\% CL)

	abstract = {Observations of structure in circumstellar debris discs provide circumstantial evidence for the presence of massive planets at large (several tens of astronomical units) orbital radii, where the time-scale for planet formation via core accretion is prohibitively long. Here, we investigate whether a population of distant planets can be produced via outward migration subsequent to formation in the inner disc. Two possibilities for significant outward migration are identified. First, cores that form early at radii a{\textasciitilde} 10 au can be carried to larger radii via gravitational interaction with the gaseous disc. This process is efficient if there is strong mass loss from the disc - either within a cluster or due to photoevaporation from a star more massive than the Sun - but does not require the extremely destructive environment found, for example, in the core of the Orion nebula. We find that, depending upon the disc model, gas disc migration can yield massive planets (several Jupiter masses) at radii of around 20-50 au. Secondly, interactions within multiple planet systems can drive the outer planet into a large, normally highly eccentric orbit. A series of scattering experiments suggests that this process is most efficient for lower-mass planets within systems of unequal mass ratio. This mechanism is a good candidate for explaining the origin of relatively low-mass giant planets in eccentric orbits at large radii.},

This work helps to motivate such planet searches by predicting a population of young giant planets that could be detectable by direct imaging campaigns. Both the classical core accretion and the gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard pressed to form long-period planets in situ. Here, we show that dynamical instabilities among planetary systems that originally formed multiple giant planets much closer to the host star could produce a population of giant planets at large (≈ 102-105 AU) separations. We estimate the limits within which these planets may survive, quantify the efficiency of gravitational scattering into both stable and unstable wide orbits, and demonstrate that population analyses must take into account the age of the system. We predict that planet scattering creates detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreases in number on timescales of {\textasciitilde} 10 Myr. We demonstrate that several members of such populations should be detectable with current technology, quantify the prospects for future instruments, and suggest how they could place interesting constraints on planet formation models.},

	abstract = {UCAC4 is a compiled, all-sky star catalog covering mainly the 8 to 16 magnitude range in a single bandpass between V and R. Positional errors are about 15 to 20 mas for stars in the 10 to 14 mag range. Proper motions have been derived for most of the about 113 million stars utilizing about 140 other star catalogs with significant epoch
difference to the UCAC CCD observations. These data are supplemented by 2MASS photometric data for about 110 million stars and 5-band
(B,V,g,r,i) photometry from the APASS (AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey) for over 50 million stars. UCAC4 also contains error estimates and various flags. All bright stars not observed with the astrograph have been added to UCAC4 from a set of Hipparcos and Tycho-2 stars. Thus UCAC4 should be complete from the brightest stars to about R=16, with the source of data indicated in flags. UCAC4 also provides a link to the original Hipparcos star number with additional data such as parallax found on a separate data file included in this release.

The proper motions of bright stars are based on about 140 catalogs, including Hipparcos and Tycho, as well as all catalogs used for the Tycho-2 proper motion construction. Proper motions of faint stars are based on re-reductions of early epoch SPM data (-90 to about -20 deg Dec) and NPM (PMM scans of early epoch blue plates) for the remainder of the sky. These early epoch SPM data have also been combined with late epoch SPM data to arrive at proper motions partly independent from UCAC4 (Girard et al. 2011AJ....142...15G, Cat. I/320). The NPM data used in UCAC4 are not published. No Schmidt plate data are used in UCAC4.

The unpublished plate measure data obtained by StarScan from the AGK2, the Hamburg Zone Astrograph, the USNO Black Birch Astrograph, and the Lick Astrograph have contributed to considerable improvement in proper motions for stars mainly in the 10 to 14 mag range (down to the UCAC limit for Lick data); however, these data do not cover all sky.

Recources permitting, USNO plans to release the individual CCD
observations (RA,Dec at epoch of each CCD observations) in the future. Please contact nz@usno.navy.mil if you are interested in obtaining this set of about 50 GB data. We will likely request that interested users provide an external disk drive for the data release.

	abstract = {A comprehensive census of the stellar content of the OB associations within 1 kpc from the Sun is presented, based on Hipparcos positions, proper motions, and parallaxes. It is a key part of a long-term project to study the formation, structure, and evolution of nearby young stellar groups and related star-forming regions. OB associations are unbound ``moving groups,'' which can be detected kinematically because of their small internal velocity dispersion. The nearby associations have a large extent on the sky, which traditionally has limited astrometric
membership determination to bright stars (V{\textless}{\textasciitilde}6 mag), with spectral types earlier than {\textasciitilde}B5. The Hipparcos measurements allow a major improvement in this situation. Moving groups are identified in the Hipparcos Catalog by combining de Bruijne's refurbished convergent point method with the ``Spaghetti method'' of Hoogerwerf \& Aguilar.
Astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distance of {\textasciitilde}650 pc. These are the three subgroups Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus Lupus, and Lower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2, alpha Persei (Per OB3), Cas-Tau, Lac OB1, Cep OB2, and a new group in Cepheus, designated as Cep OB6. The
selection procedure corrects the list of previously known astrometric and photometric B- and A-type members in these groups and identifies many new members, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars, e.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma{\textasciicircum}2 Vel (WR 11) in Vel OB2 and EZ CMa (WR 6) in Col 121, and the classical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. Membership probabilities are given for all selected stars. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars. In the nearest associations, notably in Sco OB2, the later-type members include T Tauri objects and other stars in the final pre-main-sequence phase. This provides a firm link between the classical high-mass stellar content and ongoing low-mass star formation. Detailed studies of these 12 groups, and their relation to the surrounding interstellar medium, will be presented elsewhere. Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon OB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is inconclusive. OB associations do exist in many of these regions, but they are either at distances beyond {\textasciitilde}500 pc where the Hipparcos parallaxes are of limited use, or they have unfavorable kinematics, so that the group proper motion does not distinguish it from the field stars in the Galactic disk. The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller than the pre-Hipparcos photometric estimates. While part of this may be caused by the improved membership lists, a recalibration of the upper main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram may be called for. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which is discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving groups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. This is sometimes caused by the absence of O stars, but in other cases a previously known open cluster turns out to be (part of) an extended OB association. The number of unbound young stellar groups in the solar neighborhood may be significantly larger than thought
previously.},

This survey used nonredundant aperture mask interferometry to achieve typical contrast limits of Δ K {\textasciitilde} 5-6 at the diffraction limit, revealing 12 new binary companions that lay below the detection limits of
traditional high-resolution imaging; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered seven directly resolved
companions. The overall frequency of binary companions
({\textasciitilde}35-4+5\% at separations of 6-435 AU) appears to be equivalent to field stars of similar mass, but companions could be more common among lower mass stars than for the field. The companion mass function has statistically significant differences compared to several suggested mass functions for the field, and we suggest an alternate lognormal parameterization of the mass function. Our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range, but we only detected a single companion that might be a brown dwarf; this deficit resembles the so-called brown dwarf desert that has been observed by radial velocity planet searches. Finally, our survey's deep detection limits extend into the top of the planetary mass function, reaching 8-12 MJup for half of our sample. We have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence (gtrsim99.5\%), but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence (gtrsim97.5\%) that merit additional follow-up to confirm or disprove their existence.},

	abstract = {We have conducted an angular differential imaging survey with NIRC2 at 
Keck in search of close-in substellar companions to a sample of seven
systems with confirmed planetary-mass companions (PMCs) on wide orbits
({\textgreater}50 au). These wide-separation PMCs pose significant challenges to
all three possible formation mechanisms: core accretion plus scattering,
disk instability, and turbulent fragmentation. We explore the
possibility that these companions formed closer in and were scattered
out to their present-day locations by searching for other massive bodies
at smaller separations. The typical sensitivity for this survey is
ΔK ∼ 12.5 at 1″. We identify eight candidate companions,
whose masses would reach as low as one Jupiter mass if gravitationally
bound. From our multi-epoch astrometry we determine that seven of these
are conclusively background objects, while the eighth near DH Tau is
ambiguous and requires additional monitoring. We rule out the presence
of {\textgreater}7 M Jup bodies in these systems down to 15-50 au that
could be responsible for scattering. This result combined with the
totality of evidence suggests that dynamical scattering is unlikely to
have produced this population of PMCs. We detect orbital motion from the
companions ROXs 42B b and ROXs 12 b, and from this determine 95\% upper
limits on the companions’ eccentricities of 0.58 and 0.83
respectively. Finally, we find that the 95\% upper limit on the
occurrence rate of additional planets with masses between 5 and 15 M
Jup outside of 40 au in systems with PMCs is 54\%.},

	abstract = {High-contrast adaptive optics (AO) imaging is a powerful technique to probe the architectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the atmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of high-order AO systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on observations of 384 unique and single young (≈5-300 Myr) stars spanning stellar masses between 0.1 and 3.0 M ⊙, the overall occurrence rate of 5-13 M Jup companions at orbital distances of 30-300 au is \{0.6\}-0.5+0.7 \% assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically significant trend in planet frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around \{2.8\}-2.3+3.7 \% of BA stars, {\textless}4.1\% of FGK stars, and {\textless}3.9\% of M dwarfs. Looking
forward, extreme AO systems and the next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics, composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses and ages.},

stellar companions to Sun-like stars. The survey targeted 266 F5-K5
stars in the 3 Myr-3 Gyr age range with distances of 10-190 pc. Results
from the survey include the discovery of two brown dwarf companions (HD
49197B and HD 203030B), 24 new stellar binaries, and a triple system. We
infer that the frequency of 0.012-0.072 Msun brown dwarfs in
28-1590 AU orbits around young solar analogs is 3.2+3.1
-2.7\% (2σ limits). The result demonstrates that the
deficiency of substellar companions at wide orbital separations from
Sun-like stars is less pronounced than in the radial velocity "brown
dwarf desert." We infer that the mass distribution of companions in
28-1590 AU orbits around solar-mass stars follows a continuous dN/dM
2 vprop M -0.4 2 relation over the
0.01-1.0 M sun secondary mass range. While this functional
form is similar to that for isolated objects less than 0.1 M
sun, over the entire 0.01-1.0 M sun range, the
mass functions of companions and of isolated objects differ
significantly. Based on this conclusion and on similar results from
other direct imaging and radial velocity companion surveys in the
literature, we argue that the companion mass function follows the same
universal form over the entire range between 0 and 1590 AU in orbital
semimajor axis and ≈ 0.01-20 M sun in companion mass. In
this context, the relative dearth of substellar versus stellar
secondaries at all orbital separations arises naturally from the
inferred form of the companion mass function.},

cross-correlating with model spectra, and we find it to be a slow

5.3+0.9-1.0 km s-1. The slow rotation
is most likely due to its young age of 5 Myr, as it is still in the

projected separations from their host star is not yet well understood.
In order to put constraints on formation scenarios, we search for
signatures in the orbit dynamics of the systems. We are specifically
interested in the eccentricities and inclinations since those parameters
might tell us about the dynamic history of the systems and where to look
for additional low-mass sub-stellar companions. For this purpose, we
utilized VLT/NACO to take several well-calibrated high-resolution images
of six target systems and analyse them together with available
literature data points of those systems as well as Hubble Space
Telescope archival data. We used a statistical least-squares Monte Carlo
approach to constrain the orbit elements of all systems that showed
significant differential motion of the primary star and companion. We
show for the first time that the GQ Lup system shows significant change
in both separation and position angle. Our analysis yields best-fitting
orbits for this system, which are eccentric (e between 0.21 and 0.69),
but cannot rule out circular orbits at high inclinations. Given our
astrometry, we discuss formation scenarios of the GQ Lup system. In
addition, we detected an even fainter new companion candidate to GQ Lup,
which is most likely a background object. We also updated the orbit
constraints of the PZ Tel system, confirming that the companion is on a
highly eccentric orbit with e {\textgreater} 0.62. Finally, we show with a high
significance, that there is no orbital motion observed in the cases of
the DH Tau, HD 203030 and 1RXS J160929.1-210524 systems, and give the

theoretical mass estimates, both below the Deuterium burning minimum mass limit, the companion is probably a planet imaged directly. We present here a more detailed astrometric analysis of the GQ Lup system, using all the (different) proper motions published for the primary. The common proper motion is significant in all cases, also when taking into account the error in parallax or distance (140±50 pc). When using the weighted mean, the significance for common proper motion of GQ Lup and its companion is 7 σ + 4 σ for no change in separation
plus 8 σ for no change in position angle. We also discuss the
question, whether GQ Lup and its common-proper motion companion are not bound, but share the same or similar proper motion as two independent members of the Lupus T association, which is a moving group, where most members should have the same motion anyway. Given our discussion, this hypothesis can be rejected by several σ: The probability to find by chance an L-dwarf fainter than K\_S = 14 mag within 0.s7325 arcsec with (almost) the same proper motion of GQ Lup is only ≤3 *
10-10. The orbital motion of the system is not yet detected (1.4±2.2 mas/yr), but is probably smaller than the escape
velocity (5.3±2.1 mas/yr), so that the system may well be
gravitationally bound and stable. This is different for the 2MASSWJ 1207334-393254 system, as we also show.},

The HR-diagram of the new members shows a spread of ages, ranging from ∼3 to 20 Myr, which broadly agrees with the current age estimates of ∼5-10 Myr. We find a significant range of Li 6708 equivalent widths among the members, and a minor dependence of HR-diagram position on the measured equivalent width of the Li 6708 Å line, with members that appear younger having more lithium. This could indicate the presence of either populations of different age, or a spread of ages in Upper Scorpius.

velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m
telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period
star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0 +/-
0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1 +/- 0.6 ×
106 M⊙, and the black hole's RV, which is
consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black
hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no
massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit,
obtaining R0 = 8.4 +/- 0.4 kpc and Mbh = 4.5 +/-
0.4 × 106 M⊙. More complex models
constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4

higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all
models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion
(up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the
black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on
orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric
and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of
R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived
from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*,
(θ0 = 229 +/- 18 km s-1), are compatible
with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole
mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected

longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the

companions in the Ophiuchus star-forming region and update a similar
search of the Taurus region. The search is sensitive to companions in
the angular separation range 0.005-10 sec. In Ophiuchus, we surveyed 35
young star targets; this sample contains at least 10 binaries, two
triples, and one quadruple. Ten of the companion stars are newly
discovered. In Taurus, the survey now includes 47 systems among which
there are at least 22 binaries and four triples. Only two companion
stars are newly identified because there is strong overlap with prior
work. All the triples and quadruple are hierarchical. The observed
binary frequency in Ophiuchus, in the 3-1400 AU range of separations, is
at least 1.1 +/- 0.3 that of the nearby solar-like stars. This value is
a lower bound because we make no corrections for incompleteness. In
Taurus, in the same range of separations, the observed binary frequency
is at least 1.6 +/- 0.3 that of the nearby solar-like stars. This value
extends Ghez et al.'s (1993) and Leinert's et al.'s (1993) determination
of an excess binary frequency to 3 AU separation. We used the weak-line
T Tauri star/T Tauri star (WT/TT) type and the K-L color index to
distinguish between systems with and without inner disks. We find no
convincing difference in the binary frequency or distribution of
separations of the systems with and without inner disks. The 1.3 mm
continuum emission of the single systems exceeds that of the multiples
suggesting that their extensive outer disks are more massive. The
specific angular momenta of the binaries overlap those of molecular
cloud cores measured by Goodman et al. (1993).},

spectroscopy of the planetary-mass companion to GSC 06214-00210, a
member of the {\textasciitilde}5 Myr Upper Scorpius OB association. We infer a spectral
type of L0 ± 1, and our spectrum exhibits multiple signs of
youth. The most notable feature is exceptionally strong Paβ
emission (EW = -11.4 ± 0.3 Å), which signals the presence
of a circumplanetary accretion disk. The luminosity of GSC 06214-00210 b
combined with its age yields a model-dependent mass of 14 ± 2 M
Jup, making it the lowest-mass companion to show evidence of
a disk. With a projected separation of 320 AU, the formation of GSC
06214-00210 b and other very low mass companions on similarly wide
orbits is unclear. One proposed mechanism is formation at close
separations followed by planet-planet scattering to much larger orbits.
Since that scenario involves a close encounter with another massive
body, which is probably destructive to circumplanetary disks, it is
unlikely that GSC 06214-00210 b underwent a scattering event in the
past. This implies that planet-planet scattering is not solely
responsible for the population of gas giants on wide orbits. More
generally, the identification of disks around young planetary companions
on wide orbits offers a novel method to constrain the formation pathway
of these objects, which is otherwise notoriously difficult to do for
individual systems. We also refine the spectral type of the primary from
M1 to K7 and detect a mild (2σ) excess at 22 μm using
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry.

suggest an orbital semimajor axis of \{14\}-3+7 AU,

inclination of \{138\}-13+15 deg. The remaining

	abstract = {We present significantly improved proper motion measurements of the 
Milky Way's central stellar cluster. These improvements are made
possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new
geometric optical distortion model for the W. M. Keck II 10 m
telescope's adaptive optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For
the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky
measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS
files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in
the separations of stars that are a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 smaller compared with
the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along
with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely
dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve
our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame.
The resulting infrared reference frame is {\textasciitilde}2-3 times more accurate and
stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A*
is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas
yr-1, or {\textasciitilde}3.4 km s-1 at 8 kpc (1σ). Also,
proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more
accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide
field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with
respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the
plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr-1 arcsec-1,
has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas
yr-1, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the
sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While
earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no
net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally
limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not
improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this
reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future
measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt -3/2).
This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability
required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass
on short-period stars at the GC.},

relation is based on 47 stars for which dynamical masses have been
determined, primarily using astrometric data from Fine Guidance Sensors

our HST/FGS sample of 15 binaries, component mass errors range from 0.4\%
to 4.0\% with a median error of 1.8\%. With these and masses from other
sources, we construct a V-band MLR for the lower main sequence with 47
stars and a K-band MLR with 45 stars with fit residuals half of those of
the V band. We use GJ 831 AB as an example, obtaining an absolute
trigonometric parallax, π abs = 125.3 ± 0.3 mas,

eclipsing binaries. A remaining major task is the interpretation of the
intrinsic cosmic scatter in the observed MLR for low-mass stars in terms
of physical effects. In the meantime, useful mass values can be
estimated from the MLR for the ubiquitous red dwarfs that account for
75\% of all stars, with applications ranging from the characterization of
exoplanet host stars to the contribution of red dwarfs to the mass of
the universe.

sensitivity of 50 μJy beam-1 at 225 GHz) snapshot survey
of 32 protoplanetary disks around young stars with spectral type earlier
than M3 in the Taurus star-forming region using the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array. This sample includes most mid-infrared excess members
that were not previously imaged at high spatial resolution, excluding
close binaries and objects with high extinction, thereby providing a
more representative look at disk properties at 1-2 Myr. Our 1.3 mm
continuum maps reveal 12 disks with prominent dust gaps and rings, 2 of
which are around primary stars in wide binaries, and 20 disks with no
resolved features at the observed resolution (hereafter smooth disks), 8
of which are around the primary star in wide binaries. The smooth disks
were classified based on their lack of resolved substructures, but their
most prominent property is that they are all compact with small
effective emission radii (R eff,95\% ≲ 50 au). In
contrast, all disks with R eff,95\% of at least 55 au in our
sample show detectable substructures. Nevertheless, their inner emission
cores (inside the resolved gaps) have similar peak brightness, power-law
profiles, and transition radii to the compact smooth disks, so the
primary difference between these two categories is the lack of outer
substructures in the latter. These compact disks may lose their outer
disk through fast radial drift without dust trapping, or they might be
born with small sizes. The compact dust disks, as well as the inner disk
cores of extended ring disks, that look smooth at the current resolution
will likely show small-scale or low-contrast substructures at higher
resolution. The correlation between disk size and disk luminosity
correlation demonstrates that some of the compact disks are optically
thick at millimeter wavelengths.},

The disks are assumed to be coplanar with the binary, geometrically thin, and primarily governed by gas pressure and (turbulent) viscosity but not self-gravity. Both ordinary and eccentric Lindblad resonances are primarily responsible for truncating the disks in binaries with arbitrary eccentricity and nonextreme mass ratio. Starting from a smooth disk configuration, after the gravitational field of the binary
truncates the disk on the dynamical timescale, a quasi-equilibrium is achieved, in which the resonant and viscous torques balance each other and any changes in the structure of the disk (e.g., due to global viscous evolution) occur slowly, preserving the average size of the gap. We analytically compute the approximate sizes of disks (or disk gaps) as a function of binary mass ratio and eccentricity in this
quasi-equilibrium. Comparing the gap sizes with results of direct simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we obtain a good agreement. As a by-product of the computations, we verify that standard SPH codes can adequately represent the dynamics of disks with moderate viscosity, Reynolds number R approximately 103. For typical viscous disk parameters, and with a denoting the binary
semimajor axis, the inner edge location of a circumbinary disk varies from 1.8a to 2.6a with binary eccentricity increasing from 0 to 0.25. For eccentricities 0 less than e less than 0.75, the minimum separation between a component star and the circumbinary disk inner edge is greater than a. Our calculations are relevant, among others, to protobinary stars and the recently discovered T Tau pre-main-sequence binaries. We briefly examine the case of a pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary GW Ori and conclude that circumbinary disk truncation to the size required by one proposed spectroscopic model cannot be due to Linblad resonances, even if the disk is nonviscous.},

Using the Wide-Field Spectrograph at the Australian National University 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring, we observed 397 kinematically and
photometrically selected candidate members of Upper Scorpius, and identified new members by the presence of lithium absorption. The HR-diagram of the new members shows a spread of ages, ranging from ∼3 to 20 Myr, which broadly agrees with the current age estimates of ∼5-10 Myr. We find a significant range of Li 6708 equivalent widths among the members, and a minor dependence of HR-diagram position on the measured equivalent width of the Li 6708 Å line, with members that appear younger having more lithium. This could indicate the presence of either populations of different age, or a spread of ages in Upper Scorpius. We also use Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer data to infer circumstellar disc presence in 25 of the members on the basis of infrared excesses, including two candidate transition discs. We find that 11.2 ± 3.4 per cent of the M0-M2 spectral type (0.4-0.8

the optical (≃30 m s-1), making mass measurements
unlikely in the optical but possible with future near-infrared

	abstract = {We present results from the Radio Interferometric Planet search for 
companions to the nearby star GJ 896A. We present 11 observations over
4.9 yr. Fitting astrometric parameters to the data reveals a residual
with peak-to-peak amplitude of {\textasciitilde}3 mas in right ascension. This residual
is well fit by an acceleration term of 0.458 ± 0.032 mas
yr-2. The parallax is fit to an accuracy of 0.2 mas and the
proper motion terms are fit to accuracies of 0.01 mas yr-1.
After fitting astrometric and acceleration terms, residuals are 0.26 mas
in each coordinate, demonstrating that stellar jitter does not limit the
ability to carry out radio astrometric planet detection and
characterization. The acceleration term originates in part from the
companion GJ 896B, but the amplitude of the acceleration in declination
is not accurately predicted by the orbital model. The acceleration sets
a mass upper limit of 0.15 MJ at a semimajor axis of 2 AU for
a planetary companion to GJ 896A. For semimajor axes between 0.3 and 2
AU upper limits are determined by the maximum angular separation; the
upper limits scale from the minimum value in proportion to the inverse
of the radius. Upper limits at larger radii are set by the acceleration
and scale as the radius squared. An improved solution for the stellar
binary system could improve the exoplanet mass sensitivity by an order
of magnitude.},

First, we construct our base catalogue by compiling astrometry for the stars observed by Kepler, and supplement it with parallaxes, radial velocities (RVs), and metallicities. We then mine our base catalogue for wide binary candidates by matching the stars' proper motions, as well as parallaxes, RVs, and metallicities, if available. We mitigate the presence of chance alignments among our candidates by performing a comprehensive data-based contamination analysis in the proper motion versus angular separation phase space. Our final sample contains 55 binary candidates. A cross-match of our pairs with the Second Data Release (DR2) from Gaia validates our candidates and confirms the reliability of our search method, particularly for ϖ ≳ 2 mas.
Due to the implicit Kepler selection function and image scale per pixel, our binary search is incomplete for angular separations of
Δθ ≲ 20″. We cross-match our candidates with
rotation period and asteroseismic ages catalogues, and find that our binary candidates do not follow a simple period-colour relation, in agreement with previous studies. Two pairs have an age estimate for one component star and rotation period for its companion, positioning them as potentially new gyrochronology constraints at old ages. This is the first study that uses RVs and metallicities as criteria, rather than as a confirmation, in a binary search.},

Scorpius-Ophiuchus star-forming regions. We observed systems with projected separations 1.5"-7.2" ({\textasciitilde}200-1000 AU) in order to determine the relative orientation of the circumstellar disks in each binary system. Scattered light from these disks is polarized, allowing us to deduce the position angle of the disk on the sky from the position angle of polarization even though our observations do not resolve the disks themselves. We detected measurable polarization (typically 0.5\%-2\%, with typical uncertainty 0.1\%) from both stars in 14 of the systems observed. In eight of the nine binary systems, the two stars' polarization position angles are within 30° of each other, inconsistent with
random orientations. In contrast, the five triple and quadruple systems appear to have random disk orientations when comparing the polarization position angles of the widest pair in the system; the close pairs are unresolved in all but one system. Our observations suggest that disks in wide (200-1000 AU) binaries are aligned with each other within
{\textless}{\textasciitilde}20° but not perfectly coplanar. However, we cannot conclusively rule out random relative disk orientations if the observed polarizations are significantly contaminated by interstellar polarization. Even in the presence of interstellar polarization our observations securely exclude coplanar disks. These results provide constraints on possible binary formation mechanisms if the observed orientations are primordial. On the other hand, models of disk-binary interactions indicate that the disks may have had time to decrease their relative inclinations since
formation. If the common orientation of the disks in these binaries is a tracer of the binary orbital plane, then our results also have
significance for the stability of planetary orbits, suggesting that planetary systems in wide binaries should be stable over 109 yr timescales.},

of the Gaia catalog can be exploited to enable comparison of binary
orbits with known planet or disk inclinations without costly long-term
astrometric campaigns. We show that Gaia astrometry can place meaningful
limits on orbital elements in cases with reliable astrometry, and
discuss metrics for assessing the reliability of Gaia DR2 solutions for
orbit fitting. We demonstrate our method by determining orbital elements
for three systems (DS Tuc AB, GK/GI Tau, and Kepler-25/KOI-1803) using
Gaia astrometry alone. We show that DS Tuc AB's orbit is nearly aligned
with the orbit of DS Tuc Ab, GK/GI Tau's orbit might be misaligned with
their respective protoplanetary disks, and the Kepler-25/KOI-1803 orbit
is not aligned with either component's transiting planetary system. We
also demonstrate cases where Gaia astrometry alone fails to provide
useful constraints on orbital elements. To enable broader application of
this technique, we introduce the python tool lofti\_gaiaDR2 to allow
users to easily determine orbital element posteriors.},

We constrain all three of the system's angular-momentum vectors: how the companion spin axis, the stellar spin axis, and the orbit normal are inclined relative to our line of sight. To accomplish this, we measure projected rotation rates (v sin i) for both the star and the companion using new near-infrared high-resolution spectra with NIRSPEC at Keck Observatory. We combine these with a new stellar photometric rotation period from TESS and a published companion rotation period from Hubble Space Telescope to obtain spin-axis inclinations for both objects. We also fitted multiple epochs of astrometry, including a new observation with NIRC2/Keck, to measure 2M0122b's orbital inclination. The three line-of-sight inclinations place limits on the true de-projected companion obliquity and stellar obliquity. We find that while the stellar obliquity marginally prefers alignment, the companion obliquity tentatively favors misalignment. We evaluate possible origin scenarios. While collisions, secular spin-orbit resonances, and Kozai-Lidov oscillations are unlikely, formation by gravitational instability in a gravito-turbulent disk -- the scenario favored for brown dwarf
companions to stars -- appears promising.},

	abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that the concluding stages of giant planet formation are accompanied by the development of large-scale meridional flow of gas inside the planetary Hill sphere. This circulation feeds a circumplanetary disk that viscously expels gaseous material back into the parent nebula, maintaining the system in a quasi-steady state. Here we investigate the formation of natural satellites of Jupiter and Saturn within the framework of this newly outlined picture. We begin by considering the long-term evolution of solid material, and demonstrate that the circumplanetary disk can act as a global dust trap, where \$s\_\{{\textbackslash}bullet\}{\textbackslash}sim0.1-10{\textbackslash},\$mm grains achieve a hydrodynamical equilibrium, facilitated by a balance between radial updraft and aerodynamic drag. This process leads to a gradual increase in the system's metallicity, and eventually culminates in the gravitational fragmentation of the outer regions of the solid sub-disk into \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}{\textbackslash}sim100{\textbackslash},\$km satellitesimals. Subsequently, satellite conglomeration ensues via pairwise collisions, but is terminated when disk-driven orbital migration removes the growing objects from the satellitesimal feeding zone. The resulting satellite formation cycle can repeat multiple times, until it is brought to an end by photo-evaporation of the parent nebula. Numerical simulations of the envisioned formation scenario yield satisfactory agreement between our model and the known properties of the Jovian and Saturnian moons.},

spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology,
we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the
transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1\%), and we constrain
their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than
three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was
securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass.
For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or
upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule
out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5
g cm-3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed,
the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are
smaller than {\textasciitilde}2 R ⊕. Larger planets evidently contain a
larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O).

spectroscopy, eclipses, long-baseline interferometry, adaptive optics,
common proper motion, etc. Each observational technique is sensitive to
companions across a narrow parameter space of orbital periods P and mass
ratios q = \{M\}\{comp\}/M 1. After combining the
samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective
selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type
and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First,
at short orbital periods P ≲ 20 days (separations a ≲ 0.4 au),
the binaries have small eccentricities e ≲ 0.4, favor modest mass
ratios {\textless} q{\textgreater} ≈ 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q {\textgreater}
0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log
P (days) ≈ 3.5 (a ≈ 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios
weighted toward small values q ≈ 0.2-0.3 and follow a
Maxwellian “thermal” eccentricity distribution. Finally,
companions with long orbital periods log P (days) ≈ 5.5-7.5 (a
≈ 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical
triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q ≈ 0.1-1.0
that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial
mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties
in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze
the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account
that 30\% ± 10\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely
contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries.
The mean frequency of stellar companions with q {\textgreater} 0.1 and log P
(days) {\textless} 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50 ± 0.04 for
solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 ± 0.3 for O-type MS primaries. We
fit joint probability density functions f(\{M\}1,q,P,e){\textbackslash}ne
f(\{M\}1)f(q)f(P)f(e) to the corrected distributions, which can

Way have a companion, and this fraction increases in star-forming
regions. However, why some dense cores and filaments form bound pairs
while others form single stars remains unclear. We present a set of
three-dimensional, gravo-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent
star-forming clouds, aimed at understanding the formation and evolution
of multiple-star systems formed through large-scale
(≳103 au) turbulent fragmentation. We investigate three
global magnetic field strengths, with global mass-to-flux ratios of μ
 ϕ = 2, 8, and 32. The initial separations of
protostars in multiples depend on the global magnetic field strength,
with stronger magnetic fields (e.g., μ ϕ = 2)
suppressing fragmentation on smaller scales. The overall multiplicity
fraction (MF) is between 0.4 and 0.6 for our strong and intermediate
magnetic field strengths, which is in agreement with observations. The
weak field case has a lower fraction. The MF is relatively constant
throughout the simulations, even though stellar densities increase as
collapse continues. While the MF rarely exceeds 60\% in all three
simulations, over 80\% of all protostars are part of a binary system at
some point. We additionally find that the distribution of binary spin
misalignment angles is consistent with a randomized distribution. In all
three simulations, several binaries originate with wide separations and
dynamically evolve to ≲102 au separations. We show that
a simple model of mass accretion and dynamical friction with the gas can
explain this orbital evolution.},

dwarf desert at short P, the nearly uniform distribution of mass ratios,
and a population of equal-mass binaries (twins) that decreases linearly
in frequency with log P. For massive stars, the model predicts a large
fraction of early mergers, a distribution of log P with a negative
slope, and a mass-ratio distribution that is also uniform but with a
substantially reduced twin fraction. By treating disc fragmentation as a
stochastic process, we also reproduce the observed properties of compact
triples. Success of our toy model suggests that most close binaries and
compact triples indeed formed by disc fragmentation followed by
accretion-driven inward migration.},

	abstract = {Binary and multiple star systems are a frequent outcome of the star 
formation process and as a result almost half of all stars with masses
similar to that of the Sun have at least one companion star. Theoretical
studies indicate that there are two main pathways that can operate
concurrently to form binary/multiple star systems: large-scale
fragmentation of turbulent gas cores and filaments or smaller-scale
fragmentation of a massive protostellar disk due to gravitational
instability. Observational evidence for turbulent fragmentation on
scales of more than 1,000 astronomical units has recently emerged.
Previous evidence for disk fragmentation was limited to inferences based
on the separations of more-evolved pre-main sequence and protostellar
multiple systems. The triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B is an ideal
system with which to search for evidence of disk fragmentation as it is
in an early phase of the star formation process, it is likely to be less
than 150,000 years old and all of the protostars in the system are
separated by less than 200 astronomical units. Here we report
observations of dust and molecular gas emission that reveal a disk with
a spiral structure surrounding the three protostars. Two protostars near
the centre of the disk are separated by 61 astronomical units and a
tertiary protostar is coincident with a spiral arm in the outer disk at
a separation of 183 astronomical units. The inferred mass of the central
pair of protostellar objects is approximately one solar mass, while the
disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of around 0.30
solar masses. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of about
0.085 solar masses. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B
appears susceptible to disk fragmentation at radii between 150 and 320
astronomical units, overlapping with the location of the tertiary
protostar. This is consistent with models for a protostellar disk that
has recently undergone gravitational instability, spawning one or two
companion stars.},

period information, or with expected rotational velocities based upon
the age of the star in question. These inclinations are then compared
with the orbital inclinations of the systems to test the alignment
between the equatorial and orbital planes, and how the tendency for or
against coplanarity varies as a function of parameters such as spectral
type, separation, eccentricity, etc. The results are extended to
planetary systems in order to determine the appropriateness of basing
planetary search strategies upon a parent star's equatorial inclination,
and to address issues in planetary system formation and evolution,
including the stability of planetary orbits within binary systems.
During the course of this project new or improved v sin i measurements
are made for over 30 solar-type stars within binary systems, and (for
the purposes of the study) tentative orbits are computed for thirteen
long-period systems. The results suggest that approximate coplanarity
between the equatorial and orbital planes exists solar-type binary
systems with separations less than 30-40 AU. The coplanarity tendency,
as well as this 'critical separation,' is not significantly affected by
most of the other parameters studied. The one significant exception
occurs with hierarchical multiple systems, where noncoplanarity may
exist at relatively small separations. If it is assumed that planetary
distances in our solar system are typical, the results suggest there is
no reason to expect planets to orbit in planes significantly different
from that of the parent star's equator, in turn suggesting that
planetary formation models and search strategies dependent upon this
assumption are valid from this standpoint. The results also suggest that
noncoplanarity between the components of a binary system is not a
significant issue in addressing the stability of planetary orbits within
the system.},

The large field of view, however, results in low spatial resolution; therefore, multiple stars contribute to almost every TESS light curve. High angular resolution imaging can detect the previously unknown companions to planetary candidate hosts that dilute the transit depths, lead to host star ambiguity, and, in some cases, are the source of false-positive transit signals. We use speckle imaging on the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope to search for companions to 542 TESS planet candidate hosts in the southern sky. We provide correction factors for the 117 systems with resolved companions due to photometric contamination. The contamination in TESS due to close binaries is similar to that found in surveys of Kepler planet candidates. For the solar-type population, we find a deep deficit of close binary systems with projected stellar separations less than 100 au among planet candidate hosts (44 observed binaries compared to 124 expected based on field binary statistics). The close binary suppression among TESS planet candidate hosts is similar to that seen for the more distant Kepler population. We also find a large surplus of TESS planet candidates in wide binary systems detected in both SOAR and Gaia DR2 (119 observed binaries compared to 77 expected). These wide binaries almost
exclusively host giant planets, however, suggesting that orbital migration caused by perturbations from the stellar companion may lead to planet–planet scattering and suppress the population of small
planets in wide binaries. Both trends are also apparent in the M dwarf planet candidate hosts.},

The 107 astrometric binaries targeted at Gemini so far have 38 resolved
companions with separations under 3''. Modeling shows that bright enough companions with separations on the order of an arcsecond can perturb the Hipparcos astrometry when they are not accounted for in the data reduction. However, the resulting bias of parallax and proper motion is generally below formal errors and such companions cannot produce fake acceleration. This work contributes to the multiplicity statistics of nearby dwarfs by bridging the gap between spectroscopic and visual binaries and by providing estimates of periods and mass ratios for many astrometric binaries.

A SED model was fit to available photometric data for the object. Results: We propose a triple-system with an inner binary with a period of 93 days eclipsed by a warped circum-binary disk. The nature of the secondary is unconstrained and could be stellar or sub-stellar. We confirm the discovery of a tertiary companion at a projected separation of {\textasciitilde}40 AU that could account for the circum-binary disk warp. This light curve and model is similar to the model we proposed for WL 4 in previous work. Understanding these systems may lead to insights about the nature of stellar evolution and planetary
formation, and provide valuable benchmarks for future theoretical modeling and near- and mid-infrared synoptic surveys of YSOs.},

	abstract = {We present new radial velocity (RV) measurements of HAT-P-13, a star 
with two previously known companions: a transiting giant planet "b" with
an orbital period of 3 days and a more massive object "c" on a 1.2 yr,
highly eccentric orbit. For this system, dynamical considerations would
lead to constraints on planet b's interior structure, if it could be
shown that the orbits are coplanar and apsidally locked. By modeling the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, we show that planet b's orbital angular
momentum vector and the stellar spin vector are well aligned on the sky
(λ = 1.9 ± 8.6 deg). The refined orbital solution favors a
slightly eccentric orbit for planet b (e = 0.0133 ± 0.0041),
although it is not clear whether it is apsidally locked with c's orbit
(Δω = 36+27 -36 deg). We find a
long-term trend in the star's RV and interpret it as evidence for an
additional body "d," which may be another planet or a low-mass star.
Predictions are given for the next few inferior conjunctions of c, when
transits may happen.},

With the ELODIE spectrograph we took a sequence of high precision radial velocities of the star HD209458 at time of a transit of its planet. We detected an anomaly in the residuals of the orbit. The shape and the amplitude of the anomaly are modeled as a change of the mean stellar line profile resulting from the planet crossing the disk of the rotating star. The planetary orbit is in the same direction as the stellar rotation. Using the photometric transit to constrain the timing and the impact parameters of the transit, we measure an angle alpha =3.9 [0] between the orbital plane and the apparent equatorial plane as well as a vsin i=3.75+/-1.25 km s-1. With additional constrains on the inclination of the star and on the statistics of the line of sight distribution, we can set an upper limit of 30 0 to the angle between the orbital plane and the stellar equatorial plane.

Near-infrared adaptive optics observations made at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope show a similar morphology and no directly visible star at λ{\textless}=2.2 μm. HK Tau/c is strikingly similar
to scattered light models of an optically thick circumstellar disk seen close to edge-on and to the HST images of HH 30. HK Tau/c is therefore the first disk to be clearly resolved around an individual star in a young binary system. The disk properties have been constrained by fitting model reflection nebulae to the HST images. The disk has a radius of 105 AU, an inclination of about 5°, a scale height of 3.8 AU at r=50 AU, and is flared. The absence of a point source in the near-IR requires AV{\textgreater}50 mag toward the unseen central star. The thickness of the dark lane establishes a disk mass near
10-4 Msolar ({\textasciitilde}0.1 MJupiter) of dust and gas, if the dust grains have interstellar properties and remain fully mixed vertically. With the observed disk radius equal to one-third of the projected separation of the binary, there is a strong possibility that tidal truncation of the circumsecondary disk has occurred in this system.

characterize the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet
systems. The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast
majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order
mean-motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are small but statistically
significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced
slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly near the 2:1
resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable, as
tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius
relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast
majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems.
Using the observed multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single
population of planetary systems that matches the higher multiplicities
underpredicts the number of singly transiting systems. We provide
constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution
of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a population of systems with
multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets with low to moderate

Scorpius-Ophiuchus star-forming regions. We observed systems with projected separations 1.5"-7.2" ({\textasciitilde}200-1000 AU) in order to determine the relative orientation of the circumstellar disks in each binary system. Scattered light from these disks is polarized, allowing us to deduce the position angle of the disk on the sky from the position angle of polarization even though our observations do not resolve the disks themselves. We detected measurable polarization (typically 0.5\%-2\%, with typical uncertainty 0.1\%) from both stars in 14 of the systems observed. In eight of the nine binary systems, the two stars' polarization position angles are within 30° of each other, inconsistent with
random orientations. In contrast, the five triple and quadruple systems appear to have random disk orientations when comparing the polarization position angles of the widest pair in the system; the close pairs are unresolved in all but one system. Our observations suggest that disks in wide (200-1000 AU) binaries are aligned with each other within
{\textless}{\textasciitilde}20° but not perfectly coplanar. However, we cannot conclusively rule out random relative disk orientations if the observed polarizations are significantly contaminated by interstellar polarization. Even in the presence of interstellar polarization our observations securely exclude coplanar disks. These results provide constraints on possible binary formation mechanisms if the observed orientations are primordial. On the other hand, models of disk-binary interactions indicate that the disks may have had time to decrease their relative inclinations since
formation. If the common orientation of the disks in these binaries is a tracer of the binary orbital plane, then our results also have
significance for the stability of planetary orbits, suggesting that planetary systems in wide binaries should be stable over 109 yr timescales.},

Based on the present understanding of planet formation via core accretion and oligarchic growth, we expect that giant planets often form in closely packed configurations. While the protoplanets are embedded in a
protoplanetary gas disk, dissipation can prevent eccentricity growth and suppress instabilities from becoming manifest. However, once the disk dissipates, eccentricities can grow rapidly, leading to close encounters between planets. Strong planet-planet gravitational scattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidal circularization, very short period planets, as observed in the exoplanet population. We present new results for this scenario based on extensive dynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with and without residual gas disks. We assign the initial planetary masses and orbits in a realistic manner following the core accretion model of planet formation. We show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet-planet scattering can reproduce quite well the observed
eccentricity distribution. Our results also make testable predictions for the orbital inclinations of short-period giant planets formed via strong planet scattering followed by tidal circularization.},

Instead, a high frequency of close binaries can be produced through a
combination of dynamical interactions in unstable multiple systems and
the orbital decay of initially wider binaries. Orbital decay may occur
as a result of gas accretion and/or the interaction of a binary with its
circumbinary disc. These three mechanisms avoid the problems associated
with the fragmentation of optically thick gas to form close systems
directly. They also result in a preference for close binaries to have
roughly equal-mass components because dynamical exchange interactions
and the accretion of gas with high specific angular momentum drive mass
ratios towards unity. Furthermore, because of the importance of
dynamical interactions, we find that stars with greater masses ought to
have a higher frequency of close companions, and that many close
binaries ought to have wide companions. These properties are in good
agreement with the results of observational surveys.},

orbiting several solar-type stars pose a conundrum. Conventional
models5,6 for the formation of giant planets (such as Jupiter
and Saturn) place such objects at distances of several astronomical
units from the parent star, whereas all but one of the new objects are
on orbits well inside 1 AU; these planets must therefore have originated
at larger distances and subsequently migrated inwards. One suggested
migration mechanism invokes tidal interactions between the planet and
the evolving circumstellar disk7. Such a mechanism results in
planets with small, essentially circular orbits, which appears to be the
case for many of the new planets. But two of the objects have
substantial orbital eccentricities, which are difficult to reconcile
with a tidal-linkage model. Here we describe an alternative model for
planetary migration that can account for these large orbital
eccentricities. If a system of three or more giant planets form about a
star, their orbits may become unstable as they gain mass by accreting
gas from the circumstellar disk; subsequent gravitational encounters
among these planets can eject one from the system while placing the
others into highly eccentric orbits both closer and farther from the
star.},

	abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within {\textasciitilde}0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of {\textasciitilde}2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to {\textasciitilde}105 days),
consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40° and 140°. (2)
Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.

star-disc system evolves in time such that the frequency of disc
precession (driven by the binary companion) and that of stellar
precession (driven by the disc) cross each other. This resonance
behaviour can be understood in a geometric way from the precession
dynamics of spin and disc angular momenta. We show that such resonance
crossing can occur under reasonable protostar-disc-binary conditions.
The star-disc inclination is also affected by mass accretion and by
magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either promote or
reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, a variety of star-disc
misalignment angles are produced within the lifetimes of protoplanetary
discs. We discuss the implications of our results for stellar spin
orientations in binaries, for the alignments/misalignments of
protostellar and debris discs, and for the stellar obliquities in
exoplanetary systems. In particular, even for systems where the Kozai
effect is absent or suppressed, misaligned planets and hot Jupiters may
still be produced during the protoplanetary disc phase.},

migration associated with viscous evolution of proto-planetary nebulae.
Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during
planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of hot
Jupiters are on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin axes
of their host stars. This observation has cast doubt on the importance
of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for producing hot Jupiters. Here
I show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk
migration in binary systems whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the
spin axes of the individual stars. The gravitational torques arising
from the dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under
perturbations from massive distant bodies act to misalign the orbital
planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a
result, I suggest that in the absence of strong coupling between the
angular momentum of the disk and that of the host star, or of sufficient
dissipation that acts to realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary
orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems of `hot
Neptunes' and `super-Earths') whose angular momentum vectors are
misaligned with respect to their host stars will be commensurate with
the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.},

	abstract = {Tidal perturbation of a circumstellar disc by a companion on an inclined circular orbit in a binary system of T Tauri stars is studied. The two stars have comparable masses and we suppose that the separation of the system is large enough compared to the radius of the disc to allow a linear analysis. In this paper we concentrate on the tidally induced angular momentum transport in the disc arising from (m=1) bending waves that are excited by potential perturbations with odd symmetry with respect to reflection in the disc mid-plane. These are of interest because they have a long wavelength which may in some cases by a significant fraction of the radius. Then propagation to the inner regions of the disc is facilitated. We calculate the response of the disc to tidal perturbations with both zero and non-zero perturbing frequencies. We expect the response to the zero-frequency term to be an approximate rigid body precession if the sound crossing time turns out to be short compared to the precession period. The response to the non-zero frequencies comprises long-wavelength waves excited at the outer edge of the disc and which propagate inwards transporting negative angular momentum with, in the inviscid case, an associated conserved wave action. Such conservation implies that the wave amplitude increases as it propagates inwards until non-linear effects become important and cause the wave to damp. Because the perturber rotates external to, and more slowly than, the disc, on dissipation of the wave, angular momentum is transferred from the disc to the companion, increasing the accretion rate on to the central star. If non-linear dissipation can produce a slowly decreasing wave action as the disc centre is approached, it is possible that tidal effects could induce an accretion rate which is of the order of typical accretion rates in classical T Tauri stars (namely between 10{\textasciicircum}-9 and 10{\textasciicircum}-7 M\_solar yr{\textasciicircum}-1). As long as the response of the disc is wave-like, the wave angular momentum flux induced in our model discs tends to increase with increasing separation of the binary system. This is at least in part due to the fact that the response of the disc has an increasing wavelength with increasing separation. The torque exerted by the perturber on the disc leads to the evolution of the relative inclination of the disc and the orbital planes, but not necessarily towards coplanarity. In some cases, the only stable
equilibrium position of the system does not correspond to coplanarity. The time-scale for this evolution is of the order of magnitude of the time needed by tidal effects to remove the angular momentum content of the disc. We conclude that, when the orbit is highly inclined with respect to the disc, tidal effects may play a significant role in the accretion process in the circumprimary disc.},

Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short
binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the
tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the
Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in

model where a `seed' protobinary system forms, via fragmentation, within
a collapsing molecular cloud core and evolves to its final mass by
accreting material from an infalling gaseous envelope. This accretion
alters the mass ratio and orbit of the binary, and is largely
responsible for forming the circumstellar and/or circumbinary discs.
Given this model for binary formation, we predict the properties of
binary systems and how they depend on the initial conditions within the
molecular cloud core. We predict that there should be a continuous trend
such that closer binaries are more likely to have equal-mass components
and are more likely to have circumbinary discs than wider systems.
Comparing our results with observations, we find that the observed
mass-ratio distributions of binaries and the frequency of circumbinary
discs as a function of separation are most easily reproduced if the
progenitor molecular cloud cores have radial density profiles between
uniform and 1/r (e.g., Gaussian) with near-uniform rotation. This is in
good agreement with the observed properties of pre-stellar cores.
Conversely, we find that the observed properties of binaries cannot be
reproduced if the cloud cores are in solid-body rotation and have
initial density profiles which are strongly centrally condensed.
Finally, in agreement with the radial-velocity searches for extrasolar
planets, we find that it is very difficult to form a brown dwarf
companion to a solar-type star with a separation {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10au, but that the
frequency of brown dwarf companions should increase with larger
separations or lower mass primaries.},

accuracy of the computer program. Comparisons are given with a standard
test case of binary fragmentation in a collapsing isothermal cloud of
initially uniform density. In a simulation with a 50 per cent initial

per cent initial perturbation, however, calculations show the initial
formation of a binary and a connecting bar, followed by fragmentation of
the bar. The binary components are surrounded by accretion discs of
radius ∼100 au. This result is shown to be independent of the grid
spacing employed. It is suggested that the further evolution of this
system is likely to produce some isolated low-mass fragments. In both
the above cases (i.e. 50 and 10 per cent perturbations) a detailed
analysis of the momentum of the forming fragments indicates that they
are initially on a highly eccentric orbit. The subsequent interaction of
each fragment with the other's accretion disc could result in
circularization and the formation of a shorter period multiple system.},

Many of the systems are observed to have highly irregular and non-axisymmetric morphologies on scales gsim1000 AU, with a quarter of the sample exhibiting filamentary or flattened dense structures. Complex envelope structure is observed in regions spatially distinct from outflow cavities, and the densest structures often show no systematic alignment perpendicular to the cavities. These results indicate that mass ejection is not responsible for much of the irregular morphologies we detect; rather, we suggest that the observed envelope complexity is mostly the result of collapse from protostellar cores with initially non-equilibrium structures. The striking non-axisymmetry in many envelopes could provide favorable conditions for the formation of binary systems. We also note that protostars in the sample appear to be formed preferentially near the edges of clouds or bends in filaments, suggesting formation by gravitational focusing.

	abstract = {We have conducted a survey of young single and multiple systems in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region with the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA), substantially improving both the spatial resolution and sensitivity with which individual protoplanetary disks in these systems have been observed. These ALMA observations can resolve binary separations as small as 25-30 au and have an average
3σ detection level of 0.35 mJy, equivalent to a disk mass of 4
× 10-5 M ⊙ for an M3 star. Our
sample was constructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or signs of accretion and have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher-order multiple systems observed, we detect λ = 1.3 mm continuum emission from one or more stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of Taurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected disks to over 75\% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and companions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the wealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to study the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample. While millimeter flux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we find that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations of 30-4200 au have lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar mass than single stars. We also find that for these systems, the circumstellar disk around the primary star does not dominate the total disk mass in the system and contains on average 62\% of the total mass.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the mass and age of young stars from their location in the H-R diagram are limited by not only the typical observational
uncertainties that apply to field stars, but also by large systematic uncertainties related to circumstellar phenomena. In this paper, we analyze flux-calibrated optical spectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 281 nearby T Tauri stars (TTSs). The primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a simplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinction measurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) the uniform analysis of a large sample of stars, many of which are well known and can serve as benchmarks. Comparisons between the non-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are used to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. Differences between spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when accounting for accretion and extinction. The spectral types measured here are mostly consistent with spectral types measured over the past decade. However, our new spectral types are one to two subclasses later than literature spectral types for the original members of the TW Hya Association (TWA) and are discrepant with literature values for some well-known members of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. Our extinction measurements are consistent with other optical extinction measurements but are typically 1 mag lower than near-IR measurements, likely the result of methodological differences and the presence of near-IR excesses in most CTTSs. As an illustration of the impact of accretion, spectral type, and extinction uncertainties on the H-R diagrams of young clusters, we find that the resulting luminosity spread of stars in the TWA is 15\%-30\%. The luminosity spread in the TWA and previously measured for binary stars in Taurus suggests that for a majority of stars, protostellar accretion rates are not large enough to significantly alter the subsequent evolution.},

asteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio
to allow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. We implement a
new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual
oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic
parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets.
Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar
properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent
(radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent
(distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star
sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental
parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar
abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller
than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties
with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising
from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per
cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and
age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium
abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical
uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this
parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions.
Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the
global average asteroseismic observables along with effective
temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing
to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high
signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the
Sun.},

Speed and direction of the relative motion are determined from the short observed arcs or known orbits, and their joint distribution is compared to the numerical simulations. By inverting the observed distribution with the help of simulations, we find that average eccentricity of wide binaries is 0.59 ± 0.02 and the eccentricity distribution can be modelled as f(e) ≈ 1.2e + 0.4. However, wide binaries containing inner subsystems, I.e. triple or higher order multiples, have
significantly smaller eccentricities with the average e = 0.52 ± 0.05 and the peak at e ∼ 0.5. We find that the catalogue of visual orbits is strongly biased against large eccentricities. A marginal evidence of eccentricity increasing with separation (or period) is found for this sample. Comparison with spectroscopic binaries proves the reality of the controversial period-eccentricity relation. The average eccentricity does increase with binary period, being 0.39 for periods from 102 to 103 d and 0.59 for the binaries studied here (105-106 d).},

Planets that orbit stars in young associations are particularly
important because the age of the planetary system is well constrained.
We present the discovery of a transiting planet larger than Neptune but
smaller than Saturn in the 45 Myr Tucana-Horologium young moving
group. The host star is a visual binary, and our follow-up observations
demonstrate that the planet orbits the G6V primary component, DS Tuc A
(HD 222259A, TIC 410214986). We first identified transits using
photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; alerted
as TOI 200.01). We validated the planet and improved the stellar
parameters using a suite of new and archival data, including spectra
from Southern Astrophysical Research/Goodman, South African Extremely
Large Telescope/High Resolution Spectrograph and Las Cumbres
Observatories/Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs; transit
photometry from Spitzer; and deep adaptive optics imaging from
Gemini/Gemini Planet Imager. No additional stellar or planetary signals
are seen in the data. We measured the planetary parameters by
simultaneously modeling the photometry with a transit model and a
Gaussian process to account for stellar variability. We determined that
the planetary radius is 5.70 ± 0.17 R ⊕ and that
the orbital period is 8.1 days. The inclination angles of the host
star’s spin axis, the planet’s orbital axis, and the visual
binary’s orbital axis are aligned within 15° to within the
uncertainties of the relevant data. DS Tuc Ab is bright enough (V = 8.5)

spectroscopy.},

stellar radii to 11\% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by
adding Gaia astrometry, the errors are now 3\%. Planet radius
measurements are, in turn, improved to 5\% precision. With a catalog of
∼1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the
gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small
planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous
study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally
under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden
planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is
partially filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the
distribution are a planet’s orbital distance and its host-star
mass, both of which are related to a planet’s X-ray/UV irradiation
history. For lower-mass stars, the bimodal planet distribution shifts to
smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars producing smaller planet
cores. Details of the size distribution including the extent of the
“sub-Neptune desert” and the width and slope of the gap

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the
first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data
Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second
data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1
in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the
apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3
billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition
available. The sample of sources for which variability information is
provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains
four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the
apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources;
median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for
between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar
effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity;
and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system
epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also
represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the
optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based
solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the
photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia
DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as
independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement
for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide
parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing
a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and
source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia
survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our
galaxy.},

	abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 provides high-precision astrometry and three-band photometry for about 1.3 billion sources over the full sky. The precision, accuracy, and homogeneity of both astrometry and
photometry are unprecedented. Aims: We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. Methods: We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and
kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD.
Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences,
highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.

	abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected from the Hipparcos catalog with π{\textgreater}40 mas,
σπ/π {\textless} 0.05, 0.5 {\textless}= B - V {\textless}= 1.0
({\textasciitilde}F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term "solar-type." New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common
proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56\% ± 2\%, 33\%
± 2\%, 8\% ± 1\%, and 3\% ± 1\%, respectively, counting
all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54\% ± 2\%, 34\% ± 2\%, 9\%
± 2\%, and 3\% ± 1\%, respectively. Our completeness analysis
indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% ± 2\%) of
solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V {\textless} 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] {\textless}-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4σ significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The
period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio
distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically
indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

	abstract = {Context. The Gaia satellite will observe about one billion stars and 
other point-like sources. The astrometric core solution will determine
the astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motion) for a
subset of these sources, using a global solution approach which must
also include a large number of parameters for the satellite attitude and
optical instrument. The accurate and efficient implementation of this
solution is an extremely demanding task, but crucial for the outcome of
the mission. Aims: We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of
the mathematical and physical models applicable to this solution, as
well as its numerical and algorithmic framework. Methods: The
astrometric core solution is a simultaneous least-squares estimation of
about half a billion parameters, including the astrometric parameters
for some 100 million well-behaved so-called primary sources. The global
nature of the solution requires an iterative approach, which can be
broken down into a small number of distinct processing blocks (source,
attitude, calibration and global updating) and auxiliary processes
(including the frame rotator and selection of primary sources). We
describe each of these processes in some detail, formulate the
underlying models, from which the observation equations are derived, and
outline the adopted numerical solution methods with due consideration of
robustness and the structure of the resulting system of equations.
Appendices provide brief introductions to some important mathematical
tools (quaternions and B-splines for the attitude representation, and a
modified Cholesky algorithm for positive semidefinite problems) and
discuss some complications expected in the real mission data. 
Results: A complete software system called AGIS (Astrometric Global
Iterative Solution) is being built according to the methods described in
the paper. Based on simulated data for 2 million primary sources we
present some initial results, demonstrating the basic mathematical and
numerical validity of the approach and, by a reasonable extrapolation,
its practical feasibility in terms of data management and computations
for the real mission.},

	abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {\textless} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding
uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1,
respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({\textless} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

	abstract = {The variability of young stellar objects is mostly driven by star-disk 
interactions. In long-term photometric monitoring of the accreting T
Tauri star GI Tau, we detect extinction events with typical depths of
\{\{Δ \}\}V∼ 2.5 mag that last for days to months and often appear
to occur stochastically. In 2014-2015, extinctions that repeated with a
quasi-period of 21 days over several months are the first empirical
evidence of slow warps predicted by magnetohydrodynamic simulations to
form at a few stellar radii away from the central star. The reddening is
consistent with \{R\}V=3.85+/- 0.5 and, along with an absence
of diffuse interstellar bands, indicates that some dust processing has
occurred in the disk. The 2015-2016 multiband light curve includes
variations in spot coverage, extinction, and accretion, each of which
results in different traces in color-magnitude diagrams. This light
curve is initially dominated by a month-long extinction event and a
return to the unocculted brightness. The subsequent light curve then
features spot modulation with a 7.03 day period, punctuated by brief,
randomly spaced extinction events. The accretion rate measured from
U-band photometry ranges from 1.3× \{10\}-8 to 1.1×
\{10\}-10 M ⊙ yr-1 (excluding the
highest and lowest 5\% of high- and low- accretion rate outliers), with
an average of 4.7 × \{10\}-9 M ⊙
yr-1. A total of 50\% of the mass is accreted during bursts of
{\textgreater} 12.8× \{10\}-9 M ⊙ yr\{\}-1,
which indicates limitations on analyses of disk evolution using
single-epoch accretion rates.},

In two-thirds of the cases the primary and secondary lie along the same isochrone to within the observational errors. However, real age differences appear for about one-third of our sample pairs-there is no set of nonintersecting theoretical isochrones that can make the primary and secondary have the same age for all pairs in our sample. In the cases where there are significant age differences between the component stars, the less massive star is usually younger than the more massive star. There is no correlation of the age differences with the presence or absence of accretion disks around the young stars. Hence, while disk accretion may affect the evolutionary tracks of the pre-main-sequence stars H-R diagram, we see no clear evidence of this effect among the pairs in our sample. The age differences also do not depend
systematically on the apparent separation, the mass ratio, or the ages of stars.},

sun. The total sample of 49 wide systems in these two regions conforms to only some expectations from field multiplicity surveys. Higher mass stars have a higher frequency of wide binary companions, and there is a marked paucity of wide binary systems near the substellar regime. However, the separation distribution appears to be log-flat, rather than declining as in the field, and the mass ratio distribution is more biased toward similar-mass companions than the initial mass function or the field G-dwarf distribution. The maximum separation also shows no evidence of a limit at lsim5000 AU until the abrupt cessation of any wide binary formation at system masses of {\textasciitilde}0.3 M sun. We attribute this result to the post-natal dynamical sculpting that occurs for most field systems; our binary systems will escape to the field intact, but most field stars are formed in denser clusters and undergo significant dynamical evolution. In summary, only wide binary systems with total masses lsim0.3 M sun appear to be

	abstract = {We report on a near-infrared adaptive optics survey of a sample of 66 
low-mass members of the pre-main sequence stellar cluster IC 348. We
find 12 binary systems in the separation range 0farcs1 -8'', excluding 3
probable background projected companions. An estimate of the number of
faint undetected companions is derived, before we evaluate the binary
frequency in this cluster. In the range log P= 5.0-7.9 days, the binary
fraction in IC 348 is 19+/-5\%. This is similar to the values
corresponding to G- and M-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood population
(23+/-3\% and {\textasciitilde} 18\%, respectively). Furthermore, the distribution of
orbital periods of IC 348 binaries in this range is consistent with that
of field binaries. We conclude that there is no binary excess in IC 348.
Substellar companions are found to be rare, or even missing, as
companions of low-mass stars in the separation range we surveyed. Also,
the mass ratio distribution is not peaked at q{\textasciitilde}1 in IC 348, and it is
unlikely that an observational bias can account for that. We do not find
any evidence for an evolution of the binary frequency with age within
the age spread of the cluster of about 10 Myr. Comparing the binary
frequency in IC 348 with that of other star forming regions (SFRs) and
young open clusters, we conclude that there is no significant temporal
evolution of the binary fraction between a few Myrs after the formation
process and the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) and field populations. We
find instead a trend for the binary fraction to be inversely correlated
with stellar density, with dense clusters having a binary fraction
similar to that of field dwarfs and loose associations exhibiting an
excess of binaries. Two scenarios can be suggested to explain these
differences: either all SFRs, clusters and associations alike, initially
host a large number of binaries, which is subsequently reduced only in
dense clusters on a timescale of less than 1 Myr due to numerous
gravitational encounters, or specific initial conditions in the parental
molecular clouds impact on the fragmentation process leading to
intrinsically different binary fractions from one SFR to the other.

	abstract = {This paper analyzes optical and infrared photometry of pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. More than half of the stars in our sample have excess near-infrared emission. The near-infrared excesses correlate very well with other measures of activity, such as Ho emission, ultraviolet excess emission, millimeter continuum emission, and the presence of reflection nebulae and molecular outflows. The infrared colors and the ratio of far-infrared to bolometric luminosity display a smooth progression from the most deeply embedded protostars to optically visible T Tauri stars. Infalling envelope models account for the colors of protostars; simple disk models similarly reproduce the colors of many T Tauri stars.

Both the stellar birth line and a l05 yr isochrone provide a reasonable upper envelope to the luminosity distribution of optically visible stars in the H-R diagram. Only a few stars in the cloud have apparent ages exceeding 2- 3 × 106 yr, as derived from detailed stellar evolution calculations. The distribution of stars in the H-R diagram indicates that the cloud has formed stars at a roughly constant rate for the past 1-2 × 106 yr. Analyses of
the J and K-luminosity functions support this conclusion. Within the uncertainties, the observed mass distribution for optically visible stars agrees with a Miller-Scalo initial mass function. Source
statistics imply a lifetime of 1-2 × l05 yr for the
typical protostar in Taurus-Auriga. There is no evidence, however, that these sources lie on the stellar birth line. Indeed, the protostellar luminosity function is essentially identical to the luminosity function derived for optically visible T Tauri stars in the cloud.

These results provide some support for the evolutionary
sequence-embedded protostar → T Tauri star with a circumstellar
disk → T Tauri star without a circumstellar disk-currently
envisioned in standard models of low-mass star formation. Source statistics and infrared color-color diagrams demonstrate that
pre-main-sequence stars develop bluer colors and display less evidence for circumstellar material with time. The data show little evidence, however, for the luminosity evolution expected along the proposed evolutionary sequence. Time-dependent accretion during the infall phase may account for the low luminosity of Taurus-Auriga protostars; this hypothesis requires more tests.},

binary cannot be directly measured because relative nodal angles are unknown, the near coincidence of i disk and i
⋆ suggests that θ is small for these most compact

coplanarity of CB planets discovered by Kepler, which in turn implies that the occurrence rate of close-in CB planets is similar to that around single stars. By contrast, at longer periods ranging from 30 to 105 days (where the nodal degeneracy can be broken via, e.g., binary astrometry), CB disks exhibit a wide range of mutual
inclinations, from coplanar to polar. Many of these long-period binaries are eccentric, as their component stars are too far separated to be tidally circularized. We discuss how theories of binary formation and disk-binary gravitational interactions can accommodate all these observations.},

provides precise masses without any assumptions about the primary star,
even though the observations typically cover only a small fraction of an
orbit. We also perform a uniform re-analysis of the host stars’
ages. Two of our objects, HD 4747B and HR 7672B, already have precise
dynamical masses near the stellar/substellar boundary and are used to
validate our approach. For Gl 758B, we obtain a mass of
m=\{37.9\}-1.5+1.4 \{M\}\{\{Jup\}\}, the most
precise mass measurement of this companion to date. Gl 758B is the
coldest brown dwarf with a dynamical mass, and the combination of our
low mass and slightly older host-star age resolves its previously noted
discrepancy with substellar evolutionary models. HD 68017B, a late
M-dwarf, has a mass of m = 0.149 ± 0.002 M ⊙,
consistent with stellar theory and previous empirical estimates based on
its absolute magnitude. The progenitor of the white dwarf Gl 86B has
been debated in the literature, and our dynamical measurement of m =
0.597 ± 0.010 M ⊙ is consistent with a higher
progenitor mass and younger age for this planet-hosting binary system.

This implies that small, including Earth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's history when metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of Kepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic thick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets with sizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We validate this system as a true five-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailed characterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysis of the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected solar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of 11.2 ± 1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when the universe was less than 20\% of its current age and making it the oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy. The age of Kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among the hosts to the first Galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint the beginning of the era of planet formation.},

	abstract = {Context. The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet 
candidates. Currently, some of them have already been discarded; more
than 200 have been confirmed by follow-up observations (most by radial
velocity and few by other methods), and several hundreds have been
validated. However, the large majority of the candidates are still
awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the probability
of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for subsequent
radial velocity observations. Aims: The motivation of this work
is to provide a set of isolated (good) host candidates to be further
tested by other techniques that allow confirmation of the planet. As a
complementary goal, we aim to identify close companions of the
candidates that could have contaminated the light curve of the planet
host due to the large pixel size of the Kepler CCD and its typical PSF
of around 6 arcsec. Both goals can also provide robust statistics about
the multiplicity of the Kepler hosts. Methods: We used the
AstraLux North instrument located at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar
Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain) to obtain diffraction-limited
images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. A sample of demoted Kepler
objects of interest (with rejected planet candidates) is used as a
control for comparison of multiplicity statistics. The lucky-imaging
technique used in this work is compared to other adaptive optics and
speckle imaging observations of Kepler planet host candidates. To that
end, we define a new parameter, the blended source confidence level
(BSC), to assess the probability of an object to have blended
non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the detected
transit. Results: We find that 67.2\% of the observed Kepler hosts
are isolated within our detectability limits, and 32.8\% have at least
one visual companion at angular separations below 6 arcsec. Indeed, we
find close companions (below 3 arcsec) for the 17.2\% of the sample. The
planet properties of this sample of non-isolated hosts are revised
according to the presence of such close companions. We report one
possible S-type binary (KOI-3158), where the five planet candidates
would orbit one of the components of the system. We also report three
possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01, 3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the
presence of close companions that modify candidate properties such that
they cannot be considered as planets anymore. The BSC parameter is
calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the value
prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations
from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample.

successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future

\{74\}-22+43 yr. The orbit is highly eccentric (e ≃ 0.84), shuttling the planet from within the orbit of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune. Our careful survey design enabled high cadence observations before, during, and after the planet’s
periastron passage, yielding precise orbital parameter constraints. We searched for stellar or planetary companions that could have excited the planet’s eccentricity, but found no candidates, potentially
implying that the perturber was ejected from the system. We did identify a bound stellar companion more than 15,000 au from the primary, but reasoned that it is currently too widely separated to have an
appreciable effect on HR 5183 b. Because HR 5183 b’s wide orbit
takes it more than 30 au (1″) from its star, we also explored the potential of complimentary studies with direct imaging or stellar astrometry. We found that a Gaia detection is very likely, and that imaging at 10 μm is a promising avenue. This discovery highlights the value of long-baseline RV surveys for discovering and characterizing long-period, eccentric Jovian planets.

orbital architectures of planet-hosting multiple star systems.
Kepler-444 is a metal-poor triple star system that hosts five
sub-Earth-sized planets orbiting the primary star (Kepler-444A), as well
as a spatially unresolved pair of M dwarfs (Kepler-444BC) at a projected
distance of 1.8'' (66 AU). We combine our
Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics astrometry with multi-epoch Keck/HIRES RVs of
all three stars to determine a precise orbit for the BC pair around A,
given their empirically constrained masses. We measure minimal
astrometric motion (1.0 ± 0.6 mas yr-1, or 0.17
± 0.10 km s-1), but our RVs reveal significant
orbital velocity (1.7 ± 0.2 km s-1) and
acceleration (7.8 ± 0.5 m s-1
yr-1). We determine a highly eccentric stellar orbit
(e=0.864+/- 0.023) that brings the tight M dwarf pair within
\{5.0\}-1.0+0.9 AU of the planetary system. We
validate that the system is dynamically stable in its present
configuration via n-body simulations. We find that the A-BC orbit
and planetary orbits are likely aligned (98\%) given that they both have
edge-on orbits and misalignment induces precession of the planets out of
transit. We conclude that the stars were likely on their current orbits
during the epoch of planet formation, truncating the protoplanetary disk
at ≈2 AU. This truncated disk would have been severely depleted of
solid material from which to form the total ≈1.5 M⊕
of planets. We thereby strongly constrain the efficiency of the
conversion of dust into planets and suggest that the Kepler-444 system
is consistent with models that explain the formation of most close-in
Kepler planets in more typical, not truncated, disks.

system being coeval at 80.8 ± 2.5 Myr, according to BHAC15
evolutionary models. The presence of lithium is consistent with model
predictions, marking the first test of the theoretical lithium depletion
boundary using ultracool dwarfs of known mass. However, we find that the
evolutionary model-derived average effective temperature (2950 ±
5 K) is 180 K hotter than that given by a spectral
type-\{T\}\{eff\} relation based on BT-Settl models (2770
± 100 K). We suggest that the dominant source of this discrepancy
is model radii being too small by ≈13\%. In a test mimicking the
typical application of models by observers, we derive masses on the H-R
diagram using luminosity and BT-Settl temperature. The estimated masses
are lower by \{46\}-19+16 \% (2.0σ) than we
measure dynamically and would imply that this is a system of ≈50 M
Jup brown dwarfs, highlighting the large systematic errors
possible in H-R diagram properties. This is the first time masses have
been measured for ultracool (≥M6) dwarfs displaying spectral
signatures of low gravity. Based on features in the infrared, LSPM
J1314+1320AB appears to have higher gravity than typical Pleiades and AB
Dor members, opposite the expectation given its younger age. The

and Hubble Space Telescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic distances for all systems, robust orbit
determinations for 23 systems, and photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise individual masses spanning 30-115 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\}. We determine a model-independent substellar boundary that is ≈70 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\} in mass (≈L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\} at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the substellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only the Saumon \& Marley “hybrid” models accounting for cloud
clearing match our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K.
Our masses enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and 30-70
\{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\}. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully considering biases and
completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries, possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks. Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

moving group member 2MASS J02495639-0557352 (M6 VL-G) using
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/WIRCam astrometry from the
Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program. In addition, Keck laser guide star
adaptive optics aperture-masking interferometry shows that the host is
itself a tight binary. Altogether, 2MASS J0249-0557ABc is a bound
triple system with an \{11.6\}-1.0+1.3
\{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\} object separated by 1950 ± 200 au (40″)
from a relatively close (2.17 ± 0.22 au, 0.″04) pair of
\{48\}-12+13 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\} and
\{44\}-11+14 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\} objects. 2MASS
J0249-0557AB is one of the few ultracool binaries to be discovered
in a young moving group and the first confirmed in the β Pic moving
group (22 ± 6 Myr). The mass, absolute magnitudes, and spectral
type of 2MASS J0249-0557 c (L2 VL-G) are remarkably similar to
those of the planet β Pic b (L2,
\{13.0\}-0.3+0.4 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\}). We also find
that the free-floating object 2MASS J2208+2921 (L3 VL-G) is another
possible β Pic moving group member with colors and absolute
magnitudes similar to β Pic b and 2MASS J0249-0557 c. β
Pic b is the first directly imaged planet to have a “twin,”
namely an object of comparable properties in the same stellar
association. Such directly imaged objects provide a unique opportunity
to measure atmospheric composition, variability, and rotation across
different pathways of assembling planetary-mass objects from the same
natal material.},

Pic b (13 ± 3 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\}) in a comprehensive joint orbit analysis that includes published relative astrometry and radial
velocities. Our mass uncertainty is somewhat higher than previous work because our astrometry from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of
Accelerations accounts for the error inflation and systematic terms that are required to bring the two data sets onto a common astrometric reference frame, and because we fit freely for the host-star mass (1.84 ± 0.05 M ⊙). This first model-independent mass for
a directly imaged planet is inconsistent with cold-start models given the age of the β Pic moving group (22 ± 6 Myr) but
consistent with hot- and warm-start models, concordant with past work. We find a higher eccentricity (0.24 ± 0.06) for β Pic b
compared to previous orbital fits. If confirmed by future observations, this eccentricity may help explain inner edge, scale height, and brightness asymmetry of β Pic’s disk. It could also
potentially signal that β Pic b has migrated inward to its current location, acquiring its eccentricity from interaction with the 3:1 outer Lindblad resonance in the disk.},

The final catalog adopts the reference frame of the second Gaia data release (DR2) and locally cross-calibrates both the scaled Hipparcos-Gaia DR2 positional
differences and the Hipparcos proper motions themselves to this frame. This gives three nearly independent proper motion measurements per star, with the scaled positional difference usually being the most precise. We find that a linear combination of the two Hipparcos reductions is superior to either reduction on its own and address error inflation for both Hipparcos and Gaia DR2. Our adopted error inflation is additive (in quadrature) for Hipparcos and multiplicative for Gaia. We provide the covariance matrices along with the central epochs of all measurements. Our final proper motion differences are accurately Gaussian with the appropriate variances and are suitable for acceleration measurements and orbit fitting. The catalog is constructed with an eye toward
completeness; it contains nearly 98\% of the Hipparcos stars. It also includes a handful of spurious entries and a few stars with poor Hipparcos reductions that the user must vet by hand. Statistical distributions of accelerations derived from this catalog should be interpreted with caution.},

low-metal F9 V star HD 114762, for which a possible substellar companion was reported by Latham et al. (1989). High-resolution spectroscopy is performed on HD 114762 in order to extract its projected rotational velocity (v sin i). This is then combined with an expected rotational velocity determined via age-scaling, providing an estimate of the star's equatorial inclination, which then combined with the results of the coplanarity study provides an approximate indication of the companion's orbital inclination. Although the formal uncertainties in this process preclude an accurate estimate of the companion's inclination, the results suggest that the inclination is low, possibly low enough to force the companion's mass above the limit for hydrogen fusion. It is thus possible the companion may be nothing more exotic than a low-mass M star, as opposed to a brown dwarf. These results add support to a similar conclusion recently obtained by Cochran et al. (1991).},

The MSC content and format are explained, and its incompleteness and strong observational selection are stressed. Nevertheless, the MSC can be used for statistical studies and is a valuable source for planning observations of multiple stars. Rare classes of stellar hierarchies found in the MSC (with six or seven components, extremely eccentric orbits, planar and possibly resonant orbits, hosting planets) are briefly presented. High-order hierarchies have smaller velocity dispersion compared to triples and are often associated with moving groups. The paper concludes with an analysis of the ratio of periods and separations between inner and outer subsystems. In wide hierarchies, the ratio of semimajor axes, estimated
statistically, is distributed between 3 and 300, with no evidence of dynamically unstable systems.},

However, wide binaries do not form or survive in dense clusters. Recent works on the separation distribution of young binaries,
summarized here, confirm these expectations. Alternative formation mechanisms of wide binaries, such as cluster dissolution or unfolding of triple stars, cannot explain the large observed fraction of young wide pairs, and therefore are not dominant.

A correlation between apparent revolution directions proves the partial orbit alignment known from earlier works. The alignment is strong in triples with outer projected separation less than ∼50 au, where the average Φ is about 20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ . In contrast,
outer orbits wider than 1000 au are not aligned with the inner orbits. It is established that the orbit alignment decreases with the increasing mass of the primary component. The average eccentricity of inner orbits in well-aligned triples is smaller than in randomly aligned ones. These findings highlight the role of dissipative interactions with gas in defining the orbital architecture of low-mass triple systems. On the other hand, chaotic dynamics apparently played a role in shaping more massive hierarchies. The analysis of projected configurations and triples with known inner and outer orbits indicates that the

stars’ properties. Our astrometry enables the identification of
wide stellar companions to the planet hosts. Within our limited sample,
all the multi-transiting planet hosts (three of three) appear to be
single stars, while nearly all (four of five) of the systems with a
single detected planet have wide stellar companions. By applying strict
priors on average stellar density from our updated radius and mass in
our transit fitting analysis, we measure the eccentricity probability
distributions for each transiting planet. Planets in single-star systems
tend to have smaller eccentricities than those in binaries, although
this difference is not significant in our small sample. In the case of
Kepler-42bcd, where the eccentricities are known to be ≃0, we
demonstrate that such systems can serve as powerful tests of M dwarf
evolutionary models by working in \{L\}{\textbackslash}star \{--\}\{\vphantom{\}}ρ
\vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}star space. The transit-fit density for Kepler-42bcd is
inconsistent with model predictions at 2.1σ (22\%), but matches
more empirical estimates at 0.2σ (2\%), consistent with earlier
results showing model radii of M dwarfs are underinflated. Gaia will
provide high-precision parallaxes for the entire Kepler M dwarf sample,
and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will identify more planets
transiting nearby, late-type stars, enabling significant improvements in
our understanding of the eccentricity distribution of small planets and
the parameters of late-type dwarfs.},

	abstract = {The mass-luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a 
critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing
need for both a higher-precision relation and a better understanding of
systematic effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical
relationship between \{M\}\{KS\} and M *
spanning 0.075 M ⊙ {\textless} M * {\textless} 0.70 M
⊙. The relation is derived from 62 nearby binaries, whose
orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival
adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital
parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a precision
better than 1\% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in
combination with resolved K S magnitudes and system
parallaxes, to calibrate the \{M\}\{KS\}-M
* relation. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine
masses of single stars with a precision of 2\%-3\%, which we confirm
by testing the relation on stars with individual dynamical masses from
the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit
relation beyond measured M * uncertainties, perhaps driven by
intrinsic variation in the \{M\}\{KS\}-M
* relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input
parallaxes. We find that the effect of [Fe/H] on the
\{M\}\{KS\}-M * relation is likely
negligible for metallicities in the solar neighborhood (0.0\% ±
2.2\% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). This weak effect is
consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution
Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar
Tracks (at 5σ). A sample of binaries with a wider range of
abundances will be required to discern the importance of metallicity in
extreme populations (e.g., in the Galactic halo or thick disk).},

confirmed the binarity of [BHS98] MHO 8 (hereafter MHO-Tau-8) and discovered a new candidate binary system, [SS94] V410 X-ray 3 (hereafter V410-Xray3), resulting in a binary fraction of
9+10-3\% at separations {\textgreater}4 AU. Both binary
systems are tight ({\textless}10 AU), and they possess mass ratios of 0.75 and 0.46, respectively. The binary frequency and separations are consistent with low-mass binary properties in the field, but the mass ratio of V410-Xray3 is among the lowest known. We find that the binary frequency is higher for very low mass stars and high-mass brown dwarfs than for lower mass brown dwarfs, implying either a decline in frequency or a shift to smaller separations for the lowest mass binaries. Combining these results with multiplicity statistics for higher mass Taurus members suggests a gradual decline in binary frequency and separation toward low masses. The implication is that the distinct binary
properties of very low-mass systems are set during formation and that the formation process is similar to the process that creates higher mass stellar binaries, but occurs on a smaller scale. We combine the survey detection limits with models for planetary-mass objects to show that there are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs with mass
{\textgreater}3MJ at projected separation {\textgreater}40 AU orbiting any of the Taurus members in our sample, implying that planetary-mass companions at wide separations are rare. Finally, based on fits to the optical and near-infrared spectral energy distributions, we identify several BDs with significant ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 mag) V-band excesses.

We conclude that both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also present high-resolution observations that show that the primary is itself a close binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the system would fall into the small class of young multiple systems that have unusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass. However, we demonstrate that physical association cannot be assumed purely on probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation range. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that there is a significant probability (25\%) that at least one pair of low-mass association members will be separated in projection by {\textless}{\textasciitilde}15", so analysis of the wide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all wide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at the 98\% confidence level.},

In this paper, we study the binary population of the Taurus-Auriga association, using the component positions in an HR diagram in order to quantify the frequency and degree of coevality in young binary systems. After identifying and rejecting the systems that are known to be affected by systematic errors (due to further multiplicity or
obscuration by circumstellar material), we find that the relative binary ages, {\textbar}Δlog τ{\textbar}, have an overall dispersion
σ{\textbar}Δlog τ{\textbar}{\textasciitilde} 0.40 dex. Random pairs of Taurus
members are coeval only to within σ{\textbar}Δlog τ{\textbar}{\textasciitilde}
0.58 dex, indicating that Taurus binaries are indeed more coeval than the association as a whole. However, the distribution of {\textbar}Δlog
τ{\textbar} suggests two populations, with {\textasciitilde}2/3 of the sample appearing
coeval to within the errors (σ{\textbar}Δlog τ{\textbar}{\textasciitilde} 0.16
dex) and the other {\textasciitilde}1/3 distributed in an extended tail reaching {\textbar}Δlog τ{\textbar}{\textasciitilde} 0.4-0.9 dex. To explain the finding of a multipeaked
distribution, we suggest that the tail of the differential age
distribution includes unrecognized hierarchical multiples, stars seen in scattered light, or stars with disk contamination; additional follow-up is required to rule out or correct for these explanations. The relative coevality of binary systems does not depend significantly on the system mass, mass ratio, or separation. Indeed, any pair of Taurus members wider than {\textasciitilde}10' ({\textasciitilde}0.7 pc) shows the full age spread of the association.},

The best method for constraining these properties, especially masses and radii, is to study eclipsing binary systems, but only a small number of late-type ({\textgreater}=M0) systems have been identified and well characterized to date. We present the discovery and characterization of six new M dwarf eclipsing binary systems. The 12 stars in these eclipsing systems have masses spanning 0.38-0.59 M sun and orbital periods of 0.6-1.7 days, with typical uncertainties of {\textasciitilde}0.3\% in mass and {\textasciitilde}0.5\%-2.0\% in radius. Combined with six known systems with high-precision measurements, our results reveal an intriguing trend in the low-mass regime. For stars with M= 0.35-0.80 M sun, components in short-period binary systems (Plsim1 day; 12 stars) have radii which are inflated by up to 10\% (μ = 4.8\% ± 1.0\%) with respect to evolutionary models for
low-mass main-sequence stars, whereas components in longer-period systems ({\textgreater}1.5 days; 12 stars) tend to have smaller radii (μ = 1.7\% ± 0.7\%). This trend supports the hypothesis that short-period
systems are inflated by the influence of the close companion, most likely because they are tidally locked into very high rotation speeds that enhance activity and inhibit convection. In summary, very close binary systems are not representative of typical M dwarfs, but our results for longer-period systems indicate that the evolutionary models are broadly valid in the M{\textasciitilde} 0.35-0.80 M sun regime.},

multiplicity suggests that fragmentation into a wide binary has no

again. The separation distribution for solar-type stars (0.7-2.5 M
sun) is nearly log-flat over separations of 3-5000 AU, but
lower-mass stars (0.25-0.7 M sun) show a paucity of binary
companions with separations of gsim200 AU. Across this full mass range,
companion masses are well described with a linear-flat function; all
system mass ratios (q = MB /MA ) are equally
probable, apparently including substellar companions. Our results are

These targets have been extremely elusive to date, with no exoplanets younger than 10-20 Myr and only a handful of direct-imaged exoplanets at all ages. We report the direct-imaging discovery of a likely (proto)planet around the young ({\textasciitilde}2 Myr) solar analog LkCa 15, located inside a known gap in the protoplanetary disk (a "transitional disk"). Our observations use non-redundant aperture masking
interferometry at three epochs to reveal a faint and relatively blue point source (M\_\{K{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\}=9.1 +/- 0.2, K' - L' = 0.98 ±
0.22), flanked by approximately co-orbital emission that is red and resolved into at least two sources (M\_\{L{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\}=7.5+/- 0.2, K' - L' = 2.7 ± 0.3; M\_\{L{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\}=7.4+/- 0.2, K' - L' = 1.94 ±
0.16). We propose that the most likely geometry consists of a newly formed (proto)planet that is surrounded by dusty material. The nominal estimated mass is {\textasciitilde}6 M Jup according to the 1 Myr hot-start models. However, we argue based on its luminosity, color, and the presence of circumplanetary material that the planet has likely been caught at its epoch of assembly, and hence this mass is an upper limit due to its extreme youth and flux contributed by accretion. The
projected separations (71.9 ± 1.6 mas, 100.7 ± 1.9 mas,
and 88.2 ± 1.8 mas) and deprojected orbital radii (16, 21, and 19 AU) correspond to the center of the disk gap, but are too close to the primary star for a circular orbit to account for the observed inner edge of the outer disk, so an alternative explanation (i.e., additional planets or an eccentric orbit) is likely required. This discovery is the first direct evidence that at least some transitional disks do indeed host newly formed (or forming) exoplanetary systems, and the observed properties provide crucial insight into the gas giant formation process.},

However, the majority of solar-type stars form in binary systems, so the impact of binary companions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understanding of planet formation. We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of Taurus-Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in order to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply that the tidal influence of a close (lsim40 AU) binary companion significantly hastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as {\textasciitilde}2/3 of all close binaries promptly disperse their disks within lsim1 Myr after formation. However, prompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and single stars, with {\textasciitilde}80\%-90\%
retaining their disks for at least {\textasciitilde}2-3 Myr (but rarely for more than {\textasciitilde}5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing timescale have
significant implications for giant planet formation; most single stars have 3-5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close binary systems would have to form giant planets within lsim1 Myr. If core accretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in close binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a similar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity in radial velocity (RV) surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is very well matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the disk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation.},

large-scale survey of multiplicity at the bottom of the initial mass function in several nearby young associations, encompassing 78 very low mass members observed with Keck laser guide star adaptive optics. Our survey confirms the overall trend observed in the field for lower-mass binary systems to be less frequent and more compact, including a null detection for any substellar binary systems with separations wider than {\textasciitilde}7 AU. Combined with a Bayesian re-analysis of existing surveys, our results demonstrate that the binary frequency and binary separations decline smoothly between masses of 0.5 M ⊙ and 0.02 M ⊙, though we cannot distinguish the functional form of this decline due to a degeneracy between the total binary frequency and the mean binary separation. We also show that the mass ratio
distribution becomes progressively more concentrated at q {\textasciitilde} 1 for declining masses, though a small number of systems appear to have unusually wide separations and low-mass ratios for their mass.

(Ophiuchus). All three wide planetary-mass companions (PMCs) were reported as candidate companions in previous binary survey programs, but then were neglected for {\textgreater}10 yr. We therefore obtained followup
observations that demonstrate that each candidate is comoving with its host star. Based on the absolute M\_\{K{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\} magnitudes, we infer masses (from hot-start evolutionary models) and projected separations of 10 ± 4 M Jup and 330 ± 30 AU for FW Tau b, 16
± 4 M Jup and 210 ± 20 AU for ROXs 12, and 10
± 4 M Jup and 140 ± 10 AU for ROXs 42B b. We
also present similar observations for 10 other candidates that show that they are unassociated field stars, as well as multicolor JHK'L'
near-infrared photometry for our new PMCs and for five previously identified substellar or planetary-mass companions. The near-infrared photometry for our sample of eight known and new companions generally parallels the properties of free-floating, low-mass brown dwarfs in these star-forming regions. However, five of the seven objects with M {\textless} 30 M Jup are redder in K' - L' than the distribution of young free-floating counterparts of similar J - K' color. We speculate that this distinction could indicate a structural difference in
circumplanetary disks, perhaps tied to higher disk mass since at least two of the objects in our sample are known to be accreting more
vigorously than typical free-floating counterparts.},

which much of astrophysics is built, but large swaths of model parameter
space remain uncalibrated by observations. The best calibrators are
eclipsing binaries in clusters, allowing measurement of masses, radii,
luminosities, and temperatures for stars of known metallicity and age.
We present the discovery and detailed characterization of
PTFEB132.707+19.810, a P = 6.0 day eclipsing binary in the Praesepe
cluster (τ ∼ 600-800 Myr [Fe/H] = 0.14 ± 0.04). The
system contains two late-type stars (SpT P = M3.5 ±
0.2; SpT S = M4.3 ± 0.7) with precise masses
(\{M\}p=0.3953+/- 0.0020 M ⊙
\{M\}s=0.2098 +/- 0.0014 M ⊙) and radii
(\{R\}p=0.363+/- 0.008 R ⊙
\{R\}s=0.272+/- 0.012 R ⊙). Neither star meets
the predictions of stellar evolutionary models. The primary has the
expected radius but is cooler and less luminous, while the secondary has
the expected luminosity but is cooler and substantially larger (by 20\%).
The system is not tidally locked or circularized. Exploiting a
fortuitous 4:5 commensurability between P orb and
\{P\}\{rot,\{prim\}\}, we demonstrate that fitting errors from the
unknown spot configuration only change the inferred radii by
≲1\%-2\%. We also analyze subsets of data to test the robustness of
radius measurements; the radius sum is more robust to systematic errors
and preferable for model comparisons. We also test plausible changes in
limb darkening and find corresponding uncertainties of ∼1\%. Finally,
we validate our pipeline using extant data for GU Boo, finding that our
independent results match previous radii to within the mutual
uncertainties (2\%-3\%). We therefore suggest that the substantial
discrepancies are astrophysical; since they are larger than those for
old field stars, they may be tied to the intermediate age of
PTFEB132.707+19.810.},

We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67\%. We have used radial velocities, Hα emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish
between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 in total and by a factor of {\textasciitilde}8 for members with SpT {\textgreater}= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (±5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity
distribution is very small, with a scatter of ±1.1 km
s-1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (τ {\textasciitilde} 20-30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr)
disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Hα emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F {\textless} 0.7\%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for
activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60\% of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77\% and purity of 78\%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield {\textgreater}95\% completeness for τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr populations with
GALEX data available.},

optical/near-infrared emission lines indicative of a primordial
accretion disk of gas and dust. The component-resolved 1.3 mm continuum emission is found to be associated only with the companion, with a flux (1.78 ± 0.03 mJy) that indicates a dust mass of 1-2 M

Near-infrared spectroscopy shows deep water bands that indicate a spectral type later than M5, but substantial veiling prevents a more accurate determination of the effective temperature (and hence mass).

system with both primary and secondary eclipses apparent in K2 light

\{R\}B=0.810+/- 0.006 \{R\}⊙ . The radii are
broadly consistent with pre-main-sequence ages predicted by stellar
evolutionary models, but none agree to within the uncertainties. All
models predict systematically incorrect masses at the 25\%-50\% level for
the HR diagram position of these mid-M dwarfs, suggesting significant
modifications to mass-dependent outcomes of star and planet formation.
The form of the discrepancy for most model sets is not that they predict
luminosities that are too low, but rather that they predict temperatures
that are too high, suggesting that the models do not fully encompass the
physics of energy transport (via convection and/or missing opacities)
and/or a miscalibration of the SpT-\{T\}\{eff\} scale. The
simplest modification to the models (changing \{T\}\{eff\} to
match observations) would yield an older age for this system, in line
with the recently proposed older age of Upper Scorpius (τ ∼ 11

high-resolution imaging of 382 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs)

interferometry on the Keck II telescope. Among the full sample of 506
candidate binary companions to KOIs, we super-resolve some binary
systems to projected separations of {\textless}5 au, showing that planets might
form in these dynamically active environments. However, the full
distribution of projected separations for our planet-host sample more
broadly reveals a deep paucity of binary companions at solar-system
scales. For a field binary population, we should have found 58 binary
companions with projected separation ρ {\textless} 50 au and mass ratio q
{\textgreater} 0.4 we instead only found 23 companions (a 4.6σ deficit),
many of which must be wider pairs that are only close in projection.

	abstract = {The census of Taurus–Auriga has been assembled over seven decades and inherited the biases and incompleteness of the input studies. The unusual shape of its inferred initial mass function (IMF) and the existence of isolated disk-bearing stars suggest that additional (likely disk-free) members remain to be discovered. We therefore have begun a global reassessment of the census of Taurus–Auriga that exploits new data and better definitions of youth and kinematic membership. As a first step, we reconsider the membership of all disk-free candidate members from the literature with spectral type ≥F0,
\{3\}\{\{h\}\}\{50\}\{\{m\}\}{\textless} α {\textless}
\{5\}\{\{h\}\}\{40\}\{\{m\}\}, and 14{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ {\textless} δ {\textless}

confirmed or likely Taurus members, 160 confirmed or likely interlopers, and only 18 that lack sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. A significant fraction of these stars (81/218 = 37\%) are not included in the most recent canonical member lists. There are few additional members to the immediate vicinity of the molecular clouds, preserving the IMFs that have been deemed anomalous in past work. Many of the likely Taurus members are instead distributed broadly across the search area. When combined with the known disk hosts, our updated census reveals two regimes: a high-density population with a high disk fraction (indicative of youth) that broadly traces the molecular clouds, and a low-density population with low disk fraction (hence likely older) that most likely represents previous generations of star formation.},

	abstract = {Methods. Orbiting secondary bodies inﬂuence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reﬂex motion. Using the Hipparcos and Gaia’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for 99\% of the Hipparcos catalog (≈117 000 stars).
Results. 30\% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3σ. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1−0.3 MJ to potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (Porb = 3 to 100 years). We conﬁrm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to α Cen. We recover the masses of the known companions of Eri, Ind, Ross 614 and β Pic. We also detect the signature of a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting τ Ceti.
Conclusions. Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the Hipparcos catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of σ(∆vT) = 1.0 m s−1 per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, Gaia’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.},

	abstract = {Aims.This paper describes a systematic search for high-order 
multiplicity among wide visual Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) binaries. 
Methods: .We conducted an Adaptive Optics survey of a sample of 58 PMS
wide binaries from various star-forming regions, which include 52 T
Tauri systems with mostly K- and M-type primaries, with the NIR
instrument NACO at the VLT. Results: .Of these 52 systems, 7 are
found to be triple (2 new) and 7 quadruple (1 new). The new close
companions are most likely physically bound based on their probability
of chance projection and, for some of them, on their position on a
color-color diagram. The corresponding degree of multiplicity among wide
binaries (number of triples and quadruples divided by the number of
systems) is 26.9 ± 7.2\% in the projected separation range {\textasciitilde}0.07
arcsec -12'', with the largest contribution from the Taurus-Auriga
cloud. We also found that this degree of multiplicity is twice in Taurus
compared to Ophiuchus and Chamaeleon for which the same number of
sources are present in our sample. Considering a restricted sample
composed of systems at distance 140-190 pc, the degree of multiplicity
is 26.8 ± 8.1\%, in the separation range 10/14 AU-1700/2300 AU (30
binaries, 5 triples, 6 quadruples). The observed frequency agrees with
results from previous multiplicity surveys within the uncertainties,
although a significant overabundance of quadruple systems compared to
triple systems is apparent. Tentatively including the spectroscopic
pairs in our restricted sample and comparing the multiplicity fractions
to those measured for solar-type main-sequence stars in the solar
neighborhood leads to the conclusion that both the ratio of triples to
binaries and the ratio of quadruples to triples seems to be in excess
among young stars. Most of the current numerical simulations of multiple
star formation, and especially smoothed particles hydrodynamics
simulations, over-predict the fraction of high-order multiplicity when
compared to our results. The circumstellar properties around the
individual components of our high-order multiple systems tend to favor
mixed systems (i.e. systems including components of wTTS and cTTS type),
which is in general agreement with previous studies of disks in
binaries, with the exception of Taurus, where we find a preponderance of
similar type of components among the multiples studied.},

	abstract = {Despite promising astrometric signals, to date there has been no success in direct imaging of a hypothesized third member of the Sirius system. Using the Clio instrument and MagAO adaptive optics system on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope, we have obtained extensive imagery of Sirius through a vector apodizing phase plate (vAPP) coronagraph in a narrowband filter at 3.9 microns. The vAPP coronagraph and MagAO allow us to be sensitive to planets much less massive than the limits set by previous non-detections. However, analysis of these data presents challenges due to the target’s brightness and unique characteristics of the instrument. We present a comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques to construct background illumination maps for the whole detector using the areas of the detector that are not dominated by starlight. Additionally, we describe a procedure for sub-pixel alignment of vAPP data using a physical-optics-based model of the coronagraphic PSF.},

	abstract = {We describe the photometric calibration and stellar classification methods used by the Stellar Classification Project to produce the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli \& Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2\%. We estimated stellar parameters \{T eff, log (g), log (Z), E B - V \} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram, in log (Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K {\textless}=T eff {\textless}= 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about ±200 K and 0.4 dex in
log (g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log (g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log (Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme T eff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for T eff {\textless}= 5400 K, comparison with
asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98\% confidence. Larger errors in log (g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

stellar multiple systems, the magnitude and (mis)alignment of angular

of the Gaia catalog can be exploited to enable comparison of binary
orbits with known planet or disk inclinations without costly long-term
astrometric campaigns. We show that Gaia astrometry can place meaningful
limits on orbital elements in cases with reliable astrometry, and
discuss metrics for assessing the reliability of Gaia DR2 solutions for
orbit fitting. We demonstrate our method by determining orbital elements
for three systems (DS Tuc AB, GK/GI Tau, and Kepler-25/KOI-1803) using
Gaia astrometry alone. We show that DS Tuc AB's orbit is nearly aligned
with the orbit of DS Tuc Ab, GK/GI Tau's orbit might be misaligned with
their respective protoplanetary disks, and the Kepler-25/KOI-1803 orbit
is not aligned with either component's transiting planetary system. We
also demonstrate cases where Gaia astrometry alone fails to provide
useful constraints on orbital elements. To enable broader application of
this technique, we introduce the python tool lofti\_gaiaDR2 to allow
users to easily determine orbital element posteriors.},

present astrometry for the wide planetary-mass companion GSC 6214-210 b
(240 au; ≈14 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\}) obtained using NIRC2 with adaptive
optics at the Keck telescope over 10 years. Our measurements achieved
astrometric uncertainties of ≈1 mas per epoch. We determined a
relative motion of 1.12 ± 0.15 mas yr-1 (0.61
± 0.09 km s-1), the first detection of orbital
motion for this companion. We compute the minimum periastron for the
companion due to our measured velocity vector and derive constraints on
the orbital parameters through our modified implementation of the Orbits
for the Impatient rejection sampling algorithm. We find that close
periastron orbits, which could indicate that the companion was
dynamically scattered, are present in our posterior but have low
likelihoods. For all orbits in our posterior, we assess the
detectability of close-in companions that could have scattered GSC
6214-210 b from a closer orbit, and find that most potential scatterers
would have been detected in previous imaging. We conclude that formation
at small orbital separation and subsequent dynamical scattering through
interaction with another potential close-in object is an unlikely
formation pathway for this companion. We also update stellar and
substellar properties for the system using the new parallax from Gaia

⊕ sub-Neptune with a period of P = 81.73778 ±
0.00013 days. It is the only known planet in the system. We collected radial velocity (RV) observations with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck I and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher in North hemisphere (HARPS-N) on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). We characterized stellar activity by a Gaussian process with a quasi-periodic kernel applied to our RV and cross-correlation function FWHM observations. By simultaneously modeling Kepler
photometry, RV, and FWHM observations, we found a semi-amplitude of K=\{1.68\}-0.38+0.39 m s-1 and a
planet mass of \{M\}p=\{10.6\}-2.4+2.5 M ⊕. Kepler-538b is the smallest planet beyond P = 50
days with an RV mass measurement. The planet likely consists of a significant fraction of ices (dominated by water ice), in addition to rocks/metals, and a small amount of gas. Sophisticated modeling
techniques such as those used in this paper, combined with future spectrographs with ultra high-precision and stability will be vital for yielding more mass measurements in this poorly understood exoplanet regime.

shown for other `dipper' stars, is likely due to occultation by
circumstellar dust. The barycentric space motion, lithium abundance,
rotation, and chromospheric emission of the stars in this system point
to an age of ≈125 Myr, and possible membership in the AB Doradus
moving group. As such it occupies an important but poorly explored
intermediate regime of stars with transient dimming between young
stellar objects in star-forming regions and main-sequence stars, and
between UX Orionis-type Ae/Be stars and M-type `dippers'. HD 240779, but
not its companion BD+10 714B, has Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer

of circumstellar dust. We propose that infrared emission is produced by
collisions of planetesimals during clearing of a residual disc at the
end of rocky planet formation, and that quasi-periodic dimming is
produced by the rapid disintegration of a ≳100 km planetesimal near
the silicate evaporation radius. Further studies of this and similar

corresponds to a separation of just 0.03 AU. This makes TOI-157 an interesting system, as the host star is an evolved G9 sub-giant star (V = 12.7). TOI-169b (TIC 183120439) is a bloated Jupiter orbiting a V = 12.4 G-type star. It has a mass of 0.79 ±0.06 MJ and a radius of 1.09-0.05+0.08RJ. Despite having the longest orbital period (P = 2.26 days) of the three planets, TOI-169b receives the most irradiation and is situated on the edge of the Neptune desert. All three host stars are metal rich with [Fe / H] ranging from 0.18 to0.24.},

We combine the subset of 279 PS1 SN Ia (\$0.03 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.68\$) with useful distance estimates of SN Ia from SDSS, SNLS, various low-z and HST samples to form the largest combined sample of SN Ia consisting of a total of 1048 SN Ia ranging from \$0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.3\$, which we call the `Pantheon Sample'. When combining Planck 2015 CMB measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m=0.307{\textbackslash}pm0.012\$ and \$w = -1.026{\textbackslash}pm0.041\$ for the wCDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: \$w0 = -1.007{\textbackslash}pm 0.089\$ and \$wa = -0.222 {\textbackslash}pm0.407\$ for the w0waCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of \$2{\textbackslash}times\$ in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample.

progenitor halo mass at z = 6 above a minimum halo mass for GC
formation. This model reproduces the observed
MGCs-Mhalo relation at z = 0 and results in a prediction for the minimum halo mass at z = 6 required for hosting one GC: Mmin(z = 6) = 1.07 × 109
M⊙. Translated to z = 0, the mean threshold mass is
Mhalo(z = 0) ≈ 2 × 1010
M⊙. I explore the observability of GCs in the
reionization era and their contribution to cosmic reionization, both of which depend sensitively on the (unknown) ratio of GC birth mass to present-day stellar mass, ξ. Based on current detections of z ≳
6 objects with M1500{\textless}-17, values of ξ {\textgreater} 10 are
strongly disfavoured; this, in turn, has potentially important
implications for GC formation scenarios. Even for low values of ξ, some observed high-z galaxies may actually be GCs, complicating
estimates of reionization-era galaxy ultraviolet luminosity functions and constraints on dark matter models. GCs are likely important
reionization sources if 5 ≲ ξ ≲ 10. I also explore
predictions for the fraction of accreted versus in situ GCs in the local Universe and for descendants of systems at the halo mass threshold of GC formation (dwarf galaxies). An appealing feature of the model presented here is the ability to make predictions for GC properties based solely on dark matter halo merger trees.},

Although statistical relations can be used to approximate how massive a
galaxy's halo is, very few individual galaxies have direct measurements
of their halo masses. We present a method to directly estimate the total
mass of a galaxy's dark halo using its system of globular clusters. The
link between globular cluster systems and halo masses is independent of
a galaxy's type and environment, in contrast to the relationship between
galaxy halo and stellar masses. This trend is expected in models where
globular clusters form in early, rare density peaks in the cold dark
matter density field and the epoch of reionization was roughly coeval
throughout the Universe. We illustrate the general utility of this
relation by demonstrating that a galaxy's supermassive black hole mass
and global X-ray luminosity are directly proportional to their host dark
halo masses, as inferred from our new method.},

radically unlike the strongly nonlinear behavior of total stellar mass M
⋆ versus M h . We discuss extensions of this

and (b) the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) recently discovered in Coma
and elsewhere. Our calibration of the ratio \{\vphantom{\}}η
\vphantom{\{}\}M=\{M\}\{GCS\}/\{M\}h from normal galaxies,
accounting for new revisions in the adopted mass-to-light ratio for GCs,
now gives \{η \}M=2.9× \{10\}-5 as the mean
absolute mass fraction. We find that the same ratio appears valid for
galaxy clusters and UDGs. Estimates of \{η \}M in the four
clusters we examine tend to be slightly higher than for individual
galaxies, but more data and better constraints on the mean GC mass in
such systems are needed to determine if this difference is significant.
We use the constancy of \{η \}M to estimate total masses
for several individual cases; for example, the total mass of the Milky
Way is calculated to be \{M\}h=1.1× \{10\}12
\{M\}⊙ . Physical explanations for the uniformity of
\{η \}M are still descriptive, but point to a picture in
which massive dense star clusters in their formation stages were
relatively immune to the feedback that more strongly influenced
lower-density regions where most stars form.},

(GC) system and the virial halo mass of the host galaxy. However, the
total halo mass in this correlation is a statistical measure conducted
on spatial scales that are some 10 times that of a typical GC system.
Here we investigate the connection between GC systems and galaxy's dark
matter on comparable spatial scales, using dynamical masses measured on
a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our sample consists of 17 well-studied massive
(∼1011 M⊙) early-type galaxies from the
SLUGGS survey. We find the strongest correlation to be that of the blue
(metal-poor) GC subpopulation and the dark matter content. This
correlation implies that the dark matter mass of a galaxy can be
estimated to within a factor of 2 from careful imaging of its GC system.
The ratio of the GC system mass to that of the enclosed dark matter is
nearly constant. We also find a strong correlation between the fraction
of blue GCs and the fraction of enclosed dark matter, so that a typical
galaxy with a blue GC fraction of 60 per cent has a dark matter fraction
of 86 per cent over similar spatial scales. Both halo growth and removal
(via tidal stripping) may play some role in shaping this trend. In the
context of the two-phase model for galaxy formation, we find galaxies
with the highest fractions of accreted stars to have higher dark matter
fractions for a given fraction of blue GCs.},

reveal a remarkable near-linear relation between their globular cluster

relation to the mass range of dwarf galaxies has been problematic due to
the difficulty in measuring independent halo masses. Here we derive new
halo masses based on stellar and H I gas kinematics for a sample of
nearby dwarf galaxies with GC systems. We find that the GC system
mass-halo mass relation for galaxies populated by GCs holds from halo
masses of M200 ∼ 1014 M⊙ down
to below M200 ∼109 M⊙, although
there is a substantial increase in scatter towards low masses. In
particular, three well-studied ultradiffuse galaxies, with dwarf-like
stellar masses, reveal a wide range in their GC-to-halo mass ratios. We
compare our GC system-halo mass relation to the recent model of El Badry
et al., finding that their fiducial model does not reproduce our data in
the low-mass regime. This may suggest that GC formation needs to be more
efficient than assumed in their model, or it may be due to the onset of
stochastic GC occupation in low-mass haloes. Finally, we briefly discuss
the stellar mass-halo mass relation for our low-mass galaxies with GCs,

be fruitful.},

We convert RUWE into the amplitude of the image centroid wobble, which, if scaled by the source distance, is proportional to the physical separation between companions (for periods up to several years). We test this idea on a sample of known spectroscopic binaries and demonstrate that the amplitude of the centroid perturbation scales with the binary period and the mass ratio as expected. We apply this technique to the Gaia DR2 data and show how the binary fraction evolves across the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. The observed incidence of unresolved companions is high for massive young stars and drops steadily with stellar mass, reaching its lowest levels for white dwarfs. We highlight the elevated binary fraction for the nearby blue stragglers and blue horizontal branch stars. We also illustrate how unresolved hierarchical triples inflate the relative velocity signal in wide binaries.

This study presents speckle observations of 57 Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) that are also double stars, each observed over a 3 to 8 year period, which has allowed us to track their relative motions with high precision. Measuring the position angle and separation of the companion with respect to the primary can help determine if the pair exhibits common proper motion, indicating it is likely to be a bound binary system. We report on the motions of 34 KOIs that have close stellar companions, three of which are triple stars, for a total of 37 companions studied. Eighteen of the 34 systems are confirmed exoplanet hosts, including one triple star, while four other systems have been subsequently judged to be false positives and twelve are yet to be confirmed as planet hosts. We find that 21 are most likely to be common proper motion pairs, 4 are line-of-sight companions, and 12 are of uncertain disposition at present. The fraction of the confirmed exoplanet host systems that are common proper motion pairs is approximately 86\% in this sample. In this subsample, the planets are exclusively found with periods of less than 110 days, so that in all cases the stellar companion is found at a much larger separation from the planet host star than the planet itself. A preliminary period-radius relation for the confirmed planets in our sample suggests no obvious differences at this stage with the full sample of known exoplanets.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the
uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

suggested by its current low peculiar velocity (Sellwood, J.A., Binney, J.J. [2002]. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 336, 785-796; Ro{\textbackslash}vskar, R., Debattista, V.P., Quinn, T.R., Stinson, G.S., Wadsley, J. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 684, L79-L82). In particular, the Sun may have radially migrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc (Ro{\textbackslash}vskar, R., Debattista, V.P., Quinn, T.R., Stinson, G.S., Wadsley, J. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 684, L79-L82). This has important ramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the Solar System may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were significantly different from its current local galactic environment. To characterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct numerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that end up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like disk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may belong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show that field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's extreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge sometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the chance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ∼20-30\% of the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find its median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained during the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar dependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar encounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of magnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that assumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material trapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits ( a {\textgreater} 20,000 AU) can be extremely low and may present difficulties for traditional models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet production.},

Methods: We numerically reproduced the temporal evolution of a sample of 3 ×
105 binary star systems disturbed by the Galactic potential and passing stars in an environment similar to the solar neighbourhood. Results: Our results show that the dynamical evolution of the population of wide binary stars with exoplanets in the solar
neighbourhood is modelled by the process of disruption of binary star systems induced by the Galaxy. We found that this process depends mainly on the separation between both stars, whereas it is almost independent of the initial orbital configuration. Moreover, our calculations are in agreement with the results of previous works regarding the indirect influence of the Galaxy on the stability of planetary systems in wide binary stars. However, the effects on the planetary region show a dependence on the initial configuration of binary stars. Finally, we obtain an indirect test of the impulse approximation model for dynamical studies of binary star systems.},

dynamics of well-detached binary star systems with a star separation
from 0.5 to 3 au, to determine the probability of the detection of such
variations with ground-based telescopes and space telescopes (like
former missions CoRoT and Kepler and future space missions Plato, Tess
and Cheops). For the chosen star separations both dynamical
configurations (circumstellar and circumbinary) may be observable. We
performed numerical simulations by using the full three-body problem as
dynamical model. The dynamical stability and the ETVs are investigated
by computing ETV maps for different masses of the secondary star and the
exoplanet (Earth, Neptune and Jupiter size). In addition we changed the
planet's and binary's eccentricities. We conclude that many amplitudes
of ETVs are large enough to detect exoplanets in binary-star systems. As
an application, we prepared statistics of the catalogue of exoplanets in
binary star systems which we introduce in this article and compared the
statistics with our parameter-space which we used for our calculations.
In addition to these statistics of the catalogue we enlarged them by the
investigation of well-detached binary star systems from several

In this study we investigate a five-dimensional parameter space for wide binary stars with a massive planet beyond the habitable zone (HZ). Our aim is to reveal those orbital and physical parameter combinations that expose bodies in the primary star’s HZ to secular perturbations. Building on an established semianalytical model, we combine two separate analytical models into a new one to treat the restricted four-body problem. We apply this new Combined Analytical Model (CAM) to different synthetic systems and systematically map the occurrence of secular resonances (SRs). These maps are then visualized as two-dimensional sections of the parameter space. The CAM model has a median error below 3\% relative to numerical reference simulations. We also derive a simplified CAM that performs well for hierarchical systems with moderate to large separations between the bodies. Our results show that SRs appear in the HZ even for large secondary-star distances (up to {\textgreater}1000 au) if either (i) the planet’s distance is larger than Jupiter’s or (ii) its mass is about Saturn’s or lower. Changes in the secondary star’s eccentricity by stellar flybys or galactic tides can push a formerly dynamically quiet HZ to a high-eccentricity state. Based on these results, we provide the easy-to-use online tool “SHaDoS” that evaluates the CAM for a given user input and traces the locations of SRs in the HZ in two-dimensional parameter space plots.},

	abstract = {The high eccentricities of the known extrasolar planets remain largely unexplained. We explore the possibility that eccentricities are excited in the outer parts of an extended planetary disk by encounters with stars passing at a few hundred astronomical units. After the encounter, eccentricity disturbances propagate inward because of secular
interactions in the disks, eventually exciting the innermost planets. We study how the inward propagation of eccentricity in planetary disks depends on the number and masses of the planets and the spacing between them and on the overall surface density distribution in the disk. The main governing factors are the large-scale surface density distribution and the total size of the system. If the smeared-out surface density is approximated by a power law Σ(r){\textasciitilde}r-q, then eccentricity disturbances propagate inward efficiently for flat density distributions with q{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. If this condition is satisfied and the size of the
planetary system is 50 AU or larger, the typical eccentricities excited by this mechanism by field star encounters in the solar neighborhood over 5 Gyr are in the range 0.01-0.1. Higher eccentricities ({\textgreater}0.1) may be excited in planetary systems around stars that are formed in relatively dense, long-lived open clusters. Therefore, this mechanism may provide a natural way to excite the eccentricities of extrasolar planets.},

Unlike their tighter counterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries continually change under the influence of the Milky Way's tidal field and impulses from other passing stars. Here we report numerical simulations demonstrating that the variable nature of wide binary star orbits dramatically reshapes the planetary systems they host, typically billions of years after formation. Contrary to previous understanding, wide binary companions may often strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetary ejections and increasing the orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. Although hitherto not recognized, orbits of giant exoplanets within wide binaries are statistically more eccentric than those around isolated stars. Both eccentricity distributions are well reproduced when we assume that isolated stars and wide binaries host similar planetary systems whose outermost giant planets are scattered beyond about 10 AU from their parent stars by early internal
instabilities. Consequently, our results suggest that although wide binaries eventually remove the most distant planets from many planetary systems, most isolated giant exoplanet systems harbour additional distant, still undetected planets.},

In this range of mass and orbital separation, HIP 75056Ab is likely at the low-mass end of the distribution of companions formed via disk instability, although a formation of the companion via core accretion cannot be excluded. The orbital constraints are consistent with the modest eccentricity values predicted by disk instability, a scenario that can be confirmed by further astrometric monitoring. HIP 75056Ab may be utilized as a low-mass atmospheric comparison to older, higher-mass brown dwarfs, and also to young giant planets. Finally, the detection of HIP 75056Ab at 0.125 arcsec represents a milestone in detecting low-mass companions at separations corresponding to the habitable zones of nearby Sun-like stars.},

	abstract = {Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the Solar System1, most of which orbit stars that will eventually evolve into red giants and then into white dwarfs. During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will be engulfed by the star2, but more distant planets can survive this phase and remain in orbit around the white dwarf3,4. Some white dwarfs show evidence for rocky material floating in their atmospheres5, in warm debris disks6–9 or orbiting very closely10–12, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that were scattered inwards and tidally disrupted13. Recently, the discovery of a gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to that of ice giant planets14 demonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether these planets can survive the journey. So far, no intact planets have been detected in close orbits around white dwarfs. Here we report the observation of a giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4 days. We observed and modelled the periodic dimming of the white dwarf caused by the planet candidate passing in front of the star in its orbit. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more than 14 times as massive (with 95 per cent confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence of common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during the red giant phase and shrinks owing to friction. In this case, however, the long orbital period (compared with other white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions) and low mass of the planet candidate make common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, our findings for the WD 1856+534 system indicate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being tidally disrupted, motivating the search for smaller transiting planets around white dwarfs.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a massive accreting gap (MAG) planet model that ensures large gaps in transitional disks are kept dust free by the scattering action of three co-planar quasi-circular planets in a 1:2:4 Mean Motion Resonance (MMR). This model uses the constraint of the observed gap size, and the dust-free nature of the gap, to determine within {\textasciitilde}10\% the possible orbits for 3 massive planets in an MMR. Calculated orbits are consistent with the observed orbits and H-alpha emission (the brightest line to observe these planets) for LkCa 15 b and PDS 70 b and PDS 70 c within observational errors. Moreover, the model suggests that the scarcity of detected H-alpha planets is likely a selection effect of the current limitations of non-coronagraphic, low ({\textless}10\%) Strehl, H-alpha imaging with Adaptive Optics (AO) systems used in past H-alpha surveys. We predict that as higher Strehl AO systems (with high-performance custom coronagraphs; like 6.5-m Magellan Telescope MagAO-X system) are utilized at H-alpha the number of detected gap planets will substantially increase by more than tenfold. For example, we show that {\textgreater}25 new H-alpha "gap planets" are potentially discoverable by a survey of the best 19 transitional disks with MagAO-X. Detections of these accreting protoplanets will significantly improve our understanding of planet formation, planet growth and accretion, solar system architectures, and planet disk interactions.},

The dipping activity of the star, discovered during the Kepler mission, presents deep, asymmetric, and aperiodic events. Here we present high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up during some dimming events recorded post-Kepler observations, from ground-based telescopes. We analyse data from the HERMES, HARPS-N, and FIES
spectrographs to characterize the stellar atmosphere and to put some constraints on the hypotheses that have appeared in the literature concerning the occulting elements. The star's magnetism, if existing, is not extreme. The spots on the surface, if present, would occupy 0.02 per cent of the area, at most. The chromosphere, irrespective of the epoch of observation, is hotter than the values expected from radiative equilibrium, meaning that the star has some degree of activity. We find no clear evidence of the interstellar medium or exocoments being responsible for the dimmings of the light curve. However, we detect at 1-2σ level, a decrease of the radial velocity of the star during the first dip recorded after the Kepler observations. We claim the presence of an optically thick object with likely inclined and high impact parameter orbits that produces the observed Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.},

	abstract = {Over the duration of the Kepler mission, KIC 8462852 was observed to undergo irregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux of up to ∼20 per cent. The dipping activity can last for between 5 and 80 d. We
characterize the object with high-resolution spectroscopy, spectral energy distribution fitting, radial velocity measurements,
high-resolution imaging, and Fourier analyses of the Kepler light curve. We determine that KIC 8462852 is a typical main-sequence F3 V star that exhibits no significant IR excess, and has no very close interacting companions. In this paper, we describe various scenarios to explain the dipping events observed in the Kepler light curve. We confirm that the dipping signals in the data are not caused by any instrumental or data processing artefact, and thus are astrophysical in origin. We construct scenario-independent constraints on the size and location of a body in the system that are needed to reproduce the observations. We deliberate over several assorted stellar and circumstellar astrophysical scenarios, most of which have problems explaining the data in hand. By considering the observational constraints on dust clumps in orbit around a normal main-sequence star, we conclude that the scenario most consistent with the data in hand is the passage of a family of exocomet or planetesimal fragments, all of which are associated with a single previous break-up event, possibly caused by tidal disruption or thermal processing. The minimum total mass associated with these fragments likely exceeds 10-6 M⊕, corresponding to an original rocky body of {\textgreater}100 km in diameter. We discuss the necessity of future
observations to help interpret the system.},

Based on these new measurements, we perform a joint orbit fit to the available relative astrometry from ground-based imaging, the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD), and the Gaia DR2 position, and demonstrate how to incorporate the IAD into direct imaging orbit fits. We find a mass consistent with predictions of hot-start evolutionary models and previous works following similar methods, though with larger uncertainties: 12.8+5.3 −3.2 M Jup. Our eccentricity determination of disfavors circular orbits. We consider orbit fits to several different imaging data sets, and find generally similar posteriors on the mass for each combination of imaging data. Our analysis underscores the importance of performing joint fits to the absolute and relative astrometry simultaneously, given the strong covariance between orbital elements. Time of conjunction is well-constrained within 2.8 days of 2017 September 13, with the star behind the planet’s Hill sphere between 2017 April 11 and 2018 February 16 (±18 days). Following the recent radial velocity detection of a second planet in the system, β Pic c, we perform additional two-planet fits combining relative astrometry, absolute astrometry, and stellar radial velocities. These joint fits find a significantly smaller mass (8.0 ± 2.6 M Jup) for the imaged planet β Pic b, in a somewhat more circular orbit. We expect future ground-based observations to further constrain the visual orbit and mass of the planet in advance of the release of Gaia DR4.},

	abstract = {Context. Since 1998, a planet-search around main sequence stars within 50{\textasciitilde}pc in the southern hemisphere has been carried out with the CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory. Aims. With an observing time span of more than 20 years, the CORALIE survey is able to detect long term trends in data with masses and separations large enough to select ideal targets for direct imaging. Detecting these giant companion candidates will allow us to start bridging the gap between radial velocity detected exoplanets and directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs. Methods. Long-term precise Doppler measurements with the CORALIE spectrograph reveal radial velocity signatures of massive planetary companions and brown dwarfs on long-period orbits. Results. In this paper we report the discovery of new companions orbiting HD{\textasciitilde}181234, HD{\textasciitilde}13724, HD{\textasciitilde}25015, HD{\textasciitilde}92987 and HD{\textasciitilde}50499. We also report updated orbital parameters for HD{\textasciitilde}50499b, HD{\textasciitilde}92788b and HD{\textasciitilde}98649b. In addition, we confirm the recent detection of HD{\textasciitilde}92788c. The newly reported companions span a period range of 15.6 to 40.4 years and a mass domain of 2.93 to 26.77 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\}\$, the latter of which straddles the nominal boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. Conclusion. We have reported the detection of five new companions and updated parameters of four known extrasolar planets.

After marginalizing over the starlight model, we infer the barycentric RV of HR 8799 b and c in 2010 yielding -9.2 +- 0.5 km/s and -11.6 +- 0.5 km/s respectively. These RV measurements help to constrain the 3D orientation of the orbit of the planet by resolving the degeneracy in the longitude of ascending node. Assuming coplanar orbits for HR 8799 b and c, but not including d and e, we estimate {\textbackslash}Omega = 89 (+27,-17) deg and i = 20.8 (4.5,-3.7) deg.},

	abstract = {Even though tens of directly imaged companions have been discovered in the past decades, the number of directly confirmed multiplanet systems is still small. Dynamical analysis of these systems imposes important constraints on formation mechanisms of these wide-orbit companions. As part of the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES) we report the detection of a second planetary-mass companion around the 17 Myr-old, solar-type star TYC 8998-760-1 that is located in the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. The companion has a projected physical separation of 320 au and several individual photometric measurements from 1.1 to 3.8 microns constrain a companion mass of \$6{\textbackslash}pm1{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\$, which is equivalent to a mass ratio of \$q=0.57{\textbackslash}pm0.10{\textbackslash}\%\$ with respect to the primary. With the previously detected \$14{\textbackslash}pm3{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\$ companion that is orbiting the primary at 160 au, TYC 8998-760-1 is the first directly imaged multiplanet system that is detected around a young, solar analog. We show that circular orbits are stable, but that mildly eccentric orbits for either/both components (\$e {\textgreater} 0.1\$) are chaotic on Gyr timescales, implying in-situ formation or a very specific ejection by an unseen third companion. Due to the wide separations of the companions TYC 8998-760-1 is an excellent system for spectroscopic and photometric follow-up with space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {Saturn’s moon Titan is the only extraterrestrial body known to host stable lakes and a hydrological cycle. Titan’s lakes predominantly contain liquid methane, ethane, and nitrogen, with methane evaporation driving its hydrological cycle. Molecular interactions between these three species lead to nonideal behavior that causes Titan’s lakes to behave differently than Earth’s lakes. Here, we numerically investigate how methane evaporation and nonideal interactions affect the physical properties, structure, dynamics, and evolution of shallow lakes on Titan. We ﬁnd that, under certain temperature regimes, methane-rich mixtures are denser than relatively ethane-rich mixtures. This allows methane evaporation to stratify Titan’s lakes into ethane-rich upper layers and methane-rich lower layers, separated by a strong compositional gradient. At temperatures above 86 K, lakes remain well mixed and unstratiﬁed. Between 84 and 86 K, lakes can stratify episodically. Below 84 K, lakes permanently stratify and develop very methane-depleted epilimnia. Despite small seasonal and diurnal deviations ({\textless}5 K) from typical surface temperatures, Titan’s rain-ﬁlled ephemeral lakes and “phantom lakes” may nevertheless experience signiﬁcantly larger temperature ﬂuctuations, resulting in polymictic or even meromictic stratiﬁcation, which may trigger ethane ice precipitation.},

We use Gaia DR2 and Hipparcos astrometry to derive the star's velocity caused by the orbiting planets and constrain the cold Jupiter's sky-projected inclination (\$I\_b=41-65{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$). From this we derive the mutual inclination (\${\textbackslash}Delta I\$) between the two planets, and find that \$49{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textless} {\textbackslash}Delta I {\textless} 131{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ (1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), and \$28{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} {\textless} {\textbackslash}Delta I {\textless} 152{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ (2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). We examine the dynamics of the system using \$N\$-body simulations, and find that potentially large oscillations in the super Earth's eccentricity and inclination are suppressed by General Relativistic precession. However, nodal precession of the inner orbit around the invariable plane causes the super Earth to only transit between 7-22 per cent of the time, and to usually be observed as misaligned with the stellar spin axis. We repeat our analysis for HAT-P-11, finding a large \${\textbackslash}Delta I\$ between its close-in Neptune and cold Jupiter and similar dynamics. \${\textbackslash}pi\$ Men and HAT-P-11 are prime examples of systems where dynamically hot outer planets excite their inner planets, with the effects of increasing planet eccentricities, planet-star misalignments, and potentially reducing the transit multiplicity. Formation of such systems likely involves scattering between multiple giant planets or misaligned protoplanetary discs. Future imaging of the faint debris disc in \${\textbackslash}pi\$ Men and precise constraints on the stellar spin orientation would provide strong tests for these formation scenarios.},

inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity

stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is
done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of
Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The
irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the
lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although
more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using
additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely
geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the
physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual
stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it

	abstract = {A crucial diagnostic that can tell us about processes involved in the formation and dynamical evolutionof planetary systems is the angle between the rotation axis of a star and a planet's orbital angular momentum vector ("spin-orbit" alignment or "obliquity"). Here we present the first spin-orbit alignment measurement for a wide-separation exoplanetary system, namely on the directly-imaged planet \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris b. We use VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-interferometry with an astrometric accuracy of 1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$as (microarcsecond) in the Br\${\textbackslash}gamma\$ photospheric absorption line to measure the photocenter displacement associated with the stellar rotation. Taking inclination constraints from astroseismology into account, we constrain the 3-dimensional orientation of the stellar spin axis and find that \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b orbits its host star on a prograde orbit. The angular momentum vectors of the stellar photosphere, the planet, and the outer debris disk are well-aligned with mutual inclinations \${\textless}3{\textbackslash}pm5{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, which indicates that \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b formed in a system without significant primordial misalignments. Our results demonstrate the potential of infrared interferometry to measure the spin-orbit alignment for wide-separation planetary systems, probing a highly complementary regime to the parameter space accessible with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. If the low obliquity is confirmed by measurements on a larger sample of wide-separation planets, it would lend support to theories that explain the obliquity in Hot Jupiter systems with dynamical scattering and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06679},
	abstract = {The population statistics of binary stars are an important output of star formation models. However populations of wide binaries evolve over time due to interactions within a system's birth environment and the unfolding of wide, hierarchical triple systems. Hence the wide binary populations observed in star forming regions or OB associations may not accurately reflect the wide binary populations that will eventually reach the field. We use Gaia DR2 data to select members of three open clusters, Alpha{\textasciitilde}Per, the Pleiades and Praesepe and to flag cluster members that are likely unresolved binaries due to overluminosity or elevated astrometric noise. We then identify the resolved wide binary population in each cluster, separating it from coincident pairings of unrelated cluster members. We find that these clusters have an average wide binary fraction in the 300-3000{\textbackslash},AU projected separation range of 2.1\${\textbackslash}pm{\textasciicircum}\{0.4\}\_\{0.2\}\${\textbackslash}\% increasing to 3.0\${\textbackslash}pm{\textasciicircum}\{0.8\}\_\{0.7\}\${\textbackslash}\% for primaries with masses in the 0.5-1.5{\textbackslash},\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ range. This is significantly below the observed field wide binary fraction, but shows some wide binaries survive in these dynamically highly processed environments. We compare our results with another open cluster (the Hyades) and two populations of young stars that likely originated in looser associations (Young Moving Groups and the Pisces-Eridanus stream). We find that the Hyades also has a deficit of wide binaries while the products of looser associations have wide binary fractions at or above field level.},

	abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an
altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor {\textasciitilde}5 for each image subtraction. The
combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5 σ contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 8". For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for
{\textasciitilde}1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.

	abstract = {We have searched the Kepler light curves of {\textasciitilde}3900 M-star targets for 
evidence of periodicities that indicate, by means of the effects of
starspots, rapid stellar rotation. Several analysis techniques,
including Fourier transforms, inspection of folded light curves,
"sonograms," and phase tracking of individual modulation cycles, were
applied in order to distinguish the periodicities due to rapid rotation
from those due to stellar pulsations, eclipsing binaries, or transiting
planets. We find 178 Kepler M-star targets with rotation periods, P
rot, of {\textless}2 days, and 110 with P rot {\textless} 1 day.
Some 30 of the 178 systems exhibit two or more independent short periods
within the same Kepler photometric aperture, while several have 3 or
more short periods. Adaptive optics imaging and modeling of the Kepler
pixel response function for a subset of our sample support the
conclusion that the targets with multiple periods are highly likely to
be relatively young physical binary, triple, and even quadruple M star
systems. We explore in detail the one object with four incommensurate
periods all less than 1.2 days, and show that two of the periods arise
from one of a close pair of stars, while the other two arise from the
second star, which itself is probably a visual binary. If most of these
M-star systems with multiple periods turn out to be bound M stars, this
could prove a valuable way discovering young hierarchical M-star
systems; the same approach may also be applicable to G and K stars. The
{\textasciitilde}5\% occurrence rate of rapid rotation among the {\textasciitilde}3900 M star targets is
consistent with spin evolution models that include an initial
contraction phase followed by magnetic braking, wherein a typical M star
can spend several hundred Myr before spinning down to periods longer
than 2 days.},

	abstract = {This paper shows how the dips and secular dimming in the KIC8462852 
light curve can originate in circumstellar material distributed around a
single elliptical orbit (e.g. exocomets). The expected thermal emission
and wavelength dependent dimming is derived for different orbital
parameters and geometries, including dust that is optically thick to
stellar radiation, and for a size distribution of dust with realistic
optical properties. We first consider dust distributed evenly around the
orbit, then show how to derive its uneven distribution from the optical
light curve and to predict light curves at different wavelengths. The
fractional luminosity of an even distribution is approximately the level
of dimming times stellar radius divided by distance from the star at
transit. Non-detection of dust thermal emission for KIC8462852 thus
provides a lower limit on the transit distance to complement the 0.6 au
upper limit imposed by 0.4 d dips. Unless the dust distribution is
optically thick, the putative 16 per cent century-long secular dimming
must have disappeared before the WISE 12 μm measurement in 2010, and
subsequent 4.5 μm observations require transits at {\textgreater}0.05 au.
However, self-absorption of thermal emission removes these constraints
for opaque dust distributions. The passage of dust clumps through
pericentre is predicted to cause infrared brightening lasting tens of
days and dimming during transit, such that total flux received decreases
at wavelengths {\textless}5 μm, but increases to potentially detectable
levels at longer wavelengths. We suggest that lower dimming levels than
seen for KIC8462852 are more common in the Galactic population and may
be detected in future transit surveys.},

	abstract = {First observed with the Kepler mission, KIC 8462852 undergoes unexplained dimming events, "dips," on the timescale of days which were again observed from the ground from May to December 2017. Monitored with multi-band photometry by the Los Cumbres Observatory, all four dips of the "Elsie dip family" display clear wavelength dependence. We measure how the wavelength dependence changes over the whole dimming event, including the dimming between the dips and the brightening event (the `blip') which occurs after the dips. We find that a single wavelength dependence does not fit the entire light curve and the dimming occurring between the dips is non-gray and varies in time. Because of the non-gray dimming between the dips, we measure the wavelength dependence of the dips separately and without the extra depth from this dimming. Such measurements yield a different estimate of the wavelength dependence the wavelength dependence of the dips but remains consistent with the previous measurement except for Elsie (the first dip), which is
surrounded by dimming with strong wavelength dependence. We find the range of the wavelength dependence variation of the entire 2017 light curve is consistent with optically-thin dust with an average radius of \$r{\textless}1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$m and the dust causing just the dips being
\$r{\textless}0.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$m. Since the dependence is time-dependent, the dust
occulting the star must be heterogeneous in size, composition, or both and the distributions of these properties along the line of sight must change over time.},

Our regular photometric surveillance started in 2015 October, and a sequence of dipping began in 2017 May continuing on through the end of 2017, when the star was no longer visible from Earth. We distinguish four main 1\%-2.5\% dips, named “Elsie,”
“Celeste,” “Skara Brae,” and
“Angkor,” which persist on timescales from several days to
weeks. Our main results so far are as follows: (i) there are no apparent changes of the stellar spectrum or polarization during the dips and (ii) the multiband photometry of the dips shows differential reddening favoring non-gray extinction. Therefore, our data are inconsistent with dip models that invoke optically thick material, but rather they are in-line with predictions for an occulter consisting primarily of ordinary dust, where much of the material must be optically thin with a size scale ≪1 μm, and may also be consistent with models invoking variations intrinsic to the stellar photosphere. Notably, our data do not place constraints on the color of the longer-term
“secular” dimming, which may be caused by independent
processes, or probe different regimes of a single process.},

Star), has been observed to exhibit two types of behavior unique among
known variable stars: infrequent episodes of small brightness dips and a
long-term decline in brightness between the dips. No satisfactory
mechanism has been found for this behavior, at least in part, because
there is only one known example. To begin to rectify this, we have
searched for other stars exhibiting similar dipping behavior using the
Northern Sky Variability Survey and have used data from the All Sky
Automated Survey for Supernovae to further investigate the behavior.
Twenty-one stars are identified as possible dippers. Fifteen may be
similar to Boyajian’s star and the other six are likely to be more
extreme examples of the same phenomenon. Using data from the Gaia Second
Data Release we show that the dipper candidates are located in two
restricted regions of the H-R diagram, near the main sequence with
masses near 1 solar mass and in the red giant region near the
evolutionary track for 2 solar mass stars. Stars in the former group are
considered to be likely analogs to Boyajian’s star and should be
studied in more detail to gain insights into the dipping phenomenon.},

Within the errors of our measurements, this star looks like a normal solar abundance main-sequence F1V to F3V dwarf star without any obvious traces of significant circumstellar dust or gas. Using Connelley \& Greene’s emission measures, we also see no evidence of significant ongoing accretion onto the star nor any stellar outflow away from it.

	abstract = {KIC 8462852 is a superficially ordinary main sequence F star for which Kepler detected an unusual series of brief dimming events. We obtain accurate relative photometry of KIC 8462852 from the Kepler full-frame images, finding that the brightness of KIC 8462852 monotonically decreased over the four years it was observed by Kepler. Over the first ∼1000 days KIC 8462852 faded approximately linearly at a rate of 0.341 ± 0.041\% yr-1, for a total decline of 0.9\%. KIC 8462852 then dimmed much more rapidly in the next ∼200 days, with its flux dropping by more than 2\%. For the final ∼200 days of Kepler photometry the magnitude remained approximately constant, although the data are also consistent with the decline rate measured for the first 2.7 years. Of a sample of 193 nearby comparison stars and 355 stars with similar stellar parameters, none exhibit the rapid decline by {\textgreater}2\% or the cumulative fading by 3\% of KIC 8462852. Moreover, of these
comparison stars, only one changes brightness as quickly as the 0.341\% yr-1 measured for KIC 8462852 during the first three years of the Kepler mission. We examine whether the rapid decline could be caused by a cloud of transiting circumstellar material, finding that while such a cloud could evade detection in submillimeter observations, the transit ingress and duration cannot be explained by a simple cloud model. Moreover, this model cannot account for the observed longer-term dimming. No known or proposed stellar phenomena can fully explain all aspects of the observed light curve.},

No significant emission is detected towards KIC 8462852. We determine upper limits for dust between a few
10-6 M⊕ and 10-3
M⊕ for regions identified as the most likely to host
occluding dust clumps and a total overall dust budget of {\textless}7.7
M⊕ within a radius of 200 au. Such low limits for the inner system make the catastrophic planetary disruption hypothesis unlikely. Integrating over the Kepler light curve we determine that at least 10-9 M⊕ of dust is required to cause the observed Q16 dip. This is consistent with the currently most favoured cometary breakup hypothesis, but nevertheless implies the complete breakup of ∼30 Comet 1/P Halley type objects.

transmission properties would distinguish them from exoplanets. We also
enumerate the natural sources of such signatures. Several anomalous
objects, such as KIC 12557548 and CoRoT-29, have variability in depth
consistent with Arnold’s prediction and/or an asymmetric shape
consistent with Forgan’s model. Since well-motivated physical
models have so far provided natural explanations for these signals, the
ETI hypothesis is not warranted for these objects, but they still serve
as useful examples of how non-standard transit signatures might be
identified and interpreted in a SETI context. Boyajian et al. recently
announced KIC 8462852, an object with a bizarre light curve consistent
with a “swarm” of megastructures. We suggest that this is an
outstanding SETI target. We develop the normalized information content
statistic M to quantify the information content in a signal embedded in
a discrete series of bounded measurements, such as variable transit
depths, and show that it can be used to distinguish among constant
sources, interstellar beacons, and naturally stochastic or artificial,
information-rich signals. We apply this formalism to KIC 12557548 and a
specific form of beacon suggested by Arnold to illustrate its utility.},

A single comet of similar size to those in our solar system produces a transit depth of the order of 10-3 lasting less than a day which is much smaller and shorter than the largest dip observed (∼ 20\% for ∼3
days), but a large, closely traveling cluster of comets can fit the observed depths and durations. We find that a series of large comet swarms, with all except one on the same orbit, provides a good fit for the KIC 8462852 data during Quarters 16 and 17, but does not explain the large dip observed during Quarter 8. However, the transit dips only loosely constrain the orbits and can be fit by swarms with periastrons differing by a factor of 10. To reach a transit depth of ∼0.2, the comets need to be in a close group of ∼30, if they are ∼100 km
in radius or in a group of ∼300 if they are ∼10 km in radius.
The total number of comets required to fit all of the dips is ∼70 ∼ 100 km or ∼700 ∼ 10 km comets. A single comet family from
a tidally disrupted Ceres-sized progenitor or the start of a Late Heavy Bombardment period explains the last ∼60 days of the unusual KIC 8462852 light curve.},

Recent results by Montet \& Simon lend strength and plausibility to the conclusion of Schaefer that in addition to short-term dimmings, the star also experiences large, secular decreases in brightness on decadal timescales. This, combined with a lack of long-wavelength excess in the star's spectral energy distribution, strongly constrains scenarios involving circumstellar material,
including hypotheses invoking a spherical cloud of artifacts. We show that the timings of the deepest dimmings appear consistent with being randomly distributed, and that the star's reddening and narrow sodium absorption is consistent with the total, long-term dimming observed. Following Montet \& Simon's encouragement to generate alternative hypotheses, we attempt to circumscribe the space of possible
explanations with a range of plausibilities, including: a cloud in the outer solar system, structure in the interstellar medium (ISM), natural and artificial material orbiting Boyajian's Star, an intervening object with a large disk, and variations in Boyajian's Star itself. We find the ISM and intervening disk models more plausible than the other natural models.},

types from the literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52 nearby
pre-MS stars with spectral types F3 through M4 using optical spectra
taken with the SMARTS 1.5 m telescope. Combining these new types with
published spectral types and photometry from the literature

colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectral types
and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We estimate effective
temperatures (T eff) and bolometric corrections (BCs) for our
pre-MS star sample through comparing their photometry to synthetic
photometry generated using the BT-Settl grid of model atmosphere
spectra. We derive a new T eff and BC scale for pre-MS stars,

often-adopted dwarf star scales. While our new T eff scale

It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum e ciency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modi ed and re ned and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems and the precision and accuracy of much broad and intermediate band photometry su ered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere uxes are now very realistic and synthetic photometry o ers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present the first ground-based CCD (λ {\textless} 1 μm) image of 
an extrasolar planet. Using the Magellan Adaptive Optics system's VisAO
camera, we detected the extrasolar giant planet β Pictoris b in
Y-short (YS , 0.985 μm), at a separation of 0.470 ±
0.''010 and a contrast of (1.63 ± 0.49) × 10-5.
This detection has a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.1 with an empirically
estimated upper limit on false alarm probability of 1.0\%. We also
present new photometry from the Gemini Near-Infrared Coronagraphic
Imager instrument on the Gemini South telescope, in CH 4S,1\%
(1.58 μm), KS (2.18 μm), and K cont (2.27
μm). A thorough analysis of our photometry combined with previous
measurements yields an estimated near-IR spectral type of L2.5 ±
1.5, consistent with previous estimates. We estimate log (L
bol/L ⊙) = -3.86 ± 0.04, which is
consistent with prior estimates for β Pic b and with field early-L
brown dwarfs (BDs). This yields a hot-start mass estimate of 11.9
± 0.7 M Jup for an age of 21 ± 4 Myr, with an
upper limit below the deuterium burning mass. Our L bol-based
hot-start estimate for temperature is T eff = 1643 ±
32 K (not including model-dependent uncertainty). Due to the large
corresponding model-derived radius of R = 1.43 ± 0.02 R
Jup, this T eff is {\textasciitilde}250 K cooler than would be
expected for a field L2.5 BD. Other young, low-gravity (large-radius),
ultracool dwarfs and directly imaged EGPs also have lower effective
temperatures than are implied by their spectral types. However, such
objects tend to be anomalously red in the near-IR compared to field BDs.
In contrast, β Pic b has near-IR colors more typical of an early-L
dwarf despite its lower inferred temperature.},

	abstract = {Wide binaries provide promising laboratories for testing general relativity (GR) in the low-acceleration regime. Recent observational studies have found that the difference in the proper motions and/or radial velocities of the components of nearby wide binaries appear larger than predicted by Kepler's laws, indicating a potential breakdown of GR at low accelerations. These studies have not accounted for projection effects owing to the different position of the two stars on the celestial sphere. I show that two stars in a wide binary with identical 3D space velocities often have significantly different proper motions and radial velocities purely due to projection effects. I construct a sample of simulated binaries that follow Kepler's laws and have similar phase-space distributions to the observed samples of nearby binaries. Beyond separations of ∼ 0.1 pc, direct comparison of the components' proper motions would suggest strong tensions with GR, even though the simulated binaries follow Kepler's laws by construction. The magnitude of the apparent disagreement is similar to that found
observationally, suggesting that the apparent tension between
observations and GR may largely be due to projection effects. I discuss prospects for constraining gravity at low accelerations with wide binaries. Robust tests of GR are possible with current data but require measurements of 3D velocities. Further work is also needed to model contamination from unbound moving groups and unrecognized hierarchical triples.},

	abstract = {We use a homogeneous catalogue of 42 000 main-sequence wide binaries 
identified by Gaia to measure the mass ratio distribution, p(q), of
binaries with primary masses 0.1 {\textless} M1/M⊙
{\textless} 2.5, mass ratios 0.1 ≲ q {\textless} 1, and separations 50 {\textless} s/au
{\textless} 50 000. A well-understood selection function allows us to constrain
p(q) in 35 independent bins of primary mass and separation, with
hundreds to thousands of binaries in each bin. Our investigation reveals
a sharp excess of equal-mass `twin' binaries that is statistically
significant out to separations of 1000-10 000 au, depending on primary
mass. The excess is narrow: a steep increase in p(q) at 0.95 ≲ q
{\textless} 1, with no significant excess at q ≲ 0.95. A range of tests
confirm the signal is real, not a data artefact or selection effect.
Combining the Gaia constraints with those from close binaries, we show
that the twin excess decreases with increasing separation, but its width
(q ≳ 0.95) is constant over 0.01 {\textless} a/au {\textless} 10 000. The wide
twin population would be difficult to explain if the components of all
wide binaries formed via core fragmentation, which is not expected to
produce strongly correlated component masses. We conjecture that wide
twins formed at closer separations (a ≲ 100 au), likely via
accretion from circumbinary discs, and were subsequently widened by
dynamical interactions in their birth environments. The
separation-dependence of the twin excess then constrains the efficiency
of dynamical widening and disruption of binaries in young clusters. We
also constrain p(q) across 0.1 ≲ q {\textless} 1. Besides changes in the
twin fraction, p(q) is independent of separation at fixed primary mass
over 100 ≲ s/au {\textless} 50 000. It is flatter than expected for random
pairings from the initial mass function but more bottom-heavy for wide
binaries than for binaries with a ≲100 au.},

binary stars within \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 1 kpc of the Sun, with projected
separations ranging from a few au to 1 pc. We estimate the probability
that each pair is a chance alignment empirically, using the Gaia catalog
itself to calculate the rate of chance alignments as a function of
observables. The catalog contains 1.3 (1.1) million binaries with
{\textgreater}90\% ({\textgreater}99\%) probability of being bound, including 16,000 white
dwarf -- main sequence (WD+MS) binaries and 1,400 WD+WD binaries. We
make the full catalog publicly available, as well as the queries and
code to produce it. We then use this sample to calibrate the published
Gaia DR3 parallax uncertainties, making use of the binary components'
near-identical parallaxes. We show that these uncertainties are
generally reliable for faint stars (\$G{\textbackslash}gtrsim 18\$), but are
underestimated significantly for brighter stars. The underestimates are
generally \${\textbackslash}le 30{\textbackslash}\%\$ for isolated sources with well-behaved astrometry,
but are larger (up to 80\%) for apparently well-behaved sources with a
companion within \${\textbackslash}lesssim 4\$ arcsec, and much larger for sources with
poor astrometric fits. We provide an empirical fitting function to
inflate published \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}varpi\}\$ values for isolated sources. The
public catalog offers wide ranging follow-up opportunities: from
calibrating spectroscopic surveys, to precisely constraining ages of
field stars, to the masses and the initial-final mass relation of white

	abstract = {The detection and characterization of young planetary systems offers a direct path to study the processes that shape planet evolution. We report on the discovery of a sub-Neptune-size planet orbiting the young star HD 110082 (TOI-1098). Transit events we initially detected during TESS Cycle 1 are validated with time-series photometry from Spitzer. High-contrast imaging and high-resolution, optical spectra are also obtained to characterize the stellar host and confirm the planetary nature of the transits. The host star is a late F dwarf (M=1.2 Msun) with a low-mass, M dwarf binary companion (M=0.26 Msun) separated by nearly one arcminute ({\textasciitilde}6200 AU). Based on its rapid rotation and Lithium absorption, HD 110082 is young, but is not a member of any known group of young stars (despite proximity to the Octans association). To measure the age of the system, we search for coeval, phase-space neighbors and compile a sample of candidate siblings to compare with the empirical sequences of young clusters and to apply quantitative age-dating techniques. In doing so, we find that HD 110082 resides in a new young stellar association we designate MELANGE-1, with an age of 250(+50/-70) Myr. Jointly modeling the TESS and Spitzer light curves, we measure a planetary orbital period of 10.1827 days and radius of Rp = 3.2(+/-0.1) Earth radii. HD 110082 b's radius falls in the largest 12\% of field-age systems with similar host star mass and orbital period. This finding supports previous studies indicating that young planets have larger radii than their field-age counterparts.},

	abstract = {Context. The origin of the observed diversity of planetary system architectures is one of the main topics of exoplanetary research. The detection of a statistically significant sample of planets around young stars allows us to study the early stages of planet formation and evolution, but only a handful are known so far. In this regard a considerable contribution is expected from the NASA TESS satellite, which is now performing a survey of 85\% of the sky to search for short-period transiting planets. Aims: In its first month of operation TESS found a planet candidate with an orbital period of 8.14 days around a member of the Tuc-Hor young association ( 40 Myr), the G6V main component of the binary system DS Tuc. If confirmed, it would be the first transiting planet around a young star suitable for radial velocity and/or atmospheric characterisation. Our aim is to validate the planetary nature of this companion and to measure its orbital and physical parameters. Methods: We obtained accurate planet parameters by coupling an independent reprocessing of the TESS light curve with improved stellar parameters and the dilution caused by the binary companion; we analysed high-precision archival radial velocities to impose an upper limit of about 0.1 MJup on the planet mass; we finally ruled out the presence of external companions beyond 40 au with adaptive optics images. Results: We confirm the presence of a young giant (R = 0.50 RJup) planet having a
non-negligible possibility to be inflated (theoretical mass ≲ 20 M⊕) around DS Tuc A. We discuss the feasibility of mass determination, Rossiter-McLaughlin analysis, and atmosphere
characterisation allowed by the brightness of the star.

We verify these estimates by comparing our new results to previous analyses of nearby stars, examining ﬁducial cluster properties, and estimating the power-law slope of the local present-day mass function. A comparison to previous studies suggests that our mass estimates are robust, while metallicity and age estimates are increasingly uncertain.

	abstract = {Astrometric surveys provide the opportunity to measure the absolute 
magnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual
line-of-sight extinctions are known. Unfortunately, extinction is highly
degenerate with stellar effective temperature when estimated from
broad-band optical/infrared photometry. To address this problem, I
introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the intrinsic parameters of a
star and its line-of-sight extinction. It uses both photometry and
parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to provide a
non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the parameters.
The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure
that they respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by
using it to estimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK
data for a set of artificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which
accurate effective temperatures have been estimated from high-resolution
spectroscopy. Using just the four colours, we see the expected strong
degeneracy (positive correlation) between the temperature and
extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent magnitude and the HRD
reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision (reduces the
error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the latter by
about 35 per cent. The resulting accuracy is about 200 K in temperature
and 0.2 mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these
parameters and absolute magnitudes for some 47 000 F, G, K Hipparcos
stars which have been cross-matched with Two-Micron All-Sky Survey
(2MASS). The method can easily be extended to incorporate the estimation
of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity,
making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 109
stars from Gaia.},

	abstract = {The availability of a number of new interferometric measurements of Main 
Sequence and subgiant stars makes it possible to calibrate the surface
brightness relations of these stars using exclusively direct angular
diameter measurements. These empirical laws make it possible to predict
the limb darkened angular diameters θLD of dwarfs and
subgiants using their dereddened Johnson magnitudes, or their effective
temperature. The smallest intrinsic dispersions of σ ≤1\% in
θLD are obtained for the relations based on the K and
L magnitudes, for instance log θLD = 0.0502 (B-L) +
0.5133 - 0.2 L or log θLD = 0.0755 (V-K) + 0.5170 -
0.2 K. Our calibrations are valid between the spectral types A0 and M2
for dwarf stars (with a possible extension to later types when using the
effective temperature), and between A0 and K0 for subgiants. Such
relations are particularly useful for estimating the angular sizes of
calibrators for long-baseline interferometry from readily available
broadband photometry.

observations of 31 systems in the β Pic moving group, and in the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations, using the Herschel Space Observatory. None of these stars were observed at far-infrared wavelengths before. Our Herschel measurements were
complemented by photometry from the WISE satellite for the whole sample, and by submillimeter/millimeter continuum data for one source, HD 48370. We identified six stars with infrared excess, four of them are new discoveries. By combining our new findings with results from the literature, we examined the incidence and general characteristics of debris disks around Sun-like members of the selected groups. With their dust temperatures of {\textless}45 K the newly identified disks around HD
38397, HD 48370, HD 160305, and BD-20 951 represent the coldest
population within this sample. For HD 38397 and HD 48370, the emission is resolved in the 70 μm Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrograph images, the estimated radius of these disks is ∼90 au. Together with the well-known disk around HD 61005, these three systems represent the highest mass end of the known debris disk population around young G-type members of the selected groups. In terms of dust content, they resemble the hypothesized debris disk of the ancient solar system.},

	abstract = {The population statistics of binary stars are an important output of star formation models. However, populations of wide binaries evolve over time due to interactions within a system's birth environment and the unfolding of wide, hierarchical triple systems. Hence, the wide binary populations observed in star-forming regions or OB associations may not accurately reflect the wide binary populations that will eventually reach the field. We use Gaia DR2 data to select members of three open clusters, Alpha Per, the Pleiades, and Praesepe and to flag cluster members that are likely unresolved binaries due to overluminosity or elevated astrometric noise. We then identify the resolved wide binary population in each cluster, separating it from coincident pairings of unrelated cluster members. We find that these clusters have an average wide binary fraction in the 300-3000 au projected separation range of 2.1 \${\textbackslash}pm {\textasciicircum}\{0.4\}\_\{0.2\}\$ per cent increasing to 3.0 \${\textbackslash}pm {\textasciicircum}\{0.8\}\_\{0.7\}\$ per cent for primaries with masses in the 0.5-1.5 M⊙
range. This is significantly below the observed field wide binary fraction, but shows some wide binaries survive in these dynamically highly processed environments. We compare our results with another open cluster (the Hyades) and two populations of young stars that likely originated in looser associations (young moving groups and the
Pisces-Eridanus stream). We find that the Hyades also has a deficit of wide binaries while the products of looser associations have wide binary fractions at or above field level.},

	abstract = {We study the orbital evolution of wide binary stars in the solar neighbourhood due to gravitational perturbations from passing stars. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal ﬁeld and continue to follow the stars after they become unbound. For a wide variety of initial semimajor axes and formation times, we ﬁnd that the number density (stars per unit logarithmic interval in projected separation) exhibits a minimum at a few times the Jacobi radius rJ, which equals 1.7 pc for a binary of solar-mass stars. The density peak interior to this minimum arises from the primordial distribution of bound binaries, and the exterior density, which peaks at a separation of ∼100–300 pc, arises from formerly bound binaries that are slowly drifting apart. The exterior peak gives rise to a signiﬁcant long-range correlation in the positions and velocities of disc stars that should be detectable in large astrometric surveys such as Gaia that can measure accurate three-dimensional distances and velocities.},

	abstract = {Tabby's Star (also known as Boyajian's Star and WTF Star, and designated KIC 8462852 in the Kepler Input Catalog) is an F-type main-sequence star in the constellation Cygnus approximately 1,470 light-years (450 pc) from Earth. Unusual light fluctuations of the star, including up to a 22\% dimming in brightness, were discovered by citizen scientists as part of the Planet Hunters project. In September 2015, astronomers and citizen scientists associated with the project posted a preprint of an article describing the data and possible interpretations. The discovery was made from data collected by the Kepler space telescope, which observed changes in the brightness of distant stars to detect exoplanets.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the star's large irregular changes in brightness as measured by its light curve, but none to date fully explain all aspects of the curve. One explanation is that an "uneven ring of dust" orbits Tabby's Star. In another explanation, the star's luminosity is modulated by changes in the efficiency of heat transport to its photosphere, so no external obscuration is required. A third hypothesis, based on a lack of observed infrared light, posits a swarm of cold, dusty comet fragments in a highly eccentric orbit, however, the notion that disturbed comets from such a cloud could exist in high enough numbers to obscure 22\% of the star's observed luminosity has been doubted. Another hypothesis is that a large number of small masses in "tight formation" are orbiting the star. Furthermore, spectroscopic study of the system has found no evidence for coalescing material or hot close-in dust or circumstellar matter from an evaporating or exploding planet within a few astronomical units of the mature central star. It has also been hypothesized that the changes in brightness could be signs of activity associated with intelligent extraterrestrial life constructing a Dyson swarm; however, further analysis based on data through the end of 2017 showed wavelength-dependent dimming consistent with dust but not an opaque object such as an alien megastructure, which would block all wavelengths of light equally.Tabby's Star is not the only star that has large irregular dimmings, but all other such stars are young stellar objects called YSO dippers, which have different dimming patterns. An example of such an object is EPIC 204278916.New fluctuations ran from mid-May 2017 until July 2018, assuming their continuance in late-December 2017 to mid-February 2018 when obscured by the Sun.In September 2019, astronomers reported that the observed dimmings of Tabby's Star may have been produced by fragments resulting from the disruption of an orphaned exomoon. An overall study of other similar stars has been presented. In January 2021, a distant stellar-mass companion was reported, making Tabby's Star a binary stellar system.},

	abstract = {Starlight subtraction algorithms based on the method of Karhunen-Lo{\textbackslash}`eve eigenimages have proved invaluable to exoplanet direct imaging. However, they scale poorly in runtime when paired with differential imaging techniques. In such observations, reference frames and frames to be starlight-subtracted are drawn from the same set of data, requiring a new subset of references (and eigenimages) for each frame processed to avoid self-subtraction of the signal of interest. The data rates of extreme adaptive optics instruments are such that the only way to make this computationally feasible has been to downsample the data. We develop a technique that updates a pre-computed singular value decomposition of the full dataset to remove frames (i.e. a "downdate") without a full recomputation, yielding the modified eigenimages. This not only enables analysis of much larger data volumes in the same amount of time, but also exhibits near-linear scaling in runtime as the number of observations increases. We apply this technique to archival data and investigate its scaling behavior for very large numbers of frames \$N\$. The resulting algorithm provides speed improvements of \$2.6{\textbackslash}times\$ (for 200 eigenimages at \$N = 300\$) to \$140 {\textbackslash}times\$ (at \$N = 10{\textasciicircum}4\$) with the advantage only increasing as \$N\$ grows. This algorithm has allowed us to substantially accelerate KLIP even for modest \$N\$, and will let us quickly explore how KLIP parameters affect exoplanet characterization in large \$N\$ datasets.},

In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this
instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastrom distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.},

	abstract = {The so-called Lidov-Kozai oscillation is very well known and applied to various problems in solar system dynamics. This mechanism makes the orbital inclination and eccentricity of the perturbed body in the circular restricted three-body system oscillate with a large amplitude under certain conditions. It is widely accepted that the theoretical framework of this phenomenon was established independently in the early 1960s by a Soviet Union dynamicist (Michail L'vovich Lidov) and by a Japanese celestial mechanist (Yoshihide Kozai). A large variety of studies has stemmed from the original works by Lidov and Kozai, now having the prefix of "Lidov-Kozai" or "Kozai- Lidov." However, from a survey of past literature published in late nineteenth to early
twentieth century, we have confirmed that there already existed a pioneering work using a similar analysis of this subject established in that period. This was accomplished by a Swedish astronomer, Edvard Hugo von Zeipel. In this monograph, we first outline the basic framework of the circular restricted three-body problem including typical examples where the Lidov-Kozai oscillation occurs. Then, we introduce what was discussed and learned along this line of studies from the early to mid-twentieth century by summarizing the major works of Lidov, Kozai, and relevant authors. Finally, we make a summary of von Zeipel's work, and show that his achievements in the early twentieth century already comprehended most of the fundamental and necessary formulations that the Lidov-Kozai oscillation requires. By comparing the works of Lidov, Kozai, and von Zeipel, we assert that the prefix "von
Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai" should be used for designating this theoretical framework, and not just Lidov-Kozai or Kozai-Lidov.},

	abstract = {Context. Evidence exists in the 125-Myr Pleiades cluster, and more 
recently in the 5-Myr NGC 2264 cluster, to show that rotation plays a
key role in lithium (Li) depletion processes among low-mass stars. Fast
rotators appear to be less Li-depleted than equal-mass slow rotators.
 Aims: We intend to explore the existence of a Li
depletion-rotation connection among the β Pictoris members at an
age of about 24 Myr, and to use this correlation either to confirm or to
improve age estimates based on the lithium depletion boundary (LDB)
modeling. Methods: We photometrically monitored all the known
members of the β Pictoris association with at least one lithium
equivalent width (Li EW) measurement from the literature. 
Results: We measured the rotation periods of 30 members for the first
time and retrieved the rotation periods for another 36 members from the
literature, building a catalogue of 66 members with a measured rotation
period and Li EW. Conclusions: We find that in the 0.3 {\textless} M
{\textless} 0.8M⊙ range, there is a strong correlation between
rotation and Li EW. For higher mass stars, no significant correlation is
found. For very low-mass stars in the Li depletion onset, at about 0.1
M⊙, there are too few data to infer a significant
correlation. The observed Li EWs are compared with those predicted by
the Dartmouth stellar evolutionary models that incorporate the effects
of magnetic fields. After decorrelating the Li EW from the rotation
period, we find that the hot side of the LDB is well fitted by Li EW
values that correspond to an age of 25 ± 3 Myr, which is in good
agreement with independent estimates from the literature.},

from archival time series the rotation periods of almost all members. In
a few cases the rotation periods were retrieved from the literature. We
used updated UVWXYZ components to assess the membership of the whole
stellar sample. Thanks to the known basic properties of most members we
built the rotation period distribution distinguishing between bona fide
members and candidate members and according to their multiplicity
status. Results: We find that single stars and components of
multiple systems in wide orbits ({\textgreater}80 AU) have rotation periods that
exhibit a well defined sequence arising from mass distribution with some
level of spread likely arising from initial rotation period
distribution. All components of multiple systems in close orbits ({\textless}80
AU) have rotation periods that are significantly shorter than their
equal-mass single counterparts. For these close components of multiple
systems a linear dependence of rotation rate on separation is only
barely detected. A comparison with the younger 13 Myr h Per cluster and
with the older 40-Myr open clusters and stellar associations NGC 2547,
IC 2391, Argus, and IC 2602 and the 130-Myr Pleiades shows that whereas
the evolution of F-G stars is well reproduced by angular momentum
evolution models, this is not the case for the slow K and early-M stars.
Finally, we find that the amplitude of their light curves is correlated
neither with rotation nor with mass. Conclusions: Once single
stars and wide components of multiple systems are separated from close
components of multiple systems, the rotation period distributions
exhibit a well defined dependence on mass that allows us to make a
meaningful comparison with similar distributions of either younger or
older associations and clusters. Such cleaned distributions allow us to
use the stellar rotation period meaningfully as an age indicator for F
and G type stars.

	abstract = {We present MIPS 24 μm and 70 μm photometry for 205 members of the Upper Scorpius OB Association. These data are combined with published MIPS photometry for 15 additional association members to assess the frequency of circumstellar disks around 5 Myr old stars with spectral types between B0 and M5. Twelve stars have a detectable 70 μm excess, each of which also has a detectable 24 μm excess. A total of 54 stars are identified with a 24 μm excess more than 32\% above the stellar photosphere. The MIPS observations reveal 19 excess sources—8
A/F/G stars and 11 K/M stars—that were not previously identified with an 8 μm or 16 μm excess. The lack of short-wavelength
emission and the weak 24 μm excess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants of optically thick primordial disks with inner holes. Despite the wide range of luminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excess characteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbital radii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size with spectral type. The results for Upper Sco are compared to similar photometric surveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission. After considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effects of stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude of the 24 μm excess around F-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 Myr as found by previous studies, but at lsim2.6σ confidence. For B7-A9 and G0-K5 stars, any variations in the observed 24 μm excess emission over this age range are significant at less than 2σ confidence.},

as \{d\}2n{\textbackslash}propto \{\{fM\}\}α \{a\}β
\{(\{M\}{\textbackslash}star /\{M\}⊙ )\}γ

occurrence of companions is negatively correlated with a semimajor axis
and companion mass (marginally) but is positively correlated with the
stellar host mass. Our inferred mass distribution is in good agreement
with other distributions found previously from direct imaging surveys
for planets and brown dwarfs, but is shallower as a function of mass
than the distributions inferred by radial velocity surveys of gas giants
in the 1-3 au range. This may suggest that planets at these wide and
very wide separations represent the low-mass tail of the brown dwarfs

	abstract = {Observing ROSAT sources in an area 20°×25° centered at the high-latitude (b=-59°) active star ER Eri, we found evidences for a nearby association, that we call the Horologium association (HorA), formed by at least 10 very young stars, some of them being bona fide post-T Tauri stars. We suggest other six stars as possible members of this proposed association. We examine several requirements that
characterize a young stellar association. Although no one of them, isolated, gives an undisputed prove of the existence of the HorA, all together practically create a strong evidence for it. In fact, the Li line intensities are between those of the older classical T Tauri stars and the ones of the Local Association stars. The space velocity
components of the HorA relative to the Sun (U=-9.5+/-1.0, V=-20.9+/-1.1, W=-2.1+/-1.9) are not far from those of the Local Association, so that it could be one of its last episodes of star formation. In this region of the sky there are some hotter and non-X-ray active stars, with similar space velocities, that could be the massive members of the HorA, among them, the nearby Be star Achernar. The maximum of the mass distribution function of its probable members is around 0.7-0.9
Msolar. We estimate its distance as {\textasciitilde}60 pc and its size as {\textasciitilde}50 pc. If spherical, this size would be larger than the surveyed area, and many other members could have been missed. ER Eri itself was found to be not a member, but a background RS CVn-like system. We also observed three control regions, two at northern and southern Galactic latitudes and a third one in the known TW Hya association (TWA), and the properties and distribution of their young stars strengthen the reality of the HorA. Contrary to the TWA, the only known binaries in the HorA are two very wide systems. The HorA is much more isolated from clouds and older ({\textasciitilde}30 Myr) than the TWA and could give some clues about the lifetime of the disks around T Tauri stars. Actually, none of the proposed members is an IRAS source indicating an advanced stage of the evolution of their primitive accreting disks.

They also share a consistent radial velocity with previously known members of the association. A fourth candidate T Tauri star is of earlier spectral type, has a weaker Lithium absorption feature, and a different radial velocity, and is probably located in the background of the association.

estimation of action-angle variables. We show that the method is highly accurate, to a level of {\textless}1\% in eccentricity, over a large range of relevant orbits and in different Milky Way-like potentials, and
demonstrate its validity by estimating the eccentricity distribution of the RAVE-TGAS data set and comparing it with that from orbit
integration. Using this method, the orbital characteristics of the ∼7 million Gaia DR2 stars with radial velocity measurements are
computed with Monte Carlo sampled errors in ∼116 hours of
parallelized cpu time, at a speed that we estimate to be ∼3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than using numerical orbit integration. We demonstrate using this catalog that Gaia DR2 samples a large range of orbits in the solar vicinity, down to those with r ap ≲ 2.5 kpc, and out to r peri ≳ 13 kpc. We also show that many of the features present in orbital parameter space have a low mean z max, suggesting that they likely result from disk dynamical effects.},

lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although
more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using

In addition, by using medium-resolution optical spectra of two M8 members of the association (2M1139 and 2M1207 - an accreting brown dwarf with a planetary mass companion), we have derived spectral types and measured Hα and lithium equivalent widths. We have also estimated their
effective temperature and gravity, which were used to produce an independent age estimation for these two brown dwarfs. We have also collected spectra of 2M1315, a candidate member with a L5 spectral type and measured its Hα equivalent width. Results: .Our age
estimate for the association, 10+10-7 Myr, agrees with previous values cited in the literature. In the case of the two brown dwarfs, we have derived an age of 15+15-10 Myr, which also agree with our estimate for the whole group.

	abstract = {Accurate two-colour photometry and proper motions of 7096 young X-ray stars in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Star Catalogue, version 1RXS, are extracted from the Tycho-2 Catalogue. The sample is dominated by red main-sequence and possibly pre-main-sequence stars. On a global proper motion convergence map, two features are very prominent: the nearby section of the Gould Belt and the Hyades convergent point. The
appearance of the Gould Belt feature with its peak at (l=244.3°, b=-12.6°) is quite similar to that of Hipparcos OB stars. When only stars with proper motions drawing close to that point are selected, strong concentrations of stars in the direction of the Sco-Cen complex are found. Another concentration, not corresponding to any known OB association, is detected between the position of the Lower Centaurus Crux and Vela OB2 associations. It is a new young moving group located in Carina and Vela, and a near extension of the Sco-Cen complex. Contrary to the classical Gould Belt OB associations, the Carina-Vela moving group has a considerable geometric depth, the closest members being as near as 30pc from the Sun. IC 2391, one of the youngest and closest open clusters on the sky, is a part of the Carina-Vela moving group. The Carina-Vela moving group does not link the Sco-Cen complex with the Vela OB associations, because the latter is much more distant than the outer limit of the sample. It is more likely that the young late-type population of the Scorpio-Centaurus-Carina moving group stretches towards the Sun and possibly beyond it.},

	abstract = {BANYAN Σ is a new Bayesian algorithm to identify members of young 
stellar associations within 150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young
associations with ages in the range ∼1-800 Myr, modeled with
multivariate Gaussians in six-dimensional (6D) XYZUVW space. It is the
first such multi-association classification tool to include the nearest
sub-groups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the IC 2602, IC 2391,
Pleiades and Platais 8 clusters, and the ρ Ophiuchi, Corona
Australis, and Taurus star formation regions. A model of field stars is
built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians based on the
Besançon Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership
probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion,
but can also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well
as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in
color-magnitude or spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN Σ
benefits from an analytical solution to the Bayesian marginalization
integrals over unknown radial velocities and distances that makes it
more accurate and significantly faster than its predecessor BANYAN II. A
contamination versus hit rate analysis is presented and demonstrates
that BANYAN Σ achieves a better classification performance than
other moving group tools available in the literature, especially in
terms of cross-contamination between young associations. An updated list
of bona fide members in the 27 young associations, augmented by the
Gaia-DR1 release, as well as all parameters for the 6D multivariate
Gaussian models for each association and the Galactic field neighborhood
within 300 pc are presented. This new tool will make it possible to
analyze large data sets such as the upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify new
young stars. IDL and Python versions of BANYAN Σ are made
available with this publication, and a more limited online web tool is

	abstract = {Context: Ages, metallicities, space velocities, and Galactic orbits of 
stars in the Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational
constraints on models of galactic disk evolution. Understanding and
minimising systematic errors and sample selection biases in the data is
crucial for their interpretation. Aims: We aim to consolidate
the calibrations of uvbyβ photometry into T\_eff, [Fe/H], distance,
and age for F and G stars and rediscuss the results of the
Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordström et al. 2004; GCS) in terms of
the evolution of the disk. Methods: We use recent V-K
photometry, angular diameters, high-resolution spectroscopy, Hipparcos
parallaxes, and extensive numerical simulations to re-examine and verify
the temperature, metallicity, distance, and reddening calibrations for
the uvbyβ system. We also highlight the selection effects inherent
in the apparent-magnitude limited GCS sample. Results: We
substantially improve the T\_eff and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F
stars, where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. A
slight offset of the GCS photometry and the non-standard helium
abundance of the Hyades invalidate its use for checking metallicity or
age scales; however, the distances, reddenings, metallicities, and age
scale for GCS field stars require minor corrections only. Our recomputed
ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by
Takeda et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably
determined. Conclusions: The revised G-dwarf metallicity
distribution remains incompatible with closed-box models, and the
age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains almost flat, with
large and real scatter at all ages (σ\_intrinsic = 0.20 dex).
Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life;
specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and
V velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When
assigning thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic
criteria, parameters for the oldest stars should be used to characterise
the thin disk.

stellar effective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent

high-resolution spectroscopy and checked against four open clusters and
a moving group, showing excellent consistency. The new temperature and
metallicity scales provide a better match to theoretical isochrones,
which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar ages. With respect to
previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter and 0.1 dex
more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity distribution
function around the solar value. From Strömgren photometry we are
able to derive for the first time a proxy for [α/Fe] abundances,
which enables us to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin
and thick disc. We find evidence for the latter being composed of an
old, mildly but systematically alpha-enhanced population that extends to
super solar metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our
revision offers the largest existing kinematically unbiased sample of
the solar neighbourhood that contains full information on kinematics,
metallicities, and ages and thus provides better constraints on the
physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way disc,
enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context.

	abstract = {Close binaries suppress the formation of circumstellar (S-type) planets 
and therefore significantly bias the inferred planet occurrence rates
and statistical trends. After compiling various radial velocity and
high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {\textless}
1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close
planets at 15\% the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries
with a {\textgreater} 200 au have a negligible effect on planet formation. We show
that F = 43\% +/- 6\% of solar-type primaries do not host close planets
due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing
spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for
giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8
+/- 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully
accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter occurrence rates inferred
from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression
by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence
rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 +/- 0.3 times
larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey.
About half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period
planets toward low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding
decrease in the binary fraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the
apparent enhancement of wide stellar companions to hot Jupiter hosts is
due to multiple selection effects. Although very close binaries with
secondary masses M\_2 {\textgreater} 10 M\_J preferentially have wide tertiary
companions, genuine hot Jupiters with M\_p = 0.2-4 M\_J that formed via
core accretion do not exhibit a statistically significant excess of wide
stellar companions.},

It can also be queried using an online tool for quick estimates of
instantaneous mass-loss rates (e.g for convenient evaluation of real
observed systems). The ``FRIED'' grid itself illustrates that for discs
around stars ≤0.3 M⊙, external photoevaporation is
effective down to small radii ({\textless}50 au) down to UV fields at least as
weak as 10 G0. At the other end of the scale, in a
104 G0 environment photoevaporation is effective
down to 1 au even for stellar masses at least as high as 1.9
M⊙. We also illustrate in which regimes CO survives in
the photoevaporative outflow for significant mass-loss rates; marking a
system a good candidate to detect external photoevaporation in
weak-intermediate UV environments through sub-Keplerian rotation.
Finally, we make illustrative mass-loss rate estimates for discs in
Taurus based on the Guilloteau et al. (2011) star-disc parameters,
finding that around half are expected to have both significant mass-loss

the 6th Catalogue of Orbits of Visual Binaries, the pole ambiguity could
be resolved for 51 systems using radial velocity collected in the
literature and CORAVEL database or acquired with the HERMES/Mercator
spectrograph. For several systems, we can correct the erroneous nodes in
the 6th Catalogue of Orbits and obtain new combined
spectroscopic/astrometric orbits for seven systems [WDS 01083+5455Aa,Ab;
01418+4237AB; 02278+0426AB (SB2); 09006+4147AB (SB2); 16413+3136AB;
17121+4540AB; 18070+3034AB]. We used of spherical statistics to test for
possible anisotropy. After ordering the binary systems by increasing
distance from the Sun, we computed the false-alarm probability for
subsamples of increasing sizes, from N = 1 up to the full sample of 51
systems. Rayleigh-Watson and Beran tests deliver a false-alarm
probability of 0.5\% for the 20 systems closer than 8.1 pc. To evaluate
the robustness of this conclusion, we used a jackknife approach, for
which we repeated this procedure after removing one system at a time
from the full sample. The false-alarm probability was then found to vary
between 1.5\% and 0.1\%, depending on which system is removed. The reality
of the deviation from isotropy can thus not be assessed with certainty
at this stage, because only so few systems are available, despite our
efforts to increase the sample. However, when considering the full
sample of 51 systems, the concentration of poles toward the Galactic
position l = 46.0°, b = 37°, as observed in the 8.1 pc sphere,
totally vanishes (the Rayleigh-Watson false-alarm probability then rises
to 18\%).

models. Detailed analysis of the orbital architecture of these systems

possibility that they were dynamically ejected onto a wide orbit. We
present astrometry for the wide planetary-mass companion GSC 6214-210 b
(240 au; ≈14 \{M\vphantom{\{}\}Jup\}) obtained using NIRC2 with adaptive
optics at the Keck telescope over 10 years. Our measurements achieved
astrometric uncertainties of ≈1 mas per epoch. We determined a
relative motion of 1.12 ± 0.15 mas yr-1 (0.61
± 0.09 km s-1), the first detection of orbital
motion for this companion. We compute the minimum periastron for the
companion due to our measured velocity vector and derive constraints on
the orbital parameters through our modified implementation of the Orbits
for the Impatient rejection sampling algorithm. We find that close
periastron orbits, which could indicate that the companion was
dynamically scattered, are present in our posterior but have low
likelihoods. For all orbits in our posterior, we assess the
detectability of close-in companions that could have scattered GSC
6214-210 b from a closer orbit, and find that most potential scatterers
would have been detected in previous imaging. We conclude that formation
at small orbital separation and subsequent dynamical scattering through
interaction with another potential close-in object is an unlikely
formation pathway for this companion. We also update stellar and
substellar properties for the system using the new parallax from Gaia

The planet, Kepler-1649 c, is 1.06  \$\{\}\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\$ times the size of Earth and transits its 0.1977 ± 0.0051  \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ "mid" M-dwarf host star every
19.5 days. It receives 74\% ± 3\% the incident flux of Earth,
giving it an equilibrium temperature of 234 ± 20 K and placing it firmly inside the circumstellar habitable zone. Kepler-1649 also hosts a previously known inner planet that orbits every 8.7 days and is roughly equivalent to Venus in size and incident flux. Kepler-1649 c was originally classified as a false positive (FP) by the Kepler pipeline, but was rescued as part of a systematic visual inspection of all automatically dispositioned Kepler FPs. This discovery highlights the value of human inspection of planet candidates even as automated techniques improve, and hints that terrestrial planets around mid to late M-dwarfs may be more common than those around more massive stars.},

A faint star ≈2″ to the east was discovered in Keck/NIRC2 imaging in Boyajian et al., but its status as a binary, and possible contribution to the observed variability, was unclear. Here, we use three epochs of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, spanning 5 yr, in JHK near-infrared bands to obtain 1 mas precision astrometry. We show that the two objects exhibit common proper motion, measure a relative velocity of μ = 0.14 ± 0.44 mas yr−1 (μ = 0.30 ± 0.93 km s−1) and conclude that they are a binary pair at 880 ± 10 au projected separation. There is marginal detection of possible orbital motion, but our astrometry is insufficient to characterize the orbit. We show that two other point sources are not associated with KIC 8462852. We recommend that attempts to model KIC 8462852 A’s light curve should revisit the possibility that the bound stellar companion may play a role in causing the irregular brightness variations, for example, through disruption of the orbits of bodies around the primary due to long-term orbital evolution of the binary orbit.},

We find that a fundamental role for injecting comets from the region outside the loss cone (perihelion distance q {\textgreater} 15 AU) into observable orbits ( q {\textless} 5 AU) is played by stellar perturbations. These act in synergy with the tide such that the total injection rate is significantly larger than the sum of the two separate rates. This synergy is as important during comet showers as during quiescent periods and concerns comets with both small and large semi-major axes. We propose different dynamical mechanisms to explain the synergies in the inner and outer parts of the Oort Cloud. We find that the filling of the observable part of the loss cone under normal conditions in the present-day Solar System rises from {\textless}1\% for a {\textless} 20 000 AU to about 100\% for a ≳ 100 000 AU.},

wide binaries, pairs of stars separated by over {\textasciitilde}103 AU. Due
to perturbations from other passing stars and the Milky Way's tide, the
orbits of very wide binary stars occasionally become extremely
eccentric, which forces close encounters between the companion stars. We
show that this process causes a stellar collision between very wide
binary companion stars once every 1000-7500 yr on average in the Milky
Way. One of the main uncertainties in this collision rate is the amount
of energy dissipated by dynamic tides during close (but not collisional)
periastron passages. This dissipation presents a dynamical barrier to
stellar collisions and can instead transform very wide binaries into
close or contact binaries. However, for any plausible tidal dissipation
model, very wide binary stars are an unrealized, and potentially the
dominant, source of stellar collisions in our Galaxy. Such collisions
should occur throughout the thin disk of the Milky Way. Stellar
collisions within very wide binaries should yield a small population of
single, Li-depleted, rapidly rotating massive stars.},

	abstract = {THE origin of Pluto's unusual orbit—the most eccentric and inclined of all the planets—remains a mystery. The orbits of Pluto and Neptune overlap, but close approaches of these two planets are prevented by the existence of a resonance condition1: Pluto's orbital period is exactly 3/2 that of Neptune, which ensures that the conjunctions always occur near Pluto's aphelion. Long-term orbit integrations2-5 have uncovered other subtle resonances and near-resonances, and indicate that Pluto's orbit is chaotic yet remains macroscopically stable over billion-year timescales. A
suggestion4 that the orbit may have evolved purely by chaotic dynamics appears unlikely in light of recent orbital stability
studies6, unless one appeals to a well-timed collision to place Pluto in its stable orbit19. Here I show that Pluto could have acquired its current orbit during the late stages of
planetary accretion, when the jovian planets underwent significant orbital migration as a result of encounters with residual
planetesimals7. As Neptune moved outwards, a small body like Pluto in an initially circular orbit could have been captured into the 3:2 resonance, following which its orbital eccentricity would rise rapidly to its current Neptune-crossing value.},

Classical theoretical analyses found in textbooks report that libration widths of first-order mean motion resonances diverge for nearly circular orbits. Here, we examine the nature of this divergence with a non-perturbative analysis of a few first-order resonances interior to a Jupiter-mass planet. We show that a first-order resonance has two branches, the pericentric and the apocentric resonance zone. As the eccentricity approaches zero, the centres of these zones diverge away from the nominal resonance location but their widths shrink. We also report a novel finding of 'bridges' between adjacent first-order resonances: at low eccentricities, the apocentric libration zone of a first-order resonance smoothly connects with the pericentric libration zone of the neighbouring first-order resonance. These bridges may facilitate resonant migration across large radial distances in planetary systems, entirely in the low-eccentricity regime.},

The mapping is based on the approximation that perturbations to the test particle orbit are localized near conjunction with the planet. We use the mapping to confirm Wisdom's result that initially circular test particle orbits are chaotic when {\textbar}a − 1p{\textbar}/ap ≲ μ23, where μ is the planet/Sun mass ratio. The map can be generalized to include perturbations from two nearby planets, in the two-planet map to model the evolution of initially circular test particle orbits in the Solar System. We find that many orbits between Uranus and Neptune and most orbits between Jupiter and Saturn become planet-crossing and hence unstable within the age of the Solar System (4.5 Gyr), and that most orbits between Saturn and Uranus, between Venus and Earth, and in the asteroid belt are stable over this time scale. (Between Venus and Earth, 4.5 Gyr corresponds to over 2 × 109 iterations of the map.) These results suggest that there may still be stable bands in the outer Solar System containing residual planetesimals from the protoplanetary disk. In addition, they show that interesting dynamical evolution of Solar System orbits is likely to occur on Gyr times scales.},

planetesimal bombardment so late in Solar System history. Several models
have been proposed to explain a late impact spike, but none of them has
been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution.
Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the
giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this
burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the
planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of
planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also
strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction
of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence. Our
model not only naturally explains the LHB, but also reproduces the
observational constraints of the outer Solar System.},

decades-old, well-known Fortran model used for several studies of planetary objects within the solar system and beyond. We have adopted it to include several methodologies for computing both direct and
diffuse-scattering phase functions, and have added several updates including the ability to compute Raman scattering spectral features. Here we benchmark PICASO against two independent codes and discuss the degree to which the model is sensitive to a user’s specification for various phase functions. Then, we conduct a full information-content study of the model across a wide parameter space in temperature, cloud profile, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolving power.},

Near-term space- and ground- based facilities like WFIRST and ELTs will be able to directly image mature Jovian planets in reflected light, a critical step in support of future facilities that aim to directly image terrestrial planets in reflected light (e.g., HabEx, LUVOIR). These future facilities are considering the use of photometry to classify planets. Here, we investigate the intricacies of using colors to classify gas-giant planets by analyzing a grid of 9120 theoretical reflected light spectra spread across different
metallicities, pressure-temperature profiles, cloud properties,
and phase angles. We determine how correlated these planet parameters are with the colors in the WFIRST photometric bins and other photometric bins proposed in the literature. Then we outline under what conditions giant planet populations can be classified using several supervised multivariate classification algorithms. We find that giant planets imaged in reflected light can be classified by metallicity with an accuracy of {\textgreater}90\% if they are a prior known to not have significant cloud coverage in the visible part of the atmosphere, and at least three filter observations are available. If the presence of clouds is not known a priori, directly imaged planets can be more accurately
classified by their cloud properties, as oppposed to metallicity or temperature. Furthermore, we are able to distinguish between cloudy and cloud-free populations with {\textgreater}90\% accuracy with three filter
observations. Our statistical pipeline is available on GitHub and can be extended to optimize science yield of future mission concepts.},

	abstract = {Future space-based telescopes, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey 
Telescope (WFIRST), will observe the reflected light spectra of directly
imaged extrasolar planets. Interpretation of such data presents a number
of novel challenges, including accounting for unknown planet radius and
uncertain stellar illumination phase angle. Here, we report on our
continued development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo retrieval methods for
addressing these issues in the interpretation of such data.
Specifically, we explore how the unknown planet radius and potentially
poorly known observer-planet-star phase angle impacts retrievals of
parameters of interest such as atmospheric methane abundance, cloud
properties, and surface gravity. As expected, the uncertainty in
retrieved values is a strong function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)
of the observed spectra, particularly for low metallicity atmospheres,
which lack deep absorption signatures. Meaningful results may only be
possible above certain S/N thresholds; for cases across a metallicity
range of 1-50 times solar, we find that only an S/N of 20 systematically
reproduces a value close to the correct methane abundance at all phase
angles. However, even in cases where the phase angle is poorly known we
find that the planet radius can be constrained to within a factor of
two. We find that uncertainty in planet radius decreases at phase angles
past quadrature, as the highly forward-scattering nature of the
atmosphere at these geometries limits the possible volume of phase space
that relevant parameters can occupy. Finally, we present an estimation
of possible improvement that can result from combining retrievals
against observations at multiple phase angles.},

Six additional star systems have UVW similar to those of Octans-Near stars and likely ages {\textless}=200 Myr.

substantially older than 200 Myr and thus generally can readily be distinguished from the much younger Octans-Near stars.},

	abstract = {New means of interstellar travel are now being considered by various 
research teams, assuming lightweight spaceships to be accelerated via
either laser or solar radiation to a significant fraction of the speed
of light (c). We recently showed that gravitational assists can be
combined with the stellar photon pressure to decelerate an incoming
lightsail from Earth and fling it around a star or bring it to rest.
Here, we demonstrate that photogravitational assists are more effective
when the star is used as a bumper (I.e., the sail passes “in front
of” the star) rather than as a catapult (I.e., the sail passes
“behind” or “around” the star). This increases
the maximum deceleration at α Cen A and B and reduces the travel
time of a nominal graphene-class sail (mass-to-surface ratio 8.6×
\{10\}-4 \{\{g\}\} \{\{\{m\}\}\}-2) from 95 to 75 years. The
maximum possible velocity reduction upon arrival depends on the required
deflection angle from α Cen A to B and therefore on the
binary’s orbital phase. Here, we calculate the variation of the
minimum travel times from Earth into a bound orbit around Proxima for
the next 300 years and then extend our calculations to roughly 22,000
stars within about 300 lt-yr. Although α Cen is the most nearby
star system, we find that Sirius A offers the shortest possible travel
times into a bound orbit: 69 years assuming 12.5\% c can be obtained at
departure from the solar system. Sirius A thus offers the opportunity of
flyby exploration plus deceleration into a bound orbit of the companion
white dwarf after relatively short times of interstellar travel.},

Metallicities are calibrated on high-resolution spectroscopy and checked against four open clusters and a moving group, showing excellent consistency. The new temperature and metallicity scales provide a better match to theoretical isochrones, which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar ages. With respect to previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter and 0.1 dex more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity distribution function around the solar value. From Strömgren photometry we are able to derive for the ﬁrst time a proxy for [α/Fe] abundances, which enables us to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin and thick disc. We ﬁnd evidence for the latter being composed of an old, mildly but systematically alpha-enhanced population that extends to super solar metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our revision oﬀers the largest existing kinematically unbiased sample of the solar neighbourhood that contains full information on kinematics, metallicities, and ages and thus provides better constraints on the physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way disc, enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context.},

for models of Galactic evolution. The Geneva-Copenhagen Survey of the
Solar Neighbourhood (Nordström et al. 2004; GCS), a
magnitude-complete, kinematically unbiased sample of 16 682 nearby F and
G dwarfs, is the largest available sample with complete data for stars
with ages spanning that of the disk. Aims: We aim to improve the
accuracy of the GCS data by implementing the recent revision of the
Hipparcos parallaxes. Methods: The new parallaxes yield improved
astrometric distances for 12 506 stars in the GCS. We also use the
parallaxes to verify the distance calibration for uvbyβ photometry
by Holmberg et al. (2007, A\&A, 475, 519; GCS II). We add new
selection criteria to exclude evolved cool stars giving unreliable
results and derive distances for 3580 stars with large parallax errors
or not observed by Hipparcos. We also check the GCS II scales of T\_eff
and [Fe/H] and find no need for change. Results: Introducing the
new distances, we recompute MV for 16 086 stars, and U, V, W,
and Galactic orbital parameters for the 13 520 stars that also have
radial-velocity measurements. We also recompute stellar ages from the
Padova stellar evolution models used in GCS I-II, using the new values
of M\_V, and compare them with ages from the Yale-Yonsei and
Victoria-Regina models. Finally, we compare the observed age-velocity
relation in W with three simulated disk heating scenarios to show the
potential of the data. Conclusions: With these revisions, the
basic data for the GCS stars should now be as reliable as is possible
with existing techniques. Further improvement must await consolidation
of the T\_eff scale from angular diameters and fluxes, and the Gaia
trigonometric parallaxes. We discuss the conditions for improving
computed stellar ages from new input data, and for distinguishing
different disk heating scenarios from data sets of the size and
precision of the GCS.

	abstract = {We present a self-consistent, absolute isochronal age scale for young ( 
≲ 200 Myr), nearby ( ≲ 100 pc) moving groups in the solar
neighbourhood based on homogeneous fitting of semi-empirical
pre-main-sequence model isochrones using the τ2
maximum-likelihood fitting statistic of Naylor \& Jeffries in the
MV, V - J colour-magnitude diagram. The final adopted ages
for the groups are as follows: 149{\textasciicircum}\{+51\}\_\{-19\} \{Myr\} for the AB Dor
moving group, 24 ± 3 Myr for the β Pic moving group (BPMG),
45{\textasciicircum}\{+11\}\_\{-7\} \{Myr\} for the Carina association, 42{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-4\} \{Myr\} for
the Columba association, 11 ± 3 Myr for the η Cha cluster, 45
± 4 Myr for the Tucana-Horologium moving group (Tuc-Hor), 10
± 3 Myr for the TW Hya association and 22{\textasciicircum}\{+4\}\_\{-3\} \{Myr\} for the
32 Ori group. At this stage we are uncomfortable assigning a final,
unambiguous age to the Argus association as our membership list for the
association appears to suffer from a high level of contamination, and
therefore it remains unclear whether these stars represent a single
population of coeval stars. Our isochronal ages for both the BPMG and
Tuc-Hor are consistent with recent lithium depletion boundary (LDB)
ages, which unlike isochronal ages, are relatively insensitive to the
choice of low-mass evolutionary models. This consistency between the
isochronal and LDB ages instils confidence that our self-consistent,
absolute age scale for young, nearby moving groups is robust, and hence
we suggest that these ages be adopted for future studies of these
groups. Software implementing the methods described in this study is

	abstract = {The eccentricity of a planet's orbit and the inclination of its orbital 
plane encode important information about its formation and history.
However, exoplanets detected via direct-imaging are often only observed
over a very small fraction of their period, making it challenging to
perform reliable physical inferences given wide, unconstrained
posteriors. The aim of this project is to investigate biases (deviation
of the median and mode of the posterior from the true values of orbital
parameters, and the width and coverage of their credible intervals) in
the estimation of orbital parameters of directly-imaged exoplanets,
particularly their eccentricities, and to define general guidelines to
perform better estimations of uncertainty. For this, we constructed
various orbits and generated mock data for each spanning \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5 {\textbackslash}\%\$
of the orbital period. We used the Orbits For The Impatient (OFTI)
algorithm to compute orbit posteriors, and compared those to the true
values of the orbital parameters. We found that the inclination of the
orbital plane is the parameter that most affects our estimations of
eccentricity, with orbits that appear near edge-on producing
eccentricity distributions skewed away from the true values, and often
bi-modal. We also identified a degeneracy between eccentricity and
inclination that makes it difficult to distinguish posteriors of
face-on, eccentric orbits and edge-on, circular orbits. For the
exoplanet-imaging community, we propose practical recommendations,
guidelines and warnings relevant to orbit-fitting.},

	abstract = {Young stellar associations hold a star formation record that can persist for millions of years, revealing the progression of star formation long after the dispersal of the natal cloud. To identify nearby young stellar populations that trace this progression, we have designed a comprehensive framework for the identification of young stars, and use it to identify \${\textbackslash}sim\$3\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ candidate young stars within a distance of 333 pc using Gaia DR2. Applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to this sample, we identify 27 top-level groups, nearly half of which have little to no presence in previous literature. Ten of these groups have visible substructure, including notable young associations such as Orion, Perseus, Taurus, and Sco-Cen. We provide a complete subclustering analysis on all groups with substructure, using age estimates to reveal each region's star formation history. The patterns we reveal include an apparent star formation origin for Sco-Cen along a semicircular arc, as well as clear evidence for sequential star formation moving away from that arc with a propagation speed of \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$4 pc Myr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). We also identify earlier bursts of star formation in Perseus and Taurus that predate current, kinematically identical active star-forming events, suggesting that the mechanisms that collect gas can spark multiple generations of star formation, punctuated by gas dispersal and cloud regrowth. The large spatial scales and long temporal scales on which we observe star formation offer a bridge between the processes within individual molecular clouds and the broad forces guiding star formation at galactic scales.},

Eight TESS objects of interest that were originally discovered by Kepler were previously observed using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument. Speckle observations of 186 TESS stars were carried out, and 45 (24\%) likely bound companions were detected. This is approximately the number of companions we would expect to observe given the established 46\% binarity rate in exoplanet host stars. For the detected binaries, the distribution of stellar mass ratio is consistent with that of the standard Raghavan distribution and may show a decrease in high-q systems as the binary separation increases. The distribution of binary orbital periods, however, is not consistent with the standard Ragahavan model, and our observations support the premise that exoplanet-hosting stars with binary companions have, in general, wider orbital separations than ﬁeld binaries. We ﬁnd that exoplanet-hosting binary star systems show a distribution peaking near 100 au, higher than the 40–50 au peak that is observed for ﬁeld binaries. This fact led to earlier suggestions that planet formation is suppressed in close binaries.},

We describe the equations of state of planetary materials and the construction of static structural models and thermal evolution models. We apply these models to transiting planets close to their parent stars, as well as directly imaged planets far from their parent stars. Mechanisms that have been postulated to inflate the radii of close-in transiting planets are discussed. We also review knowledge gained from the study of the solar system's giant planets. The frontiers of giant planet physics are discussed with an eye towards future planetary discoveries.

We also show evidence for an additional dependence on the color of the source, with a magnitude up to {\textasciitilde}10 μas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. However, a color correction proportional to the effective wavenumber is unsatisfactory for very red or very blue stars, and we do not recommend its use.

	abstract = {Planets are born from disks of gas and dust, and observations of protoplanetary disks are used to constrain the initial conditions of planet formation. However, dust mass measurements of Class II disks with ALMA have called into question whether they contain enough solids to build the exoplanets that have been detected to date. In this paper, we calculate the mass and spatial scale of solid material around Sun-like stars probed by transit and radial velocity exoplanet surveys, and compare those to the observed dust masses and sizes of Class II disks in the same stellar mass regime. We show that the apparent mass discrepancy disappears when accounting for observational selection and detection biases. We find a discrepancy only when the planet formation efficiency is below 100\%, or if there is a population of undetected exoplanets that significantly contributes to the mass in solids. We identify a positive correlation between the masses of planetary systems and their respective orbital periods, which is consistent with the trend between the masses and the outer radii of Class II dust disks. This implies that, despite a factor 100 difference in spatial scale, the properties of protoplanetary disks seem to be imprinted on the exoplanet population.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04604},
	abstract = {High-contrast imaging observations are fundamentally limited by the spatially and temporally correlated noise source called speckles. Suppression of speckle noise is the key goal of wavefront control and adaptive optics (AO), coronagraphy, and a host of post-processing techniques. Speckles average at a rate set by the statistical speckle lifetime, and speckle-limited integration time in long exposures is directly proportional to this lifetime. As progress continues in post-coronagraph wavefront control, residual atmospheric speckles will become the limiting noise source in high-contrast imaging, so a complete understanding of their statistical behavior is crucial to optimizing high-contrast imaging instruments. Here we present a novel power spectral density (PSD) method for calculating the lifetime, and develop a semi-analytic method for predicting intensity PSDs behind a coronagraph. Considering a frozen-flow turbulence model, we analyze the residual atmosphere speckle lifetimes in a MagAO-X-like AO system as well as 25--39 m giant segmented mirror telescope (GSMT) scale systems. We find that standard AO control shortens atmospheric speckle lifetime from {\textasciitilde}130 ms to {\textasciitilde}50 ms, and predictive control will further shorten the lifetime to {\textasciitilde}20 ms on 6.5 m MagAO-X. We find that speckle lifetimes vary with diameter, wind speed, seeing, and location within the AO control region. On bright stars lifetimes remain within a rough range of {\textasciitilde}20 ms to {\textasciitilde}100 ms. Due to control system dynamics there are no simple scaling laws which apply across a wide range of system characteristics. Finally, we use these results to argue that telemetry-based post-processing should enable ground-based telescopes to achieve the photon-noise limit in high-contrast imaging.},

To address this issue, we calculate a large suite of giant planet evolution models using a state-of-the-art planetary evolution code. Using these data, we create the python program planetsynth that generates synthetic cooling tracks by interpolation. Given the planetary mass, bulk \& atmospheric metallicity, and incident stellar irradiation, the program calculates how the planetary radius, luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity evolve with time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our models by inferring time-dependent mass-radius diagrams, estimating the metallicities from mass-radius measurements, and by showing how atmospheric measurements can further constrain the planetary bulk composition. We also estimate the mass and metallicity of the young giant planet 51 Eri b from its observed luminosity. Synthetic evolution tracks have many applications, and we suggest that they are valuable for both theoretical and observational investigations into the nature of giant planets.},

	abstract = {The extensive time span of modern radial velocity surveys has made the discovery of long-period substellar companions more common in recent years; however, measuring the true masses of these objects remains challenging. Astrometry from the Gaia mission is expected to provide mass measurements for many of these long-period companions, but these data are not yet available. However, combining proper-motion data from Gaia DR2 and the earlier Hipparcos mission makes it possible to measure true masses of substellar companions in favorable cases. In this work, we combine radial velocities with Hipparcos–Gaia astrometry to measure the true masses of two recently discovered long-period substellar companion candidates, HD 92987 B and HD 221420 b. In both cases, we find that the true masses are significantly higher than implied by radial velocities alone. A 2087 ± 19 m s−1 astrometric signal reveals that HD 92987 B is not close to its 17 M J minimum mass but is instead a 0.2562 ± 0.0045 M ⊙ star viewed at a near-polar orbital inclination, whereas the 22.9 ± 2.2 M J HD 221420 b can be plausibly interpreted as a high-mass “superplanet” or a low-mass brown dwarf. With semimajor axes of ∼10 au, both companions are interesting targets for direct imaging, and HD 221420 b in particular would be a benchmark metal-rich substellar object if it proves possible to directly detect. Our results demonstrate the power of Hipparcos–Gaia astrometry for studying long-period planet and brown dwarf candidates discovered from radial velocity surveys.},

This paper is dedicated to investigating the kinematic properties of the Lupus moving group of young stars with the primary objective of deriving individual parallaxes for each group member. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We identify those stars in the Lupus star-forming region that define the comoving association of young stars by utilizing our new and improved convergent point search method that allows us to derive the precise position of the convergent point of the comoving association from the stars' proper motions. We used published proper motion catalogs and searched the literature for radial velocities, which are needed to compute individual parallaxes. We supplemented the radial velocity data with new measurements from spectroscopic observations performed with the FEROS spectrograph mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope at La Silla. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We identify a comoving group with 109 pre-main sequence stars and candidates that define the kinematic properties of the Lupus low-mass star-forming region. We derive individual parallaxes for stars with known radial velocity and tentative parallaxes for the remaining group members by assuming that all stars share the same space motion. The convergent point method, combined with the k-NN algorithm, makes it possible to distinguish the Lupus and Upper Centaurus Lupus stars from the adjacent Scorpius-Centaurus association. We find significant depth effects in this region and show that the classical T Tauri stars, located in the close vicinity of the Lupus molecular clouds, form a background population, while the weak-emission line T Tauri stars are dispersed not only in angular extent but also in depth. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The newly derived individual parallaxes will be used in a forthcoming paper to refine the masses and ages of Lupus T Tauri stars, with the aim of better constraining the lifetimes of their circumstellar, protoplanetary disks. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based partly on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (ESO Programme 087.C-0315).Tables 4, 7, and Appendices A, B are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

Using an X-ray, proper motion and colour-magnitude selected sample, we obtained spectra for 361 stars, for which we report spectral classifications and Li and Hα equivalent widths. We identified 156 new members of Sco-Cen, and recovered 51 previously published members. We have combined these with previously known members to form a sample of 493 solar-mass (∼0.7-1.3 M⊙) members of Sco-Cen. We investigated the star formation history of this sample, and re-assessed the ages of the massive main-sequence turn-off and the G-type members in all three subgroups. We performed a census for circumstellar discs in our sample using WISE infrared data and find a protoplanetary disc fraction for K-type stars of 4.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.6\}\_\{-0.9\} per cent for Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux at ∼16 Myr and 9.0{\textasciicircum}\{+4.0\}\_\{-2.2\} per cent for Upper Scorpius at ∼10 Myr. These data are consistent with a protoplanetary disc e-folding time-scale of ∼4-5 Myr for ∼1 M⊙ stars, twice that previously quoted, but consistent with the Bell et al. revised age scale of young clusters. Finally, we construct an age map of Scorpius-Centaurus which clearly reveals substructure consisting of concentrations of younger and older stars. We find evidence for strong age gradients within all three subgroups. None of the subgroups are consistent with being simple, coeval populations which formed in single bursts, but likely represents a multitude of smaller star formation episodes of hundreds to tens of stars each.},

We would like to extend this definition to young stars (up to ≈50 Myr) of any spectral type and to identify those present in the Hipparcos catalogue by applying different selection criteria, such as peculiar space velocities or peculiar one-dimensional velocities. Runaway stars are important for studying the evolution of multiple star systems or star clusters, as well as for identifying the origins of neutron stars. We compile the distances, proper motions, spectral types, luminosity classes, V magnitudes and B-V colours, and we utilize evolutionary models from different authors to obtain star ages. We study a sample of 7663 young Hipparcos stars within 3 kpc from the Sun. The radial velocities are obtained from the literature. We investigate the distributions of the peculiar spatial velocity and the peculiar radial velocity as well as the peculiar tangential velocity and its one-dimensional components and we obtain runaway star probabilities for each star in the sample. In addition, we look for stars that are situated outside any OB association or OB cluster and the Galactic plane as well as stars for which the velocity vector points away from the median velocity vector of neighbouring stars or the surrounding local OB association/cluster (although the absolute velocity might be small). We find a total of 2547 runaway star candidates (with a contamination of normal Population I stars of 20 per cent at most). Thus, after subtracting these 20 per cent, the runaway frequency among young stars is about 27 per cent. We compile a catalogue of runaway stars, which is available via VizieR.},

	abstract = {Based on two decades of radial velocity (RV) observations using Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and McDonald/Tull, and more recent observations using the Automated Planet Finder, we found that the nearby star HR 5183 (HD 120066) hosts a 3 \{M\}\{\{J\}\} minimum mass planet with an orbital period of \{74\}-22+43 yr. The orbit is highly eccentric (e ≃ 0.84), shuttling the planet from within the orbit of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune. Our careful survey design enabled high cadence observations before, during, and after the planet’s periastron passage, yielding precise orbital parameter constraints. We searched for stellar or planetary companions that could have excited the planet’s eccentricity, but found no candidates, potentially implying that the perturber was ejected from the system. We did identify a bound stellar companion more than 15,000 au from the primary, but reasoned that it is currently too widely separated to have an appreciable effect on HR 5183 b. Because HR 5183 b’s wide orbit takes it more than 30 au (1″) from its star, we also explored the potential of complimentary studies with direct imaging or stellar astrometry. We found that a Gaia detection is very likely, and that imaging at 10 μm is a promising avenue. This discovery highlights the value of long-baseline RV surveys for discovering and characterizing long-period, eccentric Jovian planets. This population may offer important insights into the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing multiple massive planets.},

We have derived the spectral types and estimated distances for all of our stars. The spectral types range between K5 and M6. Nearly half of our stars lie within 50 pc. We have measured the equivalent width of the Hα emission line. Our targets show an increase in chromospheric activity from early to midspectral types, with a peak in activity around M5. Using the count rate and hardness ratios obtained from the ROSAT catalog, we have derived the X-ray luminosities. Our stars display a ``saturation-type'' relation between the chromospheric and coronal activity. The relation is such that logLX/Lbol remains ``saturated'' at a value of approximately -3 for varying Hα equivalent width. We have found 568 matches in the USNO-B catalog and have derived the tangential velocities for these stars. There is a slight trend of decreasing chromospheric activity with age, such that the stars with higher vtan have lower Hα equivalent widths. The coronal emission, however, remains saturated at a value of logLX/Lbol{\textasciitilde}-3 for varying tangential velocities, suggesting that the coronal activity remains saturated with age. We do not find any break in the saturation-type relation at the spectral type at which stars become fully convective ({\textasciitilde}M3.5). Most of the stars in our sample show more coronal emission than the dMe stars in the Hyades and Praesepe and have vtan{\textless}40 km s-1, suggesting a young population.},

	abstract = {We have obtained intermediate-resolution optical spectroscopy of 44 candidate very low mass members of the nearby young open cluster IC 2391. Of these, 26 spectra are totally new, 14 had been analyzed in a previous paper, and another four are in common with that paper. These spectra, taken at the Cerro Tololo 4 m and Magellan I and II telescopes, allow us to confirm 33 of them as likely cluster members, based on their spectral types, the presence of Li, and Hα emission. Among these new cluster members is CTIO-160 (M7), the first IC 2391 candidate to satisfy all criteria for being a substellar member of the cluster, including detection of the Li 6708 Å doublet. With the enlarged membership, we are able to locate the lithium depletion boundary of the cluster more reliably than in the past. On the basis of comparison of several theoretical models, we derive an age of 50 ± 5 Myr for IC 2391. We also estimate new ages for the α Per and Pleiades clusters; our ages are 85 ± 10 and 130 ± 20 Myr, respectively. We derive an estimate of the initial mass function of IC 2391 that extends to below the substellar limit and compare it to those of other well-studied young open clusters. The index of the power-law mass function for IC 2391 is α = 0.96 ± 0.12, valid in the range 0.5-0.072 M☉.}

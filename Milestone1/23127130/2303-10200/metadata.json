    "abstract": "We report the confirmation of HIP 67506 C, a new stellar companion to HIP 67506 A. We previously reported a candidate signal at 2$λ$/D (240~mas) in L$^{\\prime}$ in MagAO/Clio imaging using the binary differential imaging technique. Several additional indirect signals showed that the candidate signal merited follow-up: significant astrometric acceleration in Gaia DR3, Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly, and overluminosity compared to single main sequence stars. We confirmed the companion, HIP 67506 C, at 0.1\" with MagAO-X in April, 2022. We characterized HIP 67506 C MagAO-X photometry and astrometry, and estimated spectral type K7-M2; we also re-evaluated HIP 67506 A in light of the close companion. Additionally we show that a previously identified 9\" companion, HIP 67506 B, is a much further distant unassociated background star. We also discuss the utility of indirect signposts in identifying small inner working angle candidate companions.",

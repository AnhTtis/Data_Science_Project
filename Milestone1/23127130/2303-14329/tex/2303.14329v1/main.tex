\begin{abstract}
Edge computing has been getting a momentum with ever-increasing data at the edge of the network. In particular, huge amounts of video data and their real-time processing requirements have been increasingly hindering the traditional cloud computing approach due to high bandwidth consumption and high latency. 
Edge computing in essence aims to overcome this hindrance by processing most video data making use of edge servers, such as small-scale on-premises server clusters, server-grade computing resources at mobile base stations and even mobile devices like smartphones and tablets; hence, the term edge-based video analytics. However, the actual realization of such analytics requires more than the simple, collective use of edge servers. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art works on edge-based video analytics with respect to applications, architectures, techniques, resource management, security and privacy. We provide a comprehensive and detailed review on what works, what doesn't work and why. These findings give insights and suggestions for next generation edge-based video analytics. We also identify open issues and research directions.

% Edge-based video analytics show great potential to be applied in many intelligent system design, e.g., autonomous driving and smart city, and has been an area of intense research in the past few years. Given an image/video taken from cameras, edge-based video analytic is the process of extracting the features from images/videos and applying these features into some emerging applications, e.g., surveillance, robotics, multimedia and forensics. These applications urgently require a real-time information feedback, e.g., find the criminal from the crowd or count the number of people in a given region. It is quite challenging to design and implement an edge-based video analytics system. The challenges include but are not limited to the geo-distributed cameras, the dynamics of objects to be analyzed, the spatio-temporal uncertainty in an object's appearance across different cameras, the heterogeneous configurations of edge servers, etc. These difficulties are often compounded by low resolution images or poor quality video feeds with large amounts of unrelated information in them that puts more challenges on the edge-based video analytics design. In this survey, we explore the problem of edge-based video analytics design and discuss the state-of-the-art solutions. We first list the killing applications that require a real-time video analytics technology assistance. Then we summarize three efficient and widely used architectures for edge-based video analytics. Specifically, we highlight the state-of-the-art technologies for video analytics in the edge-based architecture. We also summarize the resource management and security/privacy issues aiming at edge-based video analytics. Last but not the least, open issues and challenges of the problem are highlighted with a discussion on potential directions for further research.

\section{Conclusion}
Edge-based video analytics have emerged as one of the most widely adapted implementations for various smart services, entertainment, safety and security. This survey has made an overarching taxonomy that covers key aspects of edge-based video analytics with respect to use cases, architectures, techniques, resource management, and security and privacy. Besides, some recommendations on future research issues and directions are provided. In particular, we have identified edge-based solutions have the following main advantages. 
\emph{Firstly}, a low response time is urgently required for most video analytics applications. However, local execution (executed on end devices) efficiency is harsh restricted by the computation resources. Differently, the tasks executed on the cloud are rarely affected by the computation resources. Nevertheless, the video content transmission requires high bandwidth, which is hard to achieve by the cloud computing. Edge computing brings computation and communication closer to the task source, and improves response times.
\emph{Secondly}, located between end devices and remote cloud, edge servers provide a new dimension of dynamical resource allocation that can promote system optimization.
The resource provisioning scalability from edge servers provides greater potential to achieve better service performance.
\emph{Thirdly}, edge servers can provide more security and privacy guarantee. Due to the storage limitation, the video contents cannot be all locally stored, and the edge servers can be a good candidate providing privacy-preserving storage solutions. Compared to the video collection, analytics, storage at the cloud, the edge-based solution can provision better privacy preservation due to its distributed properties.
As a result, edge-based video analytics solutions can be leveraged as a general framework to support several privacy-preserving video analytics applications.

In this work, we presented FlexNeRF: a novel method for photorealistic free-viewpoint rendering of moving humans starting with monocular videos. Our proposed framework utilizes pose-independent temporal deformation along with cycle consistency to better model the complex human motions with sparse input views. Experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in rendering novel viewpoints. We hope that our work will spark future research in the challenging problem of free-viewpoint rendering from in-the-wild videos.

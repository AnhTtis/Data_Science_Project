    "abstract": "In parametric down conversion, a nonlinear crystal is pumped by a laser and spontaneous emission takes place in signal and idler modes according to the phase matching conditions. A seed laser can stimulate the emission in the signal beam if there is mode overlap between them. This also enhances the emission in the idler beam, affecting its coherence properties. While the degree of coherence of the idler field as a function of the seed power has already been studied, the transverse coherence length has not yet been properly investigated. The transverse coherence length is a key parameter of optical beams that determines the beam divergence, for example. Here, we present a theoretical and experimental investigation of the transverse coherence length in stimulated down conversion. In addition, we make a connection between stimulated down conversion and partially coherent sources like the Gaussian Schell model beams, and show that in general the idler field cannot be described with this model.",

    "abstract": "Clustering with capacity constraints is a fundamental problem that attracted\nsignificant attention throughout the years. In this paper, we give the first\nFPT constant-factor approximation algorithm for the problem of clustering\npoints in a general metric into $k$ clusters to minimize the sum of cluster\nradii, subject to non-uniform hard capacity constraints. In particular, we give\na $(15+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that runs in $2^{0(k^2\\log k)}\\cdot\nn^3$ time. When capacities are uniform, we obtain the following improved\napproximation bounds: A (4 + $\\epsilon$)-approximation with running time\n$2^{O(k\\log(k/\\epsilon))}n^3$, which significantly improves over the FPT\n28-approximation of Inamdar and Varadarajan [ESA 2020]; a (2 +\n$\\epsilon$)-approximation with running time $2^{O(k/\\epsilon^2\n\\cdot\\log(k/\\epsilon))}dn^3$ and a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation with running\ntime $2^{O(kd\\log ((k/\\epsilon)))}n^{3}$ in the Euclidean space; and a (1 +\n$\\epsilon$)-approximation in the Euclidean space with running time\n$2^{O(k/\\epsilon^2 \\cdot\\log(k/\\epsilon))}dn^3$ if we are allowed to violate\nthe capacities by (1 + $\\epsilon$)-factor. We complement this result by showing\nthat there is no (1 + $\\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm running in time\n$f(k)\\cdot n^{O(1)}$, if any capacity violation is not allowed.",

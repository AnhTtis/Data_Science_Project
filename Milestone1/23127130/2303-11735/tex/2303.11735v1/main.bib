 abstract = {Tensor networks are often used to accurately represent ground states of quantum spin chains. Two popular choices of such tensor network representations can be seen to implement linear maps that correspond, respectively, to euclidean time evolution and to global scale transformations. In this paper, by exploiting the local structure of the tensor networks, we explain how to also implement local or non-uniform versions of both euclidean time evolution and scale transformations. We demonstrate our proposal with a critical quantum spin chain on a finite circle, where the low energy physics is described by a conformal field theory (CFT), and where non-uniform euclidean time evolution and local scale transformations are conformal transformations acting on the Hilbert space of the CFT. We numerically show, for the critical quantum Ising chain, that the proposed tensor networks indeed transform the low energy states of the periodic spin chain in the same way as the corresponding conformal transformations do in the CFT.},

 abstract = {In this paper we tackle the problem of dynamic portfolio optimization, i.e., determining the optimal trading trajectory for an investment portfolio of assets over a period of time, taking into account transaction costs and other possible constraints. This problem is central to quantitative finance. After a detailed introduction to the problem, we implement a number of quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms on different hardware platforms to solve its discrete formulation using real data from daily prices over 8 years of 52 assets, and do a detailed comparison of the obtained Sharpe ratios, profits and computing times. In particular, we implement classical solvers (Gekko, exhaustive), D-Wave Hybrid quantum annealing, two different approaches based on Variational Quantum Eigensolvers on IBM-Q (one of them brand-new and tailored to the problem), and for the first time in this context also a quantum-inspired optimizer based on Tensor Networks. In order to fit the data into each specific hardware platform, we also consider doing a preprocessing based on clustering of assets. From our comparison, we conclude that D-Wave Hybrid and Tensor Networks are able to handle the largest systems, where we do calculations up to 1272 fully-connected qubits for demonstrative purposes. Finally, we also discuss how to mathematically implement other possible real-life constraints, as well as several ideas to further improve the performance of the studied methods.},

@article{Murg.2015,
 abstract = {We study the tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) method with variable tensor orders for quantum chemistry. TTNS is a variational method to efficiently approximate complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction (CI) wave functions in a tensor product form. TTNS can be considered as a higher order generalization of the matrix product state (MPS) method. The MPS wave function is formulated as products of matrices in a multiparticle basis spanning a truncated Hilbert space of the original CAS-CI problem. These matrices belong to active orbitals organized in a one-dimensional array, while tensors in TTNS are defined upon a tree-like arrangement of the same orbitals. The tree-structure is advantageous since the distance between two arbitrary orbitals in the tree scales only logarithmically with the number of orbitals N, whereas the scaling is linear in the MPS array. It is found to be beneficial from the computational costs point of view to keep strongly correlated orbitals in close vicinity in both arrangements; therefore, the TTNS ansatz is better suited for multireference problems with numerous highly correlated orbitals. To exploit the advantages of TTNS a novel algorithm is designed to optimize the tree tensor network topology based on quantum information theory and entanglement. The superior performance of the TTNS method is illustrated on the ionic-neutral avoided crossing of LiF. It is also shown that the avoided crossing of LiF can be localized using only ground state properties, namely one-orbital entanglement.},

 abstract = {The numerical simulation of quantum circuits is an indispensable tool for development, verification and validation of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms on near-term quantum co-processors. The emergence of exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms presents new opportunities for pushing the boundaries of quantum circuit simulation. We present a modernized version of the Tensor Network Quantum Virtual Machine (TNQVM) which serves as a quantum circuit simulation backend in the eXtreme-scale ACCelerator (XACC) framework. The new version is based on the general purpose, scalable tensor network processing library, ExaTN, and provides multiple configurable quantum circuit simulators enabling either exact quantum circuit simulation via the full tensor network contraction, or approximate quantum state representations via suitable tensor factorizations. Upon necessity, stochastic noise modeling from real quantum processors is incorporated into the simulations by modeling quantum channels with Kraus tensors. By combining the portable XACC quantum programming frontend and the scalable ExaTN numerical backend we introduce an end-to-end virtual quantum development environment which can scale from laptops to future exascale platforms. We report initial benchmarks of our framework which include a demonstration of the distributed execution, incorporation of quantum decoherence models, and simulation of the random quantum circuits used for the certification of quantum supremacy on the Google Sycamore superconducting architecture.},

Computing ideal quantum state amplitudes for circuits of such and larger sizes is a fundamental step to assess both the correctness, performance, and scaling behavior of quantum algorithms and the fidelities of quantum devices. However, resource requirements for such calculations on classical computers grow exponentially. We show that deferring tensor contractions can extend the boundaries of what can be computed on classical systems. To demonstrate this technique, we present results obtained from a calculation of the complete set of output amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 27 in a 2D lattice of {\$}7 $\backslash $times 7{\$} qubits, and an arbitrarily selected slice of {\$}2{\^{}}{37}{\$} amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 23 in a 2D lattice of {\$}8 $\backslash $times 7{\$} qubits. Combining our methodology with other decomposition approaches found in the literature, we show that we can simulate {\$}7 $\backslash$times 7{\$}-qubit random circuits to arbitrary depth by leveraging secondary storage. These calculations were thought to be impossible due to resource requirements.},

Despite considerable advancements in recent years, the field of quantum machine learning (QML) has thus far lacked a set of comprehensive large-scale datasets upon which to benchmark the development of algorithms for use in applied and theoretical quantum settings. In this paper, we introduce such a dataset, the QDataSet, a quantum dataset designed specifically to facilitate the training and development of QML algorithms. The QDataSet comprises 52 high-quality publicly available datasets derived from simulations of one- and two-qubit systems evolving in the presence and/or absence of noise. The datasets are structured to provide a wealth of information to enable machine learning practitioners to use the QDataSet to solve problems in applied quantum computation, such as quantum control, quantum spectroscopy and tomography. Accompanying the datasets on the associated GitHub repository are a set of workbooks demonstrating the use of the QDataSet in a range of optimisation contexts.},

To develop and test quantum algorithms today, quantum circuits are often simulated on classical computers. Simulating a complex quantum circuit requires computing the contraction of a large network of tensors. The order (path) of contraction can have a drastic effect on the computing cost, but finding an efficient order is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem.  We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to address the contraction ordering problem. The problem is extremely challenging due to the huge search space, the heavy-tailed reward distribution, and the challenging credit assignment. We show how a carefully implemented RL-agent that uses a GNN as the basic policy construct can address these challenges and obtain significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques in three varieties of circuits, including the largest scale networks used in contemporary QC.},

Our simulator is designed to be extensible in both the tensor network form and the classical hardware used to run the simulation (multicore, GPU, distributed). The extensibility of the TNQVM simulator with respect to the simulation hardware type is achieved via a pluggable interface for different numerical backends (e.g., ITensor and ExaTENSOR numerical libraries). We demonstrate the utility of our TNQVM quantum circuit simulator through the verification of randomized quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, both expressed within the eXtreme-scale ACCelerator (XACC) programming model.},

Nonetheless, employment of machine learning for wave function representations is focused on more traditional architectures such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and fully-connected neural networks.

By constructing Tensor Network equivalents of these architectures, we identify an inherent reuse of information in the network operation as a key trait which distinguishes them from standard Tensor Network based representations, and which enhances their entanglement capacity. Our results show that such architectures can support volume-law entanglement scaling, polynomially more efficiently than presently employed RBMs. Thus, beyond a quantification of the entanglement capacity of leading deep learning architectures, our analysis formally motivates a shift of trending neural-network based wave function representations closer to the state-of-the-art in machine learning.},

 abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have witnessed unprecedented success in various machine learning applications. Formal understanding on what makes these networks so successful is gradually unfolding, but for the most part there are still significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects prior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this work, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum physics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel theoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each layer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias. Specifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave function, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This facilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined quantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate correlation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a deep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available. This description enables us to carry a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, with which we demonstrate a direct control over the inductive bias of the deep network via its channel numbers, that are related to the min-cut in the underlying graph. This result is relevant to any practitioner designing a network for a specific task. We theoretically analyze ConvACs, and empirically validate our findings on more common ConvNets which involve ReLU activations and max pooling. Beyond the results described above, the description of a deep convolutional network in well-defined graph-theoretic tools and the formal connection to quantum entanglement, are two interdisciplinary bridges that are brought forth by this work.},

 abstract = {Tensor networks (TN) have found a wide use in machine learning, and in particular, TN and deep learning bear striking similarities. In this work, we propose the quantum-classical hybrid tensor networks (HTN) which combine tensor networks with classical neural networks in a uniform deep learning framework to overcome the limitations of regular tensor networks in machine learning. We first analyze the limitations of regular tensor networks in the applications of machine learning involving the representation power and architecture scalability. We conclude that in fact the regular tensor networks are not competent to be the basic building blocks of deep learning. Then, we discuss the performance of HTN which overcome all the deficiency of regular tensor networks for machine learning. In this sense, we are able to train HTN in the deep learning way which is the standard combination of algorithms such as Back Propagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent. We finally provide two applicable cases to show the potential applications of HTN, including quantum states classification and quantum-classical autoencoder. These cases also demonstrate the great potentiality to design various HTN in deep learning way.},

Recently, they have been adapted to the field of machine learning, giving rise to an emergent research frontier that has attracted considerable attention. Here, we study the trainability of tensor-network based machine learning models by exploring the landscapes of different loss functions, with a focus on the matrix product states (also called tensor trains) architecture. In particular, we rigorously prove that barren plateaus (i.e., exponentially vanishing gradients) prevail in the training process of the machine learning algorithms with global loss functions. Whereas, for local loss functions the gradients with respect to variational parameters near the local observables do not vanish as the system size increases. Therefore, the barren plateaus are absent in this case and the corresponding models could be efficiently trainable. Our results reveal a crucial aspect of tensor-network based machine learning in a rigorous fashion, which provide a valuable guide for both practical applications and theoretical studies in the future.},

The architecture of QTN is composed of a parametric tensor-train network for feature extraction and a tensor product encoding for quantum embedding.

Because the entire model consists of tensor contractions (apart from the initial non-linear feature map), we can adaptively fine-grain the optimized MPS model backwards through the layers with essentially no loss in performance. The MPS itself is trained using an adaptive algorithm based on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm.

 abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to study the properties of many-body systems. Recently proposed as a tool to classify phases of matter, the approach relies on classical simulation methods$-$such as Monte Carlo$-$which are known to experience an exponential slowdown when simulating certain quantum systems. To overcome this slowdown while still leveraging machine learning, we propose a variational quantum algorithm which merges quantum simulation and quantum machine learning to classify phases of matter. Our classifier is directly fed labeled states recovered by the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, thereby avoiding the data reading slowdown experienced in many applications of quantum enhanced machine learning. We propose families of variational ansatz states that are inspired directly by tensor networks. This allows us to use tools from tensor network theory to explain properties of the phase diagrams the presented method recovers. Finally, we propose a nearest-neighbour (checkerboard) quantum neural network. This majority vote quantum classifier is successfully trained to recognize phases of matter with {\$}99\%$ accuracy for the transverse field Ising model and {\$}94\%$ accuracy for the XXZ model. These findings suggest that our merger between quantum simulation and quantum enhanced machine learning offers a fertile ground to develop computational insights into quantum systems.},

 abstract = {We describe a quantum-assisted machine learning (QAML) method in which multivariate data is encoded into quantum states in a Hilbert space whose dimension is exponentially large in the length of the data vector. Learning in this space occurs through applying a low-depth quantum circuit with a tree tensor network (TTN) topology, which acts as an unsupervised feature extractor to identify the most relevant quantum states in a data-driven fashion. This unsupervised feature extractor then feeds a supervised linear classifier and encodes the output in a small-dimensional quantum register. In contrast to previous work on \emph{quantum-inspired} TTN classifiers, in which the embedding map and class decision weights did not map the data to well-defined quantum states, we present an approach that can be implemented on gate-based quantum computing devices. In particular, we identify an embedding map with accuracy similar to exponential machines (Novikov \emph{et al.}, arXiv:1605.03795) , but which produces valid quantum states from classical data vectors, and utilize manifold-based gradient optimization schemes to produce isometric operations mapping quantum states to a register of qubits defining a class decision. We detail methods for efficiently obtaining one- and two-point correlation functions of the decision boundary vectors of the quantum model, which can be used for model interpretability, as well as methods for obtaining classifications from partial data vectors. Further, we show that the use of isometric tensors can significantly aid in the human interpretability of the correlation functions extracted from the decision weights, and may produce models that are less susceptible to adversarial perturbations.

We demonstrate our training and inference architecture on a synthetic dataset of six-site single-shot measurements from the bulk of a one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM) deep in its antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. We experimentally evaluate models on Quantinuum's H1-2 trapped ion quantum computer using entangled input data modeled as translationally invariant, bond dimension 4 MPSs across the known quantum phase transition of the TFIM.

Machine learning-based methods offer an alternative approach, as Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising success in many application domains including robotic manipulation, navigation, and playing video games. However, applying DRL to autonomous driving still faces many practical challenges in terms of slow learning rates, sample inefficiency, and safety concerns. In this study, we propose an automated lane change strategy using proximal policy optimization-based deep reinforcement learning, which shows great advantages in learning efficiency while still maintaining stable performance. The trained agent is able to learn a smooth, safe, and efficient driving policy to make lane-change decisions (i.e. when and how) in a challenging situation such as dense traffic scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed policy is validated by using metrics of task success rate and collision rate. The simulation results demonstrate the lane change maneuvers can be efficiently learned and executed in a safe, smooth, and efficient manner.},

@article{Wall.2021b,
 abstract = {Noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing devices have become an industrial reality in the last few years, and cloud-based interfaces to these devices are enabling exploration of near-term quantum computing on a range of problems. As NISQ devices are too noisy for many of the algorithms with a known quantum advantage, discovering impactful applications for near-term devices is the subject of intense research interest. We explore quantum-assisted machine learning (QAML) on NISQ devices through the perspective of tensor networks (TNs), which offer a robust platform for designing resource-efficient and expressive machine learning models to be dispatched on quantum devices. In particular, we lay out a framework for designing and optimizing TN-based QAML models using classical techniques, and then compiling these models to be run on quantum hardware, with demonstrations for generative matrix product state (MPS) models. We put forth a generalized canonical form for MPS models that aids in compilation to quantum devices, and demonstrate greedy heuristics for compiling with a given topology and gate set that outperforms known generic methods in terms of the number of entangling gates, e.g., CNOTs, in some cases by an order of magnitude. We present an exactly solvable benchmark problem for assessing the performance of MPS QAML models, and also present an application for the canonical MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The impacts of hardware topology and day-to-day experimental noise fluctuations on model performance are explored by analyzing both raw experimental counts and statistical divergences of inferred distributions. We also present parametric studies of depolarization and readout noise impacts on model performance using hardware simulators.},

While states with a finite correlation length typically give simple geometries, the state at a quantum critical point gives a discrete version of anti de Sitter space. Some finite temperature quantum states include black hole-like objects. The gross features of equal time correlation functions are also reproduced in this geometric framework.

Nevertheless, machine learning models used in modern image recognition systems consist of millions of parameters that usually require significant computational time to be adjusted. Moreover, adjustment of model hyperparameters leads to additional overhead. Because of this, new developments in machine learning models and hyperparameter optimization techniques are required. This paper presents a quantum-inspired hyperparameter optimization technique and a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for supervised learning. We benchmark our hyperparameter optimization method over standard black-box objective functions and observe performance improvements in the form of reduced expected run times and fitness in response to the growth in the size of the search space. We test our approaches in a car image classification task, and demonstrate a full-scale implementation of the hybrid quantum neural network model with the tensor train hyperparameter optimization. Our tests show a qualitative and quantitative advantage over the corresponding standard classical tabular grid search approach used with a deep neural network ResNet34. A classification accuracy of 0.97 was obtained by the hybrid model after 18 iterations, whereas the classical model achieved an accuracy of 0.92 after 75 iterations.},

A given data-set, quantum state or higher dimensional multi-linear map is factored and approximated by a composition of smaller multi-linear maps. This is reminiscent to how a Boolean function might be decomposed into a gate array: this represents a special case of tensor decomposition, in which the tensor entries are replaced by 0, 1 and the factorisation becomes exact. The collection of associated techniques are called, tensor network methods: the subject developed independently in several distinct fields of study, which have more recently become interrelated through the language of tensor networks. The tantamount questions in the field relate to expressability of tensor networks and the reduction of computational overheads. A merger of tensor networks with machine learning is natural. On the one hand, machine learning can aid in determining a factorization of a tensor network approximating a data set. On the other hand, a given tensor network structure can be viewed as a machine learning model. Herein the tensor network parameters are adjusted to learn or classify a data-set. In this survey we recover the basics of tensor networks and explain the ongoing effort to develop the theory of tensor networks in machine learning.},

However, to realize an $N$-qubit MPS with large $N$ and large entanglement on a quantum platform is extremely challenging, since it requires high-level qudits or multi-body gates of two-level qubits to carry the entanglement. In this work, an efficient method that accurately encodes a given MPS into a quantum circuit with only one- and two-qubit gates is proposed. The idea is to construct the unitary matrix product operators that optimally disentangle the MPS to a product state. These matrix product operators form the quantum circuit that evolves a product state to the targeted MPS with a high fidelity. Our benchmark on the ground-state MPS's of the strongly-correlated spin models show that the constructed quantum circuits can encode the MPS's with much fewer qubits than the sizes of the MPS's themselves. This method paves a feasible and efficient path to realizing quantum many-body states and other MPS-based models as quantum circuits on the near-term quantum platforms.},

 abstract = {The prospect of achieving quantum advantage with Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) is exciting. Understanding how QNN properties (e.g., the number of parameters $M$) affect the loss landscape is crucial to the design of scalable QNN architectures. Here, we rigorously analyze the overparametrization phenomenon in QNNs with periodic structure. We define overparametrization as the regime where the QNN has more than a critical number of parameters $M_c$ that allows it to explore all relevant directions in state space. Our main results show that the dimension of the Lie algebra obtained from the generators of the QNN is an upper bound for $M_c$, and for the maximal rank that the quantum Fisher information and Hessian matrices can reach. Underparametrized QNNs have spurious local minima in the loss landscape that start disappearing when {\$}M$\backslash$geq M{\_}c{\$}. Thus, the overparametrization onset corresponds to a computational phase transition where the QNN trainability is greatly improved by a more favorable landscape. We then connect the notion of overparametrization to the QNN capacity, so that when a QNN is overparametrized, its capacity achieves its maximum possible value. We run numerical simulations for eigensolver, compilation, and autoencoding applications to showcase the overparametrization computational phase transition. We note that our results also apply to variational quantum algorithms and quantum optimal control.},

Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum ap- proximate optimization algorithms that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea of using a classical computer to train a parameterized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that, for every polynomial time algorithm, there are instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large assuming P {\$}$\backslash$neq{\$} NP. Even for classically tractable systems composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show the optimization to be NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima. This means that gradient and higher order descent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.},

 abstract = {A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.},

 abstract = {The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems provides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems. Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes.  These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states.  The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.},

 abstract = {Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and subsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as [Formula: see text]. When only K $\ll$ T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to [Formula: see text]. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.},

 abstract = {We present a novel application of Tensor Network methods in cancer treatment as a potential tool to solve the dose optimization problem in radiotherapy. In particular, the intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique-that allows treating irregular and inhomogeneous tumors while reducing the radiation toxicity on healthy organs-is based on the optimization problem of the beamlets intensities that shall result in a maximal delivery of the therapy dose to cancer while avoiding the organs at risk of being damaged by the radiation. The resulting optimization problem is expressed as a cost function to be optimized. Here, we map the cost function into an Ising-like Hamiltonian, describing a system of long-range interacting qubits. Finally, we solve the dose optimization problem by finding the ground-state of the Hamiltonian using a Tree Tensor Network algorithm. In particular, we present an anatomical scenario exemplifying a prostate cancer treatment. A similar approach can be applied to future hybrid classical-quantum algorithms, paving the way for the use of quantum technologies in future medical treatments.},

Despite the potential to outperform classical models, serious bottlenecks exist for training QNNs; namely, QNNs with random structures have poor trainability due to the vanishing gradient with rate exponential to the input qubit number. The vanishing gradient could seriously influence the applications of large-size QNNs. In this work, we provide a viable solution with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that QNNs with tree tensor and step controlled architectures have gradients that vanish at most polynomially with the qubit number. We numerically demonstrate QNNs with tree tensor and step controlled structures for the application of binary classification. Simulations show faster convergent rates and better accuracy compared to QNNs with random structures.},

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

It focuses on tensor network models for super-compressed higher-order representation of data/parameters and related cost functions, while providing an outline of their applications in machine learning and data analytics. A particular emphasis is on the tensor train (TT) and Hierarchical Tucker (HT) decompositions, and their physically meaningful interpretations which reflect the scalability of the tensor network approach. Through a graphical approach, we also elucidate how, by virtue of the underlying low-rank tensor approximations and sophisticated contractions of core tensors, tensor networks have the ability to perform distributed computations on otherwise prohibitively large volumes of data/parameters, thereby alleviating or even eliminating the curse of dimensionality. The usefulness of this concept is illustrated over a number of applied areas, including generalized regression and classification (support tensor machines, canonical correlation analysis, higher order partial least squares), generalized eigenvalue decomposition, Riemannian optimization, and in the optimization of deep neural networks.

 abstract = {We introduce a new framework that leverages machine learning models known as generative models to solve optimization problems. Our Generator-Enhanced Optimization (GEO) strategy is flexible to adopt any generative model, from quantum to quantum-inspired or classical, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or Quantum Circuit Born Machines, to name a few. Here, we focus on a quantum-inspired version of GEO relying on tensor-network Born machines and referred to hereafter as TN-GEO. We present two prominent strategies for using TN-GEO. The first uses data points previously evaluated by any quantum or classical optimizer, and we show how TN-GEO improves the performance of the classical solver as a standalone strategy in hard-to-solve instances. The second strategy uses TN-GEO as a standalone solver, i.e., when no previous observations are available. Here, we show its superior performance when the goal is to find the best minimum given a fixed budget for the number of function calls. This might be ideal in situations where the cost function evaluation can be very expensive. To illustrate our results, we run these benchmarks in the context of the portfolio optimization problem by constructing instances from the S\&P 500 and several other financial stock indexes. We also comprehensively compare state-of-the-art algorithms in a generalized version of the portfolio optimization problem. The results show that TN-GEO is among the best compared to these state-of-the-art algorithms; a remarkable outcome given the solvers used in the comparison have been fine-tuned for decades in this real-world industrial application. We see this as an important step toward a practical advantage with quantum-inspired models and, subsequently, with quantum generative models.},

This study illustrates their use for the optimization of randomly-initialized parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in the region of vanishing gradients. We show that using the NES gradient estimator the exponential decrease in variance can be alleviated. We implement two specific approaches, the exponential and separable natural evolutionary strategies, for parameter optimization of PQCs and compare them against standard gradient descent. We apply them to two different problems of ground state energy estimation using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and state preparation with circuits of varying depth and length. We also introduce batch optimization for circuits with larger depth to extend the use of evolutionary strategies to a larger number of parameters. We achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art optimization techniques in all the above cases with a lower number of circuit evaluations. Our empirical results indicate that one can use NES as a hybrid tool in tandem with other gradient-based methods for optimization of deep quantum circuits in regions with vanishing gradients.},

 abstract = {Tensor Networks (TN) are approximations of high-dimensional tensors designed to represent locally entangled quantum many-body systems efficiently. This study provides a comprehensive comparison between classical TNs and TN-inspired quantum circuits in the context of Machine Learning on highly complex, simulated LHC data. We show that classical TNs require exponentially large bond dimensions and higher Hilbert-space mapping to perform comparably to their quantum counterparts. While such an expansion in the dimensionality allows better performance, we observe that, with increased dimensionality, classical TNs lead to a highly flat loss landscape, rendering the usage of gradient-based optimization methods highly challenging. Furthermore, by employing quantitative metrics, such as the Fisher information and effective dimensions, we show that classical TNs require a more extensive training sample to represent the data as efficiently as TN-inspired quantum circuits. We also engage with the idea of hybrid classical-quantum TNs and show possible architectures to employ a larger phase-space from the data. We offer our results using three main TN ansatz: Tree Tensor Networks, Matrix Product States, and Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalisation Ansatz.},

 abstract = {Given an image of a white shoe drawn on a blackboard, how are the white pixels deemed (say by human minds) to be informative for recognizing the shoe without any labeling information on the pixels? Here we investigate such a ``white shoe'' recognition problem from the perspective of tensor network (TN) machine learning and quantum entanglement. Utilizing a generative TN that captures the probability distribution of the features as quantum amplitudes, we propose an unsupervised recognition scheme of informative features with the variations of entanglement entropy (EE) caused by designed measurements. In this way, a given sample, where the values of its features are statistically meaningless, is mapped to the variations of EE that statistically characterize the gain of information. We show that the EE variations identify the features that are critical to recognize this specific sample, and the EE itself reveals the information distribution of the probabilities represented by the TN model. The signs of the variations further reveal the entanglement structures among the features. We test the validity of our scheme on a toy dataset of strip images, the MNIST dataset of hand-drawn digits, the fashion-MNIST dataset of the pictures of fashion articles, and the images of brain cells. Our scheme opens the avenue to the quantum-inspired and interpreted unsupervised learning, which can be applied to, e.g., image segmentation and object detection.},

However, optimizing tensor networks using standard gradient descent has proven to be difficult in practice. Tensor networks suffer from initialization problems resulting in exploding or vanishing gradients and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. Efforts to overcome these problems usually depend on specific network architectures, or ad hoc prescriptions. In this paper we address the problems of initialization and hyperparameter tuning, making it possible to train tensor networks using established machine learning techniques. We introduce a `copy node' method that successfully initializes arbitrary tensor networks, in addition to a gradient based regularization technique for bond dimensions. We present numerical results that show that the combination of techniques presented here produces quantum inspired tensor network models with far fewer parameters, while improving generalization performance.},

 abstract = {Tensor networks have emerged as promising tools for machine learning, inspired by their widespread use as variational ansatze in quantum many-body physics. It is well known that the success of a given tensor network ansatz depends in part on how well it can reproduce the underlying entanglement structure of the target state, with different network designs favoring different scaling patterns. We demonstrate here how a related correlation analysis can be applied to tensor network machine learning, and explore whether classical data possess correlation scaling patterns similar to those found in quantum states which might indicate the best network to use for a given dataset. We utilize mutual information as measure of correlations in classical data, and show that it can serve as a lower-bound on the entanglement needed for a probabilistic tensor network classifier. We then develop a logistic regression algorithm to estimate the mutual information between bipartitions of data features, and verify its accuracy on a set of Gaussian distributions designed to mimic different correlation patterns. Using this algorithm, we characterize the scaling patterns in the MNIST and Tiny Images datasets, and find clear evidence of boundary-law scaling in the latter. This quantum-inspired classical analysis offers insight into the design of tensor networks which are best suited for specific learning tasks.},

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits.},

Indeed, its characterization would enable better decisions on energy-saving strategies, e.g. for distributing the workload in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Here, we show that the green quantum advantage threshold crucially depends on (i) the quality of the experimental quantum gates and (ii) the entanglement generated in the QPU. Indeed, for NISQ hardware and algorithms requiring a moderate amount of entanglement, a classical tensor network emulation can be more energy-efficient at equal final state fidelity than quantum computation. We compute the green quantum advantage threshold for a few paradigmatic examples in terms of algorithms and hardware platforms, and identify algorithms with a power-law decay of singular values of bipartitions $-$ with power-law exponent {\$}$\backslash$alpha \lesssim 1{\$} $-$ as the green quantum advantage threshold in the near future.},

It is challenging to design an efficient machine learning model with respect to tiny object of interest. Current neural network structures are unable to deal with tiny object efficiently because they are mainly developed for images featured by large scale objects. However, in quantum physics, there is a great theoretical foundation guiding us to analyze the target function for image classification regarding to specific objects size ratio. In our work, we apply Tensor Networks to solve this arising tough machine learning problem. First, we summarize the previous work that connects quantum spin model to image classification and bring the theory into the scenario of tiny object classification. Second, we propose using 2D multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) to classify tiny objects in image.

 abstract = {The advent of noisy-intermediate scale quantum computers has introduced the exciting possibility of achieving quantum speedups in machine learning tasks. These devices, however, are composed of a small number of qubits, and can faithfully run only short circuits. This puts many proposed approaches for quantum machine learning beyond currently available devices. We address the problem of efficiently compressing and loading classical data for use on a quantum computer. Our proposed methods allow both the required number of qubits and depth of the quantum circuit to be tuned. We achieve this by using a correspondence between matrix-product states and quantum circuits, and further propose a hardware-efficient quantum circuit approach, which we benchmark on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Finally, we demonstrate that a quantum circuit based classifier can achieve competitive accuracy with current tensor learning methods using only 11 qubits.},

@article{Evenbly.2011,
 abstract = {Tensor network states are used to approximate ground states of local Hamiltonians on a lattice in D spatial dimensions. Different types of tensor network states can be seen to generate different geometries. Matrix product states (MPS) in D=1 dimensions, as well as projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in D{\textgreater}1 dimensions, reproduce the D-dimensional physical geometry of the lattice model; in contrast, the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) generates a (D+1)-dimensional holographic geometry. Here we focus on homogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of the same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting many-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and are therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters. Indeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous MPS and MERA for D=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the physical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic scaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law -- that is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers a simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and helps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In addition, it has recently motivated the branching MERA, a generalization of the MERA capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D{\textgreater}1 dimensions.},

 abstract = {Tensor network states are powerful variational ans\{\textquotedbl}atze for many-body ground states of quantum lattice models. The use of Monte Carlo sampling techniques in tensor network approaches significantly reduces the cost of tensor contractions, potentially leading to a substantial increase in computational efficiency. Previous proposals are based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme generated by locally updating configurations and, as such, must deal with equilibration and autocorrelation times, which result in a reduction of efficiency. Here we propose a perfect sampling scheme, with vanishing equilibration and autocorrelation times, for unitary tensor networks -- namely tensor networks based on efficiently contractible, unitary quantum circuits, such as unitary versions of the matrix product state (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN), and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). Configurations are directly sampled according to their probabilities in the wavefunction, without resorting to a Markov chain process. We also describe a partial sampling scheme that can result in a dramatic (basis-dependent) reduction of sampling error.},

 abstract = {Variational quantum circuits build the foundation for various classes of quantum algorithms. In a nutshell, the weights of a parametrized quantum circuit are varied until the empirical sampling distribution of the circuit is sufficiently close to a desired outcome. Numerical first-order methods are applied frequently to fit the parameters of the circuit, but most of the time, the circuit itself, that is, the actual composition of gates, is fixed. Methods for optimizing the circuit design jointly with the weights have been proposed, but empirical results are rather scarce. Here, we consider a simple evolutionary strategy that addresses the trade-off between finding appropriate circuit architectures and parameter tuning. We evaluate our method both via simulation and on actual quantum hardware. Our benchmark problems include the transverse field Ising Hamiltonian and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin model. Despite the shortcomings of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, we find only a minor slowdown on actual quantum machines compared to simulations. Moreover, we investigate which mutation operations most significantly contribute to the optimization. The results provide intuition on how randomized search heuristics behave on actual quantum hardware and lay out a path for further refinement of evolutionary quantum gate circuits.},

 abstract = {Defining and accurately measuring generalization in generative models remains an ongoing challenge and a topic of active research within the machine learning community. This is in contrast to discriminative models, where there is a clear definition of generalization, i.e., the model's classification accuracy when faced with unseen data. In this work, we construct a simple and unambiguous approach to evaluate the generalization capabilities of generative models. Using the sample-based generalization metrics proposed here, any generative model, from state-of-the-art classical generative models such as GANs to quantum models such as Quantum Circuit Born Machines, can be evaluated on the same ground on a concrete well-defined framework. In contrast to other sample-based metrics for probing generalization, we leverage constrained optimization problems (e.g., cardinality constrained problems) and use these discrete datasets to define specific metrics capable of unambiguously measuring the quality of the samples and the model's generalization capabilities for generating data beyond the training set but still within the valid solution space. Additionally, our metrics can diagnose trainability issues such as mode collapse and overfitting, as we illustrate when comparing GANs to quantum-inspired models built out of tensor networks. Our simulation results show that our quantum-inspired models have up to a {\$}68 $\backslash$times{\$} enhancement in generating unseen unique and valid samples compared to GANs, and a ratio of 61:2 for generating samples with better quality than those observed in the training set. We foresee these metrics as valuable tools for rigorously defining practical quantum advantage in the domain of generative modeling.},

 abstract = {Tensor-network techniques have enjoyed outstanding success in physics, and have recently attracted attention in machine learning, both as a tool for the formulation of new learning algorithms and for enhancing the mathematical understanding of existing methods. Inspired by these developments, and the natural correspondence between tensor networks and probabilistic graphical models, we provide a rigorous analysis of the expressive power of various tensor-network factorizations of discrete multivariate probability distributions. These factorizations include non-negative tensor-trains/MPS, which are in correspondence with hidden Markov models, and Born machines, which are naturally related to local quantum circuits. When used to model probability distributions, they exhibit tractable likelihoods and admit efficient learning algorithms. Interestingly, we prove that there exist probability distributions for which there are unbounded separations between the resource requirements of some of these tensor-network factorizations. Particularly surprising is the fact that using complex instead of real tensors can lead to an arbitrarily large reduction in the number of parameters of the network. Additionally, we introduce locally purified states (LPS), a new factorization inspired by techniques for the simulation of quantum systems, with provably better expressive power than all other representations considered. The ramifications of this result are explored through numerical experiments. Our findings imply that LPS should be considered over hidden Markov models, and furthermore provide guidelines for the design of local quantum circuits for probabilistic modeling.},

Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) makes use of only {\$}O(\log(N)){\$} variational parameters for input sizes of $N$ qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. The QCNN architecture combines the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz and quantum error correction. We explicitly illustrate its potential with two examples. First, QCNN is used to accurately recognize quantum states associated with 1D symmetry-protected topological phases. We numerically demonstrate that a QCNN trained on a small set of exactly solvable points can reproduce the phase diagram over the entire parameter regime and also provide an exact, analytical QCNN solution. As a second application, we utilize QCNNs to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given error model. We provide a generic framework to simultaneously optimize both encoding and decoding procedures and find that the resultant scheme significantly outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. Finally, potential experimental realization and generalizations of QCNNs are discussed.},

While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems.

\begin{abstract}
We present a new structure called the \textquotedbl conservative
matrix field,\textquotedbl{} initially developed to elucidate and
provide insight into the methodologies employed by Ap\'ery in his
proof of the irrationality of \textgreek{z}(3). This framework is
also applicable to other well known mathematical constants, including
$e,\;\pi,\;\ln\left(2\right)$, and more, and can be used to study
their properties. Moreover, the conservative matrix field exhibits
inherent connections to various ideas and techniques in number theory,
thereby indicating promising avenues for further applications and
investigations.

\section{Introduction}

The Riemann zeta function $\zeta\left(s\right)$ is a complex valued
function that plays a crucial role in mathematics. It is defined as
$\zeta\left(s\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}$ for complex
numbers $s$ with $Re\left(s\right)>1$ and can be extended analytically
to all of $\CC$ with a simple pole at $s=1$. In particular, the
values $\zeta\left(d\right)$ for integers $d\geq2$ have significant
implications in a number of areas, e.g. $\frac{1}{\zeta\left(d\right)}$
is the probability of choosing a random integer which is not divisible
by $m^{d}$ for some integer $m\geq1$. While the even evaluations
$\zeta\left(2d\right)$ are well understood, with $\zeta\left(2\right)=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$
and more generally $\frac{\zeta\left(2d\right)}{\pi^{2d}}$ are rational
numbers, the behavior of odd evaluations $\zeta\left(2d+1\right)$
remains largely unknown.

One of the main results about these odd evaluations was in 1978 where
Ap\'ery showed that $\zeta\left(3\right)$ is irrational \cite{apery_irrationalite_1979}.
As Ap\'ery's proof was complicated, subsequent attempts were made
to explain and simplify it, see for example van der Poorten \cite{van_der_poorten_proof_1979},
and others tried to reprove it all together, e.g. Beukers in \cite{beukers_note_2013}.
Further research \cite{rivoal_fonction_2000,zudilin_one_2001} has
also shown that there are infinitely many odd integers for which $\zeta\left(2d+1\right)$
is irrational, and in particular at least one of $\zeta\left(5\right),\zeta\left(7\right),\zeta\left(9\right)$,
and $\zeta\left(11\right)$ is irrational.

One of the main goal of this paper is to provide some motivation to
the steps used in Ap\'ery's proof through the creation of a novel
mathematical structure referred to as the \textbf{conservative matrix
field}. This structure will allow us to understand Ap\'ery's original
proof and provide a framework for studying other natural constants
such as $\zeta\left(2\right),\pi$, and $e$, with the potential to
uncover new relationships and properties among them. Moreover, while
we will mainly work over the integers, this structure seems to have
natural generalizations for general metric fields.

\medskip{}

The conservative matrix field structure is based on generalized continued
fractions, which are number presentations of the form
\[
\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{a_{k}}:=\frac{b_{1}}{a_{1}+\frac{b_{2}}{a_{2}+\frac{b_{3}}{a_{3}+\ddots}}}=\limfi n\frac{b_{1}}{a_{1}+\frac{b_{2}}{a_{2}+\frac{b_{3}}{\ddots+\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}+0}}}}\qquad a_{i},b_{i}\in\CC,
\]
where the numbers in the sequence on the left for which we look for
the limit are called the \textbf{convergents} of that expansion.

Their much more well known cousins, the simple continued fractions
where $b_{k}=1$ and $a_{k}\geq1$ are integers, have been studied
extensively and are connected to many research areas in mathematics
and in general. In particular, the original goal of these continued
fractions was to find the ``best'' rational approximations for a
given irrational number, which are given by the convergents defined
above.

While irrational numbers have a unique simple continued fraction expansion,
and rationals have two expansions, there can be many presentations
in the generalized version (more details in \secref{Generalized-continued-fractions}).
The uniqueness in the simple continued fraction expansion allows us
to extract a lot of information from the expansion, and while we lose
this property in the generalized form, what we gain is the option
to find ``nice'' generalized continued fractions which are easier
to work with. In particular, we are interested in \textbf{polynomial
continued fractions} where $a_{k}=a\left(k\right),\;b_{k}=b\left(k\right)$
with $a,b\in\ZZ\left[x\right]$.

For example, in the $\zeta\left(3\right)$ case, the simple continued
fraction is 
\[
\zeta\left(3\right)=[1;4,1,18,1,1,1,4,1,9,...]=1+\frac{1}{4+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{18+\frac{1}{1+\ddots}}}},
\]
where the coefficients $1,4,1,18,1,...$ don't seem to have any usable
pattern. However, it has a much simpler generalized continued fraction
form
\[
\zeta\left(3\right)=\frac{1}{1+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-i^{6}}{i^{3}+\left(1+i\right)^{3}}}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{1^{6}}{1^{3}+2^{3}-\frac{2^{6}}{2^{3}+3^{3}-\frac{3^{6}}{3^{3}+4^{3}-{\scriptscriptstyle \ddots}}}}},
\]
where the convergents in this expansion are the standard approximations
$\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^{3}}$ for $\zeta\left(3\right)$. Moreover,
this abundance of presentations allows us to find many presentations
for $\zeta\left(3\right)$ which can be combined together to find
a ``good enough'' presentation where the convergents converge fast
enough to prove that $\zeta\left(3\right)$ is irrational. In particular,
in Ap\'ery's original proof, and in our, we eventually show that
\[
\zeta\left(3\right)=\frac{6}{5+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-k^{6}}{17\left(k^{3}+\left(1+k\right)^{3}\right)-12\left(k+\left(1+k\right)\right)}}.
\]
\smallskip{}

The irrationality proof uses a very elementary argument (see \secref{Irrationality-testing})
that shows that if $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\to L$ where $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$
are reduced rational numbers with $\left|q_{n}\right|\to\infty$,
and $\left|L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|=o\left(\frac{1}{\left|q_{n}\right|}\right)$,
then $L$ must be irrational. Moreover, we can measure how irrational
$L$ is by looking for $\delta>0$ such that $\left|L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|\sim\frac{1}{\left|q_{n}\right|^{1+\delta}}$.
The main object of this study, the \textbf{conservative matrix field}
defined in \secref{Definition-properties-CMF},\textbf{ }is an algebraic
object that collects infinitely many related such approximations $\frac{p_{n,m}}{q_{n,m}}$
arranged on the integer lattice in the positive quadrant. Computing
$\delta_{n,m}$ for each approximation, namely $\delta_{n,m}=-1-\frac{\ln\left|L-\frac{p_{n,m}}{q_{n,m}}\right|}{\ln\left|q_{n,m}\right|}$
where the rational $\frac{p_{n,m}}{q_{n,m}}$ is reduced, and plotting
them as a heat map we get the following

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{heat_map_zeta3.jpeg}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{(Figure by Rotem Elimelech) The gradient color from red$\to$white$\to$blue
correspond to $\delta_{n,m}=-1-\log_{q_{n,m}}\left|L-\frac{p_{n,m}}{q_{n,m}}\right|$
going from positive$\to$zero$\to$negative.}
\end{figure}

As we shall see, the $X$-axis and $Y$-axis correspond more or less
to the standard approximations of $\zeta\left(3\right)$, namely $\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^{3}}$,
which do not converge fast enough to show irrationality, while on
the diagonal we get the expansion mentioned above used by Ap\'ery
to prove the irrationality.

\medskip{}

The conservative matrix field structure is not only a way to understand
Ap\'ery's original proof, but seems to have a much broader range
of applications. There are many places that study generalized continued
fraction and in particular polynomial continued fractions (see for
example \cite{apostol_introduction_1998,jones_continued_1980,pincherle_delle_1894,laughlin_real_2004})
. This paper originated in the Ramanujan machine project \cite{raayoni_generating_2021}
which aimed to find polynomial continued fraction presentations to
interesting mathematical constants using computer automation. With
the goal of trying to prove many of the conjectures discovered by
the computer, and along the way understand Ap\'ery's proof, this
conservative matrix field structure was found. These computer conjectures
suggest that there is still much to be explored in this field and
that this new structure is just a step towards a deeper understanding
of mathematical constants and their relations.

\subsection{Structure of the paper}

We present an overview of the paper's structure to delineate the development
of the conservative matrix field. The construction itself is in \secref{Definition-properties-CMF},
and while you don't necessarily need the constructions and results
in the previous sections, we believe that they provide interesting
background and motivate the conservative matrix field structure.

\textbf{Irrationality Testing (}\secref{Irrationality-testing}):
We begin by exploring the concept of good rational approximations
and their role in irrationality testing. These approximations are
closely linked to simple continued fractions, but also still close
to other continued fraction versions.

\textbf{The polynomial continued fractions (}\secref{Generalized-continued-fractions}):
We provide definitions for various types of continued fractions, with
a specific focus on polynomial continued fractions. We also recall
the Mobius action, a key tool for studying these continued fractions
and utilizing them in irrationality proofs. In \subsecref{Euler's-formula}
we employ Euler's method to construct polynomial continued fraction
expansions for well-known constants. These \textquotedbl Euler continued
fractions\textquotedbl{} serve as the fundamental building blocks
of the conservative matrix field, where by combining infinitely many
such continued fractions, we generate new rational approximations.

\textbf{Generalization to Polynomial Matrices} (\secref{The-most-general}):
Here, we extend the concept of polynomial continued fractions to encompass
general polynomial matrices. This broader approach enables the study
of families of polynomial continued fractions and their interrelations,
eventually leading to the definition of the conservative matrix field.

\textbf{The conservative matrix field }(\secref{Definition-properties-CMF}):
After defining the conservative matrix field, we present an intriguing
matrix field construction in \subsecref{matrix-field-construction}
with several interesting properties, where in particular each such
matrix field is accompanied by a dual matrix field, elaborated upon
in \subsecref{The-dual-matrix-field}.

\textbf{The $\zeta\left(3\right)$ matrix field} (\secref{The-z3-case}):
In this section, we explore $\zeta\left(3\right)$ matrix field's
structure, its intriguing properties, and its connections to the irrationality
proof of \textgreek{z}(3). The natural questions arising from this
study often parallel ideas presented in Ap\'ery's proof.

\textbf{Future Directions and Connections} (\secref{On-future-fractions}):
As a conclusion, we propose potential avenues for further development
of the conservative matrix field, and its potential connections to
other fields within number theory, hinting at exciting possibilities
for future research.

\section{\label{sec:Irrationality-testing}Rational Approximations and Irrationality
Testing}

The simple continued fractions were first introduced in order to find
good rational approximations for a given number, and in a sense also
the best rational approximations. Interestingly enough, the numbers
which have ``very good'' rational approximations are exactly the
irrational numbers. This idea of proving irrationality through good
rational approximations is quite general and will be one of the main
applications to polynomial continued fractions, and the conservative
matrix field which we introduce in this paper. As such, we being with
this irrationality test.

\medskip{}

Any real number $L$ can be approximated by rational numbers. More
over, for any denominator $q\in\NN$ there is a numerator $p\in\ZZ$
such that $\left|L-\frac{p}{q}\right|\leq\frac{1}{q}$. Looking for
approximations where the error is much smaller than $\frac{1}{q}$
is the starting point of the study of Diophantine approximations.
One of the basic results in this field is Dirichlet's theorem, which
states that if we can choose the denominator intelligently, then there
are approximations with much smaller error.
\begin{thm}[Dirichlet's theorem for Diophantine approximation]
Given any number $L\in\RR$, there are infinitely many $p_{n},q_{n}\in\ZZ$
with $q_{n}\to\infty$ such that 
\[
\left|L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|\leq\frac{1}{q_{n}^{2}}.
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{rem}
One of the important properties of simple continued fractions, is
that they can generate such approximations as in Dirichlet's theorem.
\end{rem}

Dirichlet's theorem is trivial when $L=\frac{p}{q}$ is rational by
simply taking $\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)=\left(np,nq\right)$. However if we also require that the $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ are
distinct, then this theorem is no longer trivial, or even true. In
this case, once $L=\frac{p}{q}\neq\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ we get that
\[
\left|L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|=\left|\frac{p\cdot q_{n}-q\cdot p_{n}}{q\cdot q_{n}}\right|\geq\frac{1}{\left|q\cdot q_{n}\right|},
\]
where the emphasize is that $q$ is constant, so that $\left|q_{n}L-p_{n}\right|\geq\frac{1}{q}$
is bounded from below. When $L$ is irrational, it is easy to see
that the approximations $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ cannot become constant
at any point, leading us to:

\noindent\doublebox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth - 2\fboxsep - 7.5\fboxrule - 1pt}%
\begin{align*}
L\in\QQ\; & \Rightarrow\quad\text{There is }C>0\text{ such that }\left|qL-p\right|\geq C\text{ for any }\frac{p}{q}\neq L\\
L\notin\QQ\; & \Rightarrow\quad\text{There are }\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\in\QQ\text{ distinct such that }\left|q_{n}L-p_{n}\right|\to0.
\end{align*}
%
\end{minipage}}

In general, when looking for rational approximations with $p_{n},q_{n}$
as above, they are not going to be coprime. Letting $\tilde{q}_{n}=\frac{q_{n}}{\gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)},\;\tilde{p}_{n}=\frac{p_{n}}{\gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)}$
, we see that 
\[
\gcd\left(q_{n},p_{n}\right)\left|\tilde{q}_{n}L-\tilde{p}_{n}\right|=\left|q_{n}L-p_{n}\right|,
\]
so it is enough that $\left|q_{n}L-p_{n}\right|=o\left(\gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)\right)$
in order to get the condition $\left|\tilde{q}_{n}L-\tilde{p}_{n}\right|\to0$
above to hold. Since $\frac{\tilde{p}_{n}}{\tilde{q}_{n}}=\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$,
we obtain the following irrationality test:
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:improved-rationality-test}Suppose that $p_{n},q_{n}\in\ZZ$
where $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ is not eventually constant. If $\left|q_{n}L-p_{n}\right|=o\left(\gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)\right)$,
then $L$ is irrational.
\end{thm}

The importance of rational approximations derived from polynomial
continued fractions, as we shall see in \claimref{upper-bound}, is
that it gives us an upper bound on the error on the one hand, and
an easy way to check that $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ is not eventually
constant on the other hand.

\medskip{}


\subsection*{The $\zeta\left(3\right)$ case:}

As an example, let us consider $\zeta\left(3\right)$ which Apery
has shown to be irrational. We start with its standard rational approximations
\[
\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}:=\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^{3}}\overset{n\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}\zeta\left(3\right).
\]

Multiplying the denominators, we can write $q_{n}=\left(n!\right)^{3}$
and $p_{n}=\sum_{1}^{n}\left(\frac{n!}{k}\right)^{3}$, both of which
in $\ZZ$. Trying to apply the irrationality test from the previous
section, we get that 
\[
\left|\zeta\left(3\right)-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|=\sum_{n+1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{3}}=\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right).
\]
This is, of course, far from what we need to prove irrationality,
since $\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ is much larger than $\frac{1}{q_{n}}=\frac{1}{\left(n!\right)^{3}}$.
Indeed, with denominator $q_{n}=\left(n!\right)^{3}$ we can always
find $p_{n}'$ such that $\left|\zeta\left(3\right)-\frac{p_{n}'}{q_{n}}\right|\leq\frac{1}{\left(n!\right)^{3}}\ll\frac{1}{n^{2}}$.
Hence, while the rational approximations choice above is easy to use
in general, it is not good enough to show irrationality. 

One way to improve the approximation, as mentioned before, is by moving
to a reduced form of $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$. Taking instead the common
denominator in the sum above, we get that $\tilde{q}_{n}=\lcm\left[n\right]^{3}$,
where $\lcm\left[n\right]:=\lcm\left\{ 1,2,...,n\right\} $ and then
$\tilde{p}_{n}=\sum_{1}^{n}\left(\frac{\lcm\left[n\right]}{k}\right)^{3}$.
It is well known that $\ln\left(\lcm\left[n\right]\right)=n+o\left(n\right)$
(it follows from the prime number theorem, see \cite{apostol_introduction_1998}),
so that the new denominator $\tilde{q}_{n}=\lcm\left[n\right]^{3}\sim e^{3n}$
is much smaller than $\left(n!\right)^{3}$ and we basically get a
factorial reduction.

However, the error is still too big $\frac{1}{n^{2}}\gg\frac{1}{e^{3n}}$,
so even with this improvement, it is still not enough. One way to
improve this approximation even further, is to consider $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}=\left(\sum_{1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{k^{3}}\right)+\frac{1}{2n^{2}}$.
While it doesn't change the common denominator too much, the error
becomes smaller, since
\[
\left|\zeta\left(3\right)-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|=\left|\left(\sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{3}}\right)-\frac{1}{2n^{2}}\right|=\left|\left(\sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{3}}\right)-\int_{n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x^{3}}\dx\right|\leq\frac{1}{n^{3}}.
\]

While there is still a lot of room for improvement, there is reason
for optimism. The challenge lies in automating the process indefinitely
for all $r\in\NN$, aiming to reduce the error to $\frac{1}{n^{r}}$
for arbitrarily large $r$, with the hope of somewhere in the limit
getting the error to be small enough for our irrationality test. 

The polynomial continued fractions become crucial at this juncture.
They not only furnish rational approximations but also offer iterative
means to refine them repeatedly, where in some cases leading to instances
where these improved approximations are good enough to prove the desired
irrationality.

\section{\label{sec:Generalized-continued-fractions}The polynomial continued
fraction}

\subsection{\label{subsec:The-definitions}The definitions and main tools}

We start with a generalization of the simple continued fractions,
which unsurprisingly, is called generalized continued fractions. These
can be defined over any topological field, though here we focus on
the complex field with its standard Euclidean metric, and more specifically
when the numerators and denominators are integers.
\begin{defn}[\textbf{(Generalized) continued fractions}]
Let $a_{n},b_{n}$ be a sequence of complex numbers. We will write
\[
a_{0}+\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}:=a_{0}+\cfrac{b_{1}}{a_{1}+\cfrac{b_{2}}{a_{2}+\cfrac{b_{3}}{\ddots+\cfrac{b_{n}}{a_{n}+0}}}}\in\CC\cup\left\{ \infty\right\} ,
\]
and if the limit as $n\to\infty$ exists, we also will write
\[
a_{0}+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}:=\limfi n\left(a_{0}+\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}\right).
\]

We call this type of expansion (both finite and infinite) a \textbf{continued
fraction expansion. }In case that $a_{0}+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}$
exists, we call the finite part $a_{0}+\KK_{1}^{n-1}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}$
the \textbf{$n$-th convergents} for that expansion.

A continued fraction is called \textbf{simple continued fraction},
if $b_{i}=1$ for all $i$, $a_{0}\in\ZZ$ and $1\leq a_{i}\in\ZZ$
are positive integers for $i\geq1$.

A continued fraction is called \textbf{polynomial continued fraction},
if $b_{i}=b\left(i\right),\;a_{i}=a\left(i\right)$ for some polynomials
$a\left(x\right),b\left(x\right)\in\CC\left[x\right]$ and all $i\geq1$.

\medskip{}
\end{defn}

Simple continued fraction expansion is one of the main and basic tools
used in number theory when studying rational approximations of numbers,
and their convergents satisfy the inequality in Dirichlet's theorem
that we mentioned before (for more details, see chapter 3 in \cite{einsiedler_ergodic_2013}).
The coefficients $a_{i}$ in that expansion can be found using a generalized
Euclidean division algorithm, and it is well known that a number is
rational if and only if its simple continued fraction expansion is
finite. However, while we have an algorithm to find the (almost) unique
expansion, in general they can be very complicated without any known
patterns, even for ``nice'' numbers, for example:

\[
\pi=[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,14,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,84,...]=3+\cfrac{1}{7+\cfrac{1}{15+\cfrac{1}{1+\ddots}}}.
\]

When moving to generalized continued fractions, even when we assume
that both $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ are integers, we lose the uniqueness
property, and the rational if and only if finite property. What we
gain in return are more presentations for each number, where some
of them can be much simpler to use. For example, $\pi$ can be written
as 
\[
\pi=3+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{\left(2n-1\right)^{2}}{6}.
\]
We want to study these presentations, and (hopefully) use them to
show interesting properties, e.g. prove irrationality for certain
numbers.

\medskip{}

One of the main tools used to study continued fractions are \textbf{Mobius
transformations}. Recall that given a $2\times2$ invertible matrix $M=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\in\GL_{2}\left(\CC\right)$ and a $z\in\CC$, the Mobius action is defined by
\[
M\left(z\right)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}.
\]

In other words, we apply the standard matrix multiplication $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}z\\
1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}az+b\\
cz+d
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and project it onto $R^{1}\CC$ by dividing the $x$-coordinate by
the $y$-coordinate.

By this definition, it is easy to see that 
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\frac{b_{1}}{a_{1}+\frac{b_{2}}{a_{2}+\frac{\ddots}{\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}+0}}}}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{1}\\
1 & a_{1}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{2}\\
1 & a_{2}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\cdots\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{n}\\
1 & a_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(0\right)
\]

This Mobius presentation allows us to show an interesting recurrence
relation on the numerators and denominators of the convergents, which
generalizes the well known recurrence on simple continued fractions.
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:gcf-recursion}Let $a_{n},b_{n}$ be a sequence of integers.
Define $M_{n}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{n}\\
1 & a_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and set $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n}\\
q_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)=\left(\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\
1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. Then $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}=\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}\left(0\right)=\KK_{1}^{n-1}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}$
are the convergents of the generalized continued fraction presentation.
More over, we have that $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n-1} & p_{n}\\
q_{n-1} & q_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)=\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}$, implying the same recurrence relation on $p_{n}$ and $q_{n}$ given
by 
\begin{align*}
p_{n+1} & =a_{n}p_{n}+b_{n}p_{n-1}\\
q_{n+1} & =a_{n}q_{n}+b_{n}q_{n-1},
\end{align*}
with starting condition $p_{0}=1,\;p_{1}=0$ and $q_{0}=0,\;q_{1}=1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Left as an exercise.
\end{proof}
Now that we have this basic result, we can apply it to our irrationality
test as follows:
\begin{claim}
\label{claim:upper-bound}Let $a_{n},b_{n},p_{n},q_{n}$ be sequence
of integers satisfying the recurrence from \lemref{gcf-recursion}.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\to L$, then 
\[
\left|L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|=\left|\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\prod_{1}^{k}b_{i}}{q_{k}q_{k+1}}\right|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\prod_{1}^{k}\left|b_{i}\right|}{\left|q_{k}q_{k+1}\right|}.
\]
\item Suppose in addition that the $b_{n}$ are nonzero. Then $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$
is not eventually constant, so that $\left|q_{n}L-p_{n}\right|=o\left(\gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)\right)$
implies that $L$ is irrational.
\end{enumerate}
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $M_{n}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & b_{n}\\
1 & a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}$ so that $\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n-1} & p_{n}\\
q_{n-1} & q_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right).$ For all $m\geq n$ we have
\[
L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}=L-\frac{p_{m+1}}{q_{m+1}}+\sum_{k=n}^{m}\left(\frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}}-\frac{p_{k}}{q_{k}}\right)=L-\frac{p_{m+1}}{q_{m+1}}-\sum_{k=n}^{m}\frac{\det\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{k} & p_{k+1}\\
q_{k} & q_{k+1}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)}{q_{k}q_{k+1}}.
\]
Under the assumption that $L-\frac{p_{m+1}}{q_{m+1}}\to0$ as $m\to\infty$,
we conclude that 
\[
\left|L-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\left|\frac{\det\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{k} & p_{k+1}\\
q_{k} & q_{k+1}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)}{q_{k}q_{k+1}}\right|=\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\prod_{1}^{k}\left|\det\left(M_{i}\right)\right|}{\left|q_{k}q_{k+1}\right|}=\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\prod_{1}^{k}\left|b_{i}\right|}{\left|q_{k}q_{k+1}\right|}.
\]
\item In case that the $b_{k}\neq0$ for all $k$, then
\[
\left|\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}-\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}\right|=\left|\frac{\det\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n} & p_{n+1}\\
q_{n} & q_{n+1}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)}{q_{n}q_{n+1}}\right|=\frac{\prod_{1}^{n}\left|b_{k}\right|}{\left|q_{n}q_{n+1}\right|}\neq0.
\]
It follows that the $\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ is not eventually constant,
so we can apply \thmref{improved-rationality-test} to prove this
claim.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
The recursion relation of the $q_{i}$ suggests that the larger the
$\left|b_{i}\right|$ are, the faster the growth of $\left|q_{i}\right|$
is, and in general we expect it to be fast enough so that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\prod_{1}^{k+1}\left|b_{i}\right|}{\left|q_{k}q_{k+1}\right|}$
will converge. However, it might still not be in $o\left(\frac{1}{\left|q_{n}\right|}\right)$.
Hopefully, if the $gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)$ is large enough,
then it is in $o\left(\frac{\gcd\left(p_{n},q_{n}\right)}{\left|q_{n}\right|}\right)$,
which is enough to prove irrationality.

\subsection{\label{subsec:Euler's-formula}Euler's formula}

The Euclidean division algorithm allows us to determine the simple
continued fraction expansion of any given number. Generalized continued
fractions, however, lack a unique representation, rendering a single
algorithm impractical. Nevertheless, this flexibility permits us to
seek convenient presentations, facilitating our ability to switch
between them - a vital tool in our endeavor to reprove Ap\'ery's
theorem. This section commences our exploration by introducing a fascinating
family of polynomial continued fractions that are computationally
straightforward.

One of the most elementary and useful continued fraction presentation
was introduced by Euler who found a way to convert standard finite
sums (and their infinite sum limits) to generalized continued fraction. 
\begin{thm}[Euler's formula]
 Let $r_{i}\in\CC$ for $i\geq1$. Then
\[
1+r_{1}+r_{1}r_{2}+\cdots+r_{1}\cdots r_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\prod_{i=1}^{k}r_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{1+\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{-r_{i}}{1+r_{i}}}.
\]
By taking the limit (if exists), we have that 
\[
\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-r_{i}}{1+r_{i}}=\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\prod_{i=1}^{k}r_{i}}-1.
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
This is a standard induction, which we leave as an exercise to the
reader.
\end{proof}
For more details and applications of this formula, the reader is referred
to \cite{jones_continued_1980}. 

Euler's formula implies that whenever $a_{i}+b_{i}=1$ we can go
back from generalized continued fractions $\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}$
to infinite sums, where we have many more tools at our disposal. However,
in general this condition doesn't hold, though fortunately there is
a trick to move to equivalent presentations where it might.
\begin{lem}[The equivalence transformation]
\label{lem:equivalence-transformation} Let $a_{i},b_{i}\in\CC$
be two sequences and $0\neq c_{i}\in\CC$ another sequence with nonzero
elements. Then
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}}{c_{i}a_{i}}.
\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Intuitively, this lemma follows from the fact that $\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}+x}=\frac{c_{i}b_{i}}{c_{i}a_{i}+c_{i}x}$
plus induction. For example
\[
\frac{4}{11}=\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{3}}}=\frac{1}{{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{0}}}}\cdot\frac{{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{0}}}}{2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{3}}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\cdot\frac{c_{0}{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{1}}}}{2{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{1}}}+\frac{{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{1}}}}{1+\frac{1}{3}}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\cdot\frac{c_{0}c_{1}}{2c_{1}+\frac{c_{1}{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{2}}}}{{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{2}}}+\frac{{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{2}}}}{3}}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\cdot\frac{c_{0}c_{1}}{2c_{1}+\frac{c_{1}c_{2}}{c_{2}+\frac{c_{2}{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{3}}}}{3{\color{red}\boldsymbol{c_{3}}}}}}.
\]
More precisely, recall that $\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\left[\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right]\left(0\right)$. As Mobius transformations defined by scalar matrices are the identity,
we get that
\begin{align*}
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\left[\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right]\left(0\right) & =\left[\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\cdot c_{i}I\right]\left(0\right)=\left[\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & c_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{i} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right]\left(0\right)\\
 & =\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{0}^{-1} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left[\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{i-1} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & c_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right)\right]\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{n} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(0\right)\\
 & =\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{0}^{-1} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left[\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}\\
1 & c_{i}a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right]\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{n} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(0\right)
\end{align*}
Since $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}c_{n} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\
1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\
1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ , we conclude that
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}}{c_{i}a_{i}}.
\]
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
In the last lemma we basically moved from the matrices $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ to $\left(c_{n-1}U_{n-1}\right)^{-1}M_{n}U_{n}$ with $U_{n}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & c_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. This type of equivalence can be generalized, as we shall see it
later in \secref{The-most-general}.
\end{rem}

Combining this lemma and Euler's formula, we are led to look for $c_{n}$
satisfying
\[
c_{n}a_{n}+c_{n-1}c_{n}b_{n}=1.
\]
If we can find such $c_{n}$, then we have the following.
\begin{cor}
\label{cor:c-n-conversion}Let $a_{i},b_{i}\in\CC$ be any sequences
and suppose that we can find a solution to 
\[
c_{i}a_{i}+c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}=1
\]
with nonzero $c_{i}$. Then
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{\left(c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}\right)}{\left(c_{i}a_{i}\right)}=\frac{1}{c_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}\right)}-1\right),
\]
or equivalently
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{1+c_{0}\cdot\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1\\
1 & c_{0}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}\right).
\]
\end{cor}

\begin{example}[The exponential function]
\label{exa:(The-exponential-function)} Given some $x\in\RR$, we start with the standard Taylor expansion
for $e^{x}$:
\[
e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\cdots=\sum_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}=\sum_{0}^{\infty}\prod_{1}^{n}\left(\frac{x}{i}\right).
\]
Taking $r_{i}=\frac{x}{i}$ in Euler's formula we get that 
\[
e^{x}=\frac{1}{1+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-x/i}{1+x/i}}.
\]
Using the equivalence transformation with $c_{i}=i$ starting from
the second index (to avoid division by zero) gives
\[
e^{x}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{x}{1+x+\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-ix}{1+i+x}}}\;\Rightarrow\;\frac{1+x-e^{x}}{e^{x}-1}=\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-ix}{1+i+x}.
\]

In particular, for $x=1$ and $x=-1$ we get that 
\[
\frac{2-e}{e-1}=\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-i}{2+i}\quad,\quad\frac{1}{e-1}=\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{i}{i}.
\]

Similar computation can be done with other functions like $\sin\left(x\right),\cos\left(x\right),\ln\left(1+x\right)$
etc.\medskip{}
\end{example}

Finding $c_{n}$ which satisfy the relation in \corref{c-n-conversion}
above is equivalent to solving the recurrence
\[
c_{i}:=\frac{1}{a_{i}+c_{i-1}b_{i}}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1\\
b_{i} & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(c_{i-1}\right).
\]

Of course, the hard part is not to find some sequence $c_{i}$ satisfying
this relation, but a ``nice enough'' such sequence for which we
can compute $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(c_{i-1}c_{i}b_{i}\right)$.
The matrix above is the transpose of our original polynomial continued
fraction matrix. Transposing it, and thinking of $c_{i}=\frac{F_{i}}{F_{i+1}}$
as the projection of $\left(F_{i},F_{i+1}\right)$, we get the recursion:
\[
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}F_{i-1} & F_{i}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}F_{i} & F_{i+1}\end{smallmatrix}\right).
\]
This is exactly the recurrence satisfied by $p_{n}$ and $q_{n}$
we saw in \lemref{gcf-recursion} (so that both $c_{i}=\frac{p_{i}}{p_{i+1}}$
and $c_{i}=\frac{q_{i}}{q_{i+1}}$ solve the recurrence above). Thus,
in a sense, finding one such ``nice'' solution to the recurrsion,
let us find both $p_{n}$ and $q_{n}$.

Next, we try to give simple conditions on $a_{i},b_{i}$ where we
can find ``nice'' solution for the recurrence above. A good starting point is when $a_{i},b_{i}$ are fixed $a_{i}\equiv a,\;b_{i}\equiv b$,
so that our matrix is $M_{i}=M=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b\\
1 & a
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, and a solution $F_{n}$ can be found by looking at $M^{n}$. This
is a standard recursion where $F_{n}$ will be a combination of a
polynomial $f\left(n\right)$ and exponential $h^{n}$, where $h$
is one of the two roots $h_{1},h_{2}$ for the characteristic polynomial
$x^{2}-ax-b=0$, namely $h_{1}\cdot h_{2}=-b$ and $h_{1}+h_{2}=a$. 

More generally, our recurrence depends on $i$, and the ``right''
way to think about exponential is more like factorial, so we should
look for $F_{n}$ of the form $f\left(n\right)\cdot\prod_{1}^{n}h\left(k\right)$
for some polynomials $f,h$ , or in the $c_{n}$ notation we have
$c_{n}=\frac{F_{n}}{F_{n+1}}=\frac{f\left(n\right)}{f\left(n+1\right)h\left(n+1\right)}$. 

With this quadratic intuition in mind, we have the following family
of continued fractions which have this sort of solution to their corresponding
recurrence relation. Special cases of these continued fractions appear
in many places (in particular, see for example \cite{brier_note_2022,bowman_polynomial_2018}),
though we did not see this exact formulation in the literature.
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:recurrence-roots}Let $h_{1},h_{2},f:\CC\to\CC$ be any
functions, and define $a,b:\CC\to\CC$ such that 
\begin{align*}
b\left(x\right) & =-h_{1}\left(x\right)h_{2}\left(x\right)\\
f\left(x\right)a\left(x\right) & =f\left(x-1\right)h_{1}\left(x\right)+f\left(x+1\right)h_{2}\left(x+1\right)
\end{align*}
Then taking $F_{n}=f\left(n\right)\cdot\prod_{1}^{n}h_{2}\left(k\right)$
solves the recurrence relation
\[
F_{n}a\left(n\right)+F_{n-1}b\left(n\right)=F_{n+1},
\]
and we get that
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\frac{f\left(1\right)h_{2}\left(1\right)}{f\left(0\right)}\left(\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f\left(0\right)f\left(1\right)}{f\left(k\right)f\left(k+1\right)}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{h_{1}\left(i\right)}{h_{2}\left(i+1\right)}\right)}-1\right).
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Simply putting the definition of $a,b,F$ in the recurrence gives
us
\[
F_{n}a\left(n\right)+F_{n-1}b\left(n\right)-F_{n+1}=\left[\prod_{1}^{n}h_{2}\left(k\right)\right]\left(f\left(n\right)a\left(n\right)-f\left(n-1\right)h_{1}\left(n\right)-f\left(n+1\right)h_{2}\left(n+1\right)\right)=0.
\]
Using \corref{c-n-conversion} and taking $c_{n}=\frac{F_{n}}{F_{n+1}}$
we get that
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=\frac{F_{1}}{F_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{F_{i-1}}{F_{i+1}}h_{1}\left(i\right)h_{2}\left(i\right)\right)}-1\right)=\frac{f\left(1\right)h_{2}\left(1\right)}{f\left(0\right)}\left(\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f\left(0\right)f\left(1\right)}{f\left(k\right)f\left(k+1\right)}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{h_{1}\left(i\right)}{h_{2}\left(i+1\right)}\right)}-1\right).
\]
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
We leave it as an exercise to show that solutions to $c\left(n\right)a\left(n\right)+c\left(n-1\right)c\left(n\right)b\left(n\right)=1$
where $a,b\in\CC\left[x\right]$, and $c\left(x\right)\in\CC\left(x\right)$
is a rational function, imply that $a,b$ must have the form as in
the theorem above where $f,h_{1},h_{2}$ are all polynomials in themselves
and $c\left(x\right)=\frac{f\left(x\right)}{f\left(x+1\right)h_{1}\left(x+1\right)}$.
\end{rem}

While the theorem above is applicable to any functions $h_{1},h_{2}$
and $f$, it is probably most useful when they are polynomials over
$\ZZ$, in which case the product $\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{h_{1}\left(i\right)}{h_{2}\left(i+1\right)}\right)$
can become much simpler.

\newpage{}
\begin{example}[The trivial Euler family]
\label{exa:Euler-family}\footnote{It has come to our attention that Euler doesn't have enough mathematical
objects named after him.} In \thmref{recurrence-roots}, consider the case where $f\left(x\right)=1$:
\begin{align*}
b\left(x\right) & =-h_{1}\left(x\right)h_{2}\left(x\right)\\
a\left(x\right) & =h_{1}\left(x\right)+h_{2}\left(x+1\right).
\end{align*}
In this case we have 
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=h_{2}\left(1\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{h_{1}\left(i\right)}{h_{2}\left(i+1\right)}\right)}-1\right),
\]
or alternatively
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{h_{1}\left(i\right)}{h_{2}\left(i+1\right)}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{h_{2}\left(1\right)}\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}+1\right)^{-1}.
\]
In the following example we denote $P_{k}:=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{h_{1}\left(i\right)}{h_{2}\left(i+1\right)}\right)$
so that $\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}=h_{2}\left(1\right)\left(\left(\sum_{0}^{n}P_{k}\right)^{-1}-1\right)$.\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $h_{1}\left(x\right)=1$ and $h_{2}\left(x\right)=x$. We then
have that $P_{k}=\frac{1}{\left(k+1\right)!}$, so that
\[
\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-n}{n+2}=\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(k+1\right)!}}-1=\frac{1}{e-1}-1,
\]
which we already saw in \exaref{(The-exponential-function)}.
\item Let $h_{1}\left(x\right)=h_{2}\left(x\right)=x^{d}$ for some $d\geq2$.
Then $P_{k}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{i^{d}}{\left(i+1\right)^{d}}=\frac{1}{\left(k+1\right)^{d}}$,
so that
\[
\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}}=\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(k+1\right)^{d}}}-1=\frac{1}{\zeta\left(d\right)}-1.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

In the examples above we only looked at ``trivial'' solutions where
$f\equiv1$. In general, there are solutions where $f\neq1$, however,
they are all part of the trivial family in disguise. Indeed, if
\begin{align*}
b\left(x\right) & =-h_{1}\left(x\right)h_{2}\left(x\right)\\
f\left(x\right)a\left(x\right) & =f\left(x-1\right)h_{1}\left(x\right)+f\left(x+1\right)h_{2}\left(x+1\right)
\end{align*}
as in the theorem, then using the equivalence transformation from
\lemref{equivalence-transformation} with $c_{n}=f\left(n\right)$,
we get that 
\[
\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{b\left(n\right)}{a\left(n\right)}=\frac{1}{f\left(0\right)}\KK_{1}^{n}\frac{\tilde{b}\left(n\right)}{\tilde{a}\left(n\right)}.
\]
where this new continued fraction is in the trivial Euler family:
\begin{align*}
\tilde{h}_{1}\left(x\right) & =h_{1}\left(x\right)f\left(x-1\right)\qquad;\qquad\tilde{h}_{2}\left(x\right)=h_{2}\left(x\right)f\left(x\right)\\
\tilde{b}\left(x\right) & =f\left(x-1\right)f\left(x\right)b\left(x\right)=-\tilde{h}_{1}\left(x\right)\times\tilde{h}_{2}\left(x\right)\\
\tilde{a}\left(x\right) & =f\left(x\right)a\left(x\right)=\tilde{h}_{1}\left(x\right)+\tilde{h}_{2}\left(x+1\right).
\end{align*}

\section{\label{sec:The-most-general}The most general of generalized continued
fractions}

The utilization of polynomial matrices in the study of polynomial
continued fractions, along with their equivalence transformation presented
in matrix notation, suggests that maybe the right framework is to
simply study polynomial matrices. Moreover, one of our goals, was
to start with a given continued fraction expansion for some constant
(e.g. $\zeta\left(3\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(\KK_{1}^{\infty}\frac{-n^{6}}{n^{3}+\left(1+n\right)^{3}}\right)$), and create new continued fractions, in which the approximation
error goes to zero quicker than the denominator goes to infinity.
This new matrix notation will give this process an extra structure
to utilize.
\begin{defn}
Let $M\left(i\right)\in\GL_{2}\left(\CC\right)$ be a sequence of
$2\times2$ matrices. For $z\in\CC$ we will denote 
\[
\left[\prod_{1}^{\infty}M\left(i\right)\right]\left(z\right)=\limfi n\left[\prod_{1}^{n}M\left(i\right)\right]\left(z\right).
\]
\end{defn}

In the definition above, it is possible that the limit converges for
one $z$ and diverges for another. For example, if we take $M\left(i\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}-1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, then $\left[\prod_{1}^{\infty}M\left(i\right)\right]\left(0\right)=0$
while $\left[\prod_{1}^{n}M\left(i\right)\right]\left(1\right)=\left(-1\right)^{n}$
doesn't converge. However, in many ``natural'' sequences we have
a very strong convergence behavior. 
\begin{example}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $M_{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & a_{i}\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ are upper triangular, then 
\[
\left(\prod_{1}^{n}M_{i}\right)\left(z\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & \sum_{1}^{n}a_{i}\\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(z\right)=z+\sum_{1}^{n}a_{i}.
\]
If $\sum_{1}^{\infty}a_{i}=\infty$, then $\left(\prod_{1}^{n}M_{i}\right)\left(z\right)\to\infty$
for all $z$. If we also add an $M_{0}$ matrix which takes $\infty\to w\in\CC$,
then $\left(\prod_{0}^{n}M_{i}\right)\left(z\right)\to w$ for all
$z$.
\item If $M_{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ has the continued fraction form, then $\left(\prod_{1}^{n}M_{i}\right)\left(\infty\right)=\left(\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}\right)\left(0\right)$
since $M_{i}\left(\infty\right)=0$. It follows that we have convergence
at $0$ if and only if we have convergence at $\infty$. Writing $\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n-1} & p_{n}\\
q_{n-1} & q_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ , this limit will simply be $\limfi n\frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$. \\
For $x\in\left(0,\infty\right)$ we have that 
\[
\left[\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}\right]\left(x\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n-1} & p_{n}\\
q_{n-1} & q_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)\left(x\right)=\frac{p_{n-1}x+p_{n}}{q_{n-1}x+q_{n}}
\]
and in case the $p_{n}$ and $q_{n}$ sequences are positive, it is
an exercise to show that $\frac{p_{n-1}x+p_{n}}{q_{n-1}x+q_{n}}$
is in the segment defined by the endpoints $\left\{ \frac{p_{n}}{q_{n}},\frac{p_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}}\right\} $.
It follows that when applying $\left[\prod_{1}^{n-1}M_{i}\right]$
to any element in $\left[0,\infty\right]$, the sequence converges
and to the same limit. \\
The condition on the $p_{n},q_{n}$ is true, for example, if the $a_{i},b_{i}$
are all positive, which is the case for simple continued fractions. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}


\subsection*{Potential and coboundary equivalence}

\begin{flushleft}
In our previous discussion about continued fractions, where $M_{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{i}\\
1 & a_{i}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, we were specially interested in $P_{n}:=\prod_{1}^{n}M_{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}p_{n-1} & p_{n}\\
q_{n-1} & q_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ which contained the numerators and denominators of the convergents.
These products can be defined for any sequence $M_{i}$ of matrices,
and we think of them as \textbf{potential matrices} where we move
from the potential at point $i$ to the potential at point $i+1$
via the matrix $M_{i}$, or more formally $P_{i}M_{i}=P_{i+1}$. We
can also restrict them to row vectors, instead of full $2\times2$
matrices. In particular, for the continued fraction matrices, each
such vector sequence will satisfy $\left(F_{i-1},F_{i}\right)M_{i}=\left(F_{i},F_{i+1}\right)$,
where $F_{i}$ solves the recurrence relation 
\[
F_{i+1}=F_{i}a_{i}+F_{i-1}b_{i}
\]
that we already encountered before in \subsecref{Euler's-formula}.

Attempting to move from the potential of one sequence to another is
quite natural, and this type of question is usually asked in cohomology
theory (see for example chapter 4 in \cite{brown_cohomology_2012}),
where such sequences $M_{i}$ of matrices should and can be called
``\textbf{cocycles}''. We will not go too much into this theory
here, since on the one hand this cocycle structure is in a sense trivial
here, and on the other hand, the theory is usually much more geared
into commutative rings, unlike our noncommutative matrix setting.
However, the question about natural conversion between the potentials
exists in this theory and is called coboundary equivalence, and this
will come up a lot in our study. More specifically we want to move
from one potential $P_{i}^{\left(1\right)}$ to the second $P_{i}^{\left(2\right)}$
using a nice transformation $P_{i}^{\left(1\right)}U_{i}=P_{i}^{\left(2\right)}$,
producing for us this commutative diagram:
\[
\xymatrix{P_{1}^{\left(1\right)}\ar[r]^{M_{1}^{\left(1\right)}}\ar[d]^{U_{1}} & P_{2}^{\left(1\right)}\ar[r]^{M_{2}^{\left(1\right)}}\ar[d]^{U_{2}} & P_{3}^{\left(1\right)}\ar[r]^{M_{3}^{\left(1\right)}}\ar[d]^{U_{3}} & \cdots\ar[r]^{M_{n-1}^{\left(1\right)}} & P_{n}^{\left(1\right)}\ar[d]^{U_{n}}\\
P_{1}^{\left(2\right)}\ar[r]^{M_{1}^{\left(2\right)}} & P_{2}^{\left(2\right)}\ar[r]^{M_{2}^{\left(2\right)}} & P_{3}^{\left(2\right)}\ar[r]^{M_{3}^{\left(2\right)}} & \cdots\ar[r]^{M_{n-1}^{\left(2\right)}} & P_{n}^{\left(2\right)}
}
\]
More formally, we have the following.
\begin{defn}
Two matrix sequences $M_{i}^{\left(1\right)},\;M_{i}^{\left(2\right)}$
are called \textbf{$U_{i}$-coboundary equivalent} for a sequence
of invertible matrices $U_{i}$ if $M_{i}^{\left(1\right)}U_{i+1}=U_{i}M_{i}^{\left(2\right)}$
for all $i$, or in a commutative diagram form:
\[
\xymatrix{\left(*\right)\ar[r]^{M_{i}^{\left(2\right)}} & \left(*\right)\\
\left(*\right)\ar[r]_{M_{i}^{\left(1\right)}}\ar[u]^{U_{i}} & \left(*\right)\ar[u]_{U_{i+1}}
}
.
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
In the world of standard, non indexed matrices, this coboundary equivalence
is simply matrix conjugation, and as we shall see some of the results
for this coboundary equivalence are just ``indexed'' version of
what we expect from matrix conjugacy.
\end{rem}

The commutativity condition in the coboundary definition can be extended
to products of the $M_{i}$, and in particular for our potential matrices.
Indeed, a simple inductions shows that with the notations as in the
definition, for all $m\leq n$ we have
\[
U_{m}\left[\prod_{m}^{n}M_{i}^{\left(2\right)}\right]=\left[\prod_{m}^{n}M_{i}^{\left(1\right)}\right]U_{n+1}.
\]

Every two matrix sequences $M_{i}^{\left(1\right)},\;M_{i}^{\left(2\right)}$
(invertible) are coboundary equivalent for some $U_{i}$. Indeed,
once we choose $U_{1}$, we can recursively define $U_{i+1}=\left(M_{i}^{\left(2\right)}\right)^{-1}U_{i}M_{i}^{\left(1\right)}$.
However, what will matter to us later on is that $U_{i}$ is simple
enough to work with. For example, it can be defined over $\ZZ$, triangular,
diagonal, etc. In particular, we want to work with the Mobius maps
induced by the matrices, and the upper triangular (resp. lower triangular)
are exactly the matrices which take infinity to itself (resp. zero
to itself).

This idea of coboundary equivalent sequences is very useful, and we
have already seen one such important example. In the ``equivalence
transformation'' for continued fractions in \lemref{equivalence-transformation}
we used 
\[
M_{n}^{\left(1\right)}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & b_{n}\\
1 & a_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right),\quad,M_{n}^{\left(2\right)}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & c_{n-1}c_{n}b_{n}\\
1 & c_{n}a_{n}
\end{smallmatrix}\right),\quad U_{n}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & c_{n-1}
\end{smallmatrix}\right)
\]
so that $M_{n}^{\left(1\right)}U_{n+1}=c_{n-1}U_{n}M_{n}^{\left(2\right)}$,
and since we deal with Mobius transformation, where scalar matrices
act as the identity, we have $M_{n}^{\left(1\right)}U_{n+1}\equiv U_{n}M_{n}^{\left(2\right)}$.

\medskip{}

Another important example is polynomial continued fractions in the
Euler family.
\begin{example}
\label{exa:Euler_to_triangular}Consider the polynomial continued fraction matrix of the form
\begin{align*}
b\left(x\right) & =-h_{1}\left(x\right)h_{2}\left(x\right)\\
f\left(x\right)a\left(x\right) & =f\left(x-1\right)h_{1}\left(x\right)+f\left(x+1\right)h_{2}\left(x+1\right)\\
M\left(x\right) & =\begin{pmatrix}0 & b\left(x\right)\\
1 & a\left(x\right)
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Define 
\[
U\left(x\right)=\begin{pmatrix}\left(f\left(x\right)h_{2}\left(x\right)\right)^{-1} & 0\\
f\left(x-1\right) & f\left(x\right)h_{2}\left(x\right)
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Then $M\left(n\right)$ is $U\left(n\right)$-coboundary equivalent
to 
\begin{align*}
M'\left(n\right):=U\left(n\right)M\left(n\right)U\left(n+1\right)^{-1} & =\begin{pmatrix}h_{1}\left(x\right) & \frac{-1}{f\left(x\right)f\left(x+1\right)}\frac{h_{2}\left(x\right)}{h_{2}\left(x+1\right)}\\
0 & h_{2}\left(x\right)
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
It then follows that 
\[
U\left(1\right)\left[\prod_{1}^{n}M\left(i\right)\right]\left(0\right)=\left[\prod_{1}^{n}M'\left(i\right)\right]U\left(n+1\right)\left(0\right)=\left[\prod_{1}^{n}M'\left(i\right)\right]\left(0\right).
\]
In other words, to find the limit of a polynomial continued fraction
in the Euler form, it is enough to find the product of upper triangular
matrices which is much easier to compute. We leave it as an exercise
to show that it actually reaches the same limit as in \subsecref{Euler's-formula}.

\section{\label{app:integer-values}The algebra of integer valued polynomial}

One of the tools we need along the way were rational polynomial $f\in\QQ\left[x\right]$
where $f\left(\ZZ\right)\subseteq\ZZ$, which are called \textbf{integer
valued polynomials}. Of course, if we can write $f\left(x\right)\in\ZZ\left[x\right]$,
then $f$ is integer valued, but the other direction is not true.
For example, every integer value of $g\left(x\right)=x\left(x+1\right)$
is divisible by $2$, so that $f\left(x\right)=\frac{x\left(x+1\right)}{2}$
is an integer valued polynomial which is not in $\ZZ\left[x\right]$.
There are many more such polynomials, which we write as follows:
\begin{defn}
For $n\in\NN$ we define the polynomial $\binom{x}{n}=\prod_{0}^{n-1}\frac{\left(x-i\right)}{i+1}=\frac{x\cdot\left(x-1\right)\cdots\left(x-n+1\right)}{n!}$.
This is a polynomial of degree $n$ in $\QQ\left[x\right]$, so that
$\left\{ \binom{x}{n}\right\} _{0}^{\infty}$ is a $\QQ$-basis for
$\QQ\left[x\right]$. In particular, for a nonnegative integers $x$,
we simply get the binomials.
\end{defn}

The class of integer valued polynomials was fully described by Plya
in \cite{polya_uber_1915}, and it was shown to contain exactly the
integer combinations of the $\binom{x}{n}$ above. For the ease of
the reader, we add the proof for this result here.
\begin{lem}
For every integer $m$, we have that $\binom{m}{n}\in\ZZ$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We first note that Pascal's identity holds for the polynomial. Indeed,
taking 
\[
p\left(x\right)=\binom{x}{n}-\binom{x-1}{n-1}-\binom{x-1}{n},
\]
we get a finite degree polynomial where $p\left(m\right)=0$ for all
$m\geq n$, so that $p\left(x\right)\equiv0$ as a polynomial.

In order to prove that $\binom{m}{n}\in\ZZ$ for all $n,m\in\ZZ$,
we use induction, first on $n$ and then on $m$.

For $n=0$ we simply get that $\binom{m}{0}=1$ and for $n=1$ we
get $\binom{m}{1}=m$ for all $m$, so we are done.

Assume now the claim for $n-1$ and we prove for $n\geq2$. By Pascal's
identity we have $\binom{m}{n}=\binom{m-1}{n-1}+\binom{m-1}{n}$ and
since $\binom{m-1}{n-1}$ is always an integer by the induction hypothesis,
then $\binom{m}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $\binom{m-1}{n}$
is an integer. In other words, we only need to show this for a single
$m$. Taking $m=0$ we get $\binom{0}{n}=0$ and we are done.
\end{proof}
In the following, when we write $d\mid q$ for $d\in\ZZ$ and $q\in\QQ$,
we mean that $q$ has to be an integer and is divisible by $d$.
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:binomial-polynomials}Given a general polynomial $f\left(x\right)=\sum_{0}^{d}a_{n}\binom{x}{n}\in\QQ\left[x\right]$
and an integer $k$ the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all $0\leq n\leq d$ we have $k\mid a_{n}$ ,
\item For all $m\in\ZZ$ we have $k\mid f\left(m\right)$ ,
\item For $m=0,1,...,d$ , we have $k\mid f\left(m\right)$ ,
\item There exists $m_{0}$ such that $k\mid f\left(m_{0}+m\right)$ for
$m=0,1,...,d$, and
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Note first that considering the polynomial $\frac{f\left(x\right)}{k}$
instead, it is enough to prove the lemma for $k=1$. Namely, we just
need to show that the coefficients\textbackslash evaluation are integers.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\left(1\right)\Rightarrow\left(2\right)$: follows from the fact
that $\binom{m}{n}$ are integers for all $m$.
\item $\left(2\right)\Rightarrow\left(3\right)$: is trivial.
\item $\left(3\right)\Rightarrow\left(1\right)$: Since $\binom{n}{n}=1$
and $\binom{m}{n}=0$ when $0\leq m<n$, it follows that for $0\leq m\leq d$
we have 
\[
f\left(m\right)=a_{m}+\sum_{n=0}^{m-1}a_{n}\binom{m}{n},
\]
which we can also write as 
\[
a_{m}=f\left(m\right)-\sum_{n=0}^{m-1}a_{n}\binom{m}{n}.
\]
So if $a_{n}\in\ZZ$ for $0\leq n<m$, then since $f\left(m\right)\in\ZZ$
by assumption and $\binom{m}{n}\in\ZZ$, we conclude that $a_{m}\in\ZZ$.
Thus, by induction we get that $a_{n}\in\ZZ$ for all $0\leq n\leq d$,
namely we get $\left(1\right)$.
\item $\left(2\right)\Rightarrow\left(4\right)$: is trivial.
\item $\left(4\right)\Rightarrow\left(2\right)$: If $f\left(m_{0}+m\right)\in\ZZ$
for $m=0,...,d$, then setting $g\left(m\right)=f\left(m_{0}+m\right)$
we see that $g\left(m\right)\in\ZZ$ for $m=0,...,d$. By the $\left(3\right)\Rightarrow\left(2\right)$
direction for the degree $d$ polynomial $g$ we get that $g\left(m\right)=f\left(m_{0}+m\right)\in\ZZ$
for all $m$, which is exactly condition $\left(2\right)$ for the
polynomial $f$ and we are done.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

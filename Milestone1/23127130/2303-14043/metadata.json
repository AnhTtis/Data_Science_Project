    "abstract": "Let $λ(n)$ denote the exponent of the multiplicative group modulo $n$. We show that when $q$ is odd, each coprime residue class modulo $q$ is hit equally often by $λ(n)$ as $n$ varies. Under the stronger assumption that $\\gcd(q,6)=1$, we prove that equidistribution persists throughout a Siegel--Walfisz-type range of uniformity. By similar methods we show that $λ(n)$ obeys Benford's leading digit law with respect to natural density. Moreover, if we assume GRH, then Benford's law holds for the order of $a$ mod $n$, for any fixed integer $a\\notin \\{0,\\pm 1\\}$.",

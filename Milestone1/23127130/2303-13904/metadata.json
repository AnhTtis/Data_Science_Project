    "abstract": "Harnessing the optoelectronic response of organic semiconductors requires a thorough understanding of the fundamental light-matter interaction that is dominated by the excitation of correlated electron-hole pairs, i.e. excitons. The nature of these excitons would be fully captured by knowing the quantum-mechanical wavefunction, which, however, is difficult to access both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we use femtosecond photoemission orbital tomography in combination with many-body perturbation theory to gain access to exciton wavefunctions in organic semiconductors. We find that the coherent sum of multiple electron-hole pair contributions that typically make up a single exciton can be experimentally evidenced by photoelectron spectroscopy. For the prototypical organic semiconductor buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$), we show how to disentangle such multiorbital contributions and thereby access key properties of the exciton wavefunctions including localization, charge-transfer character, and ultrafast exciton formation and relaxation dynamics.",

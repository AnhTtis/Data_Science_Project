    "abstract": "We propose and demonstrate a holographic imaging scheme exploiting random illuminations for recording hologram and then applying numerical reconstruction and twin removal. We use an in-line holographic geometry to record the hologram in terms of the second-order correlation and apply the numerical approach to reconstruct the recorded hologram. The twin image issue of the in-line holographic scheme is resolved by an unsupervised deep learning(DL) based method using an auto-encoder scheme. This strategy helps to reconstruct high-quality quantitative images in comparison to the conventional holography where the hologram is recorded in the intensity rather than the second-order intensity correlation. Experimental results are presented for two objects, and a comparison of the reconstruction quality is given between the conventional inline holography and the one obtained with the proposed technique.",

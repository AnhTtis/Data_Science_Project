\section{Conclusions}
We pointed out that the crux behind the poor coverage of the conventional CAM is that the global classifier captures only the discriminative features of objects. We proposed a novel method dubbed LPCAM to leverage both discriminative and non-discriminative local prototypes to generate activation maps with complete coverage on objects. Our extensive experiments and studies on two popular WSSS benchmarks showed the superiority of LPCAM over CAM.

    \caption{The pipeline for generating LPCAM. (a) Generating local prototypes from all training images of an individual class, e.g., ``sheep''. 
    (b) Generating LPCAM by \emph{sliding} both class prototypes and context prototypes over the feature block of the input image, and \emph{aggregating} the obtained similarity maps.
    In the gray block, the generation process of CAM is shown for comparison. }

    \caption{Justifying the advantages of LPCAM over CAM from two perspectives: (a) clustering and (b) normalization. For simplicity, in (a), we consider only three local regions on a ``bird'' image: $\bm{x_1}$: ``head'', $\bm{x_2}$: ``tail'', $\bm{x_3}$: ``sky''. In (b), we assume two class prototypes (``head'' and ``tail''), and one context prototype (``sky'') are selected after local feature clustering.}

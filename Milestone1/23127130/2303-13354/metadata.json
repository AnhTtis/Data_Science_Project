    "abstract": "To plan a safe and efficient route, an autonomous vehicle should anticipate future trajectories of other agents around it. Trajectory prediction is an extremely challenging task which recently gained a lot of attention in the autonomous vehicle research community. Trajectory-prediction forecasts future state of all the dynamic agents in the scene given their current and past states. A good prediction model can prevent collisions on the road, and hence the ultimate goal for autonomous vehicles: Collision rate: collisions per Million miles. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the field trajectory-prediction. We categorize the relevant algorithms into different classes so that researchers can follow through the trends in the trajectory-prediction research field. Moreover we also touch upon the background knowledge required to formulate a trajectory-prediction problem.",

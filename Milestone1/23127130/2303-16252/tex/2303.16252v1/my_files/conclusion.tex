\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a novel schema-guided zero-shot generalizable end-to-end task-oriented dialog system that estimates a concise summary of the dialog history through the dialog state.
This system leverages domain schemas and effective dialog history summarization to allow for robust generalization to unseen domains, overcoming the major bottleneck of acquiring labeled training data for each new domain.
Additionally, a two-stage training methodology was introduced, wherein the model initially acquires an understanding of the general structure of the dialog data and subsequently optimizes the response generation process.
The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed {\oursys} over state-of-the-art models on key metrics, particularly with a \textbf{+17\% joint goal accuracy} and \textbf{+5 inform} improvement over prior work.
To better evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed components and training mechanisms, we have provided an ablation study that shows the significance of our contributions.

%and the effectiveness of the proposed components and training mechanisms is demonstrated through a detailed ablation study.

%In this paper, we have presented a novel Schema Guided Zero-Shot Generalizable End-to-End Task Oriented Dialog System using Context Summarization,
%which to the best of our knowledge is the first End-to-End TOD system for the SGD dataset. We proposed to restructure the input to a TOD system,
%by passing the last user utterance and the previous state DST as context instead of the dialog history. We also introduced a two step
%training approach, where the model first learns the general structure of the data and then optimizes the generation.
%To better understand our contributions, we have provided an ablation study that shows the importance of each component of our approach.
%Our experimental results show that~\oursys~beats existing End-To-End TOD systems and outperforms state-of-the-art DST systems on key metrics
%like Average and Joint Goal Accuracy by a large margin in the SGD dataset.

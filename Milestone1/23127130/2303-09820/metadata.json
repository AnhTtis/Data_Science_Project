    "abstract": "We give a decoding algorithm for a class of error-correcting codes, which can be used in the DHH-cryptosystem, which is a candidate for post-quantum cryptography, since it is of McEliece type. Furthermore, we implement the encryption and decryption algorithms for this cryptosystem and investigate its performance.",

    "abstract": "We introduce QuantumGEP, a scientific computer program that uses gene expression programming (GEP) to find a quantum circuit that either (i) maps a given set of input states to a given set of output states, or (ii) transforms a fixed initial state to minimize a given physical quantity of the output state. QuantumGEP is a driver program that uses evendim, a generic computational engine for GEP, both of which are free and open source. We apply QuantumGEP as a powerful solver for MaxCut in graphs, and for condensed matter quantum many-body Hamiltonians.",

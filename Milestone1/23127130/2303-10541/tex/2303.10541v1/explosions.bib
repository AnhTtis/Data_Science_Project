        annote = {We present a comprehensive methodology for realistically
     animating liquid phenomena. Physically accurate 3D motion is achieved by
     performing a two-stage calculation over an arbitrary environment of static
     obstacles surrounded by fluid. A finite difference approximation to the
     Navier-Stokes equations is first applied to a low resolution, voxelized
     representation of the scene. The resulting velocity and pressure fields
     describe the gross transport of liquid, including effects such as
     splashing, vorticity and overturn- ing. Local fluid velocity is then used
     to drive a height field equation or to convect massless marker particles.
     The position of any free surface can thus be determined to a significantly
     higher resolution than that of the Navier-Stokes calculation. In addition,
     the pressure field, together with the Lagrange equations of motion, is
     used to simulate dynamic buoyant objects. Typical disadvantages to
     volumetric methods such as poor scalability and lack of control are
     addressed by assuming that stationary obstacles align with grid ceus
     during the finite difference discretization, and by appending driving
     functions to the Navier-Stokes equations. The output from our system is
     suitable for many of the water rendering algorithms presented by
     researchers in recent years. },

     challenge. After describing the basic phenomenology of explosion events,
     we present an efficient computational model of isotropic blast wave
     transport and an algorithm for fracturing objects in their wake. Our model
     is based on the notion of a blast curve that gives the force-loading
     profile of an explosive material on an object as a function of distance
     from the explosion's centre. We also describe a technique for fracturing
     materials loaded by a blast. Our approach is based on the notion of rapid
     fracture: that microfractures in a material together with loading forces
     seed a fracturing process that quickly spreads across the material and
     causes it to fragment. },

     various atmospheric conditions. These conditions are parameterized using
     terms that users can either measure or estimate. We also present an

     modelling "wispy" smoke and steam, using far fewer primitives than before.
     One significant innovation is the reformulation and solution of the

     These blobs more accurately model the distortions that gases undergo when
     advected by wind fields. We also introduce a simple model for the flame of
     a fire and its spread. Lastly, we present an efficient formulation and

     procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly
     create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction
     of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until
     recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to
     allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that
     previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations
     governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an
     unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like
     flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our
     model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster
     simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid

     similar hierarchy using multiple instances of a new low curvature image
     simplifier (LCIS), a partial differential equation inspired by anisotropic
     diffusion. Each LCIS reduces the scene to many smooth regions that are
     bounded by sharp gradient discontinuities, and a single parameter K chosen
     for each LCIS controls region size and boundary complexity. With a few
     chosen K values (K1 > K2 > K3...) LCIS makes a set of progressively simpler
     images, and image differences form a hierarchy of increasingly important
     details, boundaries and large features.\\ We construct a high detail, low
     contrast display image from this hierarchy by compressing only the large
     features, then adding back all small details. Unlike linear filter
     hierarchies such as wavelets, filter banks, or image pyramids, LCIS
     hierarchies do not smooth across scene boundaries, avoiding "halo"

    "abstract": "A conjecture, recently stated by Flach and Morin, relates the action of the monodromy on the Galois invariant part of the p-adic Beilinson-Hyodo-Kato cohomology of the generic fiber of a scheme defined over a DVR of mixed characteristic to (the cohomology of) its special fiber. We prove the conjecture in the case the special fiber, of the given arithmetic scheme, is also a fiber of a geometric family over a curve in positive characteristic.",

    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $K$ with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. For unipotent elements $u \\in G$ and nilpotent elements $e \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, the Jordan block sizes of $\\operatorname{Ad}(u)$ and $\\operatorname{ad}(e)$ are known in most cases. In the cases that remain, the group $G$ is of classical type in bad characteristic, so $\\operatorname{char} K = 2$ and $G$ is of type $B_{\\ell}$, $C_{\\ell}$, or $D_{\\ell}$.\n  In this paper, we consider the case where $G$ is of type $C_{\\ell}$ and $\\operatorname{char} K = 2$. As our main result, we determine the Jordan block sizes of $\\operatorname{Ad}(u)$ and $\\operatorname{ad}(e)$ for all unipotent $u \\in G$ and nilpotent $e \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. In the case where $G$ is of adjoint type, we will also describe the Jordan block sizes on $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$.",

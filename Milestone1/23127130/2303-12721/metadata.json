    "abstract": "Tensor completion is an important problem in modern data analysis. In this work, we investigate a specific sampling strategy, referred to as tubal sampling. We propose two novel non-convex tensor completion frameworks that are easy to implement, named tensor $L_1$-$L_2$ (TL12) and tensor completion via CUR (TCCUR). We test the efficiency of both methods on synthetic data and a color image inpainting problem. Empirical results reveal a trade-off between the accuracy and time efficiency of these two methods in a low sampling ratio. Each of them outperforms some classical completion methods in at least one aspect.",

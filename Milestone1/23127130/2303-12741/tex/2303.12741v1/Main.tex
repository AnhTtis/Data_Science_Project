%% The "title" command has an optional parameter,
%% allowing the author to define a "short title" to be used in page headers.
\title{A Method for Automatically Animating Children's Drawings of the Human Figure}

%%
%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
%% the authors and their affiliations.
%% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the
%% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
%% used to denote shared contribution to the research.

Children's drawings have a wonderful inventiveness, creativity, and variety to them.
We present a system that automatically animates children's drawings of the human figure, is robust to the variance inherent in these depictions, and is simple and straightforward enough for anyone to use. 
We demonstrate the value and broad appeal of our approach by building and releasing the \AD Demo, a freely available public website that has been used by millions of people around the world.
We present a set of experiments exploring the amount of training data needed for fine-tuning, as well as a perceptual study demonstrating the appeal of a novel \textit{twisted perspective} retargeting technique. 
Finally, we introduce the Amateur Drawings Dataset, a first-of-its-kind \hjs{annotated} dataset, collected via the public demo, containing over 178,000 amateur drawings and corresponding \hjs{user-accepted} character bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and joint location annotations.

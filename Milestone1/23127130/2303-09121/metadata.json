    "abstract": "Single-center two-electron integration is an important core technology in ab initio calculation of atomic and molecular structures. Therefore, this paper reviews and optimizes the method of Zhao et al., and draws a conclusion: Because this method is an accurate calculation without truncation error, it is superior to Slater-Condon integration method.",

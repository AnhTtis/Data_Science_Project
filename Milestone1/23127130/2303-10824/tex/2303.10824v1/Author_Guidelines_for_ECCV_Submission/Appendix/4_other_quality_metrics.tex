To evaluate the fidelity of synthetic images, we use the Fr\'{e}chet inception distance (FID), a standard metric for images generated using GANs. Other common metrics include PSNR and SSIM; however, these metrics quantify the degradation of quality when a source image is transformed, whereas FID measures a distributional similarity to a set of reference images based on high-level activations. FID uniquely assesses whether $k$-SALSA images are realistic compared to real retinal images. Moreover, $k$-SALSA introduces spatial flexibility of image features, which is not captured by pixel-level metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

Here we provide additional empirical results supporting our choices of similarity metric in the local style alignment.
Recall that once the local style features are constructed for each batch, we find the optimal matches between the target and source images using cosine similarity (COS).
Given these optimal matches, we then use mean squared error (MSE) to optimize the synthetic average (see the definition of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{style}}$ in Eq.~7), effectively transferring the local styles from the source image to the target average.
We note that these choices are inspired by prior works; dense contrastive learning~\cite{Wang21} uses the COS metric to perform the alignment, whereas style transfer~\cite{Gatys16} is typically done using the MSE---our work combines these two approaches and keeps the respective similarity metrics.
As shown in Supplementary Table~\ref{table:ablation2}, using either of COS and MSE metrics for both components of the model (COS-COS or MSE-MSE) results in worse averaging performance as measured by the downstream classification task evaluated in our work, which intuitively captures how well the clinically relevant features are preserved in the averaged images.
This result supports our hybrid use of both metrics.

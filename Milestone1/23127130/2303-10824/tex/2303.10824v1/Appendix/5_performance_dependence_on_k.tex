To further investigate the effect of cluster size $k$ on downstream classification performance, we compared the classifiers trained on $k$-SALSA synthetic datasets for different values of $k$, but subsampled to the same number of clusters.
Note that larger $k$ leads to fewer clusters and thus smaller training data for classification.
At the same time, larger $k$ increases the potential to retain more salient features from source images.
As shown in Supplementary Table~\ref{table:dependence_k}, we observed a performance improvement for larger $k$ in APTOS,
suggesting that summarizing key features across multiple images has a beneficial impact on the classifier training.

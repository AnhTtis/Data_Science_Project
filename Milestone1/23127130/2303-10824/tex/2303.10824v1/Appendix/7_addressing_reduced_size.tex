Dataset size is an important issue in medical imaging problems.
The reduced number of images in the synthetic average dataset constructed by $k$-SALSA is a potential concern.
To mitigate the cost of dataset reduction, we investigated an extension of $k$-SALSA based on data augmentation, whereby small random noise is added to $k$-SALSA's average embeddings to generate multiple ``views'' of each cluster.
As shown in Supplementary Table~\ref{table:reduced}, with 5 augmented images per cluster, we observed an improved performance of 0.829 (originally 0.769) for $k$-SALSA, and 0.809 (0.745) for $k$-Centroid in APTOS, $k$=5. 
This demonstrates the potential of our extension in countering the size reduction of the synthetic dataset with data augmentation.
Importantly, the augmented images are independent of private images conditioned on $k$-SALSA's representative embedding of each cluster, thus there is no additional privacy leakage.

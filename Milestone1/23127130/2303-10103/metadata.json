    "abstract": "A nonlinear elasticity model for comparing images is formulated and analyzed, in which optimal transformations between images are sought as minimizers of an integral functional. The existence of minimizers in a suitable class of homeomorphisms between image domains is established under natural hypotheses. We investigate whether for linearly related images the minimization algorithm delivers the linear transformation as the unique minimizer.",

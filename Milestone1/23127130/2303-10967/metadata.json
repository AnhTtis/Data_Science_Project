    "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to simultaneously predict the volumetric occupancy and semantic category of a 3D scene. In this paper, we propose a real-time semantic scene completion method with a feature aggregation strategy and conditioned prediction module. Feature aggregation fuses feature with different receptive fields and gathers context to improve scene completion performance. And the conditioned prediction module adopts a two-step prediction scheme that takes volumetric occupancy as a condition to enhance semantic completion prediction. We conduct experiments on three recognized benchmarks NYU, NYUCAD, and SUNCG. Our method achieves competitive performance at a speed of 110 FPS on one GTX 1080 Ti GPU.",

\title{Entanglement in conformal field theory and holography}
% \subtitle{-- Monograph --}
\maketitle 

\abstract{In these notes we give a pedagogical account of the replica trick derivation of CFT entanglement and its holographic counterpart, i.e.~the Lewkowycz Maldacena derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. The application to an `island set-up' for the calculation of black hole radiation entropy is briefly discussed. Further topics focused on are the relation to thermal entropy, thermofield double constructions and statements about the emergence of gravity from entanglement through reinterpretations of gravitational first laws.}

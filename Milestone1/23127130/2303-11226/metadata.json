    "abstract": "In this paper, we compute special values of certain combinatorial zeta functions counting geodesic paths in the (n-1)-skeleton of a triangulation of a n-dimensional manifold. We show that they carry a topological meaning. As such, we recover the first Betti number and L2-Betti number of compact manifolds, and the linking number of pairs of null-homologous knots in a 3-manifold. The tool to relate the two sides (counting geodesics/topological invariants) are random walks on higher dimensional skeleta of the triangulation.",

	abstract = {Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations have been used to examine the structure and friction of stearic acid ﬁlms adsorbed on iron surfaces with nanoscale roughness. The eﬀect of pressure, stearic acid coverage, and level of surface roughness were investigated. The direct contact of asperities was prevented under all of the conditions simulated due to strong adsorption, which prevented squeeze-out. An increased coverage generally resulted in lower lateral (friction) forces due to reductions in both the friction coeﬃcient and Derjaguin oﬀset. Rougher surfaces led to more liquidlike, disordered ﬁlms; however, the friction coeﬃcient and Derjaguin oﬀset were only slightly increased. This suggests that stearic acid ﬁlms are almost as eﬀective on contact surfaces with nanoscale roughness as those which are atomically-smooth.},

We investigate atomic liquids for new state points, and in addition two types of dumbbell liquids: ( 1) finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) and (2) newly defined generalized Lennard-Jones (GLJ), up to a nondimensional shear rate of 15. The dumbbell liquids exhibit shear thinning, non-zero first and second normal stress differences, and volumetric dilatancy. These effects are weakly sensitive to details in shape of the intra-molecular potentials, and to the dominant frequency associated with vibrations of dumbbells. However, the Newtonian viscosity of dumbbell liquids strongly depends on the size of dumbbells. The onset of shear thinning of FENE and GLJ dumbbells is delayed to higher shear rates in comparison with atomic liquids. In general, for the entire investigated region, we see that dumbbells are slightly more elastic than atomic liquids.},

	abstract = {The viscoelastic properties of a polymer solution vary with both the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillatory shear rate. In steady flow the viscosity is non-Newtonian, changing with the shear rate. A rheological model is developed which describes the interrelationship between these properties. This model is based upon multiple relaxation processes ordered as in a generalized Maxwell model. However, these processes are truncated at higher shear rates in a manner dependent upon the product of the shear rate and the relaxation time. Both the steady flow and the oscillatory flow properties are controlled by the same relaxation processes. It is shown that the critical condition marking the onset of shear rate dependence of the viscoelasticity is that the shear rate is equal to either the reciprocal of the longest relaxation time or the radian frequency, whichever is larger.},

To get an insight into the effects of molecular architecture in the behaviour of these thin lubricant ﬁlms we have studied six different molecules, mainly isomers of C30. In this work the effect of branching on rheological properties and behaviour of lubricant ﬁlm is examined. Our study shows viscosity and normal stress effects depend on the degree of branching. Dynamics of the molecules and their orientation are also affected by the degree of branching. A weaker layering near the wall is observed for branched molecules. Slip between the wall and lubricant ﬁlm also was larger for branched molecules. Branched molecules had less tendency to change their orientation under the ﬂow. The results obtained here could be helpful in designing new lubricants at the molecular level.  2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This is the ﬁrst time that a coarsegrained simulation study is carried out on the crystallization process of short chain branched polyethylenes. Crystallization and subsequent melting temperatures are related linearly to the inverse of the lamellar thickness. Different melting lines, depending on short chain branching content are obtained, but a tendency to a single crystallization line is observed. These results qualitatively match to the experimental lines obtained in model homogeneous ethylene/a-oleﬁn copolymers. Additionally, a strong lamellar thickening process is reported for the linear model at temperatures below the melting point, which follows the classical interpretation reported in polyethylene, with a logarithmic increase of the crystal thickness with time. However, for the branched samples the thickening is impeded at the same degree of undercooling. In the branched models the short chain branches are excluded from the crystal remaining at the surface and amorphous regions. This causes the pinning of these regions, minimizing crystal chain diffusion and hindering crystal stem thickening. Again the simulated results qualitatively agree with the experimental data.},

However, increasing computational resources have brought the crystallization process within reach of molecular simulations, and several groups have published simulations of crystal nucleation and growth in polymers. Yet, these studies have focused on linear polymer chains, and no results have been reported on cross-linked polymers, which are common in everyday applications. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the homogeneous crystallization of cross-linked polyethylene at high undercooling. Large cross-link densities cause the crystallization to slow down and reduce the final degree of crystallization. As expected, cross-links are rejected from the crystals into the amorphous phase. We observe that at all cross-link densities the intercrystalline amorphous phase is characterized by a single distribution of free segment lengths (amorphous segments with no cross-links). The findings provide a basis for detailed computational studies of semi-crystalline cross-linked polymer systems.},

	abstract = {Poly(ester amide)s, PEA, based on poly(propylene succinate), PPS, improved by the addition of a new sym­ metrical amido diol, AD, at various molar fractions are investigated in this article. The emphasis is given on the effect of AD (hard segment) on crystallization and molecular mobility of the polymer. To that aim, we employed differential scanning calorimetry, DSC, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy, BDS. AD was found to system­ atically facilitate crystallization, both with respect to the rate and the fraction (CF increases from 0 up to {\textasciitilde}50 wt \%), which is desirable for industrial processing and applications. In agreement with previous findings on the same systems, our results suggest that the crystallites consist mainly of the hard AD segments, whereas soft segments (PPS-related) are the main contributors to the glass transition. AD was found to increase the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the soft segments both calorimetric and dielectric, indirectly via the increase in the CF. The rigid amorphous fraction, RAF, of the polymer existing in the vicinity of the formed crystals was esti­ mated and is proposed to consist mainly of soft segments without, however, excluding a minor contribution of non-crystallized AD. RAF exhibits non-systematic alternations with CF, most probably due to the expected variations in the semicrystalline morphology. BDS allowed the full-temperature range dynamics mapping and, subsequently, revealing of effects of the polymer composition in combination with CF and the involved traces of water on the local (β and βw relaxations) and segmental (α relaxation) dynamics. Upon addition of AD, the ester bond-related local β relaxation of PPS accelerates, exhibiting, however, unchanged activation energy (Eact{\textasciitilde}39 kJ/mol). Simultaneously, α relaxation, related to the glass transition, slows down (in agreement with calorim­ etry) and exhibits a worth noting decrease in cooperativity. These results indicate severe effects on molecular dynamics and suggest possible changes in the polymer free volume/density in the PEAs. βw relaxation with Eact{\textasciitilde}58 kJ/mol is recorded for the first time in PPS and is related with the same ester group as β, moreover, with water molecule(s) attached.},

It is found that the nanorod has the most outstanding ability to increase the modulus of PNCs among the three, followed by the nanosheet. The increase of filler size can increase the modulus of the system and has little effect on Payne effect. The source of modulus enhancement of PNCs respectively filled with nanorods and nanosheets changes with increasing volume fraction from Rouse dynamics of the polymer chains to the binding force of the filler on the polymer chains and eventually to the filler network. Increasing the filler size makes the Rouse dynamics region and chain confinement region narrower and the permeation threshold lower. However, the source of modulus enhancement of PNCs filled with nanoparticles is mainly the Rouse dynamics of polymer chains, which only conforms to the above mechanism at a high interface degree of nanoparticles.},

The time-dependent mass ﬂow rate predicted by our enhanced CFD agrees well with a full molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the same conﬁguration, and is achieved at a fraction of the computational cost. Conventional CFD predictions of the same case are wholly inadequate. We then demonstrate the application of enhanced CFD as a design optimisation tool on a bifurcating two-dimensional channel, with the target of maximising mass ﬂow rate for a ﬁxed total volume and applied pressure. At macro scales the optimised geometry agrees well with Murray’s Law for optimal branching of vascular networks; however, at nanoscales, the optimum result deviates from Murray’s Law, and a corrected equation is presented.},

	abstract = {Lubricants are complex ﬂuids consisting of a base oil and many different additives, and are used to control friction and wear between solid inorganic surfaces in relative motion. A review of recent work on molecular simulations of lubricants is given. It is shown that simulations can be used to uncover a lot of interesting behaviour, including additive adsorption, additive self-assembly, and a competition between the two. The speciﬁc examples to be discussed are: the adsorption of stearic acid and oleic acid in squalane on iron-oxide surfaces; the self-assembly of glycerol monooleate in bulk n-heptane; the adsorption and friction of glycerol monooleate in squalane on iron-oxide surfaces; and the conformations of functionalised copolymers in bulk n-heptane. The structures adopted by the additives can be correlated with the observed frictional properties, opening up the possibility of molecular-level design of new lubricants.},

	abstract = {This paper is an pedagogical essay on the scenario of the instabilities and the transition to turbulence in visco-elastic polymer ﬂows. When polymers are long, they get easily stretched by the shear present in ﬂows, and the viscosity of the solution or melt is large. As a result, inertial effects are usually negligible as the Reynolds numbers are small but the ﬂuid is strongly nonNewtonian due to the shear-induced elasticity and anistropy, and the slow relaxation effects. The dimensionless number governing these nonNewtonian effects is the Weissenberg number Wi. From a number of precise experiments and theoretical investigations in the last ﬁfteen years, it has become clear that as the Weissenberg number increases, visco-elastic ﬂuids exhibit ﬂow instabilities driven by the anisotropy of the normal stress components and the curvature of the streamlines. The combination of these normal stress effects that drive laminar curved ﬂow unstable and the possibilty of the elastic effects to store energy in high shear regions and to dump it elsewhere in less sheared regions, appears to be strongly self-enhancing: Instabilities and the transition to a turbulent regime driven by these elastic forces, are often found to be hysteretic and strongly subcritical (nonlinear). There are two main underlying themes of this introductory essay. First of all, that it is proﬁtable to let one be motivated by transition scenarios in Newtonian ﬂuids as a function of Reynolds number, when investigating possible transition scenarios in visco-elastic ﬂuids as a function of Weissenberg number. Secondly, that the self-enhancing effects of polymer stretching will also cause subcritical instabilities in visco-elastic parallel shear ﬂows. The aim of this paper is to introduce and discuss these issues at a pictorial level which is accessible for a nonexpert. After introducing some of the basic ingredients of polymer rheology we follow a number of the important theoretical and experimental developments of the last ﬁfteen years and discuss the picture that emerges from it. We then turn to a discussion of recent theoretical and numerical approaches aimed at establishing whether visco-elastic parallel shear ﬂows indeed also exhibit a subcritical transition to elastic turbulence. We show how a simple extension of the well-known condition of Pakdel and McKinley for the instability threshold of curved ﬂows, can be extended to the nonlinear (subcritical) instability scenario of parallel visco-elastic shear ﬂows. This extension predicts the critical amplitude for the nonlinear instability to decrease as 1/Wi2 and to be independent of the wavenumber k of the perturbations. The fact that the threshold is k-independent over a large range of k’s suggest that many modes will be excited at the same time, and hence that the instability will generally drive the ﬂow turbulent. Implications of these results and an outlook for the future are discussed as well.},

The successive ﬁne graining (SFG) scheme is used to extrapolate the results of bead-spring chain simulations to the limit where the number of springs (Ns) approaches the number of rods (equal to the number of Kuhn steps, Nk) in a bead-rod model. It is found that in the absence of excluded volume (EV) and hydrodynamic interactions (HI), the analytical results for linear viscoelastic properties obtained using the bead-spring model with the SFG scheme are in complete agreement with the inﬁnitely stiff Fraenkel spring results. The numerical computations of linear viscoelastic properties in the presence of HI are found to be in good agreement with the results of the bead-rod model. In shear ﬂow, the SFG results show excellent agreement with bead-rod results for a range of shear rates both in the absence and presence of HI and EV. In the limit Ns → Nk, the numerical and analytical results obtained using the SFG scheme are found to be independent of the choice of spring force law.},

	abstract = {In semi-crystalline thermoplastic products, ﬁnal properties are strongly dependent on the thermomechanical history experienced by the polymer melt during processing. More precisely, structural heterogeneities such as rigidity gradients and shrinkage anisotropy are directly related to the crystalline microstructure. Therefore, accurate prediction of part properties by a processing computer simulation code requires the implementation of an appropriate crystallization kinetics model, including both the effects of thermally and ﬂow induced structure development. One issue is the necessity to improve the modeling of shear/extensional experimental data by relating the crystallization accelerating factors to an easily accessible material related variable. Several authors modeled the effect of the ﬂow on the crystallization kinetics by using the isokinetic approach of Nakamura. Often, the resulting kinetic equations of these models account only for the evolution of the crystallinity fraction ˛ leaving the inﬂuence of crystalline morphology aside. We may quote the work of Guo and Narh [1], which connects the ﬂow inﬂuence on the crystallization rate to the increase in the thermodynamic melting temperature in the Nakamura model. In 2005, R.I. Tanner presented a comparison of some models describing the polymer crystallization at low shear deformation rates under isothermal conditions. Based on Tanner’s study, we developed a model of crystallization at low shearing, applied to non-isothermal ﬂows, using only macroscopic measurable parameters. The key features of the concentrated suspension theory were used to characterize the effect of crystallization on the viscosity. In addition, we assumed that the ﬂow generates additional crystallization nuclei via a parameter which combines the deformation and the deformation rate. The concept of germination-growth is introduced using the fundamentals of the Avrami–Kolmogorov theory, coupled with a modiﬁed Schneider’s approach. The model is applied to a polypropylene, in a cooled Couette ﬂow conﬁguration. The results show the enhancement of the crystallization kinetics due to the shearing. The deﬁnition of global parameters simpliﬁes the type and the number of experiments needed for the model parameter identiﬁcation. The use of Schneider’s approach leads to a new way of discriminating the relative roles of the ﬂow and the temperature on the crystallization phenomenon. The competition between the two driving causes is presented and discussed: at low cooling rate or at high temperature, the shearing effect predominates. Other interesting results show the size distribution of the spherulites as well as the volume proportion for each crystalline size in the polymer.},

	abstract = {Shear flow is ubiquitous. Not only is it arguably the most widely-used deformation type to characterise complex fluids in rheological studies but also, in practice, the deformation most likely to occur in the great majority of flows, e.g. involving fluid transport through pipes or conduits. In steady simple shear flow the rheological properties of a complex fluid are completely characterised in just three material functions; the variation with shear rate of the shear viscosity and the so-called first and second normal-stress differences. Despite requiring only three material functions to be completely characterised, most shear-flow rheological characterisations are usually restricted simply to the shear viscosity and, at best, the variation of the first normal-stress difference N1 with shear rate. The second normal-stress difference N2 remains very much neglected. For dilute polymer so­ lutions where this quantity may be negligibly small in comparison to the first normal-stress difference, such neglect is justified but for a whole range of complex fluids – indeed even polymer solutions outside of the dilute regime and especially melts – it is not clear that N2 may be safely disregarded. Indeed, in this review article we spotlight a number of flows where second normal-stress differences are of importance and potentially major consequence. Following this attention, we review the many experimental techniques which have been proposed for its measurement and survey the available literature for measurements of this quantity for various complex fluids including the aforementioned polymeric solutions, melts, liquid crystals, dense non-Brownian suspensions (both with Newtonian and complex fluid bases), semi-dilute wormlike micellar fluids and magnetorheological fluids. Theoretical predictions for N2 from various commonly-used continuum constitutive equations – primarily from the polymer literature – are also given and their asymptotic predictions at low and high shear rates compared. Finally, we end with a brief summary and outlook.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to study viscoelastic behavior of model Lennard-Jones (LJ) crystalline composites subject to an oscillatory shear deformation. The two crystals, namely a soft and a stiff phase, individually show highly elastic behavior and very small loss modulus. On the other hand, when the stiff phase is included within the soft matrix as a sphere, the composite exhibits signiﬁcant viscous damping and a large phase shift between stress and strain. In fact, the maximum loss modulus in these model composites was found to be about 20 times greater than that given by the theoretical Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound. We attribute this behavior to the fact that in composites shear strain is highly inhomogeneous and mostly accommodated by the soft phase. This is corroborated by mode-dependent Grüneisen parameter analysis showing that in the low frequency regime, Grüneisen parameters, which measure degree of anharmonicity, are about twice greater for the composite than each individual homogenous crystal. Interestingly, the frequency at which the damping is greatest scales with the microstructural length scale of the composite, a feature we also observe for superlattice structures.},

	abstract = {The enhancement of the primary flow-induced nucleation rate in short chain alkanes (C20 and C150) has been examined for different levels of orientation by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The nucleation rate has been found to change drastically by varying average molecular orientation and temperature. For example, it is possible to accelerate nucleation kinetics by three orders of magnitude at the same temperature, but varying the average level of orientation (P2 (cos 0)) . The size of the critical nucleus has been found to increase with the level of undercooling Tm - T decrease, consistent with the classical nucleation theory. Our atomnistic molecular dynamics simulation model is even tractable at the small levels of undercooling, thus clearly demonstrating the effects of orientation (melt anisotropy) on nucleation kinetics when thermal nucleation is expected to be negligible. Furthermore, we calculate the influence of melt anisotropy on the growth rate. As expected, the growth rate is also altered by melt anisotropy. Furthermore, the growth rate maximum always occurs at the temperature above the nucleation kinetics maximum.},

With this foundation, experimental observations of normal stress differences in some suspensions and colloidal systems are surveyed, along with constitutive models that allow for normal stress differences to arise prior to yielding. Yield stresses are a hallmark of attractive colloidal systems and vital in their processing. In contrast, little attention has been given to the role of normal stress differences in these systems. The presence or absence of normal stress differences necessarily affects the isotropy of the normal stress field through the solid particulate phase (treated as a continuum), in turn affecting estimation of yield stress. Given the importance of yield stresses in dealing with practical industrial problems, and in understanding fundamental behaviours, it is important to ensure that yield measurements can be relied upon.},

We analyze the resulting trajectories using the Rouse modes of the chains, and find that entanglement strongly affect these modes. The relaxation rates of the chains show two limiting effective monomeric frictions, with the local modes experiencing much lower effective friction than the longer modes. The monomeric relaxation rates of longer modes vary approximately inversely with chain length due to kinetical confinement effects. The timedependent relaxation of Rouse modes has a stretched exponential character with a minimum of stretching exponent in the vicinity of the entanglement chain length. None of these trends are found in models that allow for chain crossing. These facts, in combination, argue for the confined motion of chains for time scales between the entanglement time and the ultimate free diffusion of these chains.},

Applications of G. M. Mittag-Leffler functions in certain areas of physical and applied sciences are also demonstrated. During the last two decades this function has come into prominence after about nine decades of its discovery by a Swedish Mathematician Mittag-Leffler, due to the vast potential of its applications in solving the problems of physical, biological, engineering, and earth sciences, and so forth. In this survey paper, nearly all types of Mittag-Leffler type functions existing in the literature are presented.

Polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) polymers were selected as candidate materials, the corresponding cell models consisting of five chains of 80 (PP) and 30 (PS) units were built successively. The energy minimization and anneal treatment were launched to optimize the unfavorable structures. The periodic boundary condition, COMPASS force field and the Velocity-Verlet algorithm were employed to calculate the shear flow behavior of chains. The sample data were collected and fitted based on the Matlab platform, and the analysis of the variance (ANOVA) method was performed to determine the validity of the model. Experimental results reveal that the inCVE model matches well with the pseudo-plastic fluids. Compared with the Ostwald-de Waele power law model and Cross model, it is effective and robust, and exhibits a three-stage rheological characteristic. Moreover, it characterizes the stress yield, activation energy, temperature dependence and viscoelastic response of polymers.},

	abstract = {The structural properties of a linear polymer and its evolution in time have a strong bearing on its anisotropic stress response. The mean-square bond length and mean bond angle are the critical parameters that inﬂuence the time-varying stress developed in the polymer. The bond length distribution along the chain is uniform without any abrupt changes at the ends. Among the externally set parameters such as density, temperature, strain rate, and chain length, the density as well as the chain length of the polymer have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the stress. At high density values, changes in mean-square bond length dominates over changes in radius of gyration and end-to-end length. In other words, bond deformations dominate as opposed to changes in size and shape. Also, there is a large change in the mean-square bond length that is reﬂected as a jump in the stress. Beyond a particular value of the chain length, n = 50, called the entanglement length, stress-response is found to have distinctly diﬀerent behavior which we attribute to the entanglement eﬀects. Short chain polymers more or less behave like rigid molecules. There is no signiﬁcant change in their internal structure when loaded. Further, temperature and rate of loading have a very mild eﬀect on the stress. Besides these new results, we can now explain well known polymeric mechanical behavior under dynamic loading from the point of view of the evolution of the molecular dynamics and the derived structural properties. This could possibly lead to polymer synthesis with desired mechanical behavior.},

The Oldroyd-B and Phan-Thien–Tanner (PTT) constitutive equations were used to assess the effect of different rheological behaviour on the ﬂow patterns and solution stability. The calculation of the polymer stress contribution is carried out with both the standard technique and with the logconformation methodology. For all test cases, up to the critical conditions when both methods converge to a steady solution, the use of the log-conformation technique provides solutions with similar accuracy as the standard approach. In terms of stability the log-conformation formulation is found to be signiﬁcantly more robust, and solutions could be obtained at higher Deborah number ﬂows.},

Here, we compare the response of the simpliﬁed linear form of the Phan-Thien–Tanner model (“sPTT”) [Phan-Thien and Tanner, “A new constitutive equation derived from network theory,” J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 2, 353–365 (1977)] and the ﬁnitely extensible nonlinear elastic (“FENE”) dumbbell model that follows the Peterlin approximation (“FENE-P”) [Bird et al., “Polymer solution rheology based on a ﬁnitely extensible bead—Spring chain model,” J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 7, 213–235 (1980)]. We show that for steady homogeneous ﬂows such as steady simple shear ﬂow or pure extension, the response of both models is identical under precise conditions (e ¼ 1=L2). The similarity of the “spring” functions between the two models is shown to help understand this equivalence despite a different molecular origin of the two models. We then use a numerical approach to investigate the response of the two models when the ﬂow is “complex” in a number of different deﬁnitions: ﬁrst, when the applied deformation ﬁeld is homogeneous in space but transient in time (so-called “start-up” shear and planar extensional ﬂow), then, as an intermediate step, the start-up of the planar channel ﬂow; and ﬁnally, “complex” ﬂows (through a range of geometries), which, although being Eulerian steady, are unsteady in a Lagrangian sense. Although there can be signiﬁcant differences in transient conditions, especially if the extensibility parameter is small L2 {\textgreater} 100; e {\textless} 0:01, under the limit that the ﬂows remain Eulerian steady, we once again observe very close agreement between the FENE-P dumbbell and sPTT models in complex geometries.},

Zatloukal, “Frameinvariant formulation of novel generalized Newtonian ﬂuid constitutive equation for polymer melts,” Phys. Fluids 32(9), 091705 (2020)] has been modiﬁed to provide uniaxial extensional viscosity at a high strain rate limit corresponding to molecular expression for a fully extended Fraenkel chain reported in Ianniruberto et al. [“Melts of linear polymers in fast ﬂows,” Macromolecules 53(13), 5023–5033 (2020)]. It uses basic rheological and molecular parameters together with the ratio of monomeric friction coefﬁcients for equilibrium and fully aligned chains. The modiﬁed GNF model was successfully tested by using steady-state uniaxial extensional viscosity data for well-characterized entangled polymer melts and solutions [namely, linear isotactic polypropylenes, poly(n-butyl acrylate), polyisoprenes, and polystyrenes] covering a wide range of strain rates, including those, at which the chain stretch occurs. Only two ﬁtting parameters were sufﬁcient to describe all uniaxial extensional viscosity data, one related to the Rouse stretch time and the other controlling the extensional thinning and thickening behavior at medium and high strain rates. The model was compared to ﬁve different advanced viscoelastic constitutive equations, which are based on Doi–Edwards theory and include chain stretch along with a number of important additions. The ability of the proposed GNF model to represent steady uniaxial extensional viscosities under fast ﬂow conditions for entangled polymer ﬂuids has been shown to be superior to the predictions of selected advanced viscoelastic constitutive equations. It is believed that the modiﬁed GNF model can be used in the stable modeling of non-Newtonian polymer liquids, especially in very fast steady-state ﬂows where chain stretch begins to occur.},

In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the viscosity and density of methylcyclohexane, 1-methylnaphthalene, and their binary mixtures at 323 K and pressures of up to 500 MPa. The simulation results are in excellent agreement with previous experiments available up to 100 MPa for both pure compounds (200 MPa for 1-methylnaphthalene) and the binary mixtures. For 1-methylnaphthalene, the viscosity initially increases slower-than-exponential with pressure before it reaches an inflection point and then increases faster-than-exponential. The inflection point (300 MPa) occurs at a pressure slightly below the one at which 1methylnaphthalene is expected to enter the supercooled phase (400 MPa). For methylcyclohexane, the increase in viscosity with pressure is slower-than-exponential over the entire pressure range studied. The binary mixtures show intermediate pressure–viscosity responses between the two pure cases. The applicability of equations commonly used to describe the pressure dependence of viscosity, as well as the viscosity of binary mixtures, is evaluated against the computational predictions.},

The complicated external flow field, i.e., shear or extensional flow, results in a great challenge in understanding the FIC phenomenon from both general thermodynamics and detailed molecular level aspects. The current tutorial first describes the general phenomenon of FIC from the aspect of different morphologies and enhanced kinetics induced by the flow. Second, characterization methods for monitoring FIC are introduced. Here, the in situ synchrotron x-ray scattering and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation are selected as typical examples. Then, the theoretical descriptions of FIC are summarized from the aspects of molecular origin and thermodynamics. The coil–stretch transition theory and later developed stretched network theory are highlighted, where the former mainly accounts for polymer dilute solution and the latter for highly entangled cases. Also, multistep features for the formation of various intermediate states during flow-induced nucleation are depicted. Despite non-equilibrium nature, the FIC can still be treated by thermodynamics, especially under weak flow conditions. The classic entropy reduction model is introduced together with later modifications. In all, understanding the fundamental mechanism of FIC is crucial for optimizing external processing parameters and internal molecular characteristics, and useful to guide current or further applied techniques.},

For one thing, it is difficult to ensure stable convergence and reliable solutions via the viscoelastic constitutive equations at a relatively high Deborah number. From a revisitation of the generalized Newtonian fluids (GNFs), deriving the weighted viscosity is natural with the coexistence of shear and extensional flow; it is called the eXtended GNF (GNF-X) model. Herein, 3D contraction flow simulations incorporating the GNF-X weighted viscosity were significantly carried out over a wide range of Deborah numbers. Numerical results regarding changes in vortex sizes exhibit the same trend of experimental observations, while the predictive accuracy is enhanced for a quantitative comparison. More importantly, the vortex formation, in terms of the weighted viscosity and the extensional flow, is demonstrated with supporting evidence. © 2020 The Society of Rheology.},

The algorithm presented here achieves two major goals; a more accurate estimation of D as well as extracting information about the short time behavior. The algorithm ﬁts the MSD to a continuous piece-wise function and predicts all the coefﬁcients in the model including the breakpoints. The novelty of this approach lies in its ability to ﬁnd the breakpoints which separate different modes of motion. We tested our algorithm using numerical experiments, and our ﬁts described the data remarkably well. In addition, we applied our algorithm to extract D for water based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The results of our ﬁts are in good agreement with the experimentally reported values.},

	abstract = {For the successful development and application of lubricants, a full understanding of their complex nanoscale behavior under a wide range of external conditions is required, but this is difﬁcult to obtain experimentally. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations can be used to yield unique insights into the atomic-scale structure and friction of lubricants and additives; however, the accuracy of the results depend on the chosen force-ﬁeld. In this study, we demonstrate that the use of an accurate, all-atom force-ﬁeld is critical in order to; (i) accurately predict important properties of long-chain, linear molecules; and (ii) reproduce experimental friction behavior of multi-component tribological systems. In particular, we focus on n-hexadecane, an important model lubricant with a wide range of industrial applications. Moreover, simulating conditions common in tribological systems, i.e., high temperatures and pressures (HTHP), allows the limits of the selected force-ﬁelds to be tested. In the ﬁrst section, a large number of united-atom and all-atom force-ﬁelds are benchmarked in terms of their density and viscosity prediction accuracy of n-hexadecane using equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations at ambient and HTHP conditions. Whilst united-atom force-ﬁelds accurately reproduce experimental density, the viscosity is signiﬁcantly under-predicted compared to all-atom force-ﬁelds and experiments. Moreover, some all-tom force-ﬁelds yield elevated melting points, leading to signiﬁcant overestimation of both the density and viscosity. In the second section, the most accurate united-atom and all-atom force-ﬁeld are compared in conﬁned NEMD simulations which probe the structure and friction of stearic acid adsorbed on iron oxide and separated by a thin layer of n-hexadecane. The united-atom force-ﬁeld provides an accurate representation of the structure of the conﬁned stearic acid ﬁlm; however, friction coefﬁcients are consistently under-predicted and the friction-coverage and friction-velocity behavior deviates from that observed using all-atom force-ﬁelds and experimentally. This has important implications regarding force-ﬁeld selection for NEMD simulations of systems containing long-chain, linear molecules; speciﬁcally, it is recommended that accurate all-atom potentials, such as L-OPLS-AA, are employed.},

Our approach is based on the calculation of an “effective viscosity” which is then used as a reference viscosity for any underlying viscoelastic (or even visco-elasto-plastic) model. Here we use a Maxwell-model which best describes stress relaxation and is therefore likely most important for the formation of large meteorite impact basins. While common viscoelastic behavior during mantle convection or other slow geodynamic or geological processes is mostly controlled by diffusion and dislocation creep, we show that the Peierls mechanism dominates at the large strain rates that typically occur during meteorite impacts. Thus, the resulting visco-elasto-plastic rheology allows implementation of a more realistic mantle behavior in computer simulations, especially for those dealing with large meteorite impacts. The approach shown here opens the way to more faithful simulations of large impact basin formation, especially in elucidating the physics behind the formation of the external fault rings characteristic of large lunar basins.},

Thanks to the development of in situ time and spatial resolved techniques like rheology and synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering, substantial progress on the understanding of FIC has been achieved in past 20 years. In this Perspective, we ﬁrst discuss some recent modiﬁcations and improvements on early coarse-grained approaches like the coil−stretch transition model for shish formation and the entropic reduction model for the enhancement of nucleation rate. Then breaking out the two-phase model of classical nucleation theory, ﬂow-induced coil−helix transition, density ﬂuctuation or phase separation, and isotropic−nematic transition are considered as intermediate orders in FIC. Establishing ﬂow morphology and phase diagrams is essential for revealing the nonequilibrium nature of FIC, which will serve as structural roadmap for the processing of high performance polymer products.},

The force ﬁelds were evaluated based on crystal structures as well as intermolecular H-bonding and π-π interactions. An optimum force ﬁeld was then used to simulate the stress−strain behavior in the chain and transverse-to-chain directions. In the chain direction, PAP5 had higher ultimate stress and failure strain than PPTA; however, the stiﬀness of PAP5 was lower than that of PPTA at low strain (0−2\%), while the reverse was observed at high strain (last 5\% before failure). This contrast and the diﬀerences in the transverse direction properties were explained by the methylene segments of PAP5 that confer conformational freedom, enabling accommodation of low strain without stretching the covalent bonds. The simulation approach demonstrated here for two polymers with distinct chemistry but similar atomic interactions may be extended to other polyamides.},

In this study, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to examine the atomistic structure and friction properties of commercially relevant organic friction modiﬁer (OFM) monolayers adsorbed on iron oxide surfaces and lubricated by a thin, separating layer of hexadecane. Speciﬁcally, acid, amide, and glyceride OFMs, with saturated and Z-unsaturated hydrocarbon tail groups, are simulated at various surface coverages and sliding velocities. At low and medium coverage, the OFMs form liquidlike and amorphous monolayers, respectively, which are signiﬁcantly interdigitated with the hexadecane lubricant, resulting in relatively high friction coeﬃcients. At high coverage, solidlike monolayers are formed for all of the OFMs, which, during sliding, results in slip planes between well-deﬁned OFM and hexadecane layers, yielding a marked reduction in the friction coeﬃcient. When present at equal surface coverage, OFMs with saturated and Z-unsaturated tail groups are found to yield similar structure and friction behavior. OFMs with glyceride head groups yield signiﬁcantly lower friction coeﬃcients than amide and particularly carboxylic acid head groups. For all of the OFMs and coverages simulated, the friction coeﬃcient is found to increase linearly with the logarithm of sliding velocity; however, the gradient of this increase depends on the coverage. The structure and friction details obtained from these simulations agree well with experimental results and also shed light on the relative tribological performance of these OFMs through nanoscale structural variations. This has important implications in terms of the applicability of NEMD to aid the development of new formulations to control friction.},

	abstract = {From corrosion inhibition to lubrication, a detailed understanding of the interactions between surfactants and iron oxide surfaces is critical for a range of industrial applications. However, there is still limited understanding of this behavior at the atomic-level, which hinders the design of improved surfactant molecules. In this study, the adsorption of three surfactants which are commonly employed as lubricant additives (carboxylic acid, amide, monoglyceride) on a αFe2O3(0001) surface is studied with density functional theory. The nature and strength of the adsorption for the diﬀerent surfactants, as well as their propensity to deprotonate on the surface, is studied at a range of surface coverages. In agreement with the available experiments, strong chemisorption on α-Fe2O3(0001) is observed for all cases considered. Dissociation is energetically favorable for carboxylic acid and glyceride surfactants through the formation of a surface hydroxyl group, whereas this is not the case for amides. Glycerides form the most strongly adsorbed ﬁlms at both low and high surface coverage due to the presence of multiple functional groups, which can all act as binding sites. However, the large size of the glyceride headgroup also means that adsorption is stronger at low coverage, where the formation of multiple bonds with the surface is possible, than at high coverage. Conversely, carboxylic acid ﬁlms have similar stability at low and high coverage, where van der Waals forces between proximal tailgroups stabilize the adsorption structures. The results of this study provide atomic-level insights which help to explain friction results from previous macroscopic tribology experiments and classical molecular dynamics simulations. They also facilitate the molecular design of new surfactants to maximize the adsorption energy, surface coverage, and ultimately friction reduction on iron oxide surfaces.},

In the limit of the linear viscoelasticity of the ﬂuid, we could postulate a Newtonian response for the interfacial friction coeﬃcient, reﬂecting the local character of solid− liquid friction mechanisms.

We hypothesize that reversible physical cross-linking can be quantitatively introduced to synthetic hydrogels to accelerate stress relaxation and enhance network stiﬀness, while strategic placement of isolated labile linkages near crosslinking sites can predict hydrogel degradation, both of which are essential for creating adaptive cellular niches. To test these hypotheses, chondrocytes were encapsulated in hydrogels formed by biorthogonal covalent and noncovalent physical cross-linking of a pair of hydrophilic building blocks. The stiﬀer and more viscoelastic hydrogels with DBCO−DBCO physical cross-links facilitated proliferation and chondrogenic ECM deposition of encapsulated cells by dissipating stress imposed by expanding cell mass/ECM via dynamic disruption/reformation of physical cross-links. Degradation of labile linkages near covalent cross-linkers further facilitated cell proliferation and timed cell release while maintaining chondrogenic phenotype.

A steady-state rectilinear shear ﬂow is imposed by sliding explicit walls with permanently grafted chains in a planar Couette ﬂow geometry. As the channel average shear rate is increased, a rapid coil−stretch transition of the surface end-grafted chains is observed. The corresponding primitive path network properties are investigated, revealing a disentanglement between surface grafted and nongrafted chains during the coil−stretch transition. Changes in slip length and surface friction are also measured. Grafted chains develop a trumpet-like conformation at high shear rates, which correlates with an increased relative density of entanglements near the free ends, a phenomenon that has already been considered by scaling models. The same mechanisms leading to slip in the current system may remain relevant for polymer melts of much higher (and more experimentally relevant) molecular weights. Therefore, we use the simulation results to examine the predictions and assumptions of some existing theoretical models. The conclusions drawn from the simulation may be used in the future to further develop theoretical models for the surface rheology of polymer melts.},

We report on neutron reﬂectometry measurements of polymer brushes in entangled polymer solutions performed under controlled shear as well as coarse-grained computer simulations corresponding to these interfaces. Here we show a reversible and reproducible collapse of the brushes, increasing with the shear rate. Using two brushes of greatly diﬀerent chain lengths and grafting densities, we demonstrate that the dynamics responsible for the structural change of the brush are governed by the free chains in solution rather than the brush itself, within the range of parameters examined. The phenomenon of the brush collapse could ﬁnd applications in the tailoring of nanosensors and as a way to dynamically control surface friction and adhesion.},

Fluid slip at the interface with a solid boundary is modelled here as forced Brownian motion in a periodic potential landscape. The resulting model goes beyond simple transition-state-theory approaches and uses well-deﬁned atomistic parameters to capture the salient features of the slip process in both the linear and nonlinear forcing regimes, yielding excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulation results, as well as previous modelling results. An explicit expression for the Navier slip coefﬁcient in terms of molecular-level system parameters is derived.},

A wall slip model based on the competition between these two factors is introduced. A surface parameter accounts for the wall-ﬂuid interaction and commensurability, and is valid for both canonical and complex crystal lattices: this quantity is then linked to the shear stress transferred to the ﬂuid molecules. The lubricant internal cohesion under conﬁnement is described by a bulk viscosity term. Finally, a semi-analytical law for wall slip prediction including both the ﬂuid viscosity and the surface characterization parameter is proposed.},

For non-reactive polymers, bubble expansion is controlled by a combination of gas diffusion and ﬂuid rheology. In the diffusion limited case, the initial growth rate is slow due to small surface area, whereas at high diffusivity initial growth is rapid and resisted only by background solvent viscosity. In this high Deborah number (De) limit, we see a two stage expansion in which there is an initial rapid expansion up to the size at which the elastic stresses balance the pressure difference. Beyond this time, the bubble expansion is controlled by the relaxation of the polymer.},

A composite model involving both continuous and nanoscale effects allows a better understanding on dimple formation and offers a new basis toward friction prediction.

The governing equations are solved using the ﬁnite-difference method, and, a thorough analysis on the effect of the model parameters α and β is presented. The numerical results showed that in the creeping ﬂow limit (Re = 0), the development length for the velocity exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour. The development length increases with Wi. For low values of Wi, the highest value of the development length is obtained for α = β = 0.5; for high values of Wi, the highest value of the development length is obtained for α = β = 1.5.

The model was implemented using a particle-based software, explored and thoroughly validated with results from numerical experiments on three different ﬂow conditions. The model was able to successfully capture a large extent of viscoelastic responses to external forcing, ranging from pure viscous ﬂows to creep-dominated Bingham type of behaviour. It is concluded that, thanks to the modularity and tunable characteristics of the parameters involved, the proposed modelling approach can be a powerful simulation tool for modelling or mimicking the behaviour of viscoelastic substances.},

            We review recent neutron scattering work and related results from simulation and complementary techniques focusing on the microscopic dynamics of polymers under confinement. Confinement is either realized in model porous materials or in polymer nanocomposites (PNC). The dynamics of such confined polymers is affected on the local segmental level, the level of entanglements as well as on global levels: (i) at the segmental level the interaction with the surface is of key importance. At locally repulsive surfaces compared to the bulk the segmental dynamics is not altered. Attractive surfaces slow down the segmental dynamics in their neighborhood but do not give rise to dead, glassy layers. (ii) Confinement generally has little effect on the inter-chain entanglements: both for weakly as well as for marginally confined polymers the reptation tube size is not changed. Only for strongly confined polymers disentanglement takes place. Similarly, in PNC at higher NP loading disentanglement phenomena are observed; in addition, at very high loading a transition from polymer caused topological constraints to purely geometrical constraints is observed. (iii) On the more global scale NSE experiments revealed important information on the nature of the interphase between adsorbed layer and bulk polymer. (iv) Polymer grafts at NP mutually confine each other, an effect that is most pronounced for one component NP. (v) Global diffusion of entangled polymers both in weakly and strongly attractive PNC is governed by the ratio of bottle-neck to chain size that characterizes the ‘entropic barrier’ for global diffusion.},

              To reveal the effect of a striped superhydrophobic surface on frictional properties, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the frictional properties of Couette flow. In particular, the influence of load on flow properties was considered in this work. The results showed that regions of gas in the groove and a low density region near the superhydrophobic surface were formed. Under a certain load, convex menisci appeared on top of the groove and some fluid atoms were trapped in it. Compared with the smooth hydrophobic surface, the striped superhydrophobic surface showed a reduction in friction owing to reduced liquid–solid contact area. With increasing load, the number of fluid atoms trapped in the groove increased prominently, which increased the friction force of the striped superhydrophobic surface more quickly. There was a critical load (
              P
              crit
              ), such that the friction-reduction property of striped superhydrophobic surfaces appeared only when the load was smaller than it.

The long-time NP diffusivities are compared with predictions from the Stokes–Einstein relation (SER), mode-coupling theory (MCT), and a recent polymer coupling theory (PCT). Increasing deviations from the SER as the polymer chains become more rigid (

              p

            Understanding the molecular-scale behavior of fluids confined and sheared between solid surfaces is important for many applications, particularly tribology where this often governs the macroscopic frictional response. In this study, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the effects of fluid and surface properties on the spatially resolved temperature and flow profiles, as well as friction. The severe pressure and shear rate conditions studied are representative of the elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime. In agreement with tribology experiments, flexible lubricant molecules give low friction, which increases linearly with logarithmic shear rate, while bulky traction fluids show higher friction, but a weaker shear rate dependence. Compared to lubricants, traction fluids show more significant shear heating and stronger shear localization. Models developed for macroscopic systems can be used to describe both the spatially resolved temperature profile shape and the mean film temperature rise. The thermal conductivity of the fluids increases with pressure and is significantly higher for lubricants compared to traction fluids, in agreement with experimental results. In a subset of simulations, the efficiency of the thermostat in one of the surfaces is reduced to represent surfaces with lower thermal conductivity. For these unsymmetrical systems, the flow and the temperature profiles become strongly asymmetric and some thermal slip can occur at the solid–fluid interface, despite the absence of velocity slip. The larger temperature rises and steeper velocity gradients in these cases lead to large reductions in friction, particularly at high pressure and shear rate.},

              A detailed understanding of the behaviour of confined fluids is critical to a range of industrial applications, for example to control friction in engineering components. In this study, a combination of tribological experiments and confined nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations has been used to investigate the effect of base fluid molecular structure on nonequilibrium phase behaviour and friction. An extensive parameter study, including several lubricant and traction fluid molecules subjected to pressures (0.5–2.0 GPa) and strain rates (10

              −1
              ) typical of the elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime, reveals clear relationships between the friction and flow behaviour. Lubricants, which are flexible, broadly linear molecules, give low friction coefficients that increase with strain rate and pressure in both the experiments and the simulations. Conversely, traction fluids, which are based on inflexible cycloaliphatic groups, give high friction coefficients that only weakly depend on strain rate and pressure. The observed differences in friction behaviour can be rationalised through the stronger shear localisation which is observed for the traction fluids in the simulations. Higher pressures lead to more pronounced shear localisation, whilst increased strain rates lead to a widening of the sheared region. The methods utilised in this study have clarified the physical mechanisms of important confined fluid behaviour and show significant potential in both improving the prediction of elastohydrodynamic friction and developing new molecules to control it.},

          , 
            
              Through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied the effects of grafting density (
              Σ
              ) and grafted chain length (
              L
              g
              ) on the structural, mechanical and visco-elastic properties of end-grafted nanoparticles (NPs) filled polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). It is found that increasing the grafting density and grafted chain length both enhance the brush/matrix interface thickness and improve the dispersion of NPs, but there seems to exist an optimum grafting density, above which the end-grafted NPs tend to aggregate. The uniaxial stress–strain behavior of PNCs is also examined, showing that the tensile stress is more enhanced by increasing
              L
              g
              compared to increasing
              Σ
              . The tensile modulus as a function of the strain is fitted following our previous work (

We infer that the increased mechanical and reduced non-linear visco-elastic properties are correlated with the enhanced brush/matrix interface and therefore better dispersion of NPs and stronger physical cross-linking.

This review traces the development of acoustic metamaterials from the initial findings of mass density and bulk modulus frequency dispersions in locally resonant structures to the diverse functionalities afforded by the perspective of negative constitutive parameter values, and their implications for acoustic wave behaviors. We survey the more recent developments, which include compact phase manipulation structures, superabsorption, and actively controllable metamaterials as well as the new directions on acoustic wave transport in moving fluid, elastic, and mechanical metamaterials, graphene-inspired metamaterials, and structures whose characteristics are best delineated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Many of the novel acoustic metamaterial structures have transcended the original definition of metamaterials as arising from the collective manifestations of constituent resonating units, but they continue to extend wave manipulation functionalities beyond those found in nature.},

              Complex fluids containing micelles, proteins, polymers and inorganic nanoparticles are often processed and used in high shear environments that can lead to structural changes at the nanoscale. Here, capillary rheometry is combined with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to simultaneously measure the viscosity and nanostructure of model complex fluids at industrially-relevant high shear rates. Capillary RheoSANS (CRSANS) uses pressure-driven flow through a long, flexible, silica capillary to generate wall shear rates up to 10

              and measure pressure drops up to 500 bar. Sample volumes as small as 2 mL are required, which allow for measurement of supply-limited biological and deuterated materials. The device design, rheology and scattering methodologies, and broad sample capabilities are demonstrated by measuring a variety of model systems including silica nanoparticles, NIST monoclonal antibodies, and surfactant worm-like micelles. For a shear-thinning suspension of worm-like micelles, CRSANS measurements are in good agreement with traditional RheoSANS measurements. Collectively, these techniques provide insight into relationships between nanostructure and steady-shear viscosity over eight orders of magnitude in shear rate. Overall, CRSANS expands the capabilities of traditional RheoSANS instruments toward higher shear rates, enabling

A lack of paradigm is an indicator of immaturity of the ﬁeld itself; thus, the fundamental issue of polymer crystallization remains unsolved. This paper provides an understanding of the basic hypothesis, as well as relevant physical implications and consequences of each theory without too much bias. We try to present the essential aspects of the major theories, and intuitive physical arguments over rigorously mathematical calculations are highlighted. In addition, a detailed comparison of various theories will be made in a logical and self-contained fashion. Our personal view of the existing theories is presented as well, aiming to inspire further open discussions. We expect that new theories based on the framework of kinetics with direct consideration of long-range multi-body correlation will help solve the remaining problems in the field of polymer crystallization.},

The simulation cell consists of a lubricant film enclosed between two metal surfaces. The attractive potential of specific iron atoms on the surface was modified such that the lubricant molecule adsorb preferentially on these atoms. These particular iron atoms were arranged to reproduce a grain boundary surface nanostructure. It is found that below the critical normal stress, the strength of the interaction between Fe and the lubricant molecule has little effect on the friction coefficient. However, the behavior of the lubricant film on the metal surface is sensitive to the interaction strength. Large attraction forces increase the adherence of the lubricant film.},

Stress or strain level, commonly considered as a limit of LVE behavior, are interrelated time-dependent functions strongly inﬂuenced by action of external factors. The concept of energy threshold has an advantage of combining into one physical function the effects of both stress and strain in initiating nonlinear behavior. The value of the stored deviatoric energy is considered as a limit of LVE behavior and is a material characteristic. The experimental data on tension at various constant strain rates and tensile creep at various stresses, temperatures, and moisture conditions are considered. It is proved for some polymers that LVE limits in stress-strain representation fall on a common curve that is an energy curve independent of time. Decrease of the test rate or growth of temperature or moisture content appears only in a shift down along the energy curve to the lower limit stresses and higher limit strains.},

The proposed model is veriﬁed by predicting the measured Stribeck curve taken from literature and experiments conducted in this work. The simulation results highlight that the micro-EHL effect at the asperity scale is critical in building load-carrying capacity between parallel rough surfaces. Finally, the drawbacks of the proposed model are addressed and the directions of future research are pointed out.},

A smooth-particlebased evaluation method by the authors, applied here for the ﬁrst time to visualize the sliding interface between the two layers of boundary lubricant, allowed the deﬁnition and calculation of a dimensionless normalized sliding resistance area, which was then related to the Derjaguin oﬀset.

The structures of stearic acid and oleic acid ﬁlms under static and shear conditions, and at various surface coverages, are described in detail, and the eﬀects of unsaturation in the tail group are highlighted. At high surface coverage, the measured properties of stearic acid and oleic acid ﬁlms are seen to be very similar. At low and intermediate surface coverages, the presence of a double bond, as in oleic acid, is seen to give rise to less penetration of lubricant in to the surfactant ﬁlm and less layering of the lubricant near to the ﬁlm. The kinetic friction coeﬃcient is measured as a function of shear rate within the hydrodynamic (high shear rate) lubrication regime. Lubricant penetration and layering are observed to be correlated with friction coeﬃcient. The friction coeﬃcient with oleic acid depends only weakly on surface coverage, while stearic acid admits more lubricant penetration, and its friction coeﬃcient increases signiﬁcantly with decreasing surface coverage. Connections between ﬁlm structure and friction are discussed.},

It is demonstrated that the linear extrapolation of pressure values toward the die exit, which is a key step in the application of the exit pressure method, is affordable to determine N1 values despite that these extrapolated exit pressure values are characterized by a relative deviation of 25-40\%. The validity of the exit pressure method is further supported by an excellent match with rheological data from the Laun rule (exponent close to 0.7) and a representative simulation of extrudate swelling data in the width and height direction, considering tuned parameters for the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) constitutive model. Also the absence of significant viscous heating effect near the die exit is highlighted based on numerical analysis.},

The key process of ﬂow-induced nucleation occurs on a very rapid timescale and on a highly localised lengthscale and so is extremely diﬃcult to observe directly in experiments. However, recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations mean that ﬂowinduced nucleation can be simulated at an achievable computational cost. Such studies oﬀer unrivalled time and lengthscale resolution of the nucleation process. Nevertheless, the computational cost of molecular dynamics places considerable constraints on the range of molecular weights, temperature and polydispersity that can be studied. In this review I will discuss recent progress, describe how future work might resolve or work around the constraints of molecular simulation and examine how multiscale modelling could translate molecular insight into improved polymer processing.},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing debate concerning the best rheological model for liquid flows in elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL). Due to the small contact area and high relative velocities of bounding solids, the lubricant experiences pressures in excess of 500 MPa and strain rates that are typically 105−107 s−1 . The high pressures lead to a dramatic rise in Newtonian viscosity N and the high rates lead to large shear stresses and pronounced shear thinning. This paper presents detailed simulations of a model EHL fluid, squalane, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods to extract the scaling of its viscosity with shear rate (1  05−1010 s−1 ) over a wide range of pressure P (0.1 MPa to 1.2 GPa), and temperature T (1  50−373 K). Simulation results are consistent with a broad range of equilibrium and nonequilibrium experiments. At high T and low P, where N is low, the response can be fit to a power law, as in the common Carreau model. Shear thinning becomes steeper as N increases, and for ��N ≳ 1 Pa s, shear thinning is consistent with the thermally activated flow assumed by another common model, Eyring theory. Simulations for a bi-disperse Lennard–Jones (LJ) system show that the transition from Carreau to Eyring is generic. For both squalane and the LJ system, the viscosity decreases by only about a decade in the Carreau regime, but may fall by many orders of magnitude in the Eyring regime. Shear thinning is often assumed to reflect changing molecular alignment, but the alignment of squalane molecules saturates after the viscosity has dropped by only about a factor of three. In contrast, thermal activation describes shear thinning by six or more decades in viscosity. Changes in the diagonal elements of the stress tensor with rate and shear stress are also studied.},

	abstract = {The large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) and steady shear behavior of star-shaped SSBR/silica 60 phr (21 vol\%) compounds with various filler surface areas was measured and simulated. An SBR gum and SBR compounds containing four different silicas with surface areas of 55, 135, 160, and 195 m2/g were utilized. Rheological behavior indicated clear correlation with surface area. LAOS tests showed an increase in dynamic moduli, shear stress, and higher order harmonic contributions with surface area. Elastic and viscous Lissajous figures showed significant distortion at intermediate and higher strain amplitudes. Additionally, ratios of third and fifth order stress harmonics to the first stress harmonic (I3/1 and I5/1, respectively) showed a ''bump'' at intermediate strain amplitudes for the three highest surface area compounds. With regards to steady shear, all materials showed strong shear thinning behavior, and an increase in shear viscosity with surface area. The Cox-Merz rule was shown to be valid for the SBR gum but not for the filled compounds. However, the complex viscosity as a function of shear rate amplitude at various frequencies at high strain amplitudes and the steady shear viscosity as a function of shear rate coincided. This correlation, referred to as the Philippoff approach, has important ramifications for the rubber industry, providing quick data for predicting processing behavior. The Simhambhatla-Leonov model was successfully employed to simulate rheological behavior for the SBR gum and the lowest surface area silica compound, but the model yielded mixed results for the higher surface area silica compounds.},

	abstract = {The fact that a polymer consists of a number of chains of different lengths, each in turn consisting of a series of monomer units, means that the motion of one part of the polymer chain will profoundly affect the motion of other parts. Hence, for a given polymer, a description of microscopic processes occurring under a given flow field depends on hypotheses regarding the molecular structure and mechanisms of flow in the polymer. Today, it is well-known, gained from practical experience, that the molecular weight, the molecular weight distribution, and the degree of long-chain branching influence the rheological properties of polymeric liquids. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between molecular parameters and rheological properties is very important from the standpoints of both polymer synthesis and polymer processing. However, the theoretical development of this aspect of the problem is far from complete, although some important progress has been made. In the preceding chapter, we discussed the viscoelastic behavior of polymeric liquids from the phenomenological point of view, without associating the significance of theoretical predictions to molecular origin(s). Specifically, we have seen that the rheological equations of state contain parameters that vary from polymer to polymer. Since it has amply been demonstrated by experiment that the extent of a particular viscoelastic behavior is greatly influenced by the molecular parameters, such as molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and the degree of long-chain branching, predictions of any viscoelastic behavior of polymers on the basis of phenomenological theory is of very limited use to either control the quality of polymers produced or improve the performance of polymers, unless the parameters appearing in various continuum constitutive equations are related to molecular parameters.},

Statistical and dynamic properties of several unentangled polymer melts are also revealed for comparison. It is obviously that the numerical difference is small when relaxation times defined by the ratio of maximum mean-square end-to-end distance of several polymers as a function of corresponding mean-square radius of gyration, and data for different architectures collapse onto a universal curve in unentangled regime. The relaxation times for several polymer exhibits weak dependence on architecture. However, the special relationship cannot be found through the relaxation times defined by the position of the intersection of g2 and g3, end-to-end correlation function and mean-square radius of gyration, with stronger architecture dependence. The correctness of the relationship is also reflected by mean-square monomer displacement. The result provides a new understanding of the correlation between relaxation time and polymer size.},

The solvent velocity field is observed to penetrate only a short distance into the brush consistent with predictions based on self-consistent field theory. The deformation of the brush is small except when the shear rate -j is very large. In this limit, while some of the polymer chains are stretched in the direction of flow, the brush height actually decreases slightly, in contrast to several theoretical predictions. When two surfaces bearing end-grafted chains are brought into contact, the normal force increases rapidly with decreasing plate separation, while the shear force is significantly smaller. For low relative velocity v, of the two walls, the surfaces slide pass each other with almost no change in the chain's radius of gyration or the amount of interpenetration, while for very large v,,, there is significant stretching and some disentanglement of the chains. The results are in qualitatively good agreement with recent experiments using the surface force apparatus.},

However, the relationship between EIT and drag-reduced turbulence is not currently well-understood, and it is important to elucidate the mechanism of the transition to EIT. The instability of viscoelastic ﬂuids has been studied in a canonical wall-bounded shear ﬂow to investigate the transition process of EIT. In this study, we numerically deduced that an instability occurs in the linearly stable viscoelastic plane Couette ﬂow for lower Reynolds numbers, at which a non-linear unstable solution exists. Under instability, the ﬂow structure is elongated in the spanwise direction and regularly arranged in the streamwise direction, which is a characteristic structure of EIT. The regularity of the ﬂow structure depends on the Weissenberg number, which represents the strength of elasticity; the structure becomes disordered under high Weissenberg numbers. In the energy spectrum of velocity ﬂuctuations, a steep decay law of the structure’s scale towards a small scale is observed, and this can be recognized as a ubiquitous feature of EIT. The existence of instability in viscoelastic plane Couette ﬂow supports the idea that the transitional path toward EIT may be mediated by subcritical instability.},

In this study, the recovery behavior of Veriflex-E, an epoxy-based, thermosetting, thermally-triggered shape memory polymer (SMP) resin, is investigated in glassy (25 °C) and rubbery (130 °C) states, as a function of shape memory cycles, and as a means to evaluate its potential as a resin for a shape memory composite. At 25 °C, Veriflex-E exhibits a promising high elastic modulus and a positive, nonlinear strain rate sensitivity in monotonic loading. At 130 °C, the strain rate sensitivity in monotonic loading decreases. Stress relaxation after storage in the deformed temporary state and subsequent shape recovery is of particular interest, a challenge to measure, and has not been widely reported for SMPs. The current experimental program measures the influence of strain rate changes in the 10−4–10−2 s−1 range on the stress relaxation response of the material, as well as on the strain recovery behavior at both 25 °C and 130 °C. As expected, the post-relaxation strain is larger with faster loading. Unexpectedly, the total strain recovered after shape memory cycling is more similar to the low temperature deformation. Overall, the results suggest that, while being influenced by both the loading rate and the test temperature, Veriflex-E is a promising candidate for a shape memory composite which could enable adaptive structures.},

	abstract = {Structural superlubricity (SSL), a state of ultra-low friction between two solid contacts, is a fascinating phenomenon in modern tribology. With extensive molecular dynamics simulations, for systems showing SSL, here we discover two different dependences between friction and normal load by varying the size of the loading area. The essence behind the observations stems from the coupling between the normal load and the edge effect of SSL systems. Keeping normal load constant, we ﬁnd that by reducing the loading area, the friction can be reduced by more than 65\% compared to the large loading area cases. Based on the discoveries, a theoretical model is proposed to describe the correlation between the size of the loading area and friction. Our results reveal the importance of loading conditions in the friction of systems showing SSL, and provide an effective way to reduce and control friction.},

This is mostly because the pressure and shear rate conditions inside EHL contacts are particularly severe, which complicates experimental design. Over the last decade, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has played an increasingly significant role in our fundamental understanding of molecular behaviour under EHL conditions. In recent years, MD simulation has shown quantitative agreement with friction and viscosity results obtained experimentally, meaning that they can, either in isolation or through the use of multiscale coupling methods, begin to be used to test and inform macroscale models for EHL problems. This is particularly useful under conditions that are relevant inside machine components, but are difficult to obtain experimentally without uncontrollable shear heating.},

In various systems, ranging from solvation free energies to protein conformational transition rates, we showcase how the proposed simulation box size effect disappears with increased sampling.

	abstract = {Commercially available grades of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) were printed in different shapes using an additive manufacturing (AM) printer based on material extrusion (ME). It is known that the quality of a 3D printed sample is closely connected to the rheological properties of the polymer matrix. However, some printing parameters, such as the feed rate and the print speed, might not be determined only by equipment design as usually reported in the literature. Instead, the thermal and rheological properties of the polymers should be carefully considered. The focus of many studies has relied on optimizing the specific properties of an ME printer through the adjustment of the printing parameters. Still, few researchers have shown how the rheological behaviour of a material can affect its final properties. Therefore, this paper would like to answer satisfactorily some recurring questions with clear practical importance, which is related to the fact that some materials have better print quality than others do and about the feasible margins for increasing the print speed according to the characteristics of a polymeric material. Thus, in this work, rheological characterization of the resins was conducted and it was detected that the processing condition for a specific thermoplastic is highly dependent on its rheological behaviour. A method of mass flow conservation was presented for determination and consideration of the rheological characteristics when selecting an appropriate process parameter for the additive manufacturing system. It was found that even a small recovery strain resulting from the characteristic morphology of ABS could provide lower layers’ roughness and good printing quality to the 3D printed samples. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the importance of the rheological properties of common thermoplastics used in extrusion-based process on the controlling of a 3D printer and on the final printing quality.},

However, the prediction accuracy of any CFD simulation depends upon the set boundary conditions and upon the applied rheological constitutive equation. In the present study the viscoelastic nature of an unﬁlled gum acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) is considered by applying the integral and time-dependent Kaye–Bernstein–Kearsley–Zapas (K-BKZ) rheological model. First, exhaustive testing is carried out in the linear viscoelastic (LVE) and non-LVE deformation range including small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) as well as high pressure capillary rheometer (HPCR) tests. Next, three abrupt capillary dies and one tapered oriﬁce die are modeled in Ansys POLYFLOW. The pressure prediction accuracy of the K-BKZ/Wagner model was found to be excellent and insensitive to the applied normal force in SAOS testing as well as to the relation of ﬁrst and second normal stress differences, provided that damping parameters are ﬁtted to steady-state rheological data. Moreover, the crucial importance of viscoelastic modeling is proven for rubber materials, as two generalized Newtonian ﬂuid (GNF) ﬂow models severely underestimate measured pressure data, especially in contraction ﬂow-dominated geometries.},

We analyzed the interfacial slip, characteristic molecular mechanisms, and deformed chain conformations in response to the applied ﬂow for linear, ring, short-chain branched (SCB) linear, and SCB ring polyethylene melts. The ring topology generally enlarges the interfacial chain dimension along the neutral direction, enhancing the dynamic friction of interfacial chains moving against the wall in the ﬂow direction. This leads to a relatively smaller degree of slip (ds) for the ring-shaped polymers compared with their linear analogues. Furthermore, short-chain branching generally resulted in more compact and less deformed chain structures via the intrinsically fast random motions of the short branches. The short branches tend to be oriented more perpendicular (i.e., aligned in the neutral direction) than parallel to the backbone, which is mostly aligned in the ﬂow direction, thereby enhancing the dynamic wall friction of the moving interfacial chains toward the ﬂow direction. These features aﬀord a relatively lower ds and less variation in ds in the weak-to-intermediate ﬂow regimes. Accordingly, the interfacial SCB ring system displayed the lowest ds among the studied polymer systems throughout these regimes owing to the synergetic eﬀects of ring geometry and short-chain branching. On the contrary, the structural disturbance exerted by the highly mobile short branches promotes the detachment of interfacial chains from the wall at strong ﬂow ﬁelds, which results in steeper increasing behavior of the interfacial slip for the SCB polymers in the strong ﬂow regime compared to the pure linear and ring polymers.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, built around chain-connectivity-altering moves and a wall-displacement algorithm, allow us to simulate freely-jointed chains of tangent hard spheres of uniform size under extreme conﬁnement. The latter is realized through the presence of two impenetrable, ﬂat, and parallel plates. Extreme conditions correspond to the case where the distance between the plates approaches the monomer size. An analysis of the local structure, based on the characteristic crystallographic element (CCE) norm, detects crystal nucleation and growth at packing densities well below the ones observed in bulk analogs. In a second step, we map the conﬁned polymer chains into self-avoiding random walks (SAWs) on restricted lattices. We study all realizations of the cubic crystal system: simple, body centered, and face centered cubic crystals. For a given chain size (SAW length), lattice type, origin of SAW, and level of conﬁnement, we enumerate all possible SAWs (equivalently all chain conformations) and calculate the size distribution. Results for intermediate SAW lengths are used to predict the behavior of long, fully entangled chains through growth formulas. The SAW analysis will allow us to determine the corresponding conﬁgurational entropy, as it is the driving force for the observed phase transition and the determining factor for the thermodynamic stability of the corresponding crystal morphologies.},

According to recent simulation data, the ratio of the tube step length to the tube diameter was found to be about 2 for different entangled polymer systems. Since measuring the tube diameter does not require     g 1     data to reach the slope-    1 4     regime, this could be the best way to find the entanglement length from microscopic consideration.},

	abstract = {We present results for the steady state shear rheology of non-concatenated, unentangled and marginally entangled ring poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) melts from detailed, atomistic nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations, and compare them to the behavior of the corresponding linear melts. The applied ﬂow ﬁeld spans a wide range of shear rates, from the linear (Newtonian) to the highly non-linear (described by a power law) regime. For all melts studied, rings are found to exhibit shear thinning but to a lesser degree compared to linear counterparts, mostly due to their reduced deformability and stronger resistance to alignment in the direction of ﬂow. These features are attributed to the more compact structure of ring molecules compared to linear chains; the latter are capable of adopting wider and more open conformations even under shear due to the freedom provided by the free ends. Similar to linear melts, rings also exhibit a ﬁrst and a second normal stress coeﬃcient; the latter is negative. The ratio of the magnitude of the two coeﬃcients remains practically constant with shear rate and is systematically higher than the corresponding one for linear melts. Emphasis was also given to the statistics of terminal (re-orientational) relaxation times which we computed by analyzing all chains in the simulated systems one by one; it was demonstrated that long time dynamics are strongly heterogeneous both for rings and (especially) linears. Repeating the analysis under ﬂow conditions, and as expected, we found that the applied ﬂow ﬁeld signiﬁcantly suppresses dynamic heterogeneity, especially for high shear rates well beyond the Newtonian plateau. Finally, a detailed geometrical analysis revealed that the average population of ring–ring threading events in the longest melt studied here (the PEO-5k ring) remains practically unaﬀected by the imposed ﬂow rate even at strong shear rates, except for multi-threadings which disappear. To further analyze this peculiar and rather unexpected eﬀect, we computed the corresponding survival times and penetration lengths, and found that the overwhelming majority of threadings under shear are extremely weak constraints, as they are characterized by very small penetration lengths, thus also by short survival times. They are expected therefore to play only a minor (if any) role on chain dynamics.},

In polymer melts, the developed united atom and multibead spring models predict an exponent of the molecular weight dependence to the polymer diffusion very similar to experiments and the tube reptation model. There are rather unexplored parameters that can inﬂuence polymer diffusion such as polymer semiﬂexibility or polydispersity, leading to a different exponent. Models with soft potentials or slip-springs can estimate accurately the tube model predictions in polymer melts enabling us to reach larger length scales and simulate well entangled polymers. However, in polymer nanocomposites, reptational polymer diffusion is more complicated due to nanoparticle ﬁllers size, loading, geometry and polymer-nanoparticle interactions.},

The ensuing morphological changes are analyzed at different length scales by in-situ polarized optical microscopy and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Upon inception of shear, the polydomain texture is initially stretched, at larger strain break up processes become increasingly important, and eventually a steady state texture is obtained. The shear stress response showed good coherence between optical and rheo-X-ray data. The evolution of the orientation parameter coincides with the evolution of the texture: the order parameter increases as the texture stretches, drops slightly in the break up regime, and reaches a constant value in the plateau regime. The relaxation of the shear stress and the polydomain texture showed two distinct processes with different timescales: The ﬁrst is fast contraction of the stretched domain texture; the second is the slow coalescence of the polydomain texture. The timescale of the orientation parameter’s relaxation matched with that of the slow coalescence process. All processes were found to scale with shear rate in the tested regime. These observations can have far reaching implications for the processing of liquid crystal polymers as they indicate that increased shear rates during processing can correspond to an increased relaxation rate of the orientation parameter and, therefore, a decrease in anisotropy and material properties after cooling.},

	abstract = {Polymer crystallization in manufacturing is a process where quiescent crystallization and ﬂow-induced crystallization coexists, and heat/mass transfer on a macroscopic level interacts with crystal morphology evolution on a microscopic level. Previous numerical studies on polymer crystallization are mostly concentrated at a single scale; they only calculate macroscale parameters, e.g., temperature and relative crystallinity, or they only predict microstructure details, e.g., crystal morphology and mean size of crystals. The multi-scale numerical works that overcome these disadvantages are unfortunately based on quiescent crystallization, in which ﬂow effects are neglected. The objective of this work is to build up a macro-micro model and a macro-micro algorithm to consider both the thermal and ﬂow effects on the crystallization. Our macro-micro model couples two parts: mass and heat transfer of polymeric ﬂow at the macroscopic level, and nucleation and growth of spherulites and shish-kebabs at the microscopic level. Our macro-micro algorithm is a hybrid ﬁnite volume/Monte Carlo method, in which the ﬁnite volume method is used at the macroscopic level to calculate the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds, while the Monte Carlo method is used at the microscopic level to capture the development of spherulites and shish-kebabs. The macro-micro model and the macro-micro algorithm are applied to simulate polymer crystallization in Couette ﬂow. The effects of shear rate, shear time, and wall temperature on the crystal morphology and crystallization kinetics are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The universal features of polymer dynamics are specifically represented by laws for (anomalous) segment diffusion and chain relaxation modes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based techniques provide direct access to these phenomena. This in particular refers to NMR relaxation and diffusion studies. Methods suitable for this purpose are described in detail. Three basic classes of polymer dynamics models, namely the Rouse model, the tube/reptation model, and the renormalized Rouse models are outlined and discussed with respect to predictions for NMR measurands. A wealth of experimental NMR data are reviewed and compared with predictions of the model theories. It is shown that characteristic features of all three types of models can be verified in great detail provided that the model premisses are suitably mimicked in the experiments. Rouse dynamics is shown to be relevant for polymer melts with molecular weights below the critical value and for solutions of diminished entanglement effect. Features specific for the renormalized Rouse model reveal themselves in the form of high- and low-mode-number limits of the spin–lattice relaxation dispersion. These results are considered to mirror the analytical structure of the Generalized Langevin Equation. Finally, anomalous-diffusion and relaxation laws characteristic for the tube/reptation model can be perfectly reproduced in experiment if the polymer chains are confined in a nanoporous, solid matrix whereas bulk melts are not in accord with these predictions. The dynamics of chains confined in artificial tubes can be treated analytically assuming a harmonic radial potential for the polymer/wall interaction. These results derived for a real tube closely render the characteristic features of the original Doi/Edwards model predicted for a fictitious tube.},

We compare model predictions with the steady-state, stress growth, and stress relaxation data after startup shear flows. In characterising the linear-viscoelastic relaxation behaviour, we consider that in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature, Rouse modes and glassy modes are inseparable, and we model the terminal regime of PS13K by effective Rouse modes. Excellent agreement is achieved between model predictions and shear viscosity data, and good agreement with first normal stress coefficient data. In particular, the shear viscosity data of PS13K as well as of two polystyrene melts with M = 10.5 kDa and M = 9.8 kDa investigated by Stratton Macromolecules 5 (3): 304–310, (1972) agree quantitatively with the universal mastercurve predicted by Narimissa and Wagner for unentangled melts, and approach a scaling of Wi−1/2at sufficiently high Weissenberg numbers Wi. Some deviations between model predictions and data are seen for stress growth and stress relaxation of shear stress and first normal stress difference, which may be attributed to limitations of the experimental data, and may also indicate limitations of the model due to the complex interactions of Rouse modes and glassy modes in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature.},

	abstract = {The study of viscous ﬂuid ﬂow coupled with rigid or deformable solids has many applications in biological and engineering problems, e.g., blood cell transport, drug delivery, and particulate ﬂow. We developed a partitioned approach to solve this coupled Multiphysics problem. The ﬂuid motion was solved by Palabos (Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Solver), while the solid displacement and deformation was simulated by LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). The coupling was achieved through the immersed boundary method (IBM). The code modeled both rigid and deformable solids exposed to ﬂow. The code was validated with the Jeﬀery orbits of an ellipsoid particle in shear ﬂow, red blood cell stretching test, and eﬀective blood viscosity ﬂowing in tubes. It demonstrated essentially linear scaling from 512 to 8192 cores for both strong and weak scaling cases. The computing time for the coupling increased with the solid fraction. An example of the ﬂuid-solid coupling was given for ﬂexible ﬁlaments (drug carriers) transport in a ﬂowing blood cell suspensions, highlighting the advantages and capabilities of the developed code.},

Simulation setups for one and the same process are not unique and diﬀerences in the setups of such simulations are discussed with respect to properties in focus, results and general goals. Valuable information need not be obtained only from numerical values of some physical quantities but also from qualitative relations between various quantities; understanding of the process at the molecular level may be obtained even only from a visualisation of the system evolution. A novel version of the volume-control molecular dynamics simulation driven by the pressure gradient is proposed and tested.},

Based on the nucleation barrier under flow, we analyze at which condition precursor may occur and how flow affects the competition among different crystal forms such as orthorhombic and hexagonal phases of polyethylene. According to the uFIC model, the different crystal morphologies and structures in the flow-temperature space have been clarified, which give a good agreement with experiments of FIC.},

	abstract = {In conventional injection molding, the molten polymer in the ﬁlling stage is generally assumed to be incompressible. However, this assumption may not be valid in micro-injection molding, since high injection pressure is normally required to avoid short shots. This paper presents both numerical and experimental investigations on the effects of polymer melt compressibility on mold ﬁlling into a micro-thickness impression. The study was conducted on six different part thicknesses ranging from 920 to 370 μm. A high-ﬂow COC TOPAS 5013L-10 polymer was chosen as the TOPAS family has recently attracted signiﬁcant interest for its use in microﬂuidic applications. A combined ﬁnite element/ ﬁnite difference/ control volume approach was adopted to simulate the compressible ﬂow. The shear viscosity of a polymer melt was characterized by the Cross-WLF model, while the melt compressibility was modeled with a double-domain Tait equation. The results obtained indicated that the compressibility of the polymer melt has signiﬁcant effects on impression pressure and density distribution in the fully ﬁlled part with thickness smaller than 620 μm and that the effects become more pronounced with a decrease in part thickness.},

In this work, magnetic PEO/iron oxide nanocomposite hydrogels were synthesized using the one-step γ-irradiation method starting from poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and iron(III) precursor alkaline aqueous suspensions followed by simultaneous crosslinking of PEO chains and reduction of Fe(III) precursor. γ-irradiation dose and concentrations of Fe3+, 2-propanol and PEO in the initial suspensions were varied and optimized. With 2-propanol and at high doses magnetic gels with embedded magnetite nanoparticles were obtained, as conﬁrmed by XRD, SEM and Mössbauer spectrometry. The quantitative determination of γ-irradiation generated Fe2+ was performed using the 1,10-phenanthroline method. The maximal Fe2+ molar fraction of 0.55 was achieved at 300 kGy, pH = 12 and initial 5\% of Fe3+. The DSC and rheological measurements conﬁrmed the formation of a well-structured network. The thermal and rheological properties of gels depended on the dose, PEO concentration and initial Fe3+ content (amount of nanoparticles synthesized inside gels). More amorphous and stronger gels were formed at higher dose and higher nanoparticle content. The properties of synthesized gels were determined by the presence of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, which acted as reinforcing agents and additional crosslinkers of PEO chains thus facilitating the one-step gel formation.},

	abstract = {A novel nano-to-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) multiscale approach, developed to integrate molecular-scale phenomena into macroscopic lubrication models based on the continuum hypothesis, is applied to a lubricated contact problem with a ceramic–steel interface and a nanometric film thickness. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to quantify wall slip occurring under severe confinement. Its dependence on the sliding velocity, film thickness, pressure, and different wall materials is described through representative analytical laws. These are then coupled to a modified Reynolds equation, where a no-slip condition applies to the ceramic surface and slip occurring on the steel wall is described through a Navier-type boundary condition. The results of this nano-to-EHL approach can contradict the well-established lubrication theory for thin films. In fact, slip can occur over the whole contact length, leading to a significant modification of the lubricant flow and consequently of the film thickness. If both walls move at the same velocity, the flow is reduced at the contact inlet and the film thickness decreases. If the nonslipping wall entrains the fluid, this one is accelerated resulting in a larger mass flow; nevertheless, the surface separation is reduced as the lubricant flows even faster in the contact center. The opposite effect occurs if the slipping surface entrains the fluid, causing a lower mass flow but higher film thickness. Finally, friction is generally smaller compared to the classical no-slip case and becomes independent of the sliding velocity as total slip is approached.},

In this study, to examine the microscopic behavior of a rough asperity contact corresponding to a bulk contact on the macroscopic scale, a loop-type meso–macro coupled analysis scheme is proposed. A mesoscale numerical model and a macroscopic friction model are required for the proposed multi-scale analysis. A friction model was adopted based on the multipoint contact model for the mesoscale model, and the pressure- and state-dependent elastoplastic analogy friction model was used for the macroscale model. In the proposed meso–macro coupled analysis, the parameter set for the elastoplastic analogy friction model was ﬁrst identiﬁed via a numerical friction test using the mesoscale multipoint contact model assuming various conditions. Then, a macroscale ﬁnite element analysis incorporating the elastoplastic analogy friction model was performed for the macroscopic analysis of contact between a rough rubber hemisphere and a smooth plate. Here, the information from the mesoscale rough surfaces were reﬂected in the macroscale ﬁnite element analysis. Finally, a mesoscale localization analysis was performed in which the macroscopic histories of several typical locations were obtained by ﬁnite element analysis and used as boundary conditions for the mesoscale model. It is suggested that the microscopic sliding process of rough surfaces represented by the ﬁnite element analysis can be examined using the proposed method.},

For the pipe and the channel it is shown that the results with the nonlinear Navier boundary condition may be obtained from a pseudo linear Navier boundary condition but with a modiﬁed slip length. For the annulus, two sets of physically acceptable solutions are obtained corresponding to the chosen sign of the normal derivative of the velocity at each solid boundary. Closer examination reveals that although the generalized Navier boundary condition is highly nonlinear, in terms of the assumed form of solution the integration constants obtained are still unique for the three simple pressure-driven ﬂows presented here, provided that care is taken in its application and noting that the multiplicity of solutions obtained for the annulus arise as a consequence of adopting diﬀerent signs for the normal derivatives of velocity at the boundaries.},

	abstract = {The viscoelastic behavior of entangled solutions of semiflexible chains is discussed. After identifying the different possible regimes of concentration and chain length in such a solution, attention is focused on a “tightly-entangled” regime in which the polymer is confined to a tube of diameter less than its persistence length. A tube model analogous to the Doi-Edwards model is introduced to describe this regime. A general expression for the stress tensor of a solution of wormlike chains is derived, which may be applied to any concentration regime, and three intramolecular stress contributions are identified: a curvature contribution arising from forces that oppose transverse deformation or rotation of chain segments, a tension contribution arising from tangential forces that resist stretching or compression of the chain, and an orientational contribution that reduces in the appropriate limit to the Brownian stress of a rigid-rod solution. Intermolecular stress contributions are also calculated. A qualitative discussion is given of the high-frequency viscoelastic response of any solution of wormlike chains, which is dominated by the tension contribution and exhibits a characteristic power law dependence on frequency.},

The nanocomposite had an approximate content of 0.52 wt \% MWNT. Rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties were investigated for both neat HDPE and nanocomposite. The nanocomposite, when compared to the neat polymer, exhibits lower values of viscosity, shear modulus and shear stress in extrusion and a concurrent delay of the distortion regimes to higher shear stresses and rates. The nanocomposite presents also improved dimensional stability after processing, and lower values of the melt strength, draw ratio and viscosity in elongational flow. This behavior has been observed in composites in which an adsorption of a fraction (that with the highest molecular weight or relaxation time) of the polymer chains is considered. Furthermore, the enhancement in the crystallization kinetics, probed by rheometry and DSC, suggests that the carbon nanotubes act as nucleating agents for the polymeric chains. Additionally, the presence of adsorbed chains does not only influence the molten state but also induces interesting effects in the mechanical properties of the polymer. As a result, an increase of up to 100\% in elastic modulus was observed in the HDPE/MWNT nanocomposite without losing the ductility present in neat HDPE.},

	abstract = {It is known that polystyrene melts behave anomalously in fast elongational ﬂows insofar as the steady-state elongational viscosity keeps decreasing with increasing stretching rate ε̇, without showing the typical upturn at ε̇τR ≈ 1, with τR the Rouse time. The authors have recently suggested that such an anomalous behavior might be due to a decrease of the monomeric friction coeﬃcient brought about by alignment of the Kuhn segments of the polymer to the stretching direction. Here we perform a quantitative analysis of such a possibility by ﬁrst determining from existing stress−optical data how such a reduction should correlate to the order parameter of the Kuhn segments and then by performing nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations over a sequence of styrene oligomers. We have used NEMD not only to obtain diﬀusion coeﬃcients of those oligomers but also, for what seems to be the ﬁrst time, friction coeﬃcients. Indeed, it is well-known that the Einstein relationship linking friction to diﬀusion does not hold true far from equilibrium. The friction coeﬃcients so obtained correlate to the order parameter of the monomers in much the same way as in the polymeric case, and by increasing the length (or mass) of the oligomer, they appear to approach a similar characteristic curve.},

Although the amount of crystallinity initially increases with γ\_ , our simulations appear to be consistent with experimental observations of an upper limit γ\_ c, above which the effect is reversed, and show it is at the reciprocal of the stress relaxation time. We reveal the structural origins of this phenomenon and show the shear rate does not affect the crystallization rate in post shear crystallization of a model polymer with 162 monomers.},

Thus, the dynamical Kuhn length of the chain exceeds the static one, and the chain at high frequencies acts like a freely jointed chain of “bent rigid wires” in which each bent rigid wire is a “dynamical Kuhn length” containing many static Kuhn lengths connected together in a rigid random walk. We show that this model is consistent with anomalous high-frequency behavior of polystyrene solutions under shear observed by Schrag and co-workers1-3 and Amelar et al.4 and predicts that there is a minimum “spring” size corresponding roughly to exp[∆Ea/(3ν + 1)kBT] Kuhn steps that will behave elastically at high frequencies, where ∆Ea is the barrier to bond rotation, and ν ) 0.5-0.6 is the Flory exponent.},

	abstract = {Entanglement network is an important structural feature in concentrated polymer solutions and polymer melts, which has a great influence on the transient rheological behavior and molecular configuration evolution. However, the existing constitutive models have limitations in describing the influence of dynamic entanglement behavior on molecular chain motion, resulting in inaccurate descriptions of the transient rheological behavior. Thus, a molecular configuration evolution model for polymer solutions considering the dynamic entanglement effect is proposed by introducing an intermolecular force that changes with the orientation of the molecular chain in this work. The intermolecular force is introduced by considering the friction coefficient as anisotropic, and the orientation effect is considered by introducing an excluded volume dependent anisotropic diffusion. The proposed model can better describe the stress relaxation, stress growth, and dielectric anisotropy of polymer solutions compared with the anisotropy FENE model and FENE model. In addition, the influence of different model parameters on the transient and steady shear response of polymer solution is investigated, and the results show that the influence of volume loss on the friction anisotropy factor kσ increases as the solution concentration increases.},

While for low Keulegan–Carpenter number (small enough amplitude), the size of the outer flow is typically that of the object, here we show that at large enough forcing, the outer flow stretches along the direction of the vibration by up to 8 times, while the flow still keeps its axial symmetry. We quantify the elongation through PIV measurements under an unprecedented range of frequency and amplitude, so that the streaming Reynolds number reaches values much larger than unity. The absence of significant unsteady component of vorticity outside the viscous boundary layer—and the fact that the length of elongation scales well with the streaming Reynolds number—suggest that the stretching should be due to the convection of stationary vorticity by the streaming flow itself.},

	abstract = {The sliding contact of soft material surface due to a rigid indenter is different from metal and some other polymers. A stick-slip motion is more frequently obtained than a smooth motion. By modeling the soft material as low damping viscoelastic material, this study proposes an analytical model to identify the stick-slip behavior of sliding system. The sliding system is a fixed rigid indenter that slides against on a moving soft material surface. A stick-slip model is developed and the motion of the sliding system is assumed to be in a solely tangential direction. By implementing the simple coulomb friction law, an exact solution is presented in the case of no damping of the sliding system. Results show that the periodic displacement of the stick-slip model is strongly depending on the friction force, sliding velocity and material stiffness. Furthermore, the effect of a viscous damping and velocity-dependent friction on the behaviour of the sliding system are discussed.},

Comparison of calculated and measured values of primary normal stress difference has shown that the proposed equation describes quite well experimental data but the calculations are not stable. For this reason, the proposed equation along with other equations of this type known from the literature was transformed into shear stress-dependent form. It was shown that such transformation makes it possible to represent the normal stress-to-shear stress ratio (Weissenberg number) as a unique function of the local slope of the flow curve, which is simultaneously temperature invariant. Such representation was confirmed using experimental data for eight systems comprising linear polymers and various measurement temperatures. It was found that new equation in the shear stress-dependent form is numerically stable and provides excellent description of experimental data. The general structure of expressions, which may be used for description of the elasticity of polymer liquids based on the flow curve shape, was discussed from the point of view of dimensional analysis. Obtained results made it possible to modify other expressions known from the literature in such way that they also provide an excellent fit to experimental data.},

Recently, a generalised version of the PTT model, that uses the Mittag-Leﬄer function to compute a new function of the trace of the stress tensor, was proposed. This new model adds one or two additional ﬁtting parameters that allow for greater ﬁtting capability. In this paper, we propose two optimisation problems for estimating the model parameters when ﬁtting experimental data in shear (storage modulus, loss modulus, shear viscosity). We also propose a numerical sequential approach for solving one of these problems. The optimal values for the parameters produced by the optimisation approach allow the model to reproduce almost exactly the experimental data.},

As observed in experiments for many glass forming materials, metastable states in our simulation show a sharp increase in mean-square-displacement at certain temperatures TD. Dynamic heterogeneity is also observed at TD. Elastic properties are calculated from stress and strain relations obtained from the spontaneous ﬂuctuation of internal stress tensor and simulation cell parameters. Each investigated state shows distinctive dynamics while maintaining solid-like elastic properties. The elastic properties stay intact even above TD. It has been shown that the rigidity and mobility of glassy metastable states are compatible under dynamic heterogeneity.},

The inﬂuence of the surfactant type and coverage, as well as the applied shear rate and pressure, has been investigated. A measurable slip length is only observed for surfactant ﬁlms with a high surface coverage, which provide smooth interfaces between well-deﬁned surfactant and hexadecane layers. Slip commences above a critical shear rate, beyond which the slip length ﬁrst increases with increasing shear rate and then asymptotes toward a constant value. The maximum slip length increases signiﬁcantly with increasing pressure. Systems and conditions which show a larger slip length typically give a lower friction coeﬃcient. Generally, the friction coeﬃcient increases linearly with logarithmic shear rate; however, it shows a much stronger shear rate dependency at low pressure than at high pressure. Relating slip and friction, slip only occurs above a critical shear stress, after which the slip length ﬁrst increases linearly with increasing shear stress and then asymptotes. This behavior is well-described using previously proposed slip models. This study provides a more detailed understanding of the slip of alkanes on surfactant monolayers. It also suggests that high coverage surfactant ﬁlms can signiﬁcantly reduce friction by promoting slip, even when the surfaces are well-separated by a lubricant.},

            The earlier integration of validated Lennard–Jones (LJ) potentials for 8 fcc metals into materials and biomolecular force fields has advanced multiple research fields, for example, metal–electrolyte interfaces, recognition of biomolecules, colloidal assembly of metal nanostructures, alloys, and catalysis. Here we introduce 12-6 and 9-6 LJ parameters for classical all-atom simulations of 10 further fcc metals (Ac, Ca (α), Ce (γ), Es (β), Fe (γ), Ir, Rh, Sr (α), Th (α), Yb (β)) and stainless steel. The parameters reproduce lattice constants, surface energies, water interfacial energies, and interactions with (bio)organic molecules in 0.1 to 5\% agreement with experiment, as well as qualitative mechanical properties under standard conditions. Deviations are reduced up to a factor of one hundred in comparison to earlier Lennard–Jones parameters, embedded atom models, and density functional theory. We also explain a quantitative correlation between atomization energies from experiments and surface energies that supports parameter development. The models are computationally very efficient and applicable to an exponential space of alloys. Compatibility with a wide range of force fields such as the Interface force field (IFF), AMBER, CHARMM, COMPASS, CVFF, DREIDING, OPLS-AA, and PCFF enables reliable simulations of nanostructures up to millions of atoms and microsecond time scales. User-friendly model building and input generation are available in the CHARMM-GUI Nanomaterial Modeler. As a limitation, deviations in mechanical properties vary and are comparable to DFT methods. We discuss the incorporation of reactivity and features of the electronic structure to expand the range of applications and further increase the accuracy.},

              relies on understanding the flow behaviour of nanometrically-thin platelets suspended in liquids. Here we show, by combining non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and continuum simulations, that rigid nanoplatelets can attain a stable orientation for sufficiently strong flows. Such a stable orientation is in contradiction with the rotational motion predicted by classical colloidal hydrodynamics. This surprising effect is due to hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface and occurs when the slip length is larger than the platelet thickness; a slip length of a few nanometers may be sufficient to observe alignment. The predictions we developed by examining pure and surface-modified graphene is applicable to different solvent/2D material combinations. The emergence of a fixed orientation in a direction nearly parallel to the flow implies a slip-dependent change in several macroscopic transport properties, with potential impact on applications ranging from functional inks to nanocomposites.},

	abstract = {The manipulation of cells and particles suspended in viscoelastic ﬂuids in microchannels has drawn increasing attention, in part due to the ability for single-stream three-dimensional focusing in simple channel geometries. Improvement in the understanding of non-Newtonian effects on particle dynamics has led to expanding exploration of focusing and sorting particles and cells using viscoelastic microﬂuidics. Multiple factors, such as the driving forces arising from ﬂuid elasticity and inertia, the effect of ﬂuid rheology, the physical properties of particles and cells, and channel geometry, actively interact and compete together to govern the intricate migration behavior of particles and cells in microchannels. Here, we review the viscoelastic ﬂuid physics and the hydrodynamic forces in such ﬂows and identify three pairs of competing forces/effects that collectively govern viscoelastic migration. We discuss migration dynamics, focusing positions, numerical simulations, and recent progress in viscoelastic microﬂuidic applications as well as the remaining challenges. Finally, we hope that an improved understanding of viscoelastic ﬂows in microﬂuidics can lead to increased sophistication of microﬂuidic platforms in clinical diagnostics and biomedical research.},

We come across many such materials in our daily lives through a number of interesting applications in engineering, material science and medicine. This article concerns itself with modelling of the nonlinear response of a class of viscoelastic solids. In particular, nonlinear viscoelasticity of strain rate type, which can be described by a constitutive relation for the stress function depending not only on the strain but also on the strain rate, is considered. This particular case is not only favourable from a mathematical analysis point of view but also due to experimental observations, knowledge of the strain rate sensitivity of viscoelastic properties is crucial for accurate predictions of the mechanical behaviour of solids in different areas of applications. First, a brief introduction of some basic terminology and preliminaries, including kinematics, material frame-indifference and thermodynamics, is given. Then, considering the governing equations with constitutive relationships between the stress and the strain for the modelling of nonlinear viscoelasticity of strain rate type, the most general model of interest is obtained. Then, the long-term behaviour of solutions is discussed. Finally, some applications of the model are presented.},

The main idea of a chain diﬀusing inside a tube can be transferred from fully ﬂexible chains although the renormalization onto a ﬂexible chain of fewer Kuhn segments fails. The entanglement length shrinks with increasing persistence length. If entanglement length and persistence length come to the same order of magnitude the picture of a tight tube is better suited, in which chain segments can move only along the contour, any transverse motion being much reduced. Thus, as stiﬀness increases, the monomers loose their freedom to perform random walks inside the tube, the “Rouse-like” part of their dynamics.},

	abstract = {Nanoconﬁnement can drastically change the behavior of liquids, puzzling us with counterintuitive properties. It is relevant in applications, including decontamination and crystallization control. However, it still lacks a systematic analysis for ﬂuids with diﬀerent bulk properties. Here we address this gap. We compare, by molecular dynamics simulations, three diﬀerent liquids in a graphene slit pore: (1) A simple ﬂuid, such as argon, described by a Lennard-Jones potential; (2) an anomalous ﬂuid, such as a liquid metal, modeled with an isotropic core-softened potential; and (3) water, the prototypical anomalous liquid, with directional HBs. We study how the slit-pore width aﬀects the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of the ﬂuids. All the ﬂuids show similar oscillating properties by changing the pore size. However, their free-energy minima are quite diﬀerent in nature: (i) are energy-driven for the simple liquid; (ii) are entropy-driven for the isotropic core-softened potential; and (iii) have a changing nature for water. Indeed, for water, the monolayer minimum is entropy driven, at variance with the simple liquid, while the bilayer minimum is energy driven, at variance with the other anomalous liquid. Also, water has a large increase in diﬀusion for subnm slit pores, becoming faster than bulk. Instead, the other two ﬂuids have diﬀusion oscillations much smaller than water, slowing down for decreasing slit-pore width. Our results, clarifying that water conﬁned at the subnm scale behaves diﬀerently from other (simple or anomalous) ﬂuids under similar conﬁnement, are possibly relevant in nanopores applications, for example, in water puriﬁcation from contaminants.},

              Corrosion is a subject of interest to interdisciplinary research communities, combining fields of materials science, chemistry, physics, metallurgy and chemical engineering. In order to understand mechanisms of corrosion and the function of corrosion inhibitors, the reactions at the interfaces between the corrosive electrolyte and a steel surface, particularly at the initial stages of the corrosion process, need to be described. Naturally, these reactions are strongly affected by the nature and properties of the steel surfaces. It is however seen that the majority of recent corrosion and corrosion-inhibition investigations are limited to electrochemical testing, with
              ex situ
              analysis of the treated steels (post-exposure analysis). The characterization of materials and their surface properties, such as texture and morphology, are not being considered in most studies. Similarly,
              in situ
              investigations of the initial stages of the corrosion reactions using advanced surface characterization techniques are scarce. In this review, attention is brought to the importance of surface features of carbon steels, such as texture and surface energy, along with defects dislocation related to mechanical processing of carbon steels. This work is extended to a critical review of surface analytical techniques used for characterization of carbon steels in corrosive media with particular focus on examining steel surfaces treated with corrosion inhibitors. Further, emerging surface analysis techniques and their applicability to analyse carbon steels in corrosive media are discussed. The importance of surface properties is commonly addressed by surface scientists as well as researchers in other chemistry fields such as nanotechnology, fuel cells, and catalysis. This article is expected to appeal to a broad scientific community, including but not limited to corrosion scientists, material chemists, analytical chemists, metal physicists, corrosion and materials engineers.},

          , 
            
              For almost a decade, growing experimental evidence has revealed a strong correlation between the properties of nanoconfined polymers and the number of chains irreversibly adsorbed onto nonrepulsive interfaces,
              e.g.
              the supporting substrate of thin polymer coatings, or nanofillers dispersed in polymer melts. Based on such a correlation, it has already been possible to tailor structural and dynamics properties – such as the glass transition temperature, the crystallization rate, the thermal expansion coefficients, the viscosity and the wettability – of nanomaterials by controlling the adsorption kinetics. This evidence indicates that irreversible adsorption affects nanoconfinement effects. More recently, also the opposite phenomenon was experimentally observed: nanoconfinement alters interfacial interactions and, consequently, also the number of chains adsorbed in equilibrium conditions. In this review we discuss this intriguing interplay between irreversible adsorption and nanoconfinement effects in ultrathin polymer films. After introducing the methods currently used to prepare adsorbed layers and to measure the number of irreversibly adsorbed chains, we analyze the models employed to describe the kinetics of adsorption in polymer melts. We then discuss the structure of adsorbed polymer layers, focusing on the complex macromolecular architecture of interfacial chains and on their thermal expansion; we examine the way in which the structure of the adsorbed layer affects the thermal glass transition temperature, vitrification, and crystallization. By analyzing segmental dynamics of 1D confined systems, we describe experiments to track the changes in density during adsorption. We conclude this review with an analysis of the impact of nanoconfinement on adsorption, and a perspective on future work where we also address the key ideas of irreversibility, equilibration and long-range interactions.},

	abstract = {A cornerstone of modern polymer physics is the “Flory ideality hypothesis” which states that a chain in a polymer melt adopts “ideal” random-walk–like conformations. Here we revisit theoretically and numerically this pivotal assumption and demonstrate that there are noticeable deviations from ideality. The deviations come from the interplay of chain connectivity and the incompressibility of the melt, leading to an eﬀective repulsion between chain segments of all sizes s. The amplitude of this repulsion increases with decreasing s where chain segments become more and more swollen. We illustrate this swelling by an analysis of the form factor F (q), i.e. the scattered intensity at wave vector q resulting from intramolecular interferences of a chain. A “Kratky plot” of q2F (q) vs. q does not exhibit the plateau for intermediate wave vectors characteristic of ideal chains. One rather ﬁnds a conspicuous depression of the plateau, δ(F −1(q)) = {\textbar}q{\textbar}3/32ρ, which increases with q and only depends on the monomer density ρ.},

The measured dynamic structure factor shows a clear transition to a plateau, signifying the stronger confinement of the star center in comparison to a corresponding center labeled linear chain. A shortening of one star arm to about only one entanglement length leads to the same topological confinement as for the symmetric star within the accessible time range of NSE. This reflects a stronger effect of such a small branch than expected and is consistent with rheological measurements on the same system.

The total polymer volume fraction is equal to 0,5, while the volume fraction of the star polymers is about ten times smaller. The static and dynamic properties of these systems are compared with the corresponding model systems of isolated star-branched polymers and with the melt of linear chains. It has been found that the number of dynamic entanglements for the star polymers with arm length up to 400 segments is too small for the onset of the arm retraction mechanism of polymer relaxation. In this regime dynamics of star-branched polymers is close to the dynamics of linear polymers at corresponding concentration and with equivalent chain length. The entanglement length for star polymers appears to be somewhat larger compared with linear chains.},

Repeated melting/recrystallization transitions were observed, at the slower strain rate of 5 × 106 s−1, characterized by oscillating stress− strain proﬁles. With increasing thickness of the crystalline regions, these oscillations occurred less frequently. For systems with initially tilted chain stems in the crystalline domain, decreasing the thickness of the noncrystalline region increased the number of short bridge segments in the noncrystalline region connecting the two crystalline regions and induced signiﬁcant shear stresses, rearrangements in the crystalline region, and the strain hardening during the tensile deformation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, hollow copper nano-cylinders are designed, and the inﬂuence of thickness on the mechanical properties of nano-cylinders is analyzed by molecular dynamics methods. In order to describe the circumferential deformation, the radial nature strain and the strain ratio to the principal nature strain are deﬁned. Afterwards, the mechanical characteristics of the nano-cylinders with different thicknesses are given in terms of energy, stress, strain and deformation. It is found that the properties of the hollow nano-cylinders have an important relationship with the wall thickness. If the thickness of the nano-tube wall is not enough, the model has the large deformation during the relaxation process, and it loses the features of the original model section. After loading, the model will still deform like a cylinder’s tension until it breaks. Although the deformations are similar, the gap between the stresses is extremely large. The corresponding relationship between the average stress and Mises stress of the nano cylinders is ﬁtted, which provides reference for the subsequent study.},

Science is, after all, the abstraction of simple principles from complex data. The title is the ultimate refinement of the paper’s contribution. Thinking about the title early—and regularly returning to hone it—can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in “one contribution” that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.},

	shorttitle = {Dilute polymer solutions under shear flow},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01870},
	abstract = {Although the non-equilibrium behaviour of polymer solutions is generally well understood, particularly in extensional flow, there remain several unanswered questions for dilute solutions in simple shear flow, and full parameter-free, quantitative agreement with experiments has not been achieved. For example, experimental viscosity data exhibit qualitative differences in shear-thinning exponents, shear rate for onset of shear-thinning and high-shear Newtonian plateaus depending on polymer semiflexibility, contour length and solvent quality. While polymer models are able to incorporate all of these effects through various spring force laws, bending potentials, excluded volume (EV) potentials, and hydrodynamic interaction (HI), the inclusion of each piece of physics has not been systematically matched to experimentally observed behaviour. Furthermore, attempts to develop multiscale models which can make quantitative predictions are hindered by the lack of ability to fully match the results of bead-rod models, often used to represent a polymer chain at the Kuhn step level, with bead-spring models, which take into account the entropic elasticity. In light of these difficulties, this work aims to develop a general model based on the so-called FENE-Fraenkel spring, originally formulated by Larson and coworkers [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 044911 (2006)], which can span the range from rigid rod to traditional entropic spring, as well as include a bending potential, EV and HI. As we show, this model can reproduce, and smoothly move between, a wide range of previously observed polymer solution rheology in shear flow.},

	abstract = {We present detailed results about the structural, conformational, rheo-optical, and topological properties of an entangled of C400H802 linear polyethylene (PE) melt over a wide range of shear rates (covering both the linear and the highly nonlinear viscoelastic regimes) from direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of a large system containing 192 chains (corresponding to 79200 interacting atomistic units). We discuss results for (i) the probability distribution of the mean-square chain end-to-end distance and its radius of gyration, (ii) the conformation tensor, (iii) the material functions in steady shear (viscosity, normal stress differences, nonequilibrium shear compliance, hydrostatic pressure), (iv) the flow birefringence, (v) the orientation angle and order parameter, (vi) the interaction energies and their relative importance, (vii) the intermolecular pair distribution function, and (viii) the intrinsic molecular shape of the chains (represented by the isosurface plots in terms of their monomer number density), all as a function of flow strength. A detailed primitive path (PP) analysis has allowed us to examine how the flow field alters the statistical properties of the underlying topological network of the melt (probability distribution functions and mean values of PP contour length, of the number and size of entanglement strands, etc.). Our results reveal significant distortions of all these distributions due to applied flow. One of the most important results of our work is that as the shear rate is increased, the average value of the contour length goes through a maximum and the number of entanglements per chain exhibits a shear-thinning behavior which bears many similarities with the corresponding behavior of the shear viscosity. Overall, most of the computed rheological properties of the C400H802 melt change in a nonlinear way with the applied shear rate due to the simultaneous effect of (a) chain orientation and stretching, (b) chain rotation and tumbling under shear, and (c) chain disentanglement.},

The emphasis is on the conditions which cause symmetry breaking in the density distribution for one component ﬂuids and binary mixtures conﬁned in a closed nanoslit between identical solid walls. The existing studies have revealed that two kinds of symmetry breaking can occur in such systems. First, a one-dimensional symmetry breaking occurs only in the direction normal to the walls as a ﬂuid density proﬁle asymmetric with respect of the middle of the slit and uniform in any direction parallel to the walls. Second, a two-dimensional symmetry breaking occurs in the ﬂuid density distribution which is nonuniform in one of the directions parallel to the walls and asymmetrical in the direction normal to the walls. It manifests through liquid bumps and bridges in the ﬂuid density distribution. For one component ﬂuids, conditions of existence of symmetry breaking are provided in terms of the average ﬂuid density, strength of ﬂuid–solid interactions, distance at which the solid wall generates a hard core repulsion, and temperature. In the case of binary mixtures, the occurrence of symmetry breaking also depends on the composition of the conﬁned mixtures.},

In this article, we review the research on the friction mechanism and the development of a new burgeoning technique named “superlubricity”, which has been demonstrated as an attractive way to achieve ultralow friction and wear with almost no energy dissipation.

The regularities investigated include common compression point, common bulk modulus point, Tait–Murnaghan equation, and the linear regularity between pressure and temperature for each isochore. All these regularities have been investigated for two different components of pressure for conﬁned ﬂuid. Our results show that the common compression and common bulk modulus point remain valid for ﬂuids conﬁned in nanoslit pores of different sizes and with different wall–ﬂuid potentials. The density of the common compression and common bulk modulus point are different from corresponding ones for the bulk ﬂuid. Our observations also show that the Tait–Murnaghan equation and pressure–temperature linear regularity also hold for conﬁned ﬂuid. The sign of the intercept of pressure–temperature regularity is determined by the difference between attraction and repulsion terms in the compressibility factor.},

	abstract = {For several centuries ﬂuid dynamics studies have relied upon the assumption that when a liquid ﬂows over a solid surface, the liquid molecules adjacent to the solid are stationary relative to the solid. This no-slip boundary condition (BC) has been applied successfully to model many macroscopic experiments, but has no microscopic justiﬁcation. In recent years there has been an increased interest in determining the appropriate BCs for the ﬂow of Newtonian liquids in conﬁned geometries, partly due to exciting developments in the ﬁelds of microﬂuidic and microelectromechanical devices and partly because new and more sophisticated measurement techniques are now available. An increasing number of research groups now dedicate great attention to the study of the ﬂow of liquids at solid interfaces, and as a result a large number of experimental, computational and theoretical studies have appeared in the literature. We provide here a review of experimental studies regarding the phenomenon of slip of Newtonian liquids at solid interfaces. We dedicate particular attention to the effects that factors such as surface roughness, wettability and the presence of gaseous layers might have on the measured interfacial slip. We also discuss how future studies might improve our understanding of hydrodynamic BCs and enable us to actively control liquid slip.},

	abstract = {Significance
            An essential step in society’s attempt to reduce energy consumption is to understand and optimize energy dissipation (friction) in mechanical processes. Despite decades of study, one of the most fundamental model systems in the study of friction remains unsolved: the shear of molecular films of simple alkanes between atomically smooth crystalline surfaces. Previous reports of the friction coefficient diverge over three orders of magnitude, and reports that the film solidifies on confinement remain controversial. We perform measurements with control over parameters not previously taken into account, allowing us to reconcile earlier reports. We demonstrate that the alkane films indeed solidify, and yet retain ultralow friction coefficients under certain conditions.
          , 
            
              Hydrocarbon films confined between smooth mica surfaces have long provided an experimental playground for model studies of structure and dynamics of confined liquids. However, fundamental questions regarding the phase behavior and shear properties in this simple system remain unsolved. With ultrasensitive resolution in film thickness and shear stress, and control over the crystallographic alignment of the confining surfaces, we here investigate the shear forces transmitted across nanoscale films of dodecane down to a single molecular layer. We resolve the conditions under which liquid–solid phase transitions occur and explain friction coefficients spanning several orders of magnitude. We find that commensurate surface alignment and presence of water at the interfaces each lead to moderate or high friction, whereas friction coefficients down to

              are observed for a single molecular layer of dodecane trapped between crystallographically misaligned dry surfaces. This ultralow friction is attributed to sliding at the incommensurate interface between one of the mica surfaces and the laterally ordered solid molecular film, reconciling previous interpretations.},

	abstract = {The nature of attractive particulate networks, yield stresses, and normal stress differences is systematically reviewed, each in terms of the relevant definitions, underlying mechanisms, and current measurement techniques. With this foundation, experimental observations of normal stress differences in some suspensions and colloidal systems are surveyed, along with constitutive models that allow for normal stress differences to arise prior to yielding. Yield stresses are a hallmark of attractive colloidal systems and vital in their processing. In contrast, little attention has been given to the role of normal stress differences in these systems. The presence or absence of normal stress differences necessarily affects the isotropy of the normal stress field through the solid particulate phase (treated as a continuum), in turn affecting estimation of yield stress. Given the importance of yield stresses in dealing with practical industrial problems, and in understanding fundamental behaviours, it is important to ensure that yield measurements can be relied upon.},

This is done by assuming that the ratio g/* of the second normal stress difference to the first is independent of shear rate. This permits the precalculation of the measured function with {\textasciitilde}g* as a curve parameter. The best possible fit of the measurement leads to the determination of gz*. This method is used to measure the normal stress ratio of pure polyisobutene and of a 34.5\% suspension of the same fluid.

	doi = {10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02224},
	abstract = {When compressed in a slit of width \$D\$, a \${\textbackslash}Theta\$-chain that displays the scaling of size \$R\_0\$ (diameter) with respect to the number of monomers \$N\$, \$R\_0{\textbackslash}sim aN{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$, expands in the lateral direction as \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}{\textbackslash}sim a N{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}nu\}(a/D){\textasciicircum}\{2{\textbackslash}nu-1\}\$. Provided that the \${\textbackslash}Theta\$ condition is strictly maintained throughout the compression, the well-known scaling exponent of \${\textbackslash}Theta\$-chain in 2 dimensions, \${\textbackslash}nu=4/7\$, is anticipated in a perfect confinement. However, numerics shows that upon increasing compression from \$R\_0/D{\textless}1\$ to \$R\_0/D{\textbackslash}gg 1\$, \${\textbackslash}nu\$ gradually deviates from \${\textbackslash}nu=1/2\$ and plateaus at \${\textbackslash}nu=3/4\$, the exponent associated with the self-avoiding walk in two dimensions. Using both theoretical considerations and numerics, we argue that it is highly nontrivial to maintain the \${\textbackslash}Theta\$ condition under confinement because of two major effects. First, as the dimension is reduced from 3 to 2 dimensions, the contributions of higher order virial terms, which can be ignored in 3 dimensions at large \$N\$, become significant. Second and more importantly, the geometrical confinement, which is regarded as an applied external field, alters the second virial coefficient (\$B\_2\$) changes from \$B\_2=0\$ (\${\textbackslash}Theta\$ condition) in free space to \$B\_2{\textgreater}0\$ (good-solvent condition) in confinement. Our study provides practical insight into how confinement affects the conformation of a single polymer chain.},

          , 
            Fluid lubricants are routinely used to reduce friction in a wide range of applications, from car engines to machinery and hard-disk drives. However, their efficiency can be significantly influenced by the ambient conditions they are exposed to, in particular humidity. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the well-documented impact of water on lubrication remains limited, hindering the improvement of tribological formulations. Here, we use Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and shear force spectroscopy to investigate the structural and dynamical behaviour of a model lubricant, hexadecane, confined between an AFM probe and a hydrophilic mica surface at different temperatures and humidities. We show that both the nanoscale structure and the tribological behaviour of the system are dominated by the nucleation of water nanodroplets at the interface. The process is favoured at higher temperature and can be explained with classical nucleation theory whereby the droplets become stable when larger than 20 nm to 50 nm size, depending on the ambient conditions. Below this threshold, a molecularly thin film of water molecules coats the surface uniformly. Highly localised shear measurements demonstrate a detrimental impact of the nanodroplets on shear with a twofold increase in the lubricated friction force. However, this can be mitigated by the adjunction of an amphiphilic additive, here oleic acid.},

	abstract = {Investigations of surface roughness effects on the structure, dynamics and rheology of a molecular ﬂuid (hexadecane) conﬁned between solid (gold) surfaces, through the use of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, reveal a remarkable sensitivity to the conﬁning surface morphology. A most signiﬁcant reduction of the ordering propensity is found in ﬁlms conﬁned by stationary rough surfaces with a consequent strong suppression of solvation forces and the development of liquid-like dynamic and response characteristics. When the rough-surface boundaries are set in motion at a high shear rate, the interfacial layers of the ﬁlm stick to the adjacent solid boundaries, resulting in partial slip inside the ﬁlm with the development of shear stress in the viscous molecular ﬂuid, unlike the case of atomically ﬂat crystalline boundaries where slip of the conﬁned ﬁlm at the boundaries is accompanied by vanishingly small shear stress in the ﬁlm. These results are discussed in the context of the effect of roughness on the boundary conditions used in modeling ﬂuid ﬂow past surfaces, and they suggest that morphological patterning of surfaces could provide ways for controlled modiﬁcations of frictional processes in thin-ﬁlm lubricated nanotribological systems.},

Results for end-to-end vector and Rouse mode correlation functions of chains end-tethered to the surface compare well with those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of a multichain system using the Kremer−Grest bead−spring model (KG MD). Even though the additional single-chain potential is parameter-free, we show that the accuracy of the model for surface chains is comparable to that of the Rouse model for bulk chains. An analytic dumbbell model accurately describes the longest Rouse mode correlation function of surface-tethered “mushroom” chains immersed in a polymer melt at low grafting density. In addition, we ﬁnd that a perfectly smooth surface enhances the inﬂuence of hydrodynamic viscoelastic coupling on the center-of-mass motion near the surface.},

We show that for a velocity range spanning over three decades, the frictional forces measured for ring-polymer brushes are half the corresponding friction in case of linear brushes. In the linear-force regime, the weak inter-digitation of two ring brushes compared to linear brushes also leads to a lower number of binary collisions between the monomers of opposing brushes. At high velocities, where the thickness of the inter-digitation layer between two opposing brushes is on the order monomer size regardless of brush topology, stretched segments of ring polymers take a double-stranded conformation. As a result, monomers of the double-stranded segments collide less with the monomers of the opposing ring brush even though a similar number of monomers occupies the inter-digitation layer for ring and linear-brush bilayers. The numerical data obtained from our simulations is consistent with the proposed scaling analysis. Conformation-dependent frictional reduction observed in ring brushes can have important consequences in non-equilibrium bulk systems.}},

    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on a triple of weights $(u, v, w)$ so that the $t$-Haar multipliers $T^t_{w,σ}, t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, are uniformly (on the choice of signs $σ$) bounded from $L^2(u)$ into $L^2(v)$. These dyadic operators have symbols $s(x; I) = σ_I (w(x)/\\langle w \\rangle_I )^t$ which are functions of the space variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and the frequency variable $I \\in \\mathcal{D}$, making them dyadic analogues of pseudo-differential operators. Here $\\mathcal{D}$ denotes the dyadic intervals, $σ_I = \\pm 1$, and $\\langle w \\rangle_I$ denotes the integral average of $w$ on $I$. When $w\\equiv 1$ we have the martingale transform and our conditions recover the known two-weight necessary and sufficient conditions of Nazarov, Treil and Volberg. We also show how these conditions are simplified when $u = v$. In particular, the martingale one-weight and the t-Haar multiplier unsigned and unweighted (corresponding to $σ_I= 1$ and $u = v \\equiv 1$) known results are recovered or improved. We also obtain necessary and sufficient testing conditions of Sawyer type for the two-weight boundedness of a single variable Haar multiplier similar to those known for the martingale transform.",

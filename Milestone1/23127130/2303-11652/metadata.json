    "abstract": "In this paper, we estimate an operator norm of dilation operators on block spaces ($\\mathfrak{B}_{r,α}(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$) over $p$-adic field. With this estimate, we establish the boundedness of $p$-adic Hardy-Hilbert type integral operator on $\\mathfrak{B}_{r,α}(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover as application to our result, we obtain the $p$-adic Hilbert inequality, $p$-adic Hardy inequality and $p$-adic Hardy-Littlewood-Pólya inequality on $\\mathfrak{B}_{r,α}(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$.",

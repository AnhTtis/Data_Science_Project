\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We devised an ownership analysis for Rust programs translated by \crust that 
is scalable (handling half a million LOC in less than 10 seconds) 
and precise (handling inductive data structures) thanks to a strengthening of the Rust ownership model, which we call 
ownership monotonicity. 
Based on this new analysis, we prototyped a refactoring tool for translating C programs
into Rust programs. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach handles real-world benchmarks and
outperforms the state-of-the-art.

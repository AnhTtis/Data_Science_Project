Dubbed a safer C, Rust is a modern programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control. 
This interesting combination has made Rust very popular among developers and there is a
growing trend of migrating legacy codebases (very often in C) to Rust. In this paper, we present a 
C to Rust translation approach centred around static ownership analysis. We design a suite of 
analyses that infer ownership models of C pointers and automatically translate the pointers into safe Rust equivalents.  
The resulting tool, \name, scales to real-world codebases (half a million lines of code in less than 10 seconds) and 
achieves a high conversion rate.

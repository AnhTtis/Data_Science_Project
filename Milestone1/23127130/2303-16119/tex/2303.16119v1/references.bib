abstract = {Abstract Data in many different fields come to practitioners through a process naturally described as functional. Although data are gathered as finite vector and may contain measurement errors, the functional form have to be taken into account. We propose a clustering procedure of such data emphasizing the functional nature of the objects. The new clustering method consists of two stages: fitting the functional data by B-splines and partitioning the estimated model coefficients using a k-means algorithm. Strong consistency of the clustering method is proved and a real-world example from food industry is given.},

abstract = {Summary We propose a classification method for longitudinal data. The Bayes classifier is classically used to determine a classification rule where the underlying density in each class needs to be well modeled and estimated. This work is motivated by a real dataset of hormone levels measured at the early stages of pregnancy that can be used to predict normal versus abnormal pregnancy outcomes. The proposed model, which is a semiparametric linear mixed-effects model (SLMM), is a particular case of the semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects class of models (SNMM) in which finite dimensional (fixed effects and variance components) and infinite dimensional (an unknown function) parameters have to be estimated. In SNMM's maximum likelihood estimation is performed iteratively alternating parametric and nonparametric procedures. However, if one can make the assumption that the random effects and the unknown function interact in a linear way, more efficient estimation methods can be used. Our contribution is the proposal of a unified estimation procedure based on a penalized EM-type algorithm. The Expectation and Maximization steps are explicit. In this latter step, the unknown function is estimated in a nonparametric fashion using a lasso-type procedure. A simulation study and an application on real data are performed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method to cluster multivariate functional data with missing observations. Analysis of functional data often encompasses dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). These techniques require complete data matrices. In this paper, the data are completed by means of multiple imputation, and subsequently each imputed data set is submitted to a cluster procedure. The final partition of the data, summarizing the partitions obtained for the imputed data sets, is obtained by means of ensemble clustering. The uncertainty in cluster membership, due to missing data, is characterized by means of the agreement between the members of the ensemble and fuzziness of the consensus clustering. The potential of the method was brought out on the heart failure (HF) data. Daily measurement for four biomarkers (heart rate, diastolic, and systolic blood pressure, weight) were used to cluster the patients. To normalize the distributions of the longitudinal outcomes, the data were transformed with a natural logarithm function. A cubic spline base with 69 basis functions was employed to smooth the profiles. The proposed algorithm indicates the existence of a latent structure and divides the HF patients into two clusters, showing a different evolution in blood pressure values and weight. In general, cluster results are sensitive to choices made. Likewise for the proposed approach, alternative choices for the distance measure, procedure to optimize the objective function, choice of the scree-test threshold, or the number of principal components, to be used in the approximation of the surrogate density, could all influence the final partition. For the HF data set, the final partition depends on the number of principal components used in the procedure.},

 abstract = {We describe a simulation-based method of inference for parametric measurement error models in which the measurement error variance is known or at least well estimated.The method entails adding additional measurement error in known increments to the data, computing estimates from the contaminated data, establishing a trend between these estimates and the variance of the added errors, and extrapolating this trend back to the case of no measurement error.We show that the method is equivalent or asymptotically equivalent to method-of-moments estimation in linear measurement error modeling.Simulation studies are presented showing that the method produces estimators that are nearly asymptotically unbiased and efficient in standard and nonstandard logistic regression models.An oversimiplified but fairly accurate description of the method is that it is method-of-moments estimation using Monte Carlo-derived estimating equations.},

 abstract = {A selective review of the statistical analysis of time series is given, attention being concentrated on methods for the interpretation of data as contrasted with methods for empirical forecasting.Ways of describing second-order properties are compared and the distinction between short-range and long-range dependency outlined.Estimation of second-order functions is reviewed in model-free and model-specific contexts.Criteria for model choice and goodness of fit are discussed.Analysis of replicated series is mentioned.Some aspects of nonGaussian theory are developed.The possibility of an exponential family theory of time series is outlined and also some aspects of nonlinear processes.The distinction between reversible and irreversible processes is emphasized.Techniques for handling nonstationary processes are compared, dealing both with nonstationarity in mean and nonstationarity in structure.Finally there are some fairly brief remarks on multiple time series analysis, especially on the regression analysis of one response series on several explanatory series.},

abstract = {This research is motivated by studying the progression of age-related macular degeneration where both a covariate and the response variable are subject to censoring. We develop a general framework to handle regression with censored covariate where the response can be different types and the censoring can be random or subject to (constant) detection limits. Multiple imputation is a popular technique to handle missing data that requires compatibility between the imputation model and the substantive model to obtain valid estimates. With censored covariate, we propose a novel multiple imputation-based approach, namely, the semiparametric two-step importance sampling imputation (STISI) method, to impute the censored covariate. Specifically, STISI imputes the missing covariate from a semiparametric accelerated failure time model conditional on fully observed covariates (Step 1) with the acceptance probability derived from the substantive model (Step 2). The 2-step procedure automatically ensures compatibility and takes full advantage of the relaxed semiparametric assumption in the imputation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the STISI method yields valid estimates in all scenarios and outperforms some existing methods that are commonly used in practice. We apply STISI on data from the Age-related Eye Disease Study, to investigate the association between the progression time of the less severe eye and that of the more severe eye. We also illustrate the method by analyzing the urine arsenic data for patients from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2004) where the response is binary and 1 covariate is subject to detection limit.},

    abstract = { One purpose of a longitudinal study is to gain a better understanding of how an outcome of interest changes among a given population over time. In what follows, a trajectory will be taken to mean the series of measurements of the outcome variable for an individual. Group-based trajectory modelling methods seek to identify subgroups of trajectories within a population, such that trajectories that are grouped together are more similar to each other than to trajectories in distinct groups. Group-based trajectory models generally assume a certain structure in the covariances between measurements, for example conditional independence, homogeneous variance between groups or stationary variance over time. Violations of these assumptions could be expected to result in poor model performance. We used simulation to investigate the effect of covariance misspecification on misclassification of trajectories in commonly used models under a range of scenarios. To do this we defined a measure of performance relative to the ideal Bayesian correct classification rate. We found that the more complex models generally performed better over a range of scenarios. In particular, incorrectly specified covariance matrices could significantly bias the results but using models with a correct but more complicated than necessary covariance matrix incurred little cost. }

 abstract = {We introduce a new method, moment reconstruction, of correcting for measurement error in covariates in regression models.The central idea is similar to regression calibration in that the values of the covariates that are measured with error are replaced by "adjusted" values.In regression calibration the adjusted value is the expectation of the true value conditional on the measured value.In moment reconstruction the adjusted value is the variance-preserving empirical Bayes estimate of the true value conditional on the outcome variable.The adjusted values thereby have the same first two moments and the same covariance with the outcome variable as the unobserved "true" covariate values.We show that moment reconstruction is equivalent to regression calibration in the case of linear regression, but leads to different results for logistic regression.For case-control studies with logistic regression and covariates that are normally distributed within cases and controls, we show that the resulting estimates of the regression coefficients are consistent.In simulations we demonstrate that for logistic regression, moment reconstruction carries less bias than regression calibration, and for case-control studies is superior in mean-square error to the standard regression calibration approach.Finally, we give an example of the use of moment reconstruction in linear discriminant analysis and a nonstandard problem where we wish to adjust a classification tree for measurement error in the explanatory variables.},

abstract = {Objective We sought to replicate a previously published prediction model for progression, developed in the Cache County Dementia Progression Study, using a clinical cohort from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Methods We included 1120 incident Alzheimer disease (AD) cases with at least one assessment after diagnosis, originating from 31 AD centres from the United States. Trajectories of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-sb) were modelled jointly over time using parallel-process growth mixture models in order to identify latent classes of trajectories. Bias-corrected multinomial logistic regression was used to identify baseline predictors of class membership and compare these with the predictors found in the Cache County Dementia Progression Study. Results The best-fitting model contained 3 classes: Class 1 was the largest (63\%) and showed the slowest progression on both MMSE and CDR-sb; classes 2 (22\%) and 3 (15\%) showed moderate and rapid worsening, respectively. Significant predictors of membership in classes 2 and 3, relative to class 1, were worse baseline MMSE and CDR-sb, higher education, and lack of hypertension. Combining all previously mentioned predictors yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 and 0.75 for classes 2 and 3, respectively, relative to class 1. Conclusions Our replication study confirmed that it is possible to predict trajectories of progression in AD with relatively good accuracy. The class distribution was comparable with that of the original study, with most individuals being members of a class with stable or slow progression. This is important for informing newly diagnosed AD patients and their caregivers.},

abstract ={Background Prodromal Huntington's disease (prHD) is associated with a myriad of cognitive changes but the domains that best predict time to clinical diagnosis have not been studied.This is a notable gap because some domains may be more sensitive to cognitive decline, which would inform clinical trials.Objectives The present study sought to characterise cognitive domains underlying a large test battery and for the first time, evaluate their ability to predict time to diagnosis.Methods Participants included gene negative and gene positive prHD participants who were enrolled in the PREDICT-HD study.The CAG-age product (CAP) score was the measure of an individual's genetic signature.A factor analysis of 18 tests was performed to identify sets of measures or latent factors that elucidated core constructs of tests.Factor scores were then fit to a survival model to evaluate their ability to predict time to diagnosis.Results Six factors were identified: (1) speed/inhibition, (2) verbal working memory, (3) motor planning/speed, (4) attention-��information integration, (5) sensory-��perceptual processing and (6) verbal learning/memory.Factor scores were sensitive to worsening of cognitive functioning in prHD, typically more so than performances on individual tests comprising the factors.Only the motor planning/speed and sensory-perceptual processing factors predicted time to diagnosis, after controlling for CAP scores and motor symptoms.Conclusions The results suggest that motor planning/speed and sensory-��perceptual processing are important markers of disease prognosis.The findings also have implications for using composite indices of cognition in preventive Huntington's disease trials where they may be more sensitive than individual tests.},

 abstract = {Generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs), as defined by Bartholomew and Knott, enable modelling of relationships between manifest and latent variables.They extend structural equation modelling techniques, which are powerful tools in the social sciences.However, because of the complexity of the log-likelihood function of a GLLVM, an approximation such as numerical integration must be used for inference.This can limit drastically the number of variables in the model and can lead to biased estimators.We propose a new estimator for the parameters of a GLLVM, based on a Laplace approximation to the likelihood function and which can be computed even for models with a large number of variables.The new estimator can be viewed as an M-estimator, leading to readily available asymptotic properties and correct inference.A simulation study shows its excellent finite sample properties, in particular when compared with a well-established approach such as LISREL.A real data example on the measurement of wealth for the computation of multidimensional inequality is analysed to highlight the importance of the methodology.},

 abstract = {While the literature on nonclassical measurement error traditionally relies on the availability of an auxiliary dataset containing correctly measured observations, this paper establishes that the availability of instruments enables the identification of a large class of nonclassical nonlinear errors-in-variables models with continuously distributed variables.The main identifying assumption is that, conditional on the value of the true regressors, some "measure of location" of the distribution of the measurement error (e.g.its mean, mode or median) is equal to zero.The proposed approach relies on the eigenvalue-eigenfunction decomposition of an integral operator associated with specific joint probability densities.The main identifying assumption is used to order the eigenfunctions so that the decomposition is unique.The authors propose a convenient sieve-based estimator, derive its asymptotic properties and investigate its finite-sample behavior through Monte Carlo simulations.An example of application to the relationship between earnings and divorce rates is also provided.}

    abstract = { We develop variable selection approaches for accelerated failure time models, consisting of a group of algorithms based on a synthesis of two widely used techniques in the area of variable selection for survival analysis—the Buckley–James method and the Dantzig selector. Two algorithms are based on proposed modified Buckley–James estimating methods that are designed for high-dimensional censored data. Another two algorithms are based on a two-stage weighted Dantzig selector method where weights are obtained from the two proposed synthesis-based algorithms. The methods are easy to understand and they perform estimation and variable selection simultaneously. Furthermore, they can deal with collinearity among the covariates. We conducted several simulation studies and one empirical analysis with a microarray dataset; these studies demonstrated satisfactory variable selection performance. In addition, the microarray data analysis shows the methods performing similarly to three other correlation-based greedy variable selection techniques in the literature—sure independence screening, tilted correlation screening (TCS), and partial correlation (PC) simple. This empirical study also found that the sure independence screening technique considerably improves the performance of most of the proposed methods. }

    abstract = { In longitudinal studies, it is often of great interest to cluster individual trajectories based on repeated measurements taken over time. Non-linear growth trajectories are often seen in practice, and the individual data can also be measured sparsely, and at irregular time points, which may complicate the modeling process. Motivated by a study of pregnant women hormone profiles, we proposed a shape invariant growth mixture model for clustering non-linear growth trajectories. Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo Markov Chain was employed to estimate the parameters of interest. We compared our model to the commonly used growth mixture model and functional clustering approach by simulation studies. Results from analyzing the real data and simulated data were presented and discussed. }

<title>Background</title>
<p>Although the increase in risk of developing breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers has been studied extensively, its impact on mortality is not well quantified.Further, possible effect of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations on non-cancer mortality risk has not been examined.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Using mortality data from the relatives of 5,287 genotyped participants, of whom 120 carried a <italic>BRCA</italic> Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation, in a community-based study of the Ashkenazi Jewish population in the Washington D.C area, we examined the association between the three Ashkenazi <italic>BRCA</italic> founder mutations and risk of overall and non-cancer mortality.To examine risks beyond the established effects of these mutations, we analyzed the data excluding both deaths and follow-up times after reported diagnosis of melanoma and cancer of the breast, ovary, prostate, and pancreas.Using an extension of the kin-cohort method that accounts for informative censoring, we estimated that, in the absence of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, and melanoma, female carriers had a life expectancy that was 6.8 years lower (95\% CI: 1.2-��10.5) than non-carriers.In male mutation carriers, the reduction in life expectancy, in the absence of prostate and pancreatic cancers and melanoma, was 3.7 (95\% CI: -0.4, 6.8) years.When deaths and follow-up times after any cancer diagnosis were excluded, the difference in life expectancy was 5.7 years for women (95\% CI: -0.1, 10.4) and 3.7 years for men (95\% CI: -��0.4, 6.9).An overall test of association for men and women together showed a statistically significant association between <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations and increased non-cancer mortality (p = 0.024).</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>These findings suggest that there may be unknown effects of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations on non-neoplastic diseases that cause death at older ages.</p>

abstract ={A polyglutamine repeat expansion of more than 36 units in a protein called huntingtin (htt) is the only known cause of Huntington's disease (HD).The expanded repeat length is inversely correlated with the age-at-onset (AAO), however, the onset age among HD patients with CAG repeats below 60 units varies considerably.In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors different from the expanded CAG repeat length can modify the AAO of HD.We hypothezised that htt interacting proteins might contribute to this variation in the AAO and investigated human htt-associated protein-1 (HAP1) using genetic and functional assays.We identified six polymorphisms in the HAP1 gene including one that substitutes methionine (M441) for threonine (T441) at amino acid 441.Analyzing 980 European HD patients, we found that patients homozygous for the M441 genotype show an 8-year delay in the AAO.Functional assays demonstrated that human M441-HAP1 interacts with mutant htt more tightly than does human T441-HAP1, reduces soluble htt degraded products and protects against htt-mediated toxicity.We thus provide genetic and functional evidence that the M441-HAP1 polymorphism modifies the AAO of HD.},

In this review, we provide a nontechnical overview of group-based trajectory and growth mixture modeling alongside a sampling of how these models have been applied in clinical research. We discuss the challenges associated with the application of both types of group-based models and propose a set of preliminary guidelines for applied researchers to follow when reporting model results. Future directions in group-based modeling applications are discussed, including the use of trajectory models to facilitate causal inference when random assignment to treatment condition is not possible. }

	abstract = {This report describes an R package, called the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimation (iCARE) tool, which allows researchers to quickly build models for absolute risk, and apply them to estimate an individual{\textquoteright}s risk of developing disease during a specified time interval, based on a set of user defined input parameters.An attractive feature of the software is that it gives users flexibility to update models rapidly based on new knowledge of risk factors and tailor models to different populations.The tool requires three input arguments be specified: (1) a model for relative risk (2) an age-specific disease incidence rate and (3) the distribution of risk factors for the population of interest.The tool handles missing risk factor information for individuals for whom risks are to be predicted using a coherent approach where all estimates are derived from a single model after appropriate model averaging.The software allows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be incorporated into the model using published odds ratios and allele frequencies.We discuss the statistical framework, handling of missing data and genetic factors, and provide real data examples that demonstrate the utility of iCARE for building and applying absolute risk models, using breast cancer as an example.},

For better understanding of this heterogeneity, we aimed to identify cognitive subtypes using latent class analysis (LCA) in a large sample of patients with AD dementia. In addition, we explored the relationship between the identified cognitive subtypes, and their demographical and neurobiological characteristics.Methods We performed LCA based on neuropsychological test results of 938 consecutive probable patients with AD dementia using Mini-Mental State Examination as the covariate. Subsequently, we performed multinomial logistic regression analysis with cluster membership as dependent variable and dichotomised demographics, APOE genotype, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and MRI characteristics as independent variables.Results LCA revealed eight clusters characterised by distinct cognitive profile and disease severity. Memory-impaired clusters{\textemdash}mild-memory (MILD-MEM) and moderate-memory (MOD-MEM){\textemdash}included 43\% of patients. Memory-spared clusters mild-visuospatial-language (MILD-VILA), mild-executive (MILD-EXE) and moderate-visuospatial (MOD-VISP) {\textemdash}included 29\% of patients. Memory-indifferent clusters mild-diffuse (MILD-DIFF), moderate-language (MOD-LAN) and severe-diffuse (SEV-DIFF) {\textemdash}included 28\% of patients. Cognitive clusters were associated with distinct demographical and neurobiological characteristics. In particular, the memory-spared MOD-VISP cluster was associated with younger age, APOE e4 negative genotype and prominent atrophy of the posterior cortex.Conclusions Using LCA, we identified eight distinct cognitive subtypes in a large sample of patients with AD dementia. Cognitive clusters were associated with distinct demographical and neurobiological characteristics.},

This is commonly addressed by preprocessing the data via a warping procedure. As opposed to treating phase variation as a nuisance effect, it is advantageous to recognize it as a possible important source of information for clustering. It is illustrated how results from a multiresolution warping procedure can be used for clustering. This approach allows us to address detailed questions to find local clusters that differ in phase, or clusters that differ in amplitude, or both simultaneously."

    abstract = { Heterogeneity in treatment efficacy is a major concern in clinical trials. Clustering may help to identify the treatment responders and the non-responders. In the context of longitudinal cluster analyses, sample size and variability of the times of measurements are the main issues with the current methods. Here, we propose a new two-step method for the Clustering of Longitudinal data by using an Extended Baseline. The first step relies on a piecewise linear mixed model for repeated measurements with a treatment-time interaction. The second step clusters the random predictions and considers several parametric (model-based) and non-parametric (partitioning, ascendant hierarchical clustering) algorithms. A simulation study compares all options of the clustering of longitudinal data by using an extended baseline method with the latent-class mixed model. The clustering of longitudinal data by using an extended baseline method with the two model-based algorithms was the more robust model. The clustering of longitudinal data by using an extended baseline method with all the non-parametric algorithms failed when there were unequal variances of treatment effect between clusters or when the subgroups had unbalanced sample sizes. The latent-class mixed model failed when the between-patients slope variability is high. Two real data sets on neurodegenerative disease and on obesity illustrate the clustering of longitudinal data by using an extended baseline method and show how clustering may help to identify the marker(s) of the treatment response. The application of the clustering of longitudinal data by using an extended baseline method in exploratory analysis as the first stage before setting up stratified designs can provide a better estimation of treatment effect in future clinical trials. }

    abstract = { Many studies measure the same type of information longitudinally on the same subject at multiple time points, and clustering of such functional data has many important applications. We propose a novel and easy method to implement dissimilarity measure for functional data clustering based on smoothing splines and smoothing parameter commutation. This method handles data observed at regular or irregular time points in the same way. We measure the dissimilarity between subjects based on varying curve estimates with pairwise commutation of smoothing parameters. The intuition is that smoothing parameters of smoothing splines reflect the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratios and that when applying an identical smoothing parameter the smoothed curves for two similar subjects are expected to be close. Our method takes into account the estimation uncertainty using smoothing parameter commutation and is not strongly affected by outliers. It can also be used for outlier detection. The effectiveness of our proposal is shown by simulations comparing it to other dissimilarity measures and by a real application to methadone dosage maintenance levels. }

ABSTRACT = {Although there is a strong correlation between CAG repeat length and age at onset (AO) of motor symptoms, individual Huntington disease (HD) patients may differ dramatically in onset age and disease manifestations despite similar CAG repeat lengths.This has led to a search for genetic factors that influence AO.In order to identify such a genetic modifier, we analysed polymorphisms in the PGC-1alpha gene.Recent data indicate inhibition of PGC-1alpha function by mutant Htt supporting a link between transcriptional deregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in HD.In > 400 HD patients, a polymorphism located within intron 2, a potential recombination hot spot, explains a small, but statistically significant, amount of the variability in AO.Our data suggest that PGC-1alpha has modifying effects on the pathogenic process in HD.},

abstract ={Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a triplet (CAG) expansion mutation.The length of the triplet repeat is the most important factor in determining age of onset of HD, although substantial variability remains after controlling for repeat length.The Venezuelan HD kindreds encompass 18,149 individuals spanning 10 generations, 15,409 of whom are living.Of the 4,384 immortalized lymphocyte lines collected, 3,989 DNAs were genotyped for their HD alleles, representing a subset of the population at greatest genetic risk.There are 938 heterozygotes, 80 people with variably penetrant alleles, and 18 homozygotes.Analysis of the 83 kindreds that comprise the Venezuelan HD kindreds demonstrates that residual variability in age of onset has both genetic and environmental components.We created a residual age of onset phenotype from a regression analysis of the log of age of onset on repeat length.Familial correlations (correlation � SE) were estimated for sibling (0.40 � 0.09), parent-offspring (0.10 � 0.11), avuncular (0.07 � 0.11), and cousin (0.15 � 0.10) pairs, suggesting a familial origin for the residual variance in onset.By using a variance-components approach with all available familial relationships, the additive genetic heritability of this residual age of onset trait is 38\%.A model, including shared sibling environmental effects, estimated the components of additive genetic (0.37), shared environment (0.22), and nonshared environment (0.41) variances, confirming that �40\% of the variance remaining in onset age is attributable to genes other than the HD gene and 60\% is environmental.},

abstract = {Objective To estimate the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in individuals with mutations in the Parkin gene.Design We assessed point mutations and exon deletions and duplications in the Parkin gene in 247 probands with PD (age at onset 50 years) and 104 control probands enrolled in the Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease (GEPD) study.For each first-degree relative, a consensus diagnosis of PD was established.The probability that each relative carried a mutation was estimated from the proband's Parkin carrier status using Mendelian principles and from the relationship of the relative to the proband.Setting Tertiary care movement disorders center.Patients Cases, controls, and their first-degree relatives were enrolled in the GEPD study.Main Outcome Measures Estimated age-specific penetrance in first-degree relatives.Results Parkin mutations were identified in 25 probands with PD (10.1\%), 18 (72.0\%) of whom were heterozygotes.One Parkin homozygote was reported in 2 siblings with PD.The cumulative incidence of PD to age 65 years in carrier relatives (age-specific penetrance) was estimated to be 7.0\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.4\%-71.9\%), compared with 1.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.8\%-3.4\%) in noncarrier relatives of the cases (P = .59) and 1.1\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.3\%-3.4\%) in relatives of the controls (compared with noncarrier relatives, P = .52).Conclusions The cumulative risk of PD to age 65 years in a noncarrier relative of a case with an age at onset of 50 years or younger is not significantly greater than the general population risk among controls.Age-specific penetrance among Parkin carriers, in particular heterozygotes, deserves further study.

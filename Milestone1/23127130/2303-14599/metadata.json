    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove that if a $3$-dimensional quasi-projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>3$ has only log canonical singularities, then so does a general hyperplane section $H$ of $X$. We also show that the same is true for klt singularities, which is a slight extension of \\cite{ST20}. In the course of the proof, we provide a sufficient condition for log canonical (resp.~klt) surface singularities to be geometrically log canonical (resp.~geometrically klt) over a field.",

	abstract = {We summarize our experimental exploration of the capabilities of an ultrabroad-bandwidth plasmonic Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), in an intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) system for short-reach optical transmission up to 10 km. We study modulation, transmission, and reception of ultrahighsymbol-rate (up to 304 GBd) multi-level optical signals with two different signaling schemes: pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), with up to 8 amplitude levels and partial-response-encoded binary (polybinary) modulation with memory length up to 4. By mapping the performance to a concatenated soft-decision (SD) and harddecision (HD) forward error correction (FEC) coding scheme, a net bitrate of 363.4 Gbit/s is possible with PAM-8 signaling and 279.0 Gbit/s with tetrabinary (polybinary) signaling after 10 km standard single-mode ﬁber transmission. Considering an HD-only coding scheme, a net bitrate of 318.0 Gbit/s is possible with PAM-6 and 277.1 Gbit/s with tetrabinary.},

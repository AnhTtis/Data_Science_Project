	abstract = {An improved weighted decision-feedback equalizer (IWDFE) is adopted and experimentally demonstrated to mitigate chromatic dispersion (CD) induced power fading for C-band four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) system. Based on a compressed sigmoid nonlinear function, the IWDFE is superior to the conventional DFE, rule-1 and rule-2 based WDFEs in reducing both the error propagation probability and percentage of errors. The IWDFE is combined with a feed-forward equalizer (FFE) to deal with both pre-cursor and post-cursor interference simultaneously. We also introduce 2nd-order polynomial nonlinear terms in both FFE and IWDFE at receiver side, constructing a nonlinear FFE-IWDFE (N-FFE-IWDFE) to simultaneously equalize both the CD-induced power fading and nonlinear distortions. Experimental results show that compared with nonlinear FFE-DFE (N-FFE-DFE), rule-1 and rule-2 based nonlinear FFE-WDFEs (N-FFE-WDFEs), the N-FFE-IWDFE can significantly reduce the bit error ratio (BER), which is close to that of the error-propagation-free N-FFE-DFE. By utilizing the N-FFE-IWDFE, 120-Gb/s PAM-4 transmission system over 50-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) is realized with the BER below 7\% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) limit of 3.8 × 10−3, achieving around 1.1-dB improvement of the receiver sensitivity over the N-FFE-DFE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an IWDFE is employed for C-band IM/DD optical transmission system.},

Gray labelings are discussed and the original work by Frank Gray is analyzed. As is noted, the number of distinct Gray labelings that result in different bit-error probability grows rapidly with increasing constellation size. By introducing a recursive Gray labeling construction method called expansion, the paper answers the natural question of what labeling, among all possible constellation labelings, will give the lowest possible average probability of bit errors for the considered constellations. Under certain assumptions on the channel, the answer is that the labeling proposed by Gray, the binary reﬂected Gray code, is the optimal labeling for all three constellations, which has, surprisingly, never been proved before.},

	abstract = {We consider block transmission over the incoherent channel, whereby several symbols either launched consecutively in time, or in parallel over several diversity paths, are equally affected by common isotropic phase and additively corrupted by circularly Gaussian additive noise. Our novel approach toward transmission over such a vector incoherent channel (VIC) model is based on coherency matrix and generalized Stokes parameters (GSP) descriptions of optimal detection inspired by classical optical polarization theory, but further extended to the dual context of generic electrical, as well as optical, communication. The four classical real-valued parameters introduced into optics by Stokes in 1853 to characterize the state of polarization of an optical beam, extended to 2 GSP, underlie our new alternative novel description of maximum a posteriori/maximum-likelihood (MAP/ML) optimal detection over the VIC channel. The modulation formats of polarization-shift keying (POLSK), differential phase-shift keying, and amplitude-shift keying, as well as recent and novel combinations thereof, will all be seen to be equivalent to a new conceptual form of modulation called GSP-shift keying. Several forms of the optimal MAP/ML receiver for vector multienergy transmission are developed, generalizing the classical scalar incoherent receiver and the known POLSK receivers.},

We discuss the reasons for the fundamentally better performance of PCS over other constellation shaping techniques that also achieve rate adaptability, such as time-division hybrid modulation, and examine in detail the impact of sub-optimum shaping and forward error correction (FEC) on PCS systems. As performance metrics for systems with PCS, we compare information-theoretic measures such as mutual information (MI), generalized MI (GMI), and normalized GMI, which enable optimization and quantiﬁcation of the information rate (IR) that can be achieved by PCS and FEC. We derive the optimal parameters of PCS and FEC that maximize the IR for both ideal and non-ideal PCS and FEC. To avoid plausible pitfalls in practice, we carefully revisit key assumptions that are typically made for ideal PCS and FEC systems.},

It is shown that this is a limit (if at all) holding only for conventional detection strategies. Indeed, it should only be considered as a limit to the information rate that can be achieved with a given modulation/detection scheme. By virtue of some simple examples and theoretical results, it is also shown that, using the same approximated models commonly adopted for deriving the nonlinear Shannon limit, the information rate can be arbitrarily increased by increasing the input power. To this aim, the validity of some popular approximations to the output distribution is also examined to show that their application outside the scope for which they were devised can lead to pitfalls. To the best of our belief, the existence of a true nonlinear Shannon limit has still not been demonstrated, and the problem of determining the channel capacity of a ﬁberoptic system in the presence of Kerr nonlinearities is still an open issue.},

However, information theory also provides insights into how transmission resources should, in principle, best be exploited, and thus may serve as a guide for where to look for better ways to squeeze more out of a precious resource.

	abstract = {Constellation shaping is a practical and effective technique to improve the performance and the rate adaptivity of optical communication systems. In principle, it could also be used to mitigate the impact of nonlinear effects, possibly increasing the information rate beyond the current limit dictated by ﬁber nonlinearity. However, this appealing idea is frustrated by the difﬁculty of designing an effective shaping strategy that takes into account the nonlinearity and long memory of the ﬁber channel, as well as the possible interplay with other nonlinearity mitigation strategies. As a result, only little progress has been made so far, while the optimal shaping distribution and the ultimate channel capacity remain unknown. In this work, we describe a novel technique to optimize the shaping distribution in a very general setting and high-dimensional space. For a simpliﬁed block-memoryless nonlinear optical channel, the capacity lower bound obtained by the proposed technique can be expressed analytically, establishing the conditions for an unbounded growth of capacity with power. In a more realistic scenario, the technique can be implemented by a rejection sampling algorithm driven by a suitable cost function, and the corresponding achievable information rate estimated numerically. The combination of the proposed technique with an improved (non-Gaussian) decoding metric yields a new capacity lower bound for the dual-polarization WDM channel.},

	abstract = {Constellation shaping is a practical and effective technique to improve the performance and the rate adaptivity of optical communication systems. In principle, it could also be used to mitigate the impact of nonlinear effects, possibly increasing the information rate beyond the current limit dictated by ﬁber nonlinearity. However, this appealing idea is frustrated by the difﬁculty of designing an effective shaping strategy that takes into account the nonlinearity and long memory of the ﬁber channel, as well as the possible interplay with other nonlinearity mitigation strategies. As a result, only little progress has been made so far, while the optimal shaping distribution and the ultimate channel capacity remain unknown. In this work, we describe a novel technique to optimize the shaping distribution in a very general setting and high-dimensional space. For a simpliﬁed block-memoryless nonlinear optical channel, the capacity lower bound obtained by the proposed technique can be expressed analytically, establishing the conditions for an unbounded growth of capacity with power. In a more realistic scenario, the technique can be implemented by a rejection sampling algorithm driven by a suitable cost function, and the corresponding achievable information rate estimated numerically. The combination of the proposed technique with an improved (non-Gaussian) decoding metric yields a new capacity lower bound for the dual-polarization WDM channel.},

APSK constellations can be regarded as a union of phase-shift keying (PSK) signal sets with different amplitude levels. A practical two-stage (TS) detection scheme is analyzed, which performs close to optimal detection for high enough input power. We optimize APSK constellations with 4, 8, and 16 points in terms of symbol error probability (SEP) under TS detection for several combinations of input power and ﬁber length. For 16 points, performance gains of 3.2 dB can be achieved at a SEP of 10−2 compared to 16-QAM by choosing an optimized APSK constellation. We also demonstrate that in the presence of severe nonlinear distortions, it may become beneﬁcial to sacriﬁce a constellation point or an entire constellation ring to reduce the average SEP. Finally, we discuss the problem of selecting a good binary labeling for the found constellations.},

Space-division multiplexing (SDM) enhanced channel capacities in classical telecommunication and bears the potential to transfer the idea to quantum communication using current infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate an SDM of polarization-entangled photons over a 411m long 19-core multicore fiber distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs through up to 12 channels simultaneously. The quality of the multiplexed transfer is evidenced by high polarization visibility and CHSH Bell inequality violation for each pair of opposite cores. Our distribution scheme shows high stability over 24 hours without any active polarization stabilization and can be effortlessly adapted to a higher number of channels. This technique increases the quantum-channel capacity and allows the reliable implementation of quantum networks of multiple users based on a single entangled-photon pair source.},

Optical ﬁber ampliﬁers, wavelength division multiplexing, and coherent communications have all enabled discontinuous growth. Space division multiplexing is proposed as the next discontinuity. Here tens of modes rather than a single mode are utilized in the transmission. Random scattering due to index ﬂuctuations within the optical ﬁber cause coupling among the modal channels thereby degrading signal transmission. Principal mode transmission overcomes this limitation. Here a set of modes arrive localized at the ﬁber output unscattered. We review this methodology as it relates to optical communication capacity, but also as it relates to light localization.

	abstract = {Probabilistic constellation shaping is investigated in the context of nonlinear ﬁber optic communication channels. Based on a general framework, different link types are considered—1. dispersion-managed channels, 2. unrepeatered transmission channels and 3. ideal distributed Raman ampliﬁed channels. These channels exhibit nonlinear effects to a degree that conventional probabilistic constellation shaping strategies for the additive white Gaussian (AWGN) noise channel are suboptimal. A channel-agnostic optimization strategy is used to optimize the constellation probability mass functions (PMFs) for the channels in use. Optimized PMFs are obtained, which balance the effects of additive ampliﬁed spontaneous emission noise and nonlinear interference. The obtained PMFs cannot be modeled by the conventional Maxwell-Boltzmann PMFs and outperform optimal choices of these in all the investigated channels. Suboptimal choices of constellation shapes are associated with increased nonlinear effects in the form of non-Gaussian noise. For dispersion-managed channels, a reach gain in 2 spans is seen and across the three channel types, gains of {\textgreater}0.1 bits/symbol over unshaped quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) are seen using channel-optimized probablistic shaping.},

	abstract = {M-ary pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) meets the requirements of data center communication because of its simplicity, but coarse entropy granularity cannot meet the dynamic bandwidth demands, and there is a large capacity gap between uniform formats and the Shannon limit. The dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) system is widely used to increase the channel capacity, but low spectral eﬃciency of the intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) solution restricts the throughput of the modern DWDM data center networks. Probabilistic shaping distribution is a good candidate to oﬀer us a ﬁne entropy granularity and eﬃciently reduce the gap to the Shannon limit, and Nyquist pulse shaping is widely used to increase the spectral eﬃciency. We aim toward the joint usage of probabilistic shaping and Nyquist pulse shaping with low-density parity-check (LDPC) coding to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of 8-PAM signal transmission. We optimized the code rate of the LDPC code and compared diﬀerent Nyquist pulse shaping parameters using simulations and experiments. We achieved a 0.43 dB gain using Nyquist pulse shaping, and a 1.1 dB gain using probabilistic shaping, while the joint use of probabilistic shaping and Nyquist pulse shaping achieved a 1.27 dB gain, which oﬀers an excellent improvement without upgrading the transceivers.},

Part 1 reviews fundamental concepts of digital communications and information theory. We treat digitization and modulation followed by information theory for channels both without and with memory. We provide explicit relationships between the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio and the optical signal-to-noise ratio. We further evaluate the performance of modulation constellations such as quadrature-amplitude modulation, combinations of amplitude-shift keying and phase-shift keying, exotic constellations, and concentric rings for an additive white Gaussian noise channel using coherent detection. Part 2 is devoted speciﬁcally to the ‘‘ﬁber channel.’’ We review the physical phenomena present in transmission over optical ﬁber networks, including sources of noise, the need for optical ﬁltering in optically-routed networks, and, most critically, the presence of ﬁber Kerr nonlinearity. We describe various transmission scenarios and impairment mitigation techniques, and deﬁne a ﬁber channel deemed to be the most relevant for communication over optically-routed networks. We proceed to evaluate a capacity limit estimate for this ﬁber channel using ring constellations. Several scenarios are considered, including uniform and optimized ring constellations, different ﬁber dispersion maps, and varying transmission distances. We further present evidences that point to the physical origin of the ﬁber capacity limitations and provide a comparison of recent record experiments with our capacity limit estimation.},

In particular for uniformly geometric-shaped constellation, the pre-FEC Q-factor is highly correlated with GMI though the correlation is reduced at lower FEC coding rate. Furthermore, GMI can be used to design optimized constellation together with generalized pairwise optimization algorithm to mitigate the GMI loss in non-Graymapped constellation. The GMI-optimized 32QAM (opt32) shows ∼0.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement between 3 and 4 b/s GMI in both simulated and experimental results. Optimized two-dimensional 8 QAM is also designed to show the consistent GMI improvement over multi-dimensional 8 QAM-equivalent formats.

	abstract = {Advanced channel decoders rely on soft-decision decoder inputs for which mutual information (MI) is the natural ﬁgure of merit. In this paper, we analyze an optical ﬁber system by evaluating MI as the maximum achievable rate of transmission of such a system. MI is estimated by means of histograms for which the correct bin number is determined in a blind way. The MI estimate obtained this way shows excellent accuracy in comparison with the true MI of 16-state quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over an additive white Gaussian noise channel with additional phase noise, which is a simpliﬁed model of a nonlinear optical ﬁber channel. We thereby justify to use the MI estimation method to accurately estimate the MI of an optical ﬁber system. In the second part of this work, a transoceanic ﬁber system with 6000 km of standard single-mode ﬁber is simulated and its MI determined. Among rectangular QAMs, 16-QAM is found to be the optimal modulation scheme for this link as to performance in terms of MI and requirements on components and digital signal processing. For the reported MI of 3.1 bits/symbol, a minimum coding overhead of 29\% is required when the channel memory is not taken into account. By employing ideal single-channel digital back-propagation, an increase in MI by 0.25 bits/symbol and 0.28 bits/symbol is reported for 16-QAM and 64-QAM, respectively, lowering the required overhead to 19\% and 16\%. When the channel spacing is decreased to be close to the Nyquist rate, the dual-polarization spectral efﬁciency is 5.7 bits/s/Hz, an increase of more than 2 bits/symbol compared to a 50 GHz spacing.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a machine learning-based tunable optical-digital signal processor is demonstrated for a short-reach optical communication system. The effect of ﬁber chromatic dispersion after square-law detection is mitigated using a hybrid structure, which shares the complexity between the optical and the digital domain. The optical part mitigates the chromatic dispersion by slicing the signal into small sub-bands and delaying them accordingly, before regrouping the signal again. The optimal delay is calculated in each scenario to minimize the bit error rate. The digital part is a nonlinear equalizer based on a neural network. The results are analyzed in terms of signal-to-noise penalty at the KP4 forward error correction threshold. The penalty is calculated with respect to a back-to-back transmission without equalization. Considering 32 GBd transmission and 0 dB penalty, the proposed hybrid solution shows chromatic dispersion mitigation up to 200 ps/nm (12 km of equivalent standard single-mode ﬁber length) for stage 1 of the hybrid module and roughly double for the second stage. A simpliﬁed version of the optical module is demonstrated with an approximated 1.5 dB penalty compared to the complete two-stage hybrid module. Chromatic dispersion tolerance for a ﬁxed optical structure and a simpler conﬁguration of the nonlinear equalizer is also investigated.},

	abstract = {In the framework of high-data-rate free-space optical low Earth orbit satellite-to-ground communication, we investigate, by means of a reﬁned end-to-end numerical model of the link, the performance of a coherent receiver that combines an adaptive optics system and a speciﬁc digital receiver architecture. The design of a ﬁne carrier recovery stage based on a phase-locked loop is presented and its performance is characterized. The end-to-end model includes the impact of atmospheric turbulence, adaptive optics correction, laser phase noise and of the frequency mismatch between the transmit and receiver lasers. The results show that adaptive optics coupled with classical digital phase-locked loop techniques can provide a reliable solution to the problem of carrier frequency and phase tracking in coherent satellite-to-ground optical links, after prior coarse frequency estimation. The phase-locked loop converges after a few hundreds of microseconds and accurately tracks the phase ﬂuctuations. The residual amplitude ﬂuctuations and laser phase noise are shown to be the dominant impairments for the link performance.},

	abstract = {Grassmannian quantization codebooks play a central role in a number of limited feedback schemes for single and multi-user MIMO communication systems. In practice, it is often desirable that these codebooks possess additional properties that facilitate their implementation, beyond the provision of good quantization performance. Although some good codebooks exist, their design tends to be a rather intricate task. The goal of this paper is to suggest a ﬂexible approach to the design of Grassmannian codebooks based on smooth optimization algorithms for the Grassmannian manifold and the use of smooth penalty functions to obtain additional desirable properties. As one example, rank-2 codebooks with a nested structure and elements from a discrete alphabet are designed. In some numerical comparisons, codebooks designed using the proposed approach have better Fubini-Study distance properties than some existing codebooks, and provide tangible performance gains when applied to a simple MIMO downlink scenario with zero-forcing beamforming, PU2RC, and block diagonalization signalling. Furthermore, the proposed approach yields codebooks that attain desirable additional properties without incurring a substantial degradation in performance.},

	abstract = {Transmit beamforming and receive combining are simple methods for exploiting the significant diversity that is available in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. Unfortunately, optimal performance requires either complete channel knowledge or knowledge of the optimal beamforming vector; both are hard to realize. In this correspondence, a quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beamforming technique is proposed where the receiver only sends the label of the best beamforming vector in a predetermined codebook to the transmitter. By using the distribution of the optimal beamforming vector in independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading matrix channels, the codebook design problem is solved and related to the problem of Grassmannian line packing. The proposed design criterion is flexible enough to allow for side constraints on the codebook vectors. Bounds on the codebook size are derived to guarantee full diversity order. Results on the density of Grassmannian line packings are derived and used to develop bounds on the codebook size given a capacity or SNR loss. Monte Carlo simulations are presented that compare the probability of error for different quantization strategies.},

Rayleigh fading channels are ﬁrst considered. The rate-distortion function of the vector source is upper-bounded, and the operational rate-distortion performance achieved by the generalized Lloyd’s algorithm is lower-bounded. Although different in nature, the two bounds yield asymptotically equivalent performance analysis results. The average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance is also quantiﬁed. Finally, beamformer codebook designs are studied for correlated Rayleigh fading channels, and a low-complexity codebook design that achieves near-optimal performance is derived.},

We investigate receiver sensitivity improvements achievable using semiconductor optical ampliﬁers (SOAs) or avalanche photodiodes (APDs). We analyze and simulate the impact of modulator bandwidth limitations and chirp, ﬁber dispersion, transient SOA gain saturation, excess shot noise, and intersymbol interference caused by the APD. Using the 4-PAM and linear equalization, an SOA with 20-dB ﬁber-to-ﬁber gain and 6-dB noise ﬁgure can improve the receiver sensitivity up to 6 dB over a thermal noiselimited receiver, whereas an APD with kA = 0.18 and responsivity R = 0.74 A/W provides 4.5-dB sensitivity improvement over the same reference system. We further present a simple algorithm to optimize the intensity levels and decision thresholds for a generic non-Gaussian noise distribution, which can provide an additional sensitivity improvement of 1–2 dB. For SOAs, transient gain saturation effects cause negligible sensitivity penalties, but limit the receiver dynamic range to about 15 dB for the worst case of single-wavelength pre-ampliﬁcation. For APDs, we show that the APD responsivity, impact ionization factor, low-gain bandwidth, and gain-bandwidth product are all critical parameters governing the system performance.},

These channels exhibit nonlinear effects to a degree that conventional probabilistic constellation shaping strategies for the additive white Gaussian (AWGN) noise channel are suboptimal. A channel-agnostic optimization strategy is used to optimize the constellation probability mass functions (PMFs) for the channels in use. Optimized PMFs are obtained, which balance the effects of additive ampliﬁed spontaneous emission noise and nonlinear interference. The obtained PMFs cannot be modeled by the conventional Maxwell-Boltzmann PMFs and outperform optimal choices of these in all the investigated channels. Suboptimal choices of constellation shapes are associated with increased nonlinear effects in the form of non-Gaussian noise. For dispersion-managed channels, a reach gain in 2 spans is seen and across the three channel types, gains of {\textgreater}0.1 bits/symbol over unshaped quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) are seen using channel-optimized probablistic shaping.},

	abstract = {Different aspects of probabilistic shaping for a multi-span optical communication system are studied. First, a numerical analysis of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel investigates the effect of using a small number of input probability mass functions (PMFs) for a range of signalto-noise ratios (SNRs), instead of optimizing the constellation shaping for each SNR. It is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1 dB SNR to the full shaping gain is acceptable, just two shaped PMFs are required per quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a large SNR range. For a multi-span wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical ﬁber system with 64QAM input, it is shown that just one PMF is required to achieve large gains over uniform input for distances from 1,400 km to 3,000 km. Using recently developed theoretical models that extend the Gaussian noise (GN) model and fullﬁeld split-step simulations, we illustrate the ramiﬁcations of probabilistic shaping on the effective SNR after ﬁber propagation. Our results show that, for a ﬁxed average optical launch power, a shaping gain is obtained for the noise contributions from ﬁber ampliﬁers and modulation-independent nonlinear interference (NLI), whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads to an increased NLI. However, this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a relatively minor impact, and optimizing the shaped PMF with a modulation-dependent GN model conﬁrms that the PMF found for AWGN is also a good choice for a multispan ﬁber system.},

For asymptotically large blocklengths, constant composition distribution matching (CCDM) is known to generate the target capacity-achieving distribution. However, as the blocklength decreases, the resulting rate loss diminishes the efﬁciency of CCDM. We claim that for such short blocklengths over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the objective of shaping should be reformulated as obtaining the most energy-efﬁcient signal space for a given rate (rather than matching distributions). In light of this interpretation, multiset-partition DM (MPDM) and SpSh are reviewed as energy-efﬁcient shaping techniques. Numerical results show that both have smaller rate losses than CCDM. SpSh—whose sole objective is to maximize the energy efﬁciency—is shown to have the minimum rate loss amongst all, which is particularly apparent for ultra short blocklengths. We provide simulation results of the end-to-end decoding performance showing that up to 1 dB improvement in power efﬁciency over uniform signaling can be obtained with MPDM and SpSh at blocklengths around 200. Finally, we present a discussion on the complexity of these algorithms from the perspectives of latency, storage and computations.},

	abstract = {We review probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS), which has been a key enabler for several recent record-setting optical ﬁber communications experiments. PCS provides both ﬁnegrained rate adaptability and energy efﬁciency (sensitivity) gains. We discuss the reasons for the fundamentally better performance of PCS over other constellation shaping techniques that also achieve rate adaptability, such as time-division hybrid modulation, and examine in detail the impact of sub-optimum shaping and forward error correction (FEC) on PCS systems. As performance metrics for systems with PCS, we compare information-theoretic measures such as mutual information (MI), generalized MI (GMI), and normalized GMI, which enable optimization and quantiﬁcation of the information rate (IR) that can be achieved by PCS and FEC. We derive the optimal parameters of PCS and FEC that maximize the IR for both ideal and non-ideal PCS and FEC. To avoid plausible pitfalls in practice, we carefully revisit key assumptions that are typically made for ideal PCS and FEC systems.},

The supermodes exploit coupling between the cores of a multi-core fiber, in which the core-to-core distance is much shorter than that in conventional multi-core fiber. The use of supermodes leads to a larger mode effective area and higher mode density than the conventional multi-core fiber. Through simulations, we show that the proposed coupled multi-core fiber allows lower modal dependent loss, mode coupling and differential modal group delay than few-mode fibers. These properties suggest that the coupled multi-core fiber could be a good candidate for both spatial division multiplexing and single-mode operation.},

The SMD was observed to be proportional to the ﬁber bend curvature, i.e., inversely proportional to the bend radius, and the SMD of 3.14 ± 0.17 ps/Ýkm was measured at the bending radius of ∼31 cm. By assuming the 3.14-ps/Ýkm SMD accumulation, the tap count of the multiple-input multiple-output digital signal processing for the crosstalk compensation is estimated to be only 63 taps for covering 99.99\% power of the impulse response after 10 000-km propagation when the 25-GBaud (50-GHz sampling) is assumed.

Most conventional phase retrieval methods have used iterative processes to recover phase information; however, the calculation speed and convergence with these methods are serious issues in real-time monitoring applications. Machinelearning-based methods are promising for addressing these issues. Here, we numerically compare conventional methods and a machine-learning-based method in which a convolutional neural network is employed. Simulations with several conditions show that the machine-learning-based method realizes fast and robust phase recovery compared with the conventional methods. We also numerically demonstrate machine-learning-based phase retrieval from noisy measurements with a noisy training data set for improving the noise robustness.

	abstract = {DSP-enhanced intensity-modulation direct-detection (IM/DD) systems can support up to 56 Gb/s over 100 km signal transmissions at C-band. To achieve higher data rates and longer transmission distances, we propose data-aided iterative algorithm (DIA) and decision-directed DIA (DD-DIA) to digitally mitigate signal-signal beating interference (SSBI) without requiring any modiﬁcations to physical layer structures. DIA utilizes pilot symbols with uniformly spaced insertions to relax the modiﬁed Gerchberg-Saxton (G-S) algorithms that suffer from the local optimum problem. To further improve the symbol error rate (SER) performance and convergence speed, DD-DIA introduces a decision process to generate pseudo-pilots. We numerically compare DIA with other algorithms and ﬁnd that DIA can recover signals subject to large ﬁber dispersions corresponding to which conventional IA and Volterra ﬁlter (VF) fail, while DD-DIA signiﬁcantly accelerates the convergence speed and improves the reconstruction performance compared with DIA, it can support 100-Gb/s PAM4 over 400-km IM/DD transmissions within just 50 iterations. Two orders of magnitude reductions in SER is observed for 100 Gb/s PAM4 signal transmission over 100-km SSMFs. Compared with conventional IA, the proposed techniques have higher convergence speeds, better global optimum features and large tolerances to physical model errors. In particular, DD-DIA results in larger optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR)/ received optical power (ROP) improvement, higher transmission capacities and less computational complexity. DD-DIA is a promising algorithm for efﬁciently reconstructing 2-dimensional optical ﬁeld for conventional IM/DD optical transmission systems.},

The phase retrieval is achieved by solving the temporal transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). The TIE is solved by the use of Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Required carrier power added to the signal is examined and it is shown that carrier power larger by 2 to 3 dB than that needed in the Kramers–Kronig receiver. The carrier can be located inside the signal spectrum, lifting the condition that the signal needs to be single-sideband with tightly conﬁned spectrum. The noise immunity in solving the TIE, which will be an issue in practical usage of the scheme, is also discussed.},

We consider two different orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques: DC-biased OFDM (DC-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM). We also consider two different techniques for bit loading and power allocation: ﬁxed bit loading with preemphasis and optimized bit loading and power allocation. We ﬁrst present a semianalytical performance and complexity evaluation of these OFDM methods including the effects of linear ﬁltering, clipping, and quantization. We then include the effects of chromatic dispersion and chirp, as well as intensity and shot noises. Performance is quantiﬁed in terms of the required average optical power to achieve a target bit-error probability for a given modulator bandwidth. Complexity is quantiﬁed in terms of the resolution and sampling rate required of digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters, as well as the number of signal processing operations required. For each OFDM technique, we adjust the clipping ratio to minimize the optical power requirement. For DC-OFDM, taking into account the DAC frequency response reduces the optical power requirement up to 2 dB. ACO-OFDM is more power efﬁcient and requires lower DAC/ADC resolution than DC-OFDM, but ACO-OFDM requires prohibitively high sampling rates owing to its poor spectral efﬁciency.},

Although power consumption can be reduced by co-packaging optical transceivers with electrical switches and employing optical switching, both approaches increase losses, further compressing link budgets. Local oscillator-based coherent receivers traditionally employed for long-haul systems provide a path to higher bit rates and improved link budgets, but their power consumption is excessive owing to high-speed digital signal processing (DSP). We discuss alternative designs for coherent receivers, such as DSP-free coherent receivers and Kramers–Kronig (KK) receivers.

We propose a novel optical polarization demultiplexing technique, for DP-QPSK and higher-order modulation formats, with three cascaded phase shifters driven by marker tone detection circuitry. We consider carrier recovery based on either optical or electrical phase-locked loops (PLLs). We propose a novel multiplier-free phase detector based on XOR gates, which exhibits less than 0.5 dB power penalty relative to a conventional Costas loop phase detector. We also study the relative performance of homodyne DP-differential QPSK, for which carrier phase recovery is unnecessary. Our proposed DSP-free architectures exhibit ∼1 dB power penalty at small chromatic dispersion compared to their DSP-based counterparts. We estimate conservatively that the high-speed analog electronics of an electrical PLL-based coherent receiver consume nearly 4 W for 200 Gbit/s DP-QPSK, assuming a 90-nm complementary metaloxide semiconductor process.},

	abstract = {To overcome power fading induced by chromatic dispersion in optical ﬁber communications, optical ﬁeld recovery is a promising solution for direct detection short-reach applications, such as fast-evolving data center interconnects (DCIs). To date, various direct detection schemes capable of optical ﬁeld recovery have been proposed, including Kramers −Kronig (KK) and signal−signal beat interference (SSBI) iterative cancellation (IC) receivers. However, they are all restricted to the single sideband (SSB) modulation format, thus conspicuously losing half of the electrical spectral efﬁciency (SE) compared with double sideband (DSB) modulation. Additionally, SSB suffers from the noise folding issue, requiring a precise optical ﬁlter that complicates the receiver design. As such, it is highly desirable to investigate the ﬁeld recovery of DSB signals via direct detection. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, we propose a novel receiver scheme called carrier-assisted differential detection (CADD) to realize optical ﬁeld recovery of complex-valued DSB signals via direct detection. First, CADD doubles the electrical SE compared with the KK and SSBI IC receivers by adopting DSB modulation without sacriﬁcing receiver sensitivities. Furthermore, by using direct detection without needing a precise receiver optical ﬁlter, CADD can employ cost-effective uncooled lasers as opposed to expensive temperature-controlled lasers in coherent systems. Our proposed receiver architecture opens a new class of direct detection schemes that are suitable for photonic integration analogous to homodyne receivers in coherent detection.},

We show that the Kramers–Kronig receiver performance strongly depends on details of the system design. Unnecessarily broad optical ﬁlters decrease the reception quality, because additional noise makes the violation of the minimum-phase condition more likely. Narrow optical ﬁlters, however, impose high local oscillator laser stability and reduce the ﬂexibility of this kind of receiver architecture. Further, we demonstrate Kramers–Kronig reception of 16 QAM signals at a net data rate of 267 Gbit/s after transmission over 300 km of standard single-mode ﬁber. We compare the performance with a conventional intradyne receiver. In a back-to-back setting, we increase the net data rate to 300 Gbit/s.},

We also show a possibility to achieve around 1 km dispersion uncompensated transmission with a simple decision feedback equalizer (DFE) for a 100 Gbaud OOK, PAM4, and eight-level PAM (PAM8) link having the received power penalty of around 1 dB.},

To achieve higher data rate, high-order partial response (PR) signaling is utilized to narrow the signal bandwidth below the Nyquist frequency of digital-to-analog converter (DAC) sampling rate. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate ultra-high speed optical interconnects based on a conventional silicon photonic traveling-wave Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) with a 3-dB bandwidth of 28.5 GHz. By applying PR narrowing and digital anti-aliasing brick-wall filter that serves to avoid spectral overlap, up to 190Gbaud OOK signal is generated using a 120GSa/s DAC with a sampling ratio as low as 0.63. Furthermore, a 180Gbaud OOK signal is generated and transmitted over 500 m standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) below 20\% hard-decision forward error-correction (HD-FEC) threshold of 1.5 × 10−2.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the technology to narrow the gap between the achievable information rate and the Shannon capacity limits attracts increasing attention. In this paper, a probabilistic shaping coding method based on multirepeat mapping is proposed. By applying block coding to the information sequences with our method, we transform the modulated constellation points from a uniform distribution to the desired distribution. Rate adaption and controllable distribution are achieved by adjusting the block length and the size of different mapping sets. The proposed algorithm has better coding efficiency, low storage and computational complexity, so is more suitable for data center optical networks. An experiment that demonstrates probabilistically shaped data transmission is successfully conducted over 10 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation – discrete multi-tone (16-QAM-DMT). We evaluate our method for a set of code rates, i.e., 16 QAM with code rate 6/8, 7/8 and 9/12. The experimental results show that the improved signal to noise ratios (SNR) can be up to 1.1 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 10-3 after using the proposed method for probabilistic shaping.},

Since direct detection (DD) provides a costefficient solution for short-reach interconnects, various advanced modulation formats have been intensively studied to improve the performance of DD for high-performance short-reach optical interconnects. In this paper, we report the recent progress on the advanced DD modulation formats that provide superior electrical spectral efficiency (SE) and transmission reach beyond that of simple direct modulation (DM) based direct detection (DM/DD). We first provide a review of the current advanced modulation formats for high-performance short-reach optical interconnects. Among these formats, Stokes vector direct detection (SVDD) achieves the highest electrical spectrum efficiency, presenting itself as a promising candidate for future short-reach networks. We then expound some novel algorithms to achieve high-performance SV-DD systems under severe impairments of either polarization mode dispersion (PMD) or polarization dependent loss (PDL).},

	abstract = {Due to the growing demand for cloud services with high availability, high connection speed and low latency, distributed data-centers have emerged as a key architecture for future optical networks. This architecture relies on power and cost-efﬁcient solutions for 400 Gb/s client interfaces over distances up to 80 km which can be densely wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) in the C-band. Recently, single side band (SSB) direct detection (DD) has been considered as an attractive transmission scheme for achieving data rates beyond 100 Gb/s per channel due to its capability of electronic dispersion compensation. However, as SSB DD schemes utilize only a single polarization for data transmission, achieving 400 Gb/s per channel requires a baudrate beyond 80 Gbaud, which might reduce the effectiveness of the commonly used signal-signal beat interference (SSBI) cancellation techniques such as iterative SSBI cancellation or Kramers-Kronig algorithm due to the imperfection of Tx drivers, modulator and Rx front-end. In this paper, through effective Tx calibration and Rx DSP, we have achieved for the ﬁrst time a net data rate per channel above 400 Gb/s with a 64 QAM signal at 85 Gbaud using a single photodetector (PD) at the receiver. In addition, a WDM transmission consisting of 5 channels at 100 GHz spacing was successfully conducted. This result indicates that SSB DD is an effective transmission technique for high capacity data center interconnect (DCI) applications.},

Over the past decade, coherent optics has moved beyond its long-haul application origins and is now firmly entrenched in metro networks. 2020 marked the 10th anniversary of digital coherent optical technology being officially deployed in service providers’ networks. Further development in CMOS processing, design simplification, and cost reduction of opto-electronic components, and the need for more efficient optical transport technologies have been factors driving coherent solutions into new market applications, specifically short-haul applications in edge and access networks. This migration model has been demonstrated in the optical industry before: the DWDM system technology started in long haul and subsequently migrating to metro and edge access; forward error correction encoding and decoding followed the same pattern. Benefiting from initial long-haul technology development, coherent optics for access networks is poised to follow the same natural progression.},

We experimentally demonstrate that the receiver sensitivity of 400-Gb/s D8QAM is insensitive to the laser type, and is the same as 400-Gb/s 16QAM in the case of 2-km transmission with a distributed feedback (DFB) laser. The proposed adaptive equalizer (AEQ) using real-valued finite impulse response (FIR) filters and shorter tap lengths for the real-imaginary filters allows hardware-efficient implementation with high robustness to the receiver-side timing skew. In the case of 400-Gb/s D8QAM 10-km transmission, our AEQ achieves comparable performance as conventional 4×4 real-valued multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and the existing simplified AEQs with complexity reduction of 50\% and 14\% respectively.},

	abstract = {We propose a DSP-free coherent-lite system that requires neither high-speed DSP nor high-resolution signal converters for deployment inside datacenters over single mode fiber links with reaches of 10 km and less. The removal of converters and DSP, in which some subsystems are fundamental for successful coherent detection, is enabled by either replacing DSP subsystems with optics having equivalent functions or by re-engineering the system. We validate in a proof-of-concept experiment the proposed DSP-free system using 50 Gbaud DP-16QAM delivering 400 Gb/s over 10 km of single mode fiber (SMF) below the KP4 forward error correction (FEC) threshold of 2.2 × 10−4. In addition, we perform a detailed experimental parametric study of the coherent-lite system in which various system parameters are swept such as baud rate, reach, laser power and laser linewidth. Our results verify that the coherent-lite system can be realized using low-cost DFB lasers with linewidths of a few hundred kHz. Moreover, we compare the performance of the coherent-lite system with that of a conventional coherent transceiver leveraging the full DSP stack. Then, we evaluate the power consumption savings achieved by the coherent-lite scheme relative to a classic DSP-based coherent system. Assuming a CMOS node ranging from 28 to 7 nm for DSP implementation, our estimate shows that the coherent-lite scheme can save 95 to 78\% of the power consumed by the following subsystems: analog-to-digital converters, chromatic dispersion compensation, 2 × 2 MIMO polarization demultiplexing and carrier recovery. Finally, we compare the power consumption of the coherent-lite scheme with more standard 400G IM-DD systems utilizing either eight or four parallel WDM lanes (8 × 50G and 4 × 100G). The coherent-lite system is found to have similar module power consumption requirements as a corresponding 4 × 100G IM-DD system while bringing the benefits of coherent detection including improved sensitivity and higher spectral efficiency leading to fewer light sources per transceiver module. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first experimental demonstration of a DSP-free coherent-lite system for single channel 400G datacenter 10 km interconnects, a potential attractive solution due to its scalability to future 800G and 1.6T intra-datacenter optical interconnects.},

In this paper, we present a detailed investigation on the performance of three advanced modulation formats for 100 Gb/s short reach transmission system. They are PAM-4, CAP-16 and DMT. The detailed digital signal processing required for each modulation format is presented. Comprehensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of each modulation format in terms of received optical power, transmitter bandwidth, relative intensity noise and thermal noise. The performance of each modulation format is also experimentally studied. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first demonstration of a 112 Gb/s transmission over 10km of SSMF employing single band CAP-16 with EML. Finally, a comparison of computational complexity of DSP for the three formats is presented.},

	abstract = {For decades, advanced modulation techniques have been proposed to increase the capacity for intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) optical fiber interconnection systems. Typically, the frequency-resolved discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation was proposed by loading modulations with different bit numbers to fit the channel’s frequency response. Capacity can thus be better improved through finer use of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) distribution in the frequency domain. For conventional DMT, the constellations loaded on individual subcarriers are all equip probability distributed. In this work, we propose a probabilistically shaped DMT (PS-DMT) modulation with adaptively loaded entropies referring to channel frequency response for short-reach optical interconnects. Achievable information rate (AIR) improvements of PS-DMT with both Maxwell-Boltzmann and dyadic distribution are investigated based on generalized mutual information (GMI). Moreover, the proposed PS-DMT has been realized experimentally over a multimode optical link using vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) with 100-m-long multimode fiber (MMF) transmission. This method can significantly improve the signaling capacity since two significant benefits are simultaneously utilized: 1) the shaping gain of PS at limited SNR condition and 2) the frequency-resolved continuous entropy loading for better fitting to the channel frequency response. Improved capacity, in terms of AIR, can thus be expected for a practical channel when using PS-DMT. This method can potentially be extended to a wide range of application scenarios, including both multimode and single-mode IM-DD fiber-optic communications.},

It realizes spectrally efﬁcient faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) format. In our scheme, the coefﬁcients of the THP precoder are obtained by numerical simulations with an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, in which the intersymbol interference (ISI) is induced by a digital FTN ﬁlter. Then, we experimentally apply these THP coefﬁcients at the transmitter to mitigate the FTN-related ISI, while the ISI from the analog channel is suppressed by the receiver-side adaptive equalizer. By this means, the experimental estimation of the THP coefﬁcients is not required, leading to a simpliﬁed system operation. We perform numerical simulations to study the impacts of FTN signaling and channel bandwidth limitation on the proposed THP scheme. A proof-of-concept experiment is conducted, in which a 28-GBaud FTN single-sideband (SSB) 16-QAM signal is transmitted over an 80-km single mode ﬁber (SMF). Compared to the conventional scheme with the experimentally estimated THP coefﬁcients, a negligible sensitivity penalty is observed for the proposed scheme. We also achieve a record FTN rate of 21.73\% and a high spectral efﬁciency of 4.30 b/s/Hz for the single-polarization 16-QAM format on a single wavelength.},

	abstract = {High-speed interconnects are highly demanded in data centers and high-performance computing, and the use of optical interconnects to replace electrical interconnects has been proposed and widely studied. For medium-range board-to-board communications, free-space based optical interconnects provide the additional advantage of reconﬁgurability and ﬂexibility, compared with traditional waveguide or ﬁber-based counterparts. However, the bit rate and interconnection range in free-space optical interconnects are typically limited. In this paper, we propose a carrierless-amplitude-phase (CAP) modulated and space-time coded free-space optical interconnect scheme to overcome these limitations. Up to 80 Gb/s (2 × 40 Gb/s) interconnection with reconﬁgurability and ﬂexibility is experimentally demonstrated for a maximum error-free distance exceeding 50 cm, showing about 65\% improvement over previous demonstrations. The receiver sensitivity of the space-time coded system is measured as well, and results show that the space-time-block code (STBC) is capable of improving the receiver sensitivity and suppressing the inter-channel crosstalk. The impact of air turbulence, which exists in typical interconnect environments, is also experimentally investigated and results show that its impact on the proposed scheme is negligible. The proposed reconﬁgurable free-space optical interconnects with CAP and STBC can be further scaled up to provide higher speed and further extended interconnection range.},

To achieve higher data rate, Tomlinson–Harashima precoding (THP) is adopted to increase the operating symbol rate beyond the Nyquist rate deﬁned by the system bandwidth. By applying THP, the signal is precoded by a feedback ﬁlter at the transmitter for the mitigation of the intersymbol interference caused by the faster-than-Nyquist signaling and the spectral power fading induced by the interaction of chromatic dispersion and direct detection. In this paper, high-performance THP-based IM/DD transmission is demonstrated, increasing the achievable data rate using a limited system bandwidth. In the experimental demonstration, we achieve a net bit rate of 185 Gb/s for up to 2-km ﬁber link, transmitting 74 GBd precoded eight-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-8) using an IM/DD system with 33 GHz brick-wall electrical bandwidth limitation.},

The limitations imposed by inter-core crosstalk (ICXT) on the performance of 112 Gb/s up to 80 km-long optically ampliﬁed PAM4 inter-DCI links with intensity-modulation and direct-detection and full chromatic dispersion compensation in the optical domain are analyzed through numerical simulation for high and low skew-symbol rate product (SSRP). With only one interfering core, we show that those PAM4 inter-DCI links achieve an outage probability (OP) of 10−4 with a maximum ICXT level of −13.9 dB for high SSRP and require an ICXT level reduction of about 8.1 dB to achieve the same OP for low SSRP. Due to using full dispersion compensation, for an OP of 10−4, the maximum acceptable ICXT level shows only a 1.4 dB variation with the MCF length increase from 10 km to 80 km. When considering the ICXT induced by several interfering cores, the maximum ICXT level per interfering core for an OP of 10−4 decreases around 3 dB when doubling the number of interfering cores. This conclusion holds for high and low SSRP regimes. For two interfering cores, we show that a single interfering core with low SSRP is enough to induce a severe reduction of the maximum acceptable ICXT level.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a polar coded probabilistic shaping (PS) 8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM8) based on many-to-one (MTO) mapping is investigated for short-reach optical interconnection. By ingeniously assigning parity bits to ambiguities positions, no extra PS redundancy and no complex distribution matcher are required in the scheme comparing to traditional probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS). The noise distributions after different transmission distances are studied and an optimal clock recovery method for PS signal is proposed to degrade the impact of severe eye skew effect on BER performance. The experimental results show that up to 1.2 dB and 0.8 dB shaping gains are respectively achieved over back-to-back (BTB) and 2-km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) transmission. With the help of the proposed optimal clock recovery method in the PS scheme, the shaping gain is improved from 0.15 dB to 0.4 dB after 10-km transmission. Moreover, compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the polar coded PS-PAM8 can provide an additional coding gain of 2.2 dB with code length of 256, which proves the performance superiority of polar code in short code length. Therefore, the proposed polar coded PS-PAM8 with low complexity and satisfactory BER performance is believed to be an alternative solution for the cost-sensitive short-reach optical interconnection.},

	abstract = {We propose a polarization dependent loss (PDL) and chromatic dispersion (CD) insensitive, low-complexity adaptive equalizer (AEQ) for short-reach coherent optical transmission systems. The AEQ contains a 1-tap butterfly finite impulse response (FIR) filter and two N-tap FIR filters. It first performs polarization demultiplexing using the 1-tap filter, of which the coefficients are obtained based on Stokes space. Then it mitigates the inter-symbol interference (ISI) using the two N-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filters and adjust the filter’s coefficients by utilizing constant modulus algorithm (CMA). Through theoretical and experimental analysis, we verify that this proposed AEQ can perform robust polarization demultiplexing when PDL and CD exists. Besides, our proposed AEQ has faster convergence speed compared with recently proposed AEQs. In addition, it reduces the number of multipliers and thus reduce the computational complexity of conventional butterfly filter structure AEQ. And this proposed AEQ suffers little bit error ratio loss compared with the conventional AEQ. Due to the low-complexity and robustness to PDL and CD, this proposed AEQ is well-suited for future low-cost short-reach optical communication system.},

	abstract = {Self-coherent detection is a promising solution for extending the transmission reach for direct detection system. For these schemes, high carrier-to-signal power ratio (CSPR) is usually required to mitigate the inherent signal-signal beat interference (SSBI) induced from direct detection. Recently, carrier-assisted differential detection (CADD) receiver has been proposed to recover the optical ﬁeld of complex-valued double sideband (DSB) signals via direct detection. Aiming at relaxing the high CSPR requirement for self-coherent detection systems, we propose an interleaved subcarrier loading scheme for double-sideband signals. At transmitter, only odd subcarriers are loaded with data while even subcarriers are left unused. By utilizing the CADD receiver, signal can be retrieved without the degradation of SSBI, which enables optical ﬁeld recovery at low CSPRs. In this article, we ﬁrst show by theory and simulation that the proposed scheme can work under lower CSPRs than the previous SSB self-coherent systems. Meanwhile, the electrical spectral efﬁciency of the proposed interleaved CADD is almost the same as SSB self-coherent systems. We also illustrate the process of parameter optimization for interleaved CADD, including optical delay, CSPR, and frequency gap. We successfully transmit 100-Gbps 16-QAM OFDM signals over 160-km uncompensated standard single mode ﬁber (SSMF) at 3.5-dB CSPR.},

	abstract = {We discuss technology options and challenges for scaling intra-datacenter interconnects beyond 1 Tb/s bandwidths, with focus on two possible approaches: pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-based intensity modulation-direct detection (IM-DD) and baud-rate sampled coherent technology. In our studies, we compare the performance of various orders of PAM modulation (PAM4 to 8). In addition to these ﬁxed PAM signaling options, a ﬂexible PAM (FlexPAM) technique leveraging granularity in spectral efﬁciency (SE) is proposed to maximize link margin. For baud-rate sampled coherent technology, we propose a simpliﬁed digital signal processing (DSP) architecture to bring down power consumption of the coherent approach closer to that of IM-DD PAM. We also propose two new phase noise tolerant 2D coherent modulation formats to relax the laser linewidth requirement. In closing, a comparative study of ﬁxed IM-DD PAM versus coherent polarization multiplexed-quadrature amplitude modulation (PMQAM) is presented for a 1.6 Tb/s solution (200 Gb/s per dimension), with consideration of link loss/reach budget, power consumption, implementation complexity, as well as fan-out granularity.},

abstract = {Until recently, the theory of noncoherent communications was premised on the use of orthogonal multi-pulse modulation such as frequency shift keying. The main drawback of this modulation scheme has been its poor spectral efficiency (rate/bandwidth). This paper considers instead the more general non-orthogonal multi-pulse modulation (NMM) technique. Optimal and suboptimal noncoherent detection strategies for NMM are reviewed and their asymptotic (high SNR) performances are characterized for the additive Gaussian as well as the Rayleigh fading channels. The resulting non-Euclidean distance measures are then used to design NMM signal sets that yield significantly higher bandwidth efficiencies than their orthogonal counterparts. NMM in conjunction with convolutional coding is also studied as a way to improve energy efficiency. Several optimal convolutional codes are examined together with our signal designs. An introduction to equalization on the noncoherent channel is also presented and illustrated by example. This paper thus contains several new results and attempts at the same time to give a tutorial exposition of the subject of noncoherent communications.},

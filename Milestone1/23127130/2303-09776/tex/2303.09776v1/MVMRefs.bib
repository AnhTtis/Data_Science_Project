	abstract = {Coherent detection offers high spectral efficiency and receiver sensitivity, but digital signal processing (DSP)-based coherent receivers may be prohibitively power hungry for data centers even when optimized for short-reach applications, where fiber propagation impairments are less severe. We propose and evaluate low-power DSP-free homodyne coherent receiver architectures for dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) for inter- and intradata center links. We propose a novel optical polarization demultiplexing technique, for DP-QPSK and higher-order modulation formats, with three cascaded phase shifters driven by marker tone detection circuitry. We consider carrier recovery based on either optical or electrical phase-locked loops (PLLs). We propose a novel multiplier-free phase detector based on XOR gates, which exhibits less than 0.5 dB power penalty relative to a conventional Costas loop phase detector. We also study the relative performance of homodyne DP-differential QPSK, for which carrier phase recovery is unnecessary. Our proposed DSP-free architectures exhibit $\sim$1 dB power penalty at small chromatic dispersion compared to their DSP-based counterparts. We estimate conservatively that the high-speed analog electronics of an electrical PLL-based coherent receiver consume nearly 4 W for 200 Gbit/s DP-QPSK, assuming a 90-nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process.},

The results indicate that the modes of FM-CMCFs are less likely to couple with each other in weak random-bending conditions in contradiction to single-mode coupled multicore fibers. To resolve this problem, we demonstrate an optimum index profile and core pitch, where the GDS can be reduced even if the different mode groups do not couple strongly.},

The SMD was observed to be proportional to the fiber bend curvature, i.e., inversely proportional to the bend radius, and the SMD of 3.14 {\textpm} 0.17 ps/{\textsurd}km was measured at the bending radius of $\sim$31 cm. By assuming the 3.14-ps/{\textsurd}km SMD accumulation, the tap count of the multiple-input multiple-output digital signal processing for the crosstalk compensation is estimated to be only 63 taps for covering 99.99\% power of the impulse response after 10 000-km propagation when the 25-GBaud (50-GHz sampling) is assumed. The present results demonstrate the strong applicability of the coupled multicore fiber to the ultralong-haul submarine transmission system.},

	abstract = {Client-side optics are facing an ever-increasing upgrading pace, driven by upcoming 5G related services and datacenter applications. The demand for a single lane data rate is soon approaching 200 Gbps. To meet such high-speed requirement, all segments of traditional intensity modulation direct detection (IM/DD) technologies are being challenged. The characteristics of electrical and optoelectronic components and the performance of modulation, coding, and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques are being stretched to their limits. In this context, we witnessed technological breakthroughs in several aspects, including development of broadband devices, novel modulation formats and coding, and high-performance DSP algorithms for the past few years. A great momentum has been accumulated to overcome the aforementioned challenges. In this article, we focus on IM/DD transmissions, and provide an overview of recent research and development efforts on key enabling technologies for 200 Gbps per lane and beyond. Our recent demonstrations of 200 Gbps short-reach transmissions with 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and discrete multitone signals are also presented as examples to show the system requirements in terms of device characteristics and DSP performance. Apart from digital coherent technologies and advanced direct detection systems, such as Stokes--vector and Kramers--Kronig schemes, we expect high-speed IM/DD systems will remain advantageous in terms of system cost, power consumption, and footprint for short reach applications in the short- to mid- term perspective.},

	abstract = {We propose a joint blind equalization method for chromatic dispersion (CD) and ultra-fast rotation of state-of-polarization (RSOP) in a Stokes vector direct detection (SV-DD) system based on a new time-frequency domain Kalman filter structure. In an SV-DD system, the impairments induced by CD and RSOP possess a nonlinear form. Therefore, CD and RSOP cannot be treated sequentially, which causes difficulty in jointly equalizing these two impairments using an ordinary algorithm. The Kalman filter was proven to be effective in equalizing polarization effects in a coherent receiver. However, this approach has inherent limitations given that the Kalman filter was originally presented as a method implemented in the time domain whereas CD is eventually induced in the frequency domain. In this report, the proposed time-frequency domain Kalman filter can facilitate CD compensation in the frequency domain and RSOP equalization in the time domain by exploiting a sliding window structure. Both the CD compensation and the RSOP equalization are conducted in Stokes space when the proposed method is utilized, which is specially designed for an SV-DD system. The presented approach was checked using a 28 Gbaud 16-QAM SV-DD system simulation platform. The simulation results confirm that the method is very effective and has strong tolerance to CD (more than 2550 ps/nm, equivalent to a 150 km G. 652 fiber) combined with ultra-fast RSOP (up to 2 Mrad/s) for application in extreme polarization environments, like the transient lightning in a rainy day.},

	abstract = {Coherent detection empowers optical receivers the capability of recovering the optical field propagating through the fiber. Field recovery not only increases the degree of freedom for optical modulations, but also enables the digital compensation of fiber dispersion that avoids the sophisticated optical dispersion management. Compared with coherent detection, direct detection (DD) owns a natural advantage---the simplicity, but lacks the capability of field recovery. To increase the modulation dimension for DD, the recent development of Stokes vector receiver takes the advantage of polarization diversity and extends the modulation dimension up to three-dimension with reference to the four-dimensional coherent detection (i.e., dual-polarization intensity and phase). However, a Stokes vector receiver is not inherently capable of field recovery because the second-order signal representation in Stokes space nonlinearizes the first-order linear field information, making it infeasible to digitally compensate the chromatic dispersion. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of Stokes-space field recovery (SSFR) that completely or partially recovers the optical field by DD. We analyze the degree of freedom for a variety of Stokes-space modulations compatible with SSFR, and reveal their tradeoff between optical spectral efficiency (that determines fiber capacity) and electrical spectral efficiency (that determines transceiver cost per bit). We review the Stokes-space polarization recovery methods and generalize a novel concept as analog polarization identification to simplify the DSP of SSFR. Furthermore, we compare the OSNR sensitivity among various common direct detection schemes to provide reliable predictions of their transmission performance. With its high spectral efficiency and capability of digital dispersion compensation, SSFR is very promising for future high-capacity short-reach applications over single- or multispan fiber transmission.},

By multi-dimensional polarization modulation in Stokes space, SVR maximizes the electrical spectral efficiency (ESE) of DD receivers by recovering at most 3-D signals. However, most 3-D schemes lack the capability of optical field recovery, an essential requirement for digital post-compensation of fiber dispersion that elongates the achievable distance. We propose a 3-D Stokes-space field modulation to enable 3-D signal field recovery, verified by a 3-D 32-Gbaud per dimension probabilistic-constellation-shaped 64-QAM transmission over 260-km fiber at C-band. This sets an ESE record of 16.5 (net ESE of 13.9) bit/s/Hz for DD receivers.},

It is shown that the splitting ratio for achieving optimum performance will be changed with SOP and EL conditions.

The transmitter is built using two identical O-band traveling wave Mach-Zehnder modulators with an average V\&\#x003C0;L and a bandwidth at 1.5 V bias voltage of 2.88 V.cm and 24.5 GHz, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate the transmitter in a Stokes vector direct-detection (SV-DD) system for dual-polarization intensity modulated signals with 2-level and 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (DP-PAM2 and DP-PAM4) formats. The direct-detection Stokes vector receiver (DD-SVR) followed by offline digital signal processing (DSP) is implemented for SOP de-rotation. We characterize the performance of the SV-DD system versus number of taps, received signal power, state of polarization (SOP), reach, and bit rate. Results reveal that 112 Gb/s DP-PAM2 can be transmitted over 10 km of single mode fiber (SMF) at a bit error rate (BER) below 10\&\#x02212;5 at \&\#x02212;1 dBm received signal power irrespective of the SOP. Moreover, a 168 Gb/s (42 Gbaud) DP-PAM4 signal can be transmitted over 2 km and 10 km at a BER below the 7\&\#x00025; hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold (i.e., 3.8 \&\#x000D7; 10\&\#x02212;3) at 0 dBm and 2 dBm, respectively. Furthermore, 224 Gb/s and 200 Gb/s DP-PAM4 are successfully received at a BER below the HD-FEC in the back-to-back and 2 km cases, respectively. Finally, we compare the performance of the 6 \&\#x000D7; 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) equalization to a simpler 4 \&\#x000D7; 2 MIMO equalization and explain the superior performance of the 6 \&\#x000D7; 2 in the presence of SVR imperfections.},

In an SV-DD system, the impairments induced by CD and RSOP possess a nonlinear form. Therefore, CD and RSOP cannot be treated sequentially, which causes difficulty in jointly equalizing these two impairments using an ordinary algorithm. The Kalman filter was proven to be effective in equalizing polarization effects in a coherent receiver. However, this approach has inherent limitations given that the Kalman filter was originally presented as a method implemented in the time domain whereas CD is eventually induced in the frequency domain. In this report, the proposed time-frequency domain Kalman filter can facilitate CD compensation in the frequency domain and RSOP equalization in the time domain by exploiting a sliding window structure. Both the CD compensation and the RSOP equalization are conducted in Stokes space when the proposed method is utilized, which is specially designed for an SV-DD system. The presented approach was checked using a 28 Gbaud 16-QAM SV-DD system simulation platform. The simulation results confirm that the method is very effective and has strong tolerance to CD (more than 2550 ps/nm, equivalent to a 150 km G. 652 fiber) combined with ultra-fast RSOP (up to 2 Mrad/s) for application in extreme polarization environments, like the transient lightning in a rainy day.},

	abstract = {Coherent detection empowers optical receivers the capability of recovering the optical field propagating through the fiber. Field recovery not only increases the degree of freedom for optical modulations, but also enables the digital compensation of fiber dispersion that avoids the sophisticated optical dispersion management. Compared with coherent detection, direct detection (DD) owns a natural advantage---the simplicity, but lacks the capability of field recovery. To increase the modulation dimension for DD, the recent development of Stokes vector receiver takes the advantage of polarization diversity and extends the modulation dimension up to three-dimension with reference to the four-dimensional coherent detection (i.e., dual-polarization intensity and phase). However, a Stokes vector receiver is not inherently capable of field recovery because the second-order signal representation in Stokes space nonlinearizes the first-order linear field information, making it infeasible to digitally compensate the chromatic dispersion. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of Stokes-space field recovery (SSFR) that completely or partially recovers the optical field by DD. We analyze the degree of freedom for a variety of Stokes-space modulations compatible with SSFR, and reveal their tradeoff between optical spectral efficiency (that determines fiber capacity) and electrical spectral efficiency (that determines transceiver cost per bit). We review the Stokes-space polarization recovery methods and generalize a novel concept as analog polarization identification to simplify the DSP of SSFR. Furthermore, we compare the OSNR sensitivity among various common direct detection schemes to provide reliable predictions of their transmission performance. With its high spectral efficiency and capability of digital dispersion compensation, SSFR is very promising for future high-capacity short-reach applications over single- or multispan fiber transmission.},

However, most 3-D schemes lack the capability of optical field recovery, an essential requirement for digital post-compensation of fiber dispersion that elongates the achievable distance. We propose a 3-D Stokes-space field modulation to enable 3-D signal field recovery, verified by a 3-D 32-Gbaud per dimension probabilistic-constellation-shaped 64-QAM transmission over 260-km fiber at C-band.

The impact of system parameters and configurations including carrier-to-signal-power ratio, guard band of the digital carrier, digital oversampling ratio and real MIMO is experimentally investigated. Finally, a record net data rate of 400 Gb/s (a raw rate of 480 Gb/s including FEC overhead) over 80 km SSMF is achieved in a 60 Gbaud PDM-16QAM single carrier experiment with a BER below the threshold of 2.0x10\&\#x2212;2.},

	abstract = {We present a dual-polarization O-band silicon photonic (SiP) transmitter for intra-datacenter optical interconnects. The transmitter is built using two identical O-band traveling wave Mach-Zehnder modulators with an average V\&\#x003C0;L and a bandwidth at 1.5 V bias voltage of 2.88 V.cm and 24.5 GHz, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate the transmitter in a Stokes vector direct-detection (SV-DD) system for dual-polarization intensity modulated signals with 2-level and 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (DP-PAM2 and DP-PAM4) formats. The direct-detection Stokes vector receiver (DD-SVR) followed by offline digital signal processing (DSP) is implemented for SOP de-rotation. We characterize the performance of the SV-DD system versus number of taps, received signal power, state of polarization (SOP), reach, and bit rate. Results reveal that 112 Gb/s DP-PAM2 can be transmitted over 10 km of single mode fiber (SMF) at a bit error rate (BER) below 10\&\#x02212;5 at \&\#x02212;1 dBm received signal power irrespective of the SOP. Moreover, a 168 Gb/s (42 Gbaud) DP-PAM4 signal can be transmitted over 2 km and 10 km at a BER below the 7\&\#x00025; hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold (i.e., 3.8 \&\#x000D7; 10\&\#x02212;3) at 0 dBm and 2 dBm, respectively. Furthermore, 224 Gb/s and 200 Gb/s DP-PAM4 are successfully received at a BER below the HD-FEC in the back-to-back and 2 km cases, respectively. Finally, we compare the performance of the 6 \&\#x000D7; 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) equalization to a simpler 4 \&\#x000D7; 2 MIMO equalization and explain the superior performance of the 6 \&\#x000D7; 2 in the presence of SVR imperfections.},

	abstract      = {Mutually unbiased bases for quantum degrees of freedom are central to all theoretical investigations and practical exploitations of complementary properties. Much is known about mutually unbiased bases, but there are also a fair number of important questions that have not been answered in full as yet. In particular, one can find maximal sets of ${N+1}$ mutually unbiased bases in Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimension ${N=p^\m}$, with $p$ prime and $\m$ a positive integer, and there is a continuum of mutually unbiased bases for a continuous degree of freedom, such as motion along a line. But not a single example of a maximal set is known if the dimension is another composite number ($N=6,10,12,...$). In this review, we present a unified approach in which the basis states are labeled by numbers ${0,1,2,...,N-1}$ that are both elements of a Galois field and ordinary integers. This dual nature permits a compact systematic construction of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases when they are known to exist but throws no light on the open existence problem in other cases. We show how to use the thus constructed mutually unbiased bases in quantum-informatics applications, including dense coding, teleportation, entanglement swapping, covariant cloning, and state tomography, all of which rely on an explicit set of maximally entangled states (generalizations of the familiar two--q-bit Bell states) that are related to the mutually unbiased bases. There is a link to the mathematics of finite affine planes. We also exploit the one-to-one correspondence between unbiased bases and the complex Hadamard matrices that turn the bases into each other. The ultimate hope, not yet fulfilled, is that open questions about mutually unbiased bases can be related to open questions about Hadamard matrices or affine planes, in particular the ...[rest deleted]},

	abstract      = {We analyze theoretically the impact of background counts on the efficiency of optical communication in the photon-starved regime using the pulse position modulation (PPM) format with direct detection. Degradation of the photon information efficiency is studied in the case when the background count rate is at most comparable with the rate of photodetection events generated by the incoming optical signal. The PPM symbol length is optimized under the constraint of a fixed average spectral power density using an analytical approximation. The results are compared with generalized on-off keying (OOK) optimized over the a priori probability distribution for the input binary alphabet. The generalized OOK scheme can be viewed as a relaxation of the PPM scheme by removing the requirement that a light pulse must occur exactly once in each fixed-length frame of time bins that constitute the PPM symbol. It is shown that the asymptotic scaling of the photon information efficiency does not change qualitatively in this scenario.},

	abstract      = {In this paper, we propose a faster-than-{Nyquist} (FTN) non-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (NOFDM) scheme for visible light communications (VLC) where the multiplexing/demultiplexing employs the inverse fractional cosine transform (IFrCT)/FrCT. Different to the common fractional Fourier transform-based NOFDM (FrFT-NOFDM) signal, FrCT-based NOFDM (FrCT-NOFDM) signal is real-valued which can be directly applied to the VLC systems without the expensive upconversion. Thus, FrCT-NOFDM is more suitable for the cost-sensitive VLC systems. Meanwhile, under the same transmission rate, FrCT-NOFDM signal occupies smaller bandwidth compared to OFDM signal. When the bandwidth compression factor $\alpha$ is set to $0.8$, $20\%$ bandwidth saving can be obtained. Therefore, FrCT-NOFDM has higher spectral efficiency and suffers less high-frequency distortion compared to OFDM, which benefits the bandwidth-limited VLC systems. As the simulation results show, bit error rate (BER) performance of FrCT-NOFDM with $\alpha$ of $0.9$ or $0.8$ is better than that of OFDM. Moreover, FrCT-NOFDM has a superior security performance. In conclusion, FrCT-NOFDM shows great potential for application in the future VLC systems.},

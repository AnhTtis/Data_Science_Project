    "abstract": "COVID-19 misinformation on social media platforms such as twitter is a threat to effective pandemic management. Prior works on tweet COVID-19 misinformation negates the role of semantic features common to twitter such as charged emotions. Thus, we present a novel COVID-19 misinformation model, which uses both a tweet emotion encoder and COVID-19 misinformation encoder to predict whether a tweet contains COVID-19 misinformation. Our emotion encoder was fine-tuned on a novel annotated dataset and our COVID-19 misinformation encoder was fine-tuned on a subset of the COVID-HeRA dataset. Experimental results show superior results using the combination of emotion and misinformation encoders as opposed to a misinformation classifier alone. Furthermore, extensive result analysis was conducted, highlighting low quality labels and mismatched label distributions as key limitations to our study.",

    "abstract": "We present an explicit construction of a Markovian random growth process on integer partitions such that given it visits some level $n$, it passes through any partition $λ$ of $n$ with equal probabilities. The construction has continuous time, but we also investigate its discrete time jump chain. The jump probabilities are given by explicit but complicated expressions, so we find their asymptotic behavior as the partition becomes large. This allows us to explain how the limit shape is formed.\n  Using the known connection of the considered probabilistic objects to Poisson point processes, we give an alternative description of the partition growth process in these terms. Then we apply the constructed growth process to find sufficient conditions for a phenomenon known as equivalence of two ensembles of random partitions for a finite number of partition characteristics.",

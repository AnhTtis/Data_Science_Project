    "abstract": "We study the expected utility portfolio optimization problem in an incomplete financial market where the risky asset dynamics depend on stochastic factors and the portfolio allocation is constrained to lie within a given convex set. We employ fundamental duality results from real constrained optimization to formally derive a dual representation of the associated HJB PDE. Using this representation, we provide a condition on the market dynamics and the allocation constraints, which ensures that the solution to the HJB PDE is exponentially affine and separable. This condition is used to derive an explicit expression for the optimal allocation-constrained portfolio up to a deterministic minimizer and the solution to a system of Riccati ODEs in a market with CIR volatility and in a market with multi-factor OU short rate.",

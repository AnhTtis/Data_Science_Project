    "abstract": "Severe plastic deformations under high pressure are used to produce nanostructured materials but were studied ex-situ. We introduce rough diamond anvils to reach maximum friction equal to yield strength in shear and perform the first in-situ study of the evolution of the pressure-dependent yield strength and nanostructural parameters for severely pre-deformed Zr. ω-Zr behaves like perfectly plastic, isotropic, and strain-path-independent. This is related to reaching steady values of the crystallite size and dislocation density, which are pressure-, strain- and strain-path-independent. However, steady states for α-Zr obtained with smooth and rough anvils are different, which causes major challenge in plasticity theory.",

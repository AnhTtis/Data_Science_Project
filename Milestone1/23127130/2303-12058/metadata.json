    "abstract": "Identifiability of the discrete tree parameter is a key property for phylogenetic models since it is necessary for statistically consistent estimation of the tree from sequence data. Algebraic methods have proven to be very effective at showing that tree and network parameters of phylogenetic models are identifiable, especially when the underlying models are group-based. However, since group-based models are time-reversible, only the unrooted tree topology is identifiable and the location of the root is not. In this note we show that the rooted tree parameter of the Cavender-Farris-Neyman Model with a Molecular Clock is generically identifiable by using the invariants of the model which were characterized by Coons and Sullivant.",

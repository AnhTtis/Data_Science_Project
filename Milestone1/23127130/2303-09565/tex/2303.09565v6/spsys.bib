    abstract = {Programming robotic systems is often a challenging task requiring advanced skills, especially when the goal is to ensure loosely-coupled coordination in heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs). Model-driven approaches for robotic system engineering have shown their benefits in facilitating the development of robots’ behavior, controllers, and system components. However, the state of the art still lacks contributions addressing crucial aspects of the model-driven approach applied to MRSs, such as developing robots’ distributed cooperation through models supporting the communication among robots. In this paper, we present a novel framework for modeling, configuring and enacting the cooperative behaviors of MRSs through collaboration diagrams as provided by the BPMN 2.0 standard. The advantages of our solution lie, indeed, in the use of BPMN, which provides easily understandable and highly expressive diagrams for representing the cooperation among distributed robots, and benefits from a wide list of supporting tools. Starting from the selection of BPMNelements, we define a set of guidelines for driving the developer in modeling an MRS mission using BPMN. The developer configures the resulting collaboration diagram to link elements in the model to the robotic middleware, ROS2 in the toolchain we implemented. Finally, the configured model is enacted by BPMN engines integrated into the ROS2 middleware run by each robot involved in the MRS, thus obtaining a fully distributed cooperation. We assess our framework’s effectiveness through experiments in simulated and real environments.}

    abstract = {With the emergence of the Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs) along with the fourth industrial revolution, the discussion of distributed architecture and coordination and extensive communication between all components of a system was raised. On the other hand, Modern industrial manufacturing relies heavily on flexible production. Autonomous mobile manipulators (MMs) have the potential to improve the flexibility of existing manufacturing environments. With the advantages associated with this technology, there is an upsurge in the demand for MMs. Thus, adding a new MM as a new CPS into a system following industry 4.0 requires a framework to help taking all the advantages from it. In this article, we proposed a framework to integrating MMs as CPSs into an existing production system. This integration requires comprehensive knowledge of the existing production process and control, which is a view to improve the performance of the existing production systems via new functionalities due to MMs. The next step of the framework is to make new MM operations compatible with the existing production control system. For this purpose, we define different parametric blocks to perform new operations and thus contribute to making the production line more autonomous. Considering all of these issues simultaneously is necessary for an efficient integration in smart production context. For a successful integration, we presented four principal dimensions of integration: Physical integration, communicational integration, functional and operational integration, and digital integration. Furthermore, the framework has been applied to a research production line called Platform 4.0 at Arts et Métiers. An MM from OMRON Company (called MoMa) has been integrated into the existing production system. Results from this real-world demonstration show that MoMa is capable of successfully increasing flexibility, autonomy, and efficiency of a production system using command signals from Manufacturing Execution System (MES).}

In this paper, we propose a development process for such an executive layer that emphasizes on the dependability of this layer. To do so, we structure the executive layer using skills, that are formally defined using a specific language, and we then provide some tools to verify these models, generate some code, and a methodology to assess the fault-tolerance of the resulting architecture.}

Such potential emerges as a result of the real-time coupling between DTs and their physical counterparts, where it is possible to make use of operational data as it is being generated in order to aid decision-making. Harnessing this potential presents several design challenges, such as the parallel operation of the DT and its physical twin (PT), and the necessary synchronisation thereof, to ensure coherent execution of the system in ensemble. In this paper we present an approach that handles situations where a DT and its PT get out of sync as a result of disturbances in the normal operational conditions of the DT–PT system, e.g., due to network degradation or temporary network drop. The purpose is to provide a best-effort functionality covering: user notification, degradation of DT to digital shadow (DS), with recovery mechanisms to re-establish the synchronisation between DT and PT.}

    ABSTRACT = {The goal of the research reported here was to investigate whether the design methodology utilising embodied agents can be applied to produce a multi-modal human–computer interface for cyberspace events visualisation control. This methodology requires that the designed system structure be defined in terms of cooperating agents having well-defined internal components exhibiting specified behaviours. System activities are defined in terms of finite state machines and behaviours parameterised by transition functions. In the investigated case the multi-modal interface is a component of the Operational Centre which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Embodied agents have been successfully used in the design of robotic systems. However robots operate in physical environments, while cyberspace events visualisation involves cyberspace, thus the applied design methodology required a different definition of the environment. It had to encompass the physical environment in which the operator acts and the computer screen where the results of those actions are presented. Smart human–computer interaction (HCI) is a time-aware, dynamic process in which two parties communicate via different modalities, e.g., voice, gesture, eye movement. The use of computer vision and machine intelligence techniques are essential when the human is carrying an exhausting and concentration demanding activity. The main role of this interface is to support security analysts and operators controlling visualisation of cyberspace events like incidents or cyber attacks especially when manipulating graphical information. Visualisation control modalities include visual gesture- and voice-based commands.},

Essentially, design concept evaluation is a complex multi-criteria decision-making process involving large amount of data and expert knowledge which are usually imprecise and subjective. Aiming to improve the effectiveness and objectivity of the design concept evaluation process, this paper proposes a novel method based on grey relation analysis and rough set theory. By integrating the strength of rough sets in handling vagueness and the merit of grey relation analysis in modeling multi-criteria decision-making, a rough number enabled grey relation analysis (called rough–grey analysis) is proposed to evaluate design concepts. The result of an example shows that the proposed rough–grey analysis has provided a novel alternative to perform design concept evaluation, in which the vague design information and expert knowledge can be modeled and analyzed more effectively and objectively.}

    title = "A formal method for subjective design evaluation with multiple attributes",
    abstract = "This paper contributes toward a more formal theory and methodology for design by mathematically modeling the functional relationships between design decisions and the ultimate overall worth of a design. The conventional approach to design evaluation is limited in two respects. First, the direct measurement of attribute performance levels does not reflect the subsequent worth to the designer. Second, ad hoc methods for determining the relative importance or priority of attributes do not accurately quantify beneficial attribute tradeoffs. This information is critical to the iterative redesign process. A formal Methodology for the Evaluation of Design Alternatives (MEDA) is presented which resolves these problems and can be used to evaluate design alternatives in the iterative design/redesign process. Multiattribute utility analysis is employed to compare the overall utility or value of alternative designs as a function of the levels of several performance characteristics of a manufactured system. The evaluation function reflects the designer's preferences for sets of multiple attributes. Sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative basis for modifying a design to increase its utility to the decision-maker. Improvements in one or more areas of performance and tradeoffs between attributes which would increase desirability of a design most are identified. A case study of materials selection and design in the automotive industry is presented which illustrates the steps followed in application of the method.",

This paper proposes a novel way of performing design concept evaluations where instead of considering cost and benefit characteristics of design criteria, the work identifies best concept which satisfy constraints imposed by the team of designers on design criteria’s as well as fulfilling maximum customers’ preferences. In this work, the rough number enabled modified Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method for design concept evaluation is developed by modifying the extended VIKOR method with interval numbers. The proposed technique is labeled as modified rough VIKOR (MR-VIKOR) analysis. The work primarily involves two phases of concept evaluation. In the first phase, relative importance ranking and initial weights of design criteria are computed through the importance assigned to each design criteria by the designers or the decision makers (DM); and in the second phase, customers’ preferences to the generated user needs are captured in the form of rough numbers. The relative importance ranking computed in first phase along with customers’ preferences is incorporated in the second phase to select the best concept.}

Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture: the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) are declared inappropriate. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework on the other hand are suitable. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model. An example with the collaborative engineering services for the global automotive supply chain is hereby described.}

This motion specification takes into account three elementary behaviors that suffice to define any robot interaction with the environment, i.e. free motion, exerting generalized forces and the transition between both of these behaviors. These behaviors provide a foundation for general motion generation taking into account any sensors, any effectors and the capability to exchange information between embodied agents. This specification can be used both for the definition of robot tasks and implementation of robot control software, hence both of those aspects are presented in this paper. This formal approach was used for the implementation of the MRROC++ robot programming framework. Two-handed manipulation of a Rubik’s cube is used as an exemplary task. Extensive experimentation both with the presented formalism and the MRROC++ framework showed that the imposed formal rigor eliminates many errors at the software specification phase, produces well-structured control software and significantly speeds up and simplifies its implementation. These advantages are mainly due to the fact that the proposed formal specification tool is derived from operational semantics used in computer science for the definition of programming languages, thus a close relationship between abstract definition and the implementation of the control system resulted.},

This term is more and more used in industry and research initiatives; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique definition of this concept. The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors. The paper also proposes the definition of DT for Industry 4.0 manufacturing, elaborated by the European H2020 project MAYA, as a contribution to the research discussion about DT concept.}

    ABSTRACT = {This article proposes a formal method of designing robotic systems focusing on communication between components, as well as standardization of the messages between those components. The objective is to design a robotic system controller in a systematic way, focusing on communication at an abstract agent level. Communication, thus organized, and its properly defined specification facilitate the system’s further development. The method uses a standard message structure, based on IEEE FIPA standards, for communication within robotic systems composed of agents. Communication-focused top-down design of robotic systems based on binary decomposition is proposed, and used to design a companion robot working in the kitchen environment. The implemented robotic system is verified based on whether or not the specification conforms to the specified requirements. The characteristics of the designed communication are evaluated. The obtained results prove that the proposed method of designing robotic systems is formally correct, it facilitates the implementation of agents, and separates specification of the system from its implementation. The method of designing robotic systems is correct and useful. The proposed formal notation facilitates understanding of how the system operates and organizes the design process. It puts the communication between system components at the forefront. The resulting system specification facilitates the implementation. The tools for experimental evaluation of its characteristics enable the confirmation that it fulfills the requirements, and that the communication between the system components is correct.},

    abstract = {Context: Many critical systems must comply with safety standards as a way of providing assurance that they do not pose undue risks to people, property, or the environment. Safety compliance is a very demanding activity, as the standards can consist of hundreds of pages and practitioners typically have to show the fulfilment of thousands of safety-related criteria. Furthermore, the text of the standards can be ambiguous, inconsistent, and hard to understand, making it difficult to determine how to effectively structure and manage safety compliance information. These issues become even more challenging when a system is intended to be reused in another application domain with different applicable standards. Objective: This paper aims to resolve these issues by providing a metamodel for the specification of safety compliance needs for critical systems. Method: The metamodel is holistic and generic, and abstracts common concepts for demonstrating safety compliance from different standards and application domains. Its application results in the specification of “reference assurance frameworks” for safety-critical systems, which correspond to a model of the safety criteria of a given standard. For validating the metamodel with safety standards, parts of several standards have been modelled by both academic and industry personnel, and other standards have been analysed. We further augment this with feedback from practitioners, including feedback during a workshop. Results: The results from the validation show that the metamodel can be used to specify safety compliance needs for aerospace, automotive, avionics, defence, healthcare, machinery, maritime, oil and gas, process industry, railway, and robotics. Practitioners consider that the metamodel can meet their needs and find benefits in its use. Conclusion: The metamodel supports the specification of safety compliance needs for most critical computer-based and software-intensive systems. The resulting models can provide an effective means of structuring and managing safety compliance information.}

    keywords = {Cyber–physical systems, Test scenario generation, Genetic algorithms, Virtual environments},
    abstract = {Background:
    Many modern cyber–physical systems incorporate computer vision technologies, complex sensors and advanced control software, allowing them to interact with the environment autonomously. Examples include drone swarms, self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, etc. Testing such systems poses numerous challenges: not only should the system inputs be varied, but also the surrounding environment should be accounted for. A number of tools have been developed to test the system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements. However, they are not directly applicable to autonomous cyber–physical systems, as the inputs to their models are generated while operating in a virtual environment.
    Aims:
    In this paper, we aim to design a search-based framework, named AmbieGen, for generating diverse fault-revealing test scenarios for autonomous cyber–physical systems. The scenarios represent an environment in which an autonomous agent operates. The framework should be applicable to generating different types of environments.
    Methods:
    To generate the test scenarios, we leverage the NSGA-II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the deviation of the observed system’s behaviour from its expected behaviour. The second objective is the test case diversity, calculated as a Jaccard distance with a reference test case. To guide the first objective we are using a simplified system model rather than the full model. The full model is used to run the system in the simulation environment and can take substantial time to execute (several minutes for one scenario). The simplified system model is derived from the full model and can be used to get an approximation of the results obtained from the full model without running the simulation.
    Results:
    We evaluate AmbieGen on three scenario generation case studies, namely a smart-thermostat, a robot obstacle avoidance system, and a vehicle lane-keeping assist system. For all the case studies, our approach outperforms the available baselines in fault revealing and several other metrics such as the diversity of the revealed faults and the proportion of valid test scenarios.
    Conclusion:
    AmbieGen could find scenarios, revealing failures for all the three autonomous agents considered in our case studies. We compared three configurations of AmbieGen: based on a single objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective, and random search. Both single and multi objective configurations outperform the random search. Multi objective configuration can find the individuals of the same quality as the single objective, producing more unique test scenarios in the same time budget. Our framework can be used to generate virtual environments of different types and complexity and reveal the system’s faults early in the design stage.}

    abstract = {Context
    Testing complex industrial robots (CIRs) requires testing several interacting control systems. This is challenging, especially for robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing, since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled with the robot’s motion control.
    Objective
    Current practices for validating CIRs involve manual test case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate CIR control systems in an industrial context.
    Method
    This paper reports on a methodology, developed at ABB Robotics in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of CIRs control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on a novel constraint-based model for automatically generating test sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part of a continuous integration process.
    Results
    By performing a detailed analysis of experimental results over a simplified version of our constraint model, we determine the most appropriate parameterization of the operational version of the constraint model. This version is now being deployed at ABB Robotics’s CIR testing facilities and used on a permanent basis. This paper presents the empirical results obtained when automatically generating test sequences for CIRs at ABB Robotics. In a real industrial setting, the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults.
    Conclusion
    Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for CIRs and can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context.}

Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world's population thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efficient city management has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in information and communication technologies to find sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained significant attention over the past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efficient and effective resource management in Smart Cities. Today, infrastructure, platforms and software applications are offered as services using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it fits with the IoT. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical and social perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues.

One critical aspect of RT systems is the production of output before specified deadline. Formal methods are promising in dealing with the design issues of these applications, although they do not scale well for complex systems. Instead, Modeling and Simulation (M&S) provides a cost-effective approach to verify the design and implementation details of very Complex RT applications. M&S methods provide dynamic and risk-free testing environments to verify different scenarios, and they are used for feasibility analysis and verification of such systems. Nevertheless, the simulation models are usually discarded in the later phases of the development. We present the application of an M&S-based method referred to as DEVSRT (Discrete EVent System Specifications in Real-Time) to solve the discontinuity between the simulation models and the final embedded application, in this paper. DEVSRT defines explicit deadline notation for DEVS transitions, draws a clear mapping between DEVS transitions and real-time tasks and provides a formal method and tool for integration of simulation models with the associated hardware components.}

In an exemplary identification procedure, the weight of an object and its centre of mass together with gripper kinematic configuration are identified. The procedure is based on the measurements from a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted near the gripper. The proposed method reduces trajectory tracking errors coming from the model imprecision without compromising the main advantages of impedance control. The whole approach is applied according to the embodied agent paradigm and verified on the two-arm service robot both in simulation and on hardware. Due to the general description that follows system engineering standards, the method can be easily modified or applied to similar systems.},

In particular, several agent-oriented methodologies, incorporating suitable agent models, frameworks and tools, have been to date defined to support the development lifecycle of distributed agent systems (DAS). However, few of them provide effective validation methods to analyze design objects at different degrees of refinement before their actual implementation and deployment. In this paper, ELDAMeth, a simulation-based methodology for DAS, which enables rapid prototyping based on visual programming, validation, and automatic code generation for JADE-based DAS, is presented. ELDAMeth can be used both stand-alone for the modeling and evaluation of DAS and coupled with other agent-oriented methodologies for enhancing them with simulation-based validation. In particular, the proposed methodology, which is based on the ELDA (Event-driven Lightweight Distilled StateCharts-based Agents) agent model, provides key programming abstractions (event-driven computation, multi-coordination, and coarse-grained strong mobility) very suitable for highly dynamic distributed computing and is supported by a CASE tool-driven iterative process seamlessly covering the detailed design, simulation, and implementation phases of DAS. A simple yet effective case study in the distributed information retrieval domain is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.}

Hence, development of such systems needs an iterative and incremental process to handle complexity and the continuously changing na-ture of the requirements. In this paper, a test driven multi-agent system devel-opment approach that naturally supports iterative and incremental MAS con-struction is proposed. Also a testing framework called as SUnit which supports the proposed approach by extending JUnit framework is introduced. This framework allows writing automated tests for agent behaviors and interactions between agents. The framework also includes the necessary mock agents to model the organizational aspects of the MAS.",

Results from an international study, including 477 cross-industry projects, indicated that 52\% of projects could be categorized as hybrid approaches. A regression analysis using multiple outcome measures indicated substantial explanatory power (0.21 < R 2 <0.41). Analysis suggested that hybrid and agile approaches significantly increase stakeholder success over traditional approaches while achieving the same budget, time, scope, and quality outcomes. Hybrid approaches were found to be similar in effectiveness to fully agile approaches. Results validate decisions by practitioners to combine agile and traditional practices and suggest that hybrid is a leading project management approach.},

Digital twins provide previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies. Recently, agriculture has seen several technological advancements, but it is still unclear if this community is making an effort to adopt digital twins in its operations. In this work, we employ a mixed-method approach to investigate the added-value of digital twins for agriculture. We examine the extent of digital twin adoption in agriculture, shed light on the concept and the benefits it brings, and provide an application-based roadmap for a more extended adoption. We report a literature review of digital twins in agriculture, covering years 2017-2020. We identify 28 use cases, and compare them with use cases in other disciplines. We compare reported benefits, service categories, and technology readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture. We distill the digital twin characteristics that can provide added-value to agriculture from the examined digital twin applications in agriculture and in other disciplines. Then, inspired by digital twin applications in other disciplines, we propose a roadmap for digital twins in agriculture, consisting of examples of growing complexity. We conclude this paper by identifying the distinctive characteristics of agricultural digital twins.}

  abstract = {AbstractPhysical testing is used extensively to characterize mechanical systems. However, in many cases, mathematical models are now available that adequately describe the behaviour of part of the test specimen. Thus, test systems can be conceived which split the specimen into a physical part, and a virtual part, i.e. a real-time computer simulation. This has the potential to enhance convenience and reduce cost. The term ‘model-in-the-loop’ (MiL) has been used in the automotive industry to describe this concept. In this paper, a general framework for MiL system analysis is described. Two detailed examples are given. These concern the integration of numerical aerodynamic and tyre models into car test rigs. In the first case, the analytical results are validated by data from a real system. It is clear that particular demands are placed on the actuation and sensing systems if the numerical and real parts of the specimen are to interact correctly to give a realistic response for the complete system. Acceptable realism is achieved in the case of the aerodynamic model example. However, the results are less satisfactory in the tyre model example where both actuator response and sensor noise are limiting factors.},

While a growing body of research has acknowledged that the integration of an agile development methodology with user-centered design (UCD) provides advantages for both organizations and end users, integrating UCD in an agile methodology has been a challenging endeavor. The present paper illustrates a user-centered agile approach that integrates user perspectives through formative usability testing during an agile development process of a robot application and thus differentiates from most robot application evaluations, which conduct summative usability testing (i.e., they quantitatively test goal achievement after technological developments). Through an active involvement of organization and end users, the intermediate results of our ongoing project show that the developed social robot application is both useful and usable.},

	ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the issue of metamodeling of Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) for the purpose of designing complex mechatronics systems. Usually, one of the problems during the development of such projects is an interdisciplinary character of the team that is involved in this endeavour. The success of a complex machine project (e.g., Computer Numerically Controlled machine (CNC), loading crane, forestry crane) often depends on a proper communication between team members. The domain-specific modelling languages developed using one of the two approaches discussed in the work, lead to a machine design that can be carried out much more efficiently than with conventional approaches. Within the paper, the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) approach to metamodeling is presented; it is much more prevalent in modern modelling software tools than Graph-Object-Property-Relationship-Role (GOPRR). The main outcome of this work is the first presentation of researchML modelling language that is the result of more than twenty ambitious research and development projects. It is effectively used within new enterprises and leads to improved traceability of the project goals. It enables for fully-featured automatic code generation which is one of the main pillars of the agile management within mechatronic system design projects.},

  abstract       = {This paper addresses the problem of grasped object weight compensation in the one-handed manipulation of impedance controlled robots. In an exemplary identification procedure, the weight of an object and its centre of mass together with gripper kinematic configuration are identified. The procedure is based on the measurements from a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted near the gripper. The proposed method reduces trajectory tracking errors coming from the model imprecision without compromising the main advantages of impedance control. The whole approach is applied according to the embodied agent paradigm and verified on the two-arm service robot both in simulation and on hardware. Due to the general description that follows system engineering standards, the method can be easily modified or applied to similar systems.},

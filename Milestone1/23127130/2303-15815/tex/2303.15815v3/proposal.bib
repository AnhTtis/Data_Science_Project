	abstract = {Analogous to a classical link diagram, a surface-link can be generically projected to 3-space and given crossing information to create a broken sheet diagram. The triple point number of a surface-link is the minimal number of triple points among all broken sheet diagrams that lift to that surface-link. This paper generalizes a family of Oshiro to show that there are non-split surface-links of arbitrarily many trivial components whose triple point number can be made arbitrarily large.},

Another application is a smooth version of a result of Homma and Nagase on a set of moves for regular homotopies of surfaces.},

On the other hand the knot quandle can still be defined in the case where the links or surface-links are not oriented, but in this case it cannot be used to construct homological invariants. Here we introduce the notion of a quandle with a good involution, and its homology groups. We can use them to construct invariants of unoriented links and unoriented, or non-orientable, surface-links in 4-space. },

	abstract = {The 2-twist spun trefoil is an example of a sphere that is knotted in 4-dimensional space. A proof is given in this paper that this sphere is distinct from the same sphere with its orientation reversed. Our proof is based on a state-sum invariant for knotted surfaces developed via a cohomology theory of racks and quandles (also known as distributive groupoids). A quandle is a set with a binary operation -- the axioms of which model the Reidemeister moves in classical knot theory. Colorings of diagrams of knotted curves and surfaces by quandle elements, together with cocycles of quandles, are used to define state-sum invariants for knotted circles in 3-space and knotted surfaces in 4-space. Cohomology groups of various quandles are computed herein and applied to the study of the state-sum invariants. Non-triviality of the invariants is proved for a variety of knots and links, and conversely, knot invariants are used to prove non-triviality of cohomology for a variety of quandles.},

By using symmetric quandles, symmetric quandle cocycle invariants are also defined for unoriented links and surface-links via broken surface diagrams. A marked graph diagram is a link diagram possibly with 4-valent vertices equipped with markers. Lomonaco, Jr. and Yoshikawa introduced a method of describing surface-links by using marked graph diagrams. In this paper, we give interpretations of these quandle cocycle invariants in terms of marked graph diagrams, and introduce a method of computing them from marked graph diagrams. },

	abstract = {A necessary and sufficient condition for an immersed surface in 3-space to be lifted to an embedding in 4-space is given in terms of colorings of the preimage of the double point set. Giller's example and two new examples of non-liftable generic surfaces in 3-space are presented. One of these examples has branch points. The other is based on a construction similar to the construction of Giller's example in which the orientation double cover of a surface with odd Euler characteristic is immersed in general position. A similar example is shown to be liftable with an explicit lifting given. The problem of lifting is discussed in relation to the theory of surface braids. Finally, the orientations of the double point sets are studied in relation to the lifting problem.},

@article{MZ,
	abstract = {A common theme in low-dimensional topology is to split a complicated space into simple pieces and to study how these pieces can be glued back together to recover the total space. For example, a bridge splitting of a knotted loop in standard 3D space R3 cuts the loop into two collections of unknotted arcs. In dimension four, the interesting knotted objects are surfaces, and in previous work, the authors merged ideas from bridge splitting and trisection theories to define bridge trisections, novel decompositions of knotted surfaces in standard four-dimensional space R4. In this paper, we define generalized bridge trisections for knotted surfaces in more complicated four-dimensional spaces, offering a different approach to knotted surface theory.We prove that every smoothly embedded surface in a 4-manifold can be isotoped to be in bridge position with respect to a given trisection of the ambient 4-manifold; that is, after isotopy, the surface meets components of the trisection in trivial disks or arcs. Such a decomposition, which we call a generalized bridge trisection, extends the authors{\textquoteright} definition of bridge trisections for surfaces in S4. Using this construction, we give diagrammatic representations called shadow diagrams for knotted surfaces in 4-manifolds. We also provide a low-complexity classification for these structures and describe several examples, including the important case of complex curves inside ℂℙ2. Using these examples, we prove that there exist exotic 4-manifolds with (g,0){\textemdash}trisections for certain values of g. We conclude by sketching a conjectural uniqueness result that would provide a complete diagrammatic calculus for studying knotted surfaces through their shadow diagrams.},

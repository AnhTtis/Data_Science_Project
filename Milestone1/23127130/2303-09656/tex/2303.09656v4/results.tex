 %\subsection{Demographic survey}
 %Table \ref{TableParticipants} shows the self reported demographic information of the respondents, who responded to our credibility rating task. Due to problems in the data collection, demographic information is missing for one participant in the Toloka platform and 3 participants from the Prolific platform. As can be seen, on average the respondents from the Prolific platform are 10 years older than the Toloka platform. Slight majority of 54\% identify as male of the respondents from Toloka platform, while a slight majority (52\%) identifies as female on the prolific platform. Three respondents identified their gender as other in the Toloka platform. Majority of respondents identify as white on both platforms, with the total of 400 being around 83\% of the sample. The most common nationality for respondents from Toloka platform is Russia, and for Prolific platform it is United Kingdom. For both platforms, most commonly reported educational level reported is Bachelor' degree, followed by a high school diploma and a Masters' degree at third.

In this study, we were interested in how content-related issues (i.e., prior belief consistency and evidence type), source characteristics (i.e., source expertise, ethnicity and gender), and crowdsourcing platform (i.e. Toloka or Prolific) were associated with reader's credibility evaluations of short social media posts when the posts' topic controlled for. Specifically, we were interested in the relative impact of the identified factors on the perceived credibility of social media posts containing accurate or inaccurate health claims. Descriptive statistics are shown in Table \ref{TableDesc}. We ran the CLMM analyses separately for credibility evaluations of the posts with accurate and inaccurate knowledge claims. A Likelihood-ratio test between full models and their null model counterparts, that is, models without predictors, showed a good fit, with both being statistically significant at the \textit{p} < .001 level.


%Table \ref{Chisquare} shows model fit with likelihood-ratio test, and multiple Pseudo Rsquared effect-size measures.

Results of the CLMM analysis are presented in Table \ref{TableAcc} for the posts with accurate claims and in Table \ref{TableInacc} for the posts with inaccurate claims. As assumed, the content-related issues (i.e., prior belief consistency and evidence type) affected readers' credibility evaluations of the posts regardless of whether the claims were accurate or inaccurate. As shown in Tables \ref{TableAcc} and \ref{TableInacc}, participants'  prior beliefs especially affected their credibility evaluations. The more consistent participants' prior beliefs were with the claim of the post, the more credible the message was evaluated as being. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) between evaluations of the very high consistency posts and the very low consistency posts were -0.71 for posts with accurate claims and -1.17 for posts with inaccurate claims. 
 
The role of evidence type in credibility evaluation was small. When other evidence types were compared to research evidence (posts with accurate claims), the effect sizes ranged from 0.11 to -0.18, and when compared to testimony (posts with inaccurate claims), the effect sizes ranged from 0.01 to -0.18. Notably, for the posts with accurate claims, the posts with testimony were evaluated the most credible, testimony being 1.21 times more likely to be evaluated credible than research evidence. When evaluating posts with inaccurate claims, readers evaluated the posts with testimony and consensus similar in credibility.


In terms of the source characteristics, the expertise of the source affected credibility evaluations, whereas source gender and ethnicity did not have any effect. The posts written by the expert sources, that is professor of medicine or nurse education practitioner, were evaluated to be more credible than posts by non-expert sources. Cohen's d varied from -0.43 to -0.62 when the expert sources were compared to the parent and from -0.39 to -0.49 when the expert sources were compared to the professional lifestyle blogger.

In terms of contextual attributes of the crowdworkers themselves, the choice of data collection platform had a notable impact on our results. Participants from the Toloka platform tended to perceive both kinds of posts as more credible, whether they contained accurate or inaccurate claims. %Specifically, a post containing an accurate claim was twice as likely to receive a higher credibility rating on the Toloka platform compared to the Prolific platform (d = 0.38).
This disparity between the platforms was even more pronounced for posts containing inaccurate claims (d = 0.57), with a post of this nature being 2.83 times more likely to be rated higher on the Toloka platform compared to Prolific platform. 

To sum up, our results suggest that adults' prior beliefs play a considerable role in the credibility evaluation of short social media posts across different sources (See Figure \ref{fig:pbsource}). This is particularly significant when adults face inaccurate information on social media. Furthermore, adult readers seem to pay more attention to source features indicating the source's expertise than to the quality of the evidence (See Figure \ref{fig:evidencesource}). For example, regardless of evidence type used in the arguments, participants trusted the posts by the professor of medicine more than those by the parent. Finally, adults’ credibility evaluations differed significantly across the two crowdsourcing platforms, such that crowdworkers in the Toloka platform tended to evaluate the credibility of the inaccurate posts, in particular, higher than crowdworkers in the Prolific platform.

%Messages with claims from consensus and personal experience are rated as less credible than claims with research evidence, with odds ratios of 0.75 and 0.67 respectively. For inaccurate claims, the evidence type of consensus and testimony are rated most credible, with messages with claim evidence of personal experience rated the least credible. However, based on Cohen's d, the effect sizes are very small for most of the differences between claim types for both the model for accurate and the model for inaccurate claims. Only exception is for the accurate model, where the difference between research evidence and personal experience is small.


%Cumulative link mixed model was used to examine relationships between varied factors in the social media post and the perceived credibility of posts. The model explaining the credibility of accurate claims is shown in Table \ref{TableAcc} and the model explaining the credibility of inaccurate claims is shown in table \ref{TableInacc}. Likelihood-ratio test between the model and a null model, containing only random effects structure, is shown in Table \ref{Chisquare} for both accurate and inaccurate claims. Similarly, multiple pseudo-rsquared indices are presented there. Based on the likelihood-ratio test, the full model offers a significantly better fit than a null model for both accurate and inaccurate claims.

%For fixed effect terms, the estimate is the estimated relationship between the fixed effect term on the same row and the perceived credibility. The p-value describes how likely it is that the relationship (estimate) is by random chance, where we interpret p-values of less than 0.05 as statistically significant relationships. The odds ratio quantifies the likelihood that credibility of the post is either higher or lower than the default term in the model.

%Descriptives for credibility evaluations by independent variables are presented in Table \ref{TableDesc}. 

%First, the social media posts with accurate claims were evaluated more credible than inaccurate claims. Accurate claim is  more than 1.8 times more likely to be evaluated more credible than inaccurate claim.


%The topic of the message affects the perceived credibility for both accurate and inaccurate claims. For accurate messages, the topic vitamin D is seen as the most credible, followed by food, meat, vaccines and fish oil. Messages with the topic vitamin D is 4.73 times more likely to be credible than a message with the topic fish oil for accurate claims, and this difference is large based on Cohen's d. In comparison to fish oil, messages with topic food are 4.1 times more likely to be rated credible, and this difference is medium. The topic meat is 1.87 times more likely to be credible, and this difference is small. Lastly for accurate messages, the topic vaccine 1.48 times more likely to be credible than the topic fish oil, and the difference is small. 

%Similar results are true for inaccurate claims. However, there the credibility is partly in reverse order, with messages with the topic of fishoil rated the most credible. Second most credible are messages with the topic meat, and then in order food, vaccines and vitamin d. Based on Cohen's D, the difference between fish oil and vitamin d is large, the difference between fish oil and food is medium, and the rest of the differences are small.


%Claims with consensus as evidence do not differ statistically from claims with personal experience as evidence. Post-hoc test in Table \ref{Post-hoc} shows that the difference between expert testimony and research evidence is also statistically significant, with messages containing testimony evidence rated more credible.

%Also the topic of the health claim had an effect on the credibility evaluation. Most credible topic was the claims made about food safety, and claims made about aluminum in vaccines were the least credible. Claims made about food safety were more than 1.8 more likely to be evaluated higher than a claim about vaccine safety. Claims made about vitamin D, red processed meat and fish oil have similar credibility evaluations, as they are all less credible than claims about food safety, but more credible than claims about vaccine safety. They are all between 1.38 and 1.45 more likely to be evaluated more credible than claims about vaccine safety.

%For both accurate and inaccurate claims the perceived credibility of different authors follows the same ranking, with generally professor being seen the most credible, nurse education practitioner the second most credible, blogger the second least credible and parent the least credible. For accurate messages, professor is 3.08 times more likely to be perceived more credible than parent, and based on Cohen's d the difference is medium. For inaccurate messages, the professor 2.24 times more likely to perceived more credible than parent, with the difference being small. For nurse education practitioner, the same evaluations are 2.33 and small, and 2.21 and small for accurate and inaccurate messages respectively. For the blogger the same numbers are 1.28 and very small, and 1.16 and very small.

%For accurate claims, credible author is the professor of medicine, with the nurse education practitioner being the second most credible. The claims made by the parent are the least credible, and the claims made by the lifestyle blogger the seconds least credible. Claims made by the professor were 2.9 more likely to be evaluated more credible than the parent, with the same ratio being around 2.2 between nurse education practitioner and the parent, and 1.3 with blogger and the parent.

%Table \ref{Post-hoc} shows post-hoc tests between blogger, nurse education practitioner and professor, showing that the differences between these authors are statistically significant. 



%The credibility evaluations were consistent with prior beliefs.


%There is also a significant difference between evaluators from the two crowd-sourcing platforms used. Evaluators from the Toloka platform are more than twice as likely to rate a claim more credible than a rater from the Prolific platform. We have added platform specific descriptives and CLM models to the appendix. The main difference between the platforms is the credibility of different topics, though similarities can be found, with claims related to vaccine safety being least credible in both platforms.

%Lastly, in our sample, the gender or ethnicity of the author were not associated with the credibility evaluation of the social media message, as all differences are statistically not significant.

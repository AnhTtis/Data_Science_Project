Three types of heuristics were examined, including authority, identity, and bandwagon cues. Findings suggest that all three heuristics impacted source credibility perceptions to some extent. Authority cues most strongly influenced source credibility perceptions, and cue-cumulative effects were demonstrated in which different heuristics triggered by different agency cues increased perceptions of credibility. Moreover, the presence of retweets reduced perceptions of source credibility compared to conditions with no retweets.}

abstract = {The electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) literature supports the robust finding that negative reviews are generally more influential to consumer behavior than positive ones. Moreover, recent studies suggest that much of the negativity bias is driven by the distinct emotions embedded in the content of negative word-of-mouth (NWOM) and the interaction effects between emotions and other source factors. Although the gender of the information source is a common heuristic used in message evaluation, this is the first study to examine the effect of gender stereotypes on emotional NWOM. Two web-based experiments show that when reviewer reputation cues are present, emotional content in NWOM lowers the credibility of male reviewers and the helpfulness of their reviews, but does not affect female-authored reviews. In contrast, when reputation cues are absent, the presence of emotions in NWOM lowers the credibility of female reviewers, but not that of male reviewers. The reputation cue has a positive effect on NWOM credibility and helpfulness. Findings help companies understand the impact of gender stereotypes in online NWOM and detect the most helpful NWOM in order to correct product issues and improve future eWOM.}

Research indicates that medical professionals do not author an extensive amount of health information available on the Internet. This creates a possibility for false information, thereby potentially leading ill people away from proper care. One way to begin addressing this problem is to assess perceptions of credibility about information found online. A between-groups, 2 (message type) Ã— 3 (source type) factorial design was tested by manipulating source expertise (high, medium, low) and content knowledge (known and unknown). While findings did not indicate a significant interaction between source and content type, they did indicate an overall tendency to rate all information as relatively credible. In addition, results indicate that both knowledge of content and source expertise affect perceptions of online health information.}",

abstract = {Collaborative argumentation in education, where students work together to construct and critique arguments, is an important social practice in many disciplines and can also develop conceptual understanding. This article addresses the evolution of my research agenda on collaborative argumentation from just scaffolding the generation of counterarguments and rebuttals in students' discourse toward what I call critical, integrative argumentation (CIA). The CIA framework involves teaching students to ask critical questions to assess the strength and cogency of arguments. It also involves generating, in addition to conventional refutations, integrative refutations that (a) weigh costs and benefits (or for scientific arguments, the evidence for and plausibility of alternative models), or (b) involve design arguments (or for scientific arguments, the integration of multiple factors and constraints). Issues related to terminology, instruction, student learning progressions, teachers' professional learning, public discourse, and the need to teach complex, critical thinking to students are discussed.},

Due to lockdowns, online studies often became the only available option for behavioral economists, sociologists, and political scientists. The use of the most well-known platforms, such as mTurk, was so intensive that the quality of data was harmed. However, even before the pandemic-induced quality crisis, online studies were limited in scope; real-time interactions between participants were hard to achieve due to the large proportion of drop-outs and issues with creating stable groups. Using the relatively unknown crowdsourcing platform, Toloka, we successfully ran several multi-round interactive experiments. Toloka’s sizeable online population, fairly low exposure of participants to sociological surveys and behavioral studies, and convenient application programming interface can make it a useful addition to the toolbox of an experimentalist who needs to run behavioral studies that require real-time interactions between participants.}

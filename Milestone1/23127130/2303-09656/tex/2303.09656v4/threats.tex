%\section{Limitations}\label{sec:threats}

%The order in which the tasks are shown to participants can have an effect, as learning can have an effect on the evaluations. There are downsides to both purely randomizing the order the tasks are given, and predefined batches of tasks. With predefined batches all scenarios are always in the same order, meaning the same scenario is always the first of the batch. With purely randomized tasks participants might get very similar tasks many times in a row.

%Completing tasks in a very fast manner to maximise income is a potential threat to validity in all studies using crowd-sourcing according to \cite{gadiraju2015understanding}. We combated this threat by using filters in both crowdsourcing platforms, by filtering only the top-performing workers for our tasks. We also controlled for the duration of the task by including it as a random effect in our models.

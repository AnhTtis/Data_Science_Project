\section{Future Work}

While using simulation was necessary for making it tractable to evaluate hundreds of different morphologies, a natural next step is to build the final optimized robot design in the real world and test its performance against the simulation results.
Another extension of our work is to include sensor placement during the optimization as well as evaluating on more complex task distributions.
Investigations in those directions could help us discover some unconventional designs that are overlooked by human engineers.

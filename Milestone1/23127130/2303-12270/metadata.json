    "abstract": "While the performance of deep convolutional neural networks for image super-resolution (SR) has improved significantly, the rapid increase of memory and computation requirements hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Quantized networks, especially binary neural networks (BNN) for SR have been proposed to significantly improve the model inference efficiency but suffer from large performance degradation. We observe the activation distribution of SR networks demonstrates very large pixel-to-pixel, channel-to-channel, and image-to-image variation, which is important for high performance SR but gets lost during binarization. To address the problem, we propose two effective methods, including the spatial re-scaling as well as channel-wise shifting and re-scaling, which augments binary convolutions by retaining more spatial and channel-wise information. Our proposed models, dubbed EBSR, demonstrate superior performance over prior art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively across different datasets and different model sizes. Specifically, for x4 SR on Set5 and Urban100, EBSRlight improves the PSNR by 0.31 dB and 0.28 dB compared to SRResNet-E2FIF, respectively, while EBSR outperforms EDSR-E2FIF by 0.29 dB and 0.32 dB PSNR, respectively.",

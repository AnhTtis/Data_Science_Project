\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we observe the large pixel-to-pixel, channel-to-channel, and image-to-image variations in FP SR networks, which contain important detailed information for SR. To preserve these information in BNNs, we first construct a strong baseline utilizing robust binarization methods and propose the spatial re-scaling as well as channel-wise shifting and re-scaling methods. Then we construct EBSR, EBSR-light, and EBSR-SQ. Compared to the prior art, the proposed models capture more detailed information for SR and significantly bridge the performance gap between BNN and FP SR networks in low computation and memory costs. Specifically, EBSR-light improves the PSNR by 0.31 dB and 0.28 dB compared to SRResNet-E2FIF while EBSR outperforms
EDSR-E2FIF by 0.29 dB and 0.32 dB PSNR for $\times 4$ SR on Set5 and Urban100 respectively.

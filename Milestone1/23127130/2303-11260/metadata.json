    "abstract": "We study nearly geodesic immersions in higher rank symmetric spaces of non-compact type, which we define as immersions that satisfy a bound on their fundamental form, generalizing the notion of immersions in hyperbolic space with principal curvature in $(-1,1)$. This notion depends on the choice of a flag manifold embedded in the visual boundary, and immersions satisfying this bound admit a natural domain in this flag manifold that comes with a fibration. As an application we give an explicit fibration of some domains of discontinuity for some Anosov representations. Our method can be applied in particular to some $Θ$-positive representations for each notion of $Θ$-positivity.",

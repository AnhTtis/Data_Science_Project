    "abstract": "Phase change materials, which show different electrical characteristics across the phase transitions, have attracted considerable research attention for their potential electronic device applications. Materials with metal-to-insulator or charge density wave (CDW) transitions such as VO2 and 1T-TaS2 have demonstrated voltage oscillations due to their robust bi-state resistive switching behavior with some basic neuronal characteristics. BaTiS3 is a small bandgap ternary chalcogenide that has recently reported the emergence CDW order below 245 K. Here, we report on the discovery of DC voltage / current-induced reversible threshold switching in BaTiS3 devices between a CDW phase and a room temperature semiconducting phase. The resistive switching behavior is consistent with a Joule heating scheme and sustained voltage oscillations with a frequency of up to 1 kHz has been demonstrated by leveraging the CDW phase transition and the associated negative differential resistance. Strategies of reducing channel sizes and improving thermal management may further improve the device performance. Our findings establish BaTiS3 as a promising CDW material for future energy-efficient electronics, especially for neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "The utility of a matrix satisfying the Strong Spectral Property has been well established particularly in connection with the inverse eigenvalue problem for graphs. More recently the class of graphs in which all associated symmetric matrices possess the Strong Spectral Property (denoted $G^{SSP}$) were studied, and along these lines we aim to study properties of graphs that exhibit a so-called barbell partition. Such a partition is a known impediment to membership in the class $G^{SSP}$. In particular we consider the existence of barbell partitions under various standard and useful graph operations.",

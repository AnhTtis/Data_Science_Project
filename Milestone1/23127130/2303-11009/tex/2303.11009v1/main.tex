\begin{abstract} 
Retrieving\let\thefootnote\relax\footnotetext{* Corresponding author.} relevant items that match users' queries from billion-scale corpus forms the core of industrial e-commerce search systems, in which embedding-based retrieval (EBR) methods are prevailing.
%E-commerce search aims to discover relevant items from billion-level corpus that satisfy user queries, which is a crucial problem to meet the emergent needs of online shopping. 
These methods adopt a two-tower framework to learn embedding vectors for query and item separately and thus leverage efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to retrieve relevant items.
%Previous methods mainly adopt embedding-based networks to learn query and item embeddings, and then use the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) to return the search results. 
However, existing EBR methods usually ignore inconsistent user behaviors in industrial multi-stage search systems, resulting in insufficient retrieval efficiency with a low commercial return. 
%However, existing EBR methods usually model inconsistent user behaviors at different stages, resulting in insufficient retrieval efficiency with low commercial return. 
% However, existing EBR methods usually formulate the retrieval problem as multi-class classification while ignoring the multi-level nature of query-item relevance.
% For example, an ordered item is usually more relevant than a clicked but not ordered item to the query.
To tackle this challenge, we propose to improve EBR methods by learning Multi-level Multi-Grained Semantic Embeddings (\textbf{MMSE}). We propose the multi-stage information mining to exploit the ordered, clicked, unclicked and random sampled items in practical user behavior data, and then capture query-item similarity via a post-fusion strategy. We then propose multi-grained learning objectives that integrate the retrieval loss with global comparison ability and the ranking loss with local comparison ability to generate semantic embeddings.
% In this paper, we provide the definition of multi-level query-item relevance, which motivates our multi-grained metric learning algorithm:
% We exploit four levels including the ordered, clicked, exposed but unclicked and random sampled items in practical user behavior data, and the cross-level loss function is introduced to constrain the margin of query-item relevance between nearby levels.
Both experiments on a real-world billion-scale dataset and online A/B tests verify the effectiveness of MMSE in achieving significant performance improvements on metrics such as offline recall and online conversion rate (CVR).

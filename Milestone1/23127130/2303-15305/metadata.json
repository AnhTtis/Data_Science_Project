    "abstract": "Ranking is used in sport leagues to determine a champion and/or to decide on promotion/relegation of teams. Arguably, the best known ranking method relies on scores obtained by cumulating the points associated with the wins and the draws of all teams, which are then ranked by sorting the score obtained. There are two main problems with this ranking method. First, the meaning of the ranking is undefined, and, second, it depends on the relative value of the wins that is arbitrarily set. We remedy these issues by introducing a probabilistic model of the game results and by showing an interpretation of the ranking that is consistent with the model. We also propose a methodology to estimate the parameter of the model which allows us to objectively determine the value of the win. In particular, using data from the association football (soccer), we show that the value of the win is close to five (5) points.",

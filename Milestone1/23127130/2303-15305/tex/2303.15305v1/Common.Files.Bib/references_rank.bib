These questions are answered for the important Copeland method (CM) where, with a geometric approach, we characterize all relationships among the rankings of positional voting methods and the CM. Then, we characterize all ways CM rankings can vary as candidates enter or leave the election. In this manner new CM strengths and flaws are detected.},

	abstract = {Preference aggregation as a single consensus ranking (CR) determination, using Kemeny rule, for an input profile consisting of m rankings, including ties, of n alternatives is used in multidimensional ordinal scale measurements, interval fusion with preference aggregation (IF&PA) technique, and various machine learning applications. In spite of its NP-hardness, the Kemeny rule can be fruitfully applied at the problem size n < 20, using branch and bound method, however, it can lead not to a single, but N optimal (exact) solutions (CRs), which are strict orders of the alternatives and form an output profile (OP). An efficient formal rule based on specific parameters of a weighted tournament matrix, constructed for the OP, is proposed to convolute the OP into an exact single final CR, which can include ties. The convolution rule is validated using Borda count, applied to the OP, and the notion of ``betweenness'' relation over rankings.},

@article{Hu20,
	abstract = { There is a dearth of robust methods to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatments when the outcome is binary. This paper uses two unique sets of simulations to propose and evaluate the use of Bayesian additive regression trees in such settings. First, we compare Bayesian additive regression trees to several approaches that have been proposed for continuous outcomes, including inverse probability of treatment weighting, targeted maximum likelihood estimator, vector matching, and regression adjustment. Results suggest that under conditions of non-linearity and non-additivity of both the treatment assignment and outcome generating mechanisms, Bayesian additive regression trees, targeted maximum likelihood estimator, and inverse probability of treatment weighting using generalized boosted models provide better bias reduction and smaller root mean squared error. Bayesian additive regression trees and targeted maximum likelihood estimator provide more consistent 95\% confidence interval coverage and better large-sample convergence property. Second, we supply Bayesian additive regression trees with a strategy to identify a common support region for retaining inferential units and for avoiding extrapolating over areas of the covariate space where common support does not exist. Bayesian additive regression trees retain more inferential units than the generalized propensity score-based strategy, and shows lower bias, compared to targeted maximum likelihood estimator or generalized boosted model, in a variety of scenarios differing by the degree of covariate overlap. A case study examining the effects of three surgical approaches for non-small cell lung cancer demonstrates the methods. },

@article{Lopez17,
	abstract = {The propensity score is a common tool for estimating the causal effect of a binary treatment in observational data. In this setting, matching, subclassification, imputation or inverse probability weighting on the propensity score can reduce the initial covariate bias between the treatment and control groups. With more than two treatment options, however, estimation of causal effects requires additional assumptions and techniques, the implementations of which have varied across disciplines. This paper reviews current methods, and it identifies and contrasts the treatment effects that each one estimates. Additionally, we propose possible matching techniques for use with multiple, nominal categorical treatments, and use simulations to show how such algorithms can yield improved covariate similarity between those in the matched sets, relative the pre-matched cohort. To sum, this manuscript provides a synopsis of how to notate and use causal methods for categorical treatments.},

@article{Stijn22,
	abstract = {Abstract Inference for the parameters indexing generalised linear models is routinely based on the assumption that the model is correct and a priori specified. This is unsatisfactory because the chosen model is usually the result of a data-adaptive model selection process, which may induce excess uncertainty that is not usually acknowledged. Moreover, the assumptions encoded in the chosen model rarely represent some a priori known, ground truth, making standard inferences prone to bias, but also failing to give a pure reflection of the information that is contained in the data. Inspired by developments on assumption-free inference for so-called projection parameters, we here propose novel nonparametric definitions of main effect estimands and effect modification estimands. These reduce to standard main effect and effect modification parameters in generalised linear models when these models are correctly specified, but have the advantage that they continue to capture respectively the (conditional) association between two variables, or the degree to which two variables interact in their association with outcome, even when these models are misspecified. We achieve an assumption-lean inference for these estimands on the basis of their efficient influence function under the nonparametric model while invoking flexible data-adaptive (e.g. machine learning) procedures.},

	abstract = {The linear ordering problem is an NP-hard problem that arises in a variety of applications. Due to its interest in practice, it has received considerable attention and a variety of algorithmic approaches to its solution have been proposed. In this paper we give a detailed search space analysis of available benchmark instance classes that have been used in various researches. The large fitness-distance correlations observed for many of these instances suggest that adaptive restart algorithms like iterated local search or memetic algorithms, which iteratively generate new starting solutions for a local search based on previous search experience, are promising candidates for obtaining high performing algorithms. We therefore experimentally compared two such algorithms and the final experimental results suggest that, in particular, the memetic algorithm is a new state-of-the-art approach to the linear ordering problem.},

Intransitivities in the observed preferences are cleared away by the introduction of decision errors of varying importance. An observed preference between two alternatives that causes an intransitivity in the course of the procedure will be reversed if it is of lesser importance. The method is applicable in case one wants to take account of intensities of preference and assume these to be monotone with the probability that an observed choice coincides with a fixed underlying true choice.},

@article{Ceberio15,
	abstract = {The Linear Ordering Problem is a popular combinatorial optimisation problem which has been extensively addressed in the literature. However, in spite of its popularity, little is known about the characteristics of this problem. This paper studies a procedure to extract static information from an instance of the problem, and proposes a method to incorporate the obtained knowledge in order to improve the performance of local search-based algorithms. The procedure introduced identifies the positions where the indexes cannot generate local optima for the insert neighbourhood, and thus global optima solutions. This information is then used to propose a restricted insert neighbourhood that discards the insert operations which move indexes to positions where optimal solutions are not generated. In order to measure the efficiency of the proposed restricted insert neighbourhood system, two state-of-the-art algorithms for the LOP that include local search procedures have been modified. Conducted experiments confirm that the restricted versions of the algorithms outperform the classical designs systematically when a maximum number of function evaluations is considered as the stopping criterion. The statistical test included in the experimentation reports significant differences in all the cases, which validates the efficiency of our proposal. Moreover, additional experiments comparing the execution times reveal that the restricted approaches are faster than their counterparts for most of the instances.},

We address box-constrained (strictly convex) problems by deriving two new quasi-Newton algorithms. Our algorithms are positioned between the projected-gradient [J. B. Rosen, J. SIAM, 8 (1960), pp. 181-217] and projected-Newton [D. P. Bertsekas, SIAM J. Control Optim., 20 (1982), pp. 221-246] methods. We also prove their convergence under a simple Armijo step-size rule. We provide experimental results for two particular box-constrained problems: nonnegative least squares (NNLS), and nonnegative Kullback-Leibler (NNKL) minimization. For both NNLS and NNKL our algorithms perform competitively as compared to well-established methods on medium-sized problems; for larger problems our approach frequently outperforms the competition.},

@article{Rosati22,
	abstract = {Nowadays, decision support systems (DSSs) are widely used in several application domains, from industrial to healthcare and medicine fields. Concerning the industrial scenario, we propose a DSS oriented to the aesthetic quality control (AQC) task, which has quickly established itself as one of the most crucial challenges of Industry 4.0. Taking into account the increasing amount of data in this domain, the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques offers great opportunities to automatize the overall AQC process. State-of-the-art is mainly oriented to approach this problem with a nominal DL classification method which does not exploit the ordinal structure of the AQC task, thus not penalizing the error among distant AQC classes (which is a relevant aspect for the real use case). The paper introduces a DL ordinal methodology for the AQC classification. Differently from other deep ordinal methods, we combined the standard categorical cross-entropy with the cumulative link model and we imposed the ordinal constraint via the thresholds and slope parameters. Experimental results were performed for solving an AQC task on a novel image dataset originated from a specific company's demand (i.e., aesthetic assessment of wooden stocks). We demonstrated how the proposed methodology is able to reduce misclassification errors (up to 0.937 quadratic weight kappa loss) among distant classes while overcoming other state-of-the-art deep ordinal models and reducing the bias factor related to the item geometry. The proposed DL approach was integrated as the main core of a DSS supported by Internet of Things (IoT) architecture that can support the human operator by reducing up to 90{\%} the time needed for the qualitative analysis carried out manually in this specific domain.},

	abstract = {Far-reaching decisions in organizations often rely on sophisticated methods of data analysis. However, data availability is not always given in complex real-world systems, and even available data may not fully reflect all the underlying processes. In these cases, artificial data can help shed light on pitfalls in decision making, and gain insights on optimized methods. The present paper uses the example of forecasts targeting the outcomes of sports events, representing a domain where despite the increasing complexity and coverage of models, the proposed methods may fail to identify the main sources of inaccuracy. While the actual outcome of the events provides a basis for validation, it remains unknown whether inaccurate forecasts source from misestimating the strength of each competitor, inaccurate forecasting methods or just from inherently random processes. To untangle this paradigm, the present paper proposes the design of a comprehensive simulation framework that models the sports forecasting process while having full control of all the underlying unknowns. A generalized model of the sports forecasting process is presented as the conceptual basis of the system and is supported by the main challenges of real-world data applications. The framework aims to provide a better understanding of rating procedures and forecasting techniques that will boost new developments and serve as a robust validation system accounting for the predictive quality of forecasts. As a proof of concept, a full data generation is showcased together with the main analytical advantages of using artificial data.},

	abstract = {Summary.  We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

	abstract = {We extend the Bayesian skill rating system TrueSkill to infer entire time series of skills of players by smoothing through time instead of filtering. The skill of each participating player, say, every year is represented by a latent skill variable which is affected by the relevant game outcomes that year, and coupled with the skill variables of the previous and subsequent year. Inference in the resulting factor graph is carried out by approximate message passing (EP) along the time series of skills. As before the system tracks the uncertainty about player skills, explicitly models draws, can deal with any number of competing entities and can infer individual skills from team results. We extend the system to estimate player-specific draw margins. Based on these models we present an analysis of the skill curves of important players in the history of chess over the past 150 years. Results include plots of players' lifetime skill development as well as the ability to compare the skills of different players across time. Our results indicate that a) the overall playing strength has increased over the past 150 years, and b) that modelling a player's ability to force a draw provides significantly better predictive power.},

@article{Adams12,
	abstract = { The Rasch rating (or partial credit) model is a widely applied item response model that is used to model ordinal observed variables that are assumed to collectively reflect a common latent variable. In the application of the model there is considerable controversy surrounding the assessment of fit. This controversy is most notable when the set of parameters that are associated with the categories of an item have estimates that are not ordered in value in the same order as the categories. Some consider this disordering to be inconsistent with the intended order of the response categories in a variable and often term it reversed deltas. This article examines a variety of derivations of the model to illuminate the controversy. The examination of the derivations shows that the so-called parameter disorder and order of the response categories are separate phenomena. When the data fit the Rasch rating model the response categories are ordered regardless of the (order of the) values of the parameter estimates. In summary, reversed deltas are not necessarily evidence of a problem. In fact the reversed deltas phenomenon is indicative of specific patterns in the relative numbers of respondents in each category. When there are preferences about such relative numbers in categories, the patterns of deltas may be a useful diagnostic. },

Statistical methods based on the model provide 1) estimation of two item parameters for each response alternative of each multiple choice item and 2) recovery of information from ``wrong''responses when estimating latent ability. An application to a large sample of data for twenty vocabulary items shows excellent fit of the model according to a chi-square criterion. Item and test information curves are compared for estimation of ability assuming multiple category and dichotomous scoring of these items. Multiple scoring proves substantially more precise for subjects of less than median ability, and about equally precise for subjects above the median.},

	abstract = {The random forest method is a commonly used tool for classification with high-dimensional data that is able to rank candidate predictors through its inbuilt variable importance measures. It can be applied to various kinds of regression problems including nominal, metric and survival response variables. While classification and regression problems using random forest methodology have been extensively investigated in the past, in the case of ordinal response there is no standard procedure. Extensive studies using random forest based on conditional inference trees are conducted to explore whether incorporating the ordering information yields any improvement in both prediction performance or variable selection. Two novel permutation variable importance measures are presented that are reasonable alternatives to the currently implemented importance measure which was developed for nominal response and makes no use of the ordering in the levels of an ordinal response variable. Results based on simulated and real data suggest that predictor rankings can be improved in some settings by using new permutation importance measures that explicitly use the ordering in the response levels in combination with ordinal regression trees. With respect to prediction accuracy, the performance of ordinal regression trees was similar to and in most settings even slightly better than that of classification trees.},

@article{Arntzen20,
	abstract = { The main goal of this article is to compare the performance of team ratings and individual player ratings when trying to forecast match outcomes in association football. The well-known Elo rating system is used to calculate team ratings, whereas a variant of plus-minus ratings is used to rate individual players. For prediction purposes, two covariates are introduced. The first represents the pre-match difference in Elo ratings of the two teams competing, while the second is the average difference in individual ratings for the players in the starting line-ups of the two teams. Two different statistical models are used to generate forecasts. The first type is an ordered logit regression (OLR) model that directly outputs probabilities for each of the three possible match outcomes, namely home win, draw and away win. The second type is based on competing risk modelling and involves the estimation of scoring rates for the two competing teams. These scoring rates are used to derive match outcome probabilities using discrete event simulation. Both types of models can be used to generate pre-game forecasts, whereas the competing risk models can also be used for in-game predictions. Computational experiments indicate that there is no statistical difference in the prediction quality for pre-game forecasts between the OLR models and the competing risk models. It is also found that team ratings and player ratings perform about equally well when predicting match outcomes. However, forecasts made when using both team ratings and player ratings as covariates are significantly better than those based on only one of the ratings. },

@article{Manisera14,
	abstract = {We propose a probabilistic framework for the treatment of ``don't know'' responses in surveys aimed at investigating human perceptions through expressed ratings. The rationale behind the proposal is that ``don't know'' is a valid response to all extents because it informs about a specific state of mind of the respondent, and therefore, it is not correct to treat it as a missing value, as it is usually treated. The actual insightfulness of the proposed model depends on the chosen probability distributions. The required assumptions of these distributions first pertain to the expressed ratings and then to the state of mind of ``don't know'' respondents toward the ratings. Regarding the former, we worked in the CUB model framework, while for the latter, we proposed using the Uniform distribution for formal and empirical reasons. We show that these two choices provide a solution that is both tractable and easy to interpret, where ``don't know'' responses can be taken into account by simply adjusting one parameter in the model.},

@article{Krese21,
	abstract = {The famous Bradley-Terry model for pairwise comparisons is widely used for ranking objects and is often applied to sports data. In this paper we extend the Bradley-Terry model by allowing time-varying latent strengths of compared objects. The time component is modelled with barycentric rational interpolation and Gaussian processes. We also allow for the inclusion of additional information in the form of outcome probabilities. Our models are evaluated and compared on toy data set and real sports data from ATP tennis matches and NBA games. We demonstrated that using Gaussian processes is advantageous compared to barycentric rational interpolation as they are more flexible to model discontinuities and are less sensitive to initial parameters settings. However, all investigated models proved to be robust to over-fitting and perform well with situations of volatile and of constant latent strengths. When using barycentric rational interpolation it has turned out that applying Bayesian approach gives better results than by using MLE. Performance of the models is further improved by incorporating the outcome probabilities.},

This paper combines rating systems with Bayesian networks and presents the first published model specifically developed for prediction and assessment of the efficiency of the AH betting market. The results are based on 13 English Premier League seasons and are compared to the traditional market, where the bets are for win, lose or draw. Different betting situations have been examined including a) both average and maximum (best available) market odds, b) all possible betting decision thresholds between predicted and published odds, c) optimisations for both return-on-investment and profit, and d) simple stake adjustments to investigate how the variance of returns changes when targeting equivalent profit in both traditional and AH markets. While the AH market is found to share the inefficiencies of the traditional market, the findings reveal both interesting differences as well as similarities between the two.},

One of our results contradicts the conjecture proposed by Neumann in 2007 which states that modified Bessel function of the first kind {\$}I{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}nu {\}}{\$}is log-concave in {\$}(0,{$\backslash$}infty ){\$}given {\$}{$\backslash$}nu >0{\$}. The log-concavity holds true in some bounded domain. The application of the other results in Kibble's bivariate gamma distribution is also demonstrated.},

	abstract = {In model building and model evaluation, cross-validation is a frequently used resampling method. Unfortunately, this method can be quite time consuming. In this article, we discuss an approximation method that is much faster and can be used in generalized linear models and Cox' proportional hazards model with a ridge penalty term. Our approximation method is based on a Taylor expansion around the estimate of the full model. In this way, all cross-validated estimates are approximated without refitting the model. The tuning parameter can now be chosen based on these approximations and can be optimized in less time. The method is most accurate when approximating leave-one-out cross-validation results for large data sets which is originally the most computationally demanding situation. In order to demonstrate the method's performance, it will be applied to several microarray data sets. An R package penalized, which implements the method, is available on CRAN.},

@article{Benesty21,
	abstract = {System identification problems are always challenging to address in applications that involve long impulse responses, especially in the framework of multichannel systems. In this context, the main goal of this review paper is to promote some recent developments that exploit decomposition-based approaches to multiple-input/single-output (MISO) system identification problems, which can be efficiently solved as combinations of low-dimension solutions. The basic idea is to reformulate such a high-dimension problem in the framework of bilinear forms, and to then take advantage of the Kronecker product decomposition and low-rank approximation of the spatiotemporal impulse response of the system. The validity of this approach is addressed in terms of the celebrated Wiener filter, by developing an iterative version with improved performance features (related to the accuracy and robustness of the solution). Simulation results support the main theoretical findings and indicate the appealing performance of these developments.},

@article{Egidi21,
	abstract = {Two main approaches are considered when building statistical models for football outcomes: (1) the goal-based approach, where the number of goals scored by two competing teams is modelled, and (2) the result-based approach, where a three-category outcome (win--draw--loss) is modelled. The debate about which approach is preferable is still ongoing, although the general agreement is that any direct comparison between the forecasting abilities of the two approaches should be based on the quality of the forecasts. Alternatively, a greater emphasis can be given to diagnostic measures in order to judge the quality of model specifications, as is more customary in statistical modelling. In this paper, we develop a broad comparison of four possible Bayesian models, focusing on model checking and calibration and then using Markov chain Monte Carlo replications to explore the predictive performance over future matches. Although inconclusive, we believe our set of comparison tools may be beneficial for future scholars in differentiating the two approaches.},

@article{Zwiener14,
	abstract = {Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient outcome. Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.},

In this framework, some of the most popular solutions rely on the Wiener filter, which is widely used in practice. Moreover, it also represents a benchmark for other related optimization problems. In this paper, new insights into the regularization of the Wiener filter are provided, which is a must in real-world scenarios. A proper regularization technique is of great importance, especially in challenging conditions, e.g., when operating in noisy environments and/or when only a low quantity of data is available for the estimation of the statistics. Different regularization methods are investigated in this paper, including several new solutions that fit very well for the identification of sparse and low-rank systems. Experimental results support the theoretical developments and indicate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.},

@article{Watanabe13,
	abstract = {A statistical model or a learning machine is called regular if the map taking a parameter
to a probability distribution is one-to-one and if its Fisher information matrix is
always positive definite. If otherwise, it is called singular. In regular statistical
models, the Bayes free energy, which is defined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal
likelihood, can be asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion
(BIC), whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold.Recently, it was
proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is asymptotically given by a
generalized formula using a birational invariant, the real log canonical threshold
(RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs
in several statistical models are now being discovered based on algebraic geometrical
methodology. However, it has been difficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using
only training samples, because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution.In
the present paper, we define a widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC)
by the average log likelihood function over the posterior distribution with the inverse
temperature 1/log n, where n is the number of training samples. We mathematically
prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if
a statistical model is singular for or unrealizable by a statistical model. Since
WBIC can be numerically calculated without any information about a true distribution,
it is a generalized version of BIC onto singular statistical models.},

@inproceedings{Baker08,
	abstract = {Modeling students' knowledge is a fundamental part of intelligent tutoring systems. One of the most popular methods for estimating students' knowledge is Corbett and Anderson's [6] Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model. The model uses four parameters per skill, fit using student performance data, to relate performance to learning. Beck [1] showed that existing methods for determining these parameters are prone to the Identifiability Problem: the same performance data can be fit equally well by different parameters, with different implications on system behavior. Beck offered a solution based on Dirichlet Priors [1], but, we show this solution is vulnerable to a different problem, Model Degeneracy, where parameter values violate the model's conceptual meaning (such as a student being more likely to get a correct answer if he/she does not know a skill than if he/she does).We offer a new method for instantiating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, using machine learning to make contextual estimations of the probability that a student has guessed or slipped. This method is no more prone to problems with Identifiability than Beck's solution, has less Model Degeneracy than competing approaches, and fits student performance data better than prior methods. Thus, it allows for more accurate and reliable student modeling in ITSs that use knowledge tracing.},

@article{Rad20,
	abstract = {Summary The paper considers the problem of out-of-sample risk estimation under the high dimensional settings where standard techniques such as K-fold cross-validation suffer from large biases. Motivated by the low bias of the leave-one-out cross-validation method, we propose a computationally efficient closed form approximate leave-one-out formula ALO for a large class of regularized estimators. Given the regularized estimate, calculating ALO requires a minor computational overhead. With minor assumptions about the data-generating process, we obtain a finite sample upper bound for the difference between leave-one-out cross-validation and approximate leave-one-out cross-validation, |LO−ALO|. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that |LO−ALO|→0 with overwhelming probability, when n,p→∞, where the dimension p of the feature vectors may be comparable with or even greater than the number of observations, n. Despite the high dimensionality of the problem, our theoretical results do not require any sparsity assumption on the vector of regression coefficients. Our extensive numerical experiments show that |LO−ALO| decreases as n and p increase, revealing the excellent finite sample performance of approximate leave-one-out cross-validation. We further illustrate the usefulness of our proposed out-of-sample risk estimation method by an example of real recordings from spatially sensitive neurons (grid cells) in the medial entorhinal cortex of a rat.},

	abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

	abstract = {Consider the ridge estimate β̂(λ) for β in the model y=Xβ +ε,ε ∼ N(0,σ 2I), σ 2 unknown, β̂(λ)=(XTX+nλ I)-1 XTy. We study the method of generalized cross-validation (GCV) for choosing a good value λ̂ for λ, from the data. The estimate λ̂ is the minimizer of V(λ) given by $V(\lambda)=\frac{1}{n}\|(I-A(\lambda))y\|^{2}/\left[\frac{1}{n}\text{Trace}(I-A(\lambda))\right]^{2}$, where A(λ)=X(XTX+nλ I)-1XT. This estimate is a rotation-invariant version of Allen's PRESS, or ordinary cross-validation. This estimate behaves like a risk improvement estimator, but does not require an estimate of σ 2, so can be used when n - p is small, or even if p ≥ n in certain cases. The GCV method can also be used in subset selection and singular value truncation methods for regression, and even to choose from among mixtures of these methods.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality-based instruction is becoming an important resource to improve learning outcomes and communicate hands-on skills in science laboratory courses. Our study attempts first to investigate whether a Markov chain model can predict the students'performance in conducting an experiment and whether simulations improve learner achievement in handling lab equipment and conducting science experiments in physical labs. In the present study, three cohorts of graduate students are trained on a microscopy experiment using different teaching methodologies. The effectiveness of the teaching strategies is evaluated by observing the sequences of students'actions, while engaging in the microscopy experiment in real-lab situations. The students'ability in performing the science experiment is estimated by sequential analysis using a Markov chain model. According to the Markov chain analysis, the students who are trained via a virtual reality software exhibit a higher probability to perform the steps of the experiment without difficulty and without assistance than their fellow students who attend more traditional training scenarios. Our study indicates that a Markov chain model is a powerful tool that can lead to a dynamic evaluation of the students'performance in science experiments by tracing the students'knowledge states and by predicting their innate abilities.},

@article{Wolf20,
	abstract = {Association football (soccer) is the most popular sport in the world, resulting in a large economic interest from investors, team managers, and betting agencies. For this reason, a vast number of rating systems exists to assess the strength of football teams or individual players. Nevertheless, most of the existing approaches incorporate deficiencies, e. g., that they depend on subjective ratings from experts. The objective of this work was the development of a new rating system for determining the playing strength of football players. The Elo algorithm, which has established itself as an objective and adaptive rating system in numerous individual sports, has been expanded in accordance with the requirements of team sports. Matches from 16 different European domestic leagues, the UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues have been recorded, with more than 17 000 matches played in recent years, and 12 400 different players. The developed rating system produced promising results, when evaluating the matches based on its predictions. A high relevance of the created system results from the fact that only the associated match report is needed and thus---in relation to existing valuation models---significantly more football players can be assessed.},

@article{Brill22,
	abstract = {Tournament solutions are frequently used to select winners from a set of alternatives based on pairwise comparisons between them. Prior work has shown that several common tournament solutions tend to select large winner sets and therefore have low discriminative power. In this paper, we propose a general framework for refining tournament solutions. In order to distinguish between winning alternatives, and also between non-winning ones, we introduce the notion of margin of victory (MoV) for tournament solutions. MoV is a robustness measure for individual alternatives: For winners, the MoV captures the distance from dropping out of the winner set, and for non-winners, the distance from entering the set. In each case, distance is measured in terms of which pairwise comparisons would have to be reversed in order to achieve the desired outcome. For common tournament solutions, including the top cycle, the uncovered set, and the Banks set, we determine the complexity of computing the MoV and provide bounds on the MoV for both winners and non-winners. We then reveal a number of structural insights on the MoV by investigating fundamental properties such as monotonicity and consistency with respect to the covering relation. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence on the extent to which the MoV notion refines winner sets in tournaments generated according to various stochastic models. Our results can also be viewed from the perspective of bribery and manipulation.},

@article{Angelini21,
	abstract = {Originally applied to tennis by the data journalists of FiveThirtyEight.com, the Elo rating method estimates the strength of each player based on her/his career as well as the outcome of the last match played. Together with the regression-based, point-based and paired-comparison approaches, the Elo rating is a popular method to predict the probability of winning tennis matches. Notwithstanding its widely recognized merits in terms of ease of reproducibility and good performance, the Elo method does not completely take into account the current form of each player and their recent performances. This paper proposes a new version of the Elo rating method, labelled Weighted Elo (WElo), where the standard Elo updating is additionally weighted according to the scoreline of the players' last match. The proposed method considers not only if a player has won (lost) a match, but also how the victory (defeat) was achieved. In the empirical application, the forecasting performance of the WElo method is evaluated and compared against the most popular forecasting methods in tennis, using a sample of over 60,000 men's and women's professional matches. Overall, the WElo method outperforms all these competing methods. Moreover, it provides meaningfully profitable opportunities, according to a simple betting strategy.},

@article{Staniswalis89,
	abstract = {Smoothing splines have a penalized likelihood motivation (Good and Gaskins 1971) allowing direct application to nonparametric regression in likelihood-based models. The notion of a weighted likelihood for the nonparametric kernel estimation of a regression function is proposed, generalizing the local likelihood theory of Tibshirani and Hastie (1987). Let the data be of the form (xi, Yi) (i = 1,...,n), where xi ∈ [ 0, 1]d are lattice points and the Yi are independent random variables from a family of distributions with parameter λi = g(xi), with g having continuous partial derivatives of order k ≥ 2. The goal is to arrive at a nonparametric estimate $\hat\lambda_o$ of λo = g(xo) for a fixed point xo ∈ [ 0, 1]d. We consider the estimator $\hat\lambda_o$ that maximizes the weighted likelihood function W(λ) = Σn i = 1 W[(x0 - xi)/b] log f(Yi:λ), with f the density of Yi, W a symmetric kernel with compact support, and b the bandwidth that controls the degree of smoothing. Sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of $\hat\lambda_o$ are given. If the Yi are normal random variables with mean λi and equal variance, then $\hat\lambda_0$ is the kernel estimator of Priestly-Chao (1972). It is a weighted average of Yi corresponding to xi in a neighborhood of xo. The kernel governs the weights and the bandwidth controls the size of the neighborhood. The kernel estimator of the relative risk function is developed for censored survival times under the assumption of the Cox proportional hazards model. The weighted likelihood approach based on the full likelihood is illustrated with real and simulated data.},

@article{Ullman01,
	abstract = {Our use of language depends upon two capacities: a mental lexicon of memorized words and a mental grammar of rules that underlie the sequential and hierarchical composition of lexical forms into predictably structured larger words, phrases, and sentences. The declarative/procedural model posits that the lexicon/grammar distinction in language is tied to the distinction between two well-studied brain memory systems. On this view, the memorization and use of at least simple words (those with noncompositional, that is, arbitrary form-meaning pairings) depends upon an associative memory of distributed representations that is subserved by temporal-lobe circuits previously implicated in the learning and use of fact and event knowledge. This ``declarative memory''system appears to be specialized for learning arbitrarily related information (i.e., for associative binding). In contrast, the acquisition and use of grammatical rules that underlie symbol manipulation is subserved by frontal/basal-ganglia circuits previously implicated in the implicit (nonconscious) learning and expression of motor and cognitive ``skills''and ``habits''(e.g., from simple motor acts to skilled game playing). This ``procedural''system may be specialized for computing sequences. This novel view of lexicon and grammar offers an alternative to the two main competing theoretical frameworks. It shares the perspective of traditional dual-mechanism theories in positing that the mental lexicon and a symbol-manipulating mental grammar are subserved by distinct computational components that may be linked to distinct brain structures. However, it diverges from these theories where they assume components dedicated to each of the two language capacities (that is, domain-specific) and in their common assumption that lexical memory is a rote list of items. Conversely, while it shares with single-mechanism theories the perspective that the two capacities are subserved by domain-independent computational mechanisms, it diverges from them where they link both capacities to a single associative memory system with broad anatomic distribution. The declarative/procedural model, but neither traditional dual- nor single-mechanism models, predicts double dissociations between lexicon and grammar, with associations among associative memory properties, memorized words and facts, and temporal-lobe structures, and among symbol-manipulation properties, grammatical rule products, motor skills, and frontal/basal-ganglia structures. In order to contrast lexicon and grammar while holding other factors constant, we have focused our investigations of the declarative/procedural model on morphologically complex word forms. Morphological transformations that are (largely) unproductive (e.g., in go---went, solemn---solemnity) are hypothesized to depend upon declarative memory. These have been contrasted with morphological transformations that are fully productive (e.g., in walk---walked, happy---happiness), whose computation is posited to be solely dependent upon grammatical rules subserved by the procedural system. Here evidence is presented from studies that use a range of psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic approaches with children and adults. It is argued that converging evidence from these studies supports the declarative/procedural model of lexicon and grammar.},

@article{Corbett94,
	abstract = {This paper describes an effort to model students' changing knowledge state during skill acquisition. Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has `mastered'each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.},

	abstract = {We investigate applications of learner modeling in a computerized adaptive system for practicing factual knowledge. We focus on areas where learners have widely varying degrees of prior knowledge. We propose a modular approach to the development of such adaptive practice systems: dissecting the system design into an estimation of prior knowledge, an estimation of current knowledge, and the construction of questions. We provide a detailed discussion of learner models for both estimation steps, including a novel use of the Elo rating system for learner modeling. We implemented the proposed approach in a system for practising geography facts; the system is widely used and allows us to perform evaluation of all three modules. We compare the predictive accuracy of different learner models, discuss insights gained from learner modeling, as well as the impact different variants of the system have on learners'engagement and learning.},

	abstract = {We propose a versatile joint regression framework for count responses. The method is implemented in the R add-on package GJRM and allows for modelling linear and non-linear dependence through the use of several copulae. Moreover, the parameters of the marginal distributions of the count responses and of the copula can be specified as flexible functions of covariates. Motivated by competitive settings, we also discuss an extension which forces the regression coefficients of the marginal (linear) predictors to be equal via a suitable penalisation. Model fitting is based on a trust region algorithm which estimates simultaneously all the parameters of the joint models. We investigate the proposal's empirical performance in two simulation studies, the first one designed for arbitrary count data, the other one reflecting competitive settings. Finally, the method is applied to football data, showing its benefits compared to the standard approach with regard to predictive performance.},

We find that former professional football players have superior forecasting ability when compared to laypeople. The results give partial support to the view that a crowd forecast offers the greatest precision. Pundits generate a positive return while both the crowd and laypeople generate losses. As the prediction of multiple score outcomes represents a computationally difficult task, both groups display forecasting biases including a preference toward specific score forecasts. The results are relevant for those concerned with gambling behaviour if the forecasting strategies adopted here generalise to match betting markets.},

	abstract = {{We investigate the most popular approaches to the problem of sports betting investment based on modern portfolio theory and the Kelly criterion. We define the problem setting, the formal investment strategies and review their common modifications used in practice. The underlying purpose of the reviewed modifications is to mitigate the additional risk stemming from the unrealistic mathematical assumptions of the formal strategies. We test the resulting methods using a unified evaluation protocol for three sports: horse racing, basketball and soccer. The results show the practical necessity of the additional risk-control methods and demonstrate their individual benefits. Particularly, an adaptive variant of the popular `fractional Kelly' method is a very suitable choice across a wide range of settings.}},

	abstract = {In this paper, we use a Bayesian methodology to analyze the outcome of a hockey game using different sources of information, such as points in previous games, home advantage, and specialists' opinions. Two different models to predict the number of goals are considered, taking into account that it is the nature of hockey that goals are infrequent and rarely exceed six per team per game. A Bayesian predictive density to predict the number of the goals using each model will be used and the possible winner of the game will be predicted. The corresponding prediction error for each model will be addressed.},

@article{Gelman13,
	abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

	abstract = {We provide a uniform, general, and complete formal account of evaluation metrics for ranking, classification, clustering, and other information access problems. We leverage concepts from measurement theory, such as scale types and permissible transformation functions, and we capture the nature of evaluation metrics in many tasks by two formal definitions, which lead to a distinction of two metric/tasks families, and provide a comprehensive classification of the tasks that have been proposed so far. We derive some theorems to analyze the suitability (or otherwise) of some common metrics. Within our model we can derive and explain the theoretical properties and drawbacks of the state of the art metrics for multiple tasks. The main contributions of this paper are that, differently from previous studies, the formalization is well grounded on a solid discipline, it is general as it can take into account most effectiveness metrics as well as most existing tasks, and it allows to derive important consequences on metrics and their limitations.},

	abstract = {We seek to find the statistical model that most accurately describes empirically observed results in sports. This model has only two assumptions: a trinomial distribution of outcomes and a transitive relationship between these probabilities. The latter is implemented by imposing constraints on the outcome probabilities. To find the most likely correct ranking, we propose a Branch-and-Bound algorithm and a quicker, heuristic method. We apply the model to panel data from soccer, American football and tennis. Due to the transitivity assumption, our model has a natural application in comparing ranking systems. Therefore, we use it to evaluate empirically applied ranking schemes.},

It differs from a branch and bound scheme in that it searches the nodes of a tree one branch at a time.

When direct preferences are missing or unclear, then preferences are determined through indirect comparisons. Given that a ranking of n subjects implies (2n) paired preferences, the resultant computational problem is the determination of an optimal ranking where the agreement between the implied preferences via the ranking and the data preferences is maximized. Comparisons are carried out via simulation studies where the proposed rankings outperform Bradley--Terry in a particular predictive comparison.},

We develop a dynamic model based on the Poisson difference (Skellam) distribution which simultaneously models the two different point scoring mechanisms in Australian Rules Football, the motivation for which comes from work on predicting outcomes in soccer matches. Our model is developed in a Bayesian framework and is fitted using the Stan modelling language. Model validation is performed on the 2015 Australian Football league (AFL) home and away season.},

@article{Lasek20,
	abstract = {We introduce several new sports team rating models based on the gradient descent algorithm. More precisely, the models can be formulated by maximising the likelihood of match results observed using a single step of this optimisation heuristic. The proposed framework is inspired by the prominent Elo rating system, and yields an iterative version of ordinal logistic regression, as well as different variants of Poisson regression-based models. This construction makes the update equations easy to interpret, and adjusts ratings once new match results are observed. Thus, it naturally handles temporal changes in team strength. Moreover, a study of association football data indicates that the new models yield more accurate forecasts and are less computationally demanding than corresponding methods that jointly optimise the likelihood for the whole set of matches.},

	abstract = { Modelling football outcomes has gained increasing attention, in large part due to the potential for making substantial profits. Despite the strong connection existing between football models and the bookmakers' betting odds, no authors have used the latter for improving the fit and the predictive accuracy of these models. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model in which the scoring rates of the teams are convex combinations of parameters estimated from historical data and the additional source of the betting odds. We apply our analysis to a nine-year dataset of the most popular European leagues in order to predict match outcomes for their tenth seasons. In this article, we provide numerical and graphical checks for our model. },

@article{Ley19,
	abstract = { We present 10 different strength-based statistical models that we use to model soccer match outcomes with the aim of producing a new ranking. The models are of four main types: Thurstone--Mosteller, Bradley--Terry, independent Poisson and bivariate Poisson, and their common aspect is that the parameters are estimated via weighted maximum likelihood, the weights being a match importance factor and a time depreciation factor giving less weight to matches that are played a long time ago. Since our goal is to build a ranking reflecting the teams' current strengths, we compare the 10 models on the basis of their predictive performance via the Rank Probability Score at the level of both domestic leagues and national teams. We find that the best models are the bivariate and independent Poisson models. We then illustrate the versatility and usefulness of our new rankings by means of three examples where the existing rankings fail to provide enough information or lead to peculiar results. },

The well-known Bradley--Terry (BT) and Plackett--Luce (PL) models can be derived from the order statistics of the exponential distribution but cannot handle ties. However, ties often occur in sports, and the ability to accommodate them leads to more useful ranking models. In this paper, we use discrete distributions, principally the geometric distribution, to obtain modified BT and PL models and some others that allow tied ranks. Our methodology is introduced for some mathematically tractable and some less tractable distributions and is illustrated using test match cricket.}},

	abstract = {{A shootout is a popular mechanism to identify a winner of a match between two teams. It consists of rounds in which each team gets, sequentially, an opportunity to score a point. It has been shown empirically that shooting first or shooting second in a round has an impact on the scoring probability. This raises a fairness question: is it possible to specify a sequence such that identical teams have equal chance of winning? We show that, for a sudden death, no repetitive sequence can be fair. In addition, we show that the so-called Prohuet--Thue--Morse sequence is not fair. There is, however, an algorithm that outputs a fair sequence whenever one exists. We also analyze the popular best-of-\\$k\\$ shootouts and show that no fair sequence exists in this situation. In addition, we find explicit expressions for the degree of unfairness in a best-of-\\$k\\$ shootout; this allows sports administrators to asses the effect of the length of the shootout on the degree of unfairness.}},

@article{Hankin20,
	abstract = {In inference problems where the dataset comprises Bernoulli outcomes of paired comparisons, the Bradley--Terry model offers a simple and easily interpreted framework. However, it does not deal easily with chess because of the existence of draws, and the white player advantage. Here I present a new generalization of Bradley--Terry in which a chess game is regarded as a three-way competition between the two players and an entity that wins if the game is drawn. Bradley--Terry is then further generalized to account for the white player advantage by positing a second entity whose strength is added to that of the white player. These techniques afford insight into players' strengths, response to playing black or white, and risk-aversion as manifested by probability of drawing. The likelihood functions arising are easily optimised numerically. I analyse a number of datasets of chess results, including the infamous 1963 World Chess Championships, in which Fischer accused three Soviet players of collusion. I conclude, on the basis of a dataset that includes only the scorelines at the event itself, that the Candidates Tournament (Cura{\c c}ao 1962) exhibits evidence of collusion (p<10−5), in agreement with previous work. I also present scoreline evidence for the effectiveness of such a drawing cartel: noncollusive games are less detrimental to future play than collusive games (p<10−5).},

	abstract = {The over/under 2.5 goals betting market allows gamblers to bet on whether the total number of goals in a football match will exceed 2.5. In this paper, a set of ratings, named `Generalised Attacking Performance' (GAP) ratings, are defined which measure the attacking and defensive performance of each team in a league. GAP ratings are used to forecast matches in ten European football leagues and their profitability is tested in the over/under market using two value betting strategies. GAP ratings with match statistics such as shots and shots on target as inputs are shown to yield better predictive value than the number of goals. An average profit of around 0.8 percent per bet taken is demonstrated over twelve years when using only shots and corners (and not goals) as inputs. The betting strategy is shown to be robust by comparing it to a random betting strategy.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY We propose a class of observation-driven time series models referred to as generalized autoregressive score (GAS) models. The mechanism to update the parameters over time is the scaled score of the likelihood function. This new approach provides a unified and consistent framework for introducing time-varying parameters in a wide class of nonlinear models. The GAS model encompasses other well-known models such as the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, autoregressive conditional duration, autoregressive conditional intensity, and Poisson count models with time-varying mean. In addition, our approach can lead to new formulations of observation-driven models. We illustrate our framework by introducing new model specifications for time-varying copula functions and for multivariate point processes with time-varying parameters. We study the models in detail and provide simulation and empirical evidence. Copyright {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We develop a new dynamic multivariate model for the analysis and forecasting of football match results in national league competitions. The proposed dynamic model is based on the score of the predictive observation mass function for a high-dimensional panel of weekly match results. Our main interest is in forecasting whether the match result is a win, a loss or a draw for each team. The dynamic model for delivering such forecasts can be based on three different dependent variables: the pairwise count of the number of goals, the difference between the numbers of goals, or the category of the match result (win, loss, draw). The different dependent variables require different distributional assumptions. Furthermore, different dynamic model specifications can be considered for generating the forecasts. We investigate empirically which dependent variable and which dynamic model specification yield the best forecasting results. We validate the precision of the resulting forecasts and the success of the forecasts in a betting simulation in an extensive forecasting study for match results from six large European football competitions. Finally, we conclude that the dynamic model for pairwise counts delivers the most precise forecasts while the dynamic model for the difference between counts is most successful for betting, but that both outperform benchmark and other competing models.},

@article{Crowder02,
	abstract = {We focus on modelling the 92 soccer teams in the English Football Association League over the years 1992-1997 using refinements of the independent Poisson model of Dixon and Coles. Our framework assumes that each team has attack and defence strengths that evolve through time (rather than remaining constant) according to some unobserved bivariate stochastic process. Estimation of the teams' attack and defence capabilities is undertaken via a novel approach involving an approximation that is computationally convenient and fast. The results of this approximation compare very favourably with results obtained through the Dixon and Coles approach. We note that the full model (i.e. the model before the above approximation is made) may be implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures, and that this approach is vastly more computationally expensive. We focus on the probabilities of home win, draw or away win because these outcomes constitute the primary betting market. These probabilities are estimated for games played between any two of the 92 teams and the predictions are compared with the actual results.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a model for forecasting association football scores. The model uses a Weibull inter-arrival-times-based count process and a copula to produce a bivariate distribution of the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teams in a match. We test it against a variety of alternatives, including the simpler Poisson distribution-based model and an independent version of our model. The out-of-sample performance of our methodology is illustrated using, first, calibration curves, then a Kelly-type betting strategy that is applied to the pre-match win/draw/loss market and to the over--under 2.5 goals market. The new model provides an improved fit to the data relative to previous models, and results in positive returns to betting.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of dynamically rating sports teams on the basis of categorical outcomes of paired comparisons such as win, draw and loss in football. Our modelling framework is the cumulative link model for ordered responses, where latent parameters represent the strength of each team. A dynamic extension of this model is proposed with close connections to nonparametric smoothing methods. As a consequence, recent results have more influence in estimating current abilities than results in the past. We highlight the importance of using a specific constrained random walk prior for time-changing abilities which guarantees an equal treatment of all teams. Estimation is done with an extended Kalman filter and smoother algorithm. An additional hyperparameter which determines the temporal dynamic of the latent team abilities is chosen on the basis of the optimal one-step-ahead predictive power. Alternative estimation methods are also considered. We apply our method to the results from the German football league Bundesliga 1996-1997 and to the results from the American National Basketball Association 1996-1997.},

As such, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian dynamic model based on the Skellam distribution, where the scoring abilities are changing over time and different across teams.

We assume there is a fixed \textasciigrave \textasciigrave comparison graph\textquotesingle \textquotesingle  and every neighboring pair of items is compared k times. We will study the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce model,  where the probability that item i wins a  comparison against j equals w\_i/(w\_i + w\_j).  We are interested in how the expected error in estimating the vector w = (w\_1, ... , w\_n) behaves in the regime when the number of comparisons k is large.

Our contribution is the determination of the minimax rate up to a constant factor. We   show that this rate is achieved by a simple algorithm based on weighted least squares, with weights determined from the empirical outcomes of the comparisons. This algorithm can be implemented  in nearly linear time in the total number of comparisons.},

@article{Karlis08,
	abstract = {{Modelling football match outcomes is becoming increasingly popular nowadays for both team managers and betting funs. Most of the existing literature deals with modelling the number of goals scored by each team. In this paper, we work in a different direction. Instead of modelling the number of goals directly, we focus on the difference of the number of goals, i.e. the margin of victory. Modelling the differences instead of the scores themselves has some major advantages. Firstly, we eliminate correlation imposed by the fact that the two opponent teams compete each other, and secondly, we do not assume that the scored goals by each team are marginally Poisson distributed. Application of the Bayesian methodology for the Skellam's distribution using covariates is discussed. Illustrations using real data from the English Premiership for the season 2006--2007 are provided. The advantages of the proposed approach are also discussed.}},

Our results show that MM algorithms have the same convergence rate, up to a constant factor, as gradient descent algorithms with optimal constant step size. For the ML estimation objective, the convergence is linear with the rate crucially determined by the algebraic connectivity of the matrix of item pair co-occurrences in observed comparison data. For the MAP estimation objective, we show that the convergence rate is also linear, with the rate determined by a parameter of the prior distribution in a way that can make convergence arbitrarily slow for small values of this parameter. The limit of small values of this parameter corresponds to a flat, non-informative prior distribution.  },

	abstract = {Abstract  Previous authors have rejected the Poisson model for association football scores in favour of the Negative Binomial. This paper, however, investigates the Poisson model further. Parameters representing the teams' inherent attacking and defensive strengths are incorporated and the most appropriate model is found from a hierarchy of models. Observed and expected frequencies of scores are compared and goodness-of-fit tests show that although there are some small systematic differences, an independent Poisson model gives a reasonably accurate description of football scores. Improvements can be achieved by the use of a bivariate Poisson model with a correlation between scores of 0.2.},

For the binary scale (A < B, A > B), special cases of the models using logit transforms simplify to the Bradley-Terry model. When the same raters compare each pair of treatments, one can allow within-rater dependence by fitting the models with constrained maximum likelihood.},

Moreover as the data consists of counts the adequacy of the model can be tested in an objective way. Three examples from the literature are analysed, fitting the basic Bradley-Terry model and a modified Bradley-Terry model with ties and order effects. The parametrisation used in the case of ties is claimed to be more convenient than that of Fienberg. A test of linearity is also included.},

@article{Goddard05,
	abstract = {In the previous literature, two approaches have been used to model match outcomes in association football (soccer): first, modelling the goals scored and conceded by each team; and second, modelling win--draw--lose match results directly. There have been no previous attempts to compare the forecasting performance of these two types of model. This paper aims to fill this gap. Bivariate Poisson regression is used to estimate forecasting models for goals scored and conceded. Ordered probit regression is used to estimate forecasting models for match results. Both types of models are estimated using the same 25-year data set on English league football match outcomes. The best forecasting performance is achieved using a `hybrid' specification, in which goals-based team performance covariates are used to forecast win--draw--lose match results. However, the differences between the forecasting performance of models based on goals data and models based on results data appear to be relatively small.},

The ELO rating system is used to derive covariates that are then used in ordered logit regression models. In order to make informed statements about the relative merit of the ELO-based predictions compared to those from a set of six benchmark prediction methods, both economic and statistical measures are used.

	abstract = {This paper presents two probabilistic models based on the logistic and the normal distribution for the analysis of dependencies in individual paired comparison judgments. It is argued that a core assumption of latent class choice models, independence of individual decisions, may not be well-suited for the analysis of paired comparison data. Instead, the analysis and interpretation of paired comparison data may be much simplified by allowing for within-person dependencies that result from repeated evaluations of the same options in different pairs. Moreover, by relating dependencies among the individual-level responses to (in)consistencies in the judgmental process, we show that the proposed graded paired comparison models reduce to ranking models under certain conditions. Three applications are presented to illustrate the approach.},

The model can also be extended to allow home ground advantage. When only summary results are available, maximum likelihood estimation is not feasible and we recommend a method based on matching the numbers of home wins, home draws, away wins and away draws for each team with their expected values. We also discuss the problem of obtaining estimated standard errors. As an illustration, the suggested model is fitted to the 1993-94 English Premier Soccer League results.},

	abstract = {Abstract This article compares the forecast accuracy of different methods, namely prediction markets, tipsters and betting odds, and assesses the ability of prediction markets and tipsters to generate profits systematically in a betting market. We present the results of an empirical study that uses data from 678--837 games of three seasons of the German premier soccer league. Prediction markets and betting odds perform equally well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but both methods strongly outperform tipsters. A weighting-based combination of the forecasts of these methods leads to a slightly higher forecast accuracy, whereas a rule-based combination improves forecast accuracy substantially. However, none of the forecasts leads to systematic monetary gains in betting markets because of the high fees (25\%) charged by the state-owned bookmaker in Germany. Lower fees (e.g., approximately 12\% or 0\%) would provide systematic profits if punters exploited the information from prediction markets and bet only on a selected number of games. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A general class of regression models for ordinal data is developed and discussed. These models utilize the ordinal nature of the data by describing various modes of stochastic ordering and this eliminates the need for assigning scores or otherwise assuming cardinality instead of ordinality. Two models in particular, the proportional odds and the proportional hazards models are likely to be most useful in practice because of the simplicity of their interpretation. These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are discussed and it is shown that even here the method of iteratively reweighted least squares converges to the maximum likelihood estimate, a property which greatly simplifies the necessary computation. Applications are discussed with the aid of examples.},

Indeed, sometimes sports organizations try to maximize the uncertainty associated with outcomes of games by restricting the behaviour of teams and players so as to maximize public interest. The degree of competitiveness in a league is also known as competitive balance. In this paper we propose a very simple model to analyze the outcome of soccer matches. The parameters of this model are used to assess whether the competitive balance in Dutch professional soccer has decreased or increased over time.

The present paper describes a simple extension which allows for widely differing proportions of ties (or draws). The model is applied to some data of Keene & Divinsky (1989, Warriors of the Mind) relating to games between 64 of the greatest chess players. In addition, some more recent chess data is examined, and it is shown that the length of a chess game has an important bearing on the proportion of wins and draws.},

These models are extended to make use of covariate information and used for ranking 64 top chess players since 1800 with information on career periods. The Davidson model which allows for draws does not fit chess data well because of the large variability in draw percentages from player to player. Some new methodology including an analysis of an appropriate goodness-of-fit test is given for this extended use of the linear model.},

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden'units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

The best performing algorithm is a version of the famous Elo rating system that originates from chess player ratings, but several other methods (and method versions) provide better predictive performance than the official ranking method. Being able to predict match outcomes better than the official method might have implications for, e.g., a team's strategy to schedule friendly games. },

@article{Dittrich07,
	abstract = { This paper provides an alternative methodology for the analysis of a set of Likert responses measured on a common attitudinal scale when the primary focus of interest is on the relative importance of items in the set. The method makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of the responses than the more usual approaches such as comparisons of means, MANOVA or ordinal data methods. The approach transforms the Likert responses into paired comparison responses between the items. The complete multivariate pattern of responses thus produced can be analyzed by an appropriately reformulated paired comparison model. The dependency structure between item responses can also be modelled flexibly. The advantage of this approach is that sets of Likert responses can be analyzed simultaneously within the Generalized Linear Model framework, providing standard likelihood-based inference for model selection. This method is applied to a recent international survey on the importance of environmental problems. },

@article{Davidson70,
	abstract = {This study is concerned with the extension of the Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons to situations which allow an expression of no preference. A new model is developed and its performance compared with a model proposed by Rao and Kupper. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are found using an iterative procedure which, under a weak assumption, converges monotonically to the solution of the likelihood equations. It is noted that for a balanced paired comparison experiment the ranking obtained from the maximum likelihood estimates agrees with that obtained from a scoring system which allots two points for a win, one for a tie and zero for a loss. The likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis of equal preferences is shown to have the same asymptotic efficiency as that for the Rao-Kupper model. Two examples are presented, one of which introduces a set of data for an unbalanced paired comparison experiment. Initial applications of the test of goodness of fit suggest that the proposed model yields a reasonable representation of actual experimentation.},

	abstract = {We review the Akaike, deviance, and Watanabe-Akaike information criteria from a Bayesian perspective, where the goal is to estimate expected out-of-sample-prediction error using a bias-corrected adjustment of within-sample error. We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this paper is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.},

	abstract = {We present a new Bayesian skill rating system which can be viewed as a generalisation of the Elo system used in Chess. The new system tracks the uncertainty about player skills, explicitly models draws, can deal with any number of competing entities and can infer individual skills from team results. Inference is performed by approximate message passing on a factor graph representation of the model. We present experimental evidence on the increased accuracy and convergence speed of the system compared to Elo and report on our experience with the new rating system running in a large-scale commercial online gaming service under the name of TrueSkill.

@article{Constantinou18,
	abstract = {The paper describes Dolores, a model designed to predict football match outcomes in one country by observing football matches in multiple other countries. The model is a mixture of two methods: (a) dynamic ratings and (b) Hybrid Bayesian Networks. It was developed as part of the international special issue competition Machine Learning for Soccer. Unlike past academic literature which tends to focus on a single league or tournament, Dolores is trained with a single dataset that incorporates match outcomes, with missing data (as part of the challenge), from 52 football leagues from all over the world. The challenge involved using a single model to predict 206 future match outcomes from 26 different leagues, played from March 31 to April 9 in 2017. Dolores ranked 2nd in the competition with a predictive error 0.94{\%} higher than the top and 116.78{\%} lower than the bottom participants. The paper extends the assessment of the model in terms of profitability against published market odds. Given that the training dataset incorporates a number of challenges as part of the competition, the results suggest that the model generalised well over multiple leagues, divisions, and seasons. Furthermore, while detailed historical performance for each team helps to maximise predictive accuracy, Dolores provides empirical proof that a model can make a good prediction for a match outcome between teams x and y even when the prediction is derived from historical match data that neither x nor y participated in. While this agrees with past studies in football and other sports, this paper extends the empirical evidence to historical training data that does not just include match results from a single competition but contains results spanning different leagues and divisions from 35 different countries. This implies that we can still predict, for example, the outcome of English Premier League matches, based on training data from Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, and other countries in addition to data from the English Premier league.},

@article{Daley04,
	abstract = {The entropy score of an observed outcome that has been given a probability forecast p is defined to be -log p. If p is derived from a probability model and there is a background model for which the same outcome has probability π, then the log ratio log (p/π) is the probability gain, and its expected value the information gain, for that outcome. Such concepts are closely related to the likelihood of the model and its entropy rate. The relationships between these concepts are explored in the case that the outcomes in question are the occurrence or nonoccurrence of events in a stochastic point process. It is shown that, in such a context, the mean information gain per unit time, based on forecasts made at arbitrary discrete time intervals, is bounded above by the entropy rate of the point process. Two examples illustrate how the information gain may be related to realizations with a range of values of 'predictability'.},

@article{Roulston02,
	abstract = { Abstract The problem of assessing the quality of an operational forecasting system that produces probabilistic forecasts is addressed using information theory. A measure of the quality of the forecasting scheme, based on the amount of a data compression it allows, is outlined. This measure, called ignorance, is a logarithmic scoring rule that is a modified version of relative entropy and can be calculated for real forecasts and realizations. It is equivalent to the expected returns that would be obtained by placing bets proportional to the forecast probabilities. Like the cost--loss score, ignorance is not equivalent to the Brier score, but, unlike cost--loss scores, ignorance easily generalizes beyond binary decision scenarios. The use of the skill score is illustrated by evaluating the ECMWF ensemble forecasts for temperature at London's Heathrow airport. },

@inproceedings{Zhang10,
	abstract = {Many real world applications employ multi-variate performance measures and each example can belong to multiple classes. The currently most popular approaches train an SVM for each class, followed by ad hoc thresholding.  Probabilistic models using Bayesian decision theory are also commonly adopted.  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian online multi-label classification framework (BOMC) which learns a probabilistic linear classifier.  The likelihood is modeled by a graphical model similar to TrueSkill^TM, and inference is based on Gaussian density filtering with expectation propagation.  Using samples from the posterior, we label the testing data by maximizing the expected F_1-score.  Our experiments on Reuters1-v2 dataset show BOMC compares favorably to the state-of-the-art online learners in macro-averaged F_1-score and training time.},

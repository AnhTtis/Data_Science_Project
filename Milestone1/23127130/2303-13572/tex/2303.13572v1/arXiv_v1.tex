\begin{abstract}
We investigate the effect of resonant spin conversion  of the neutrinos induced by the geometrical phase in a twisting magnetic field. 
We find that the geometrical phase originating from the rotation of the transverse magnetic field  along the neutrino trajectory can trigger a new resonant spin conversion of Dirac neutrinos inside the supernova, even if there were no such transitions in the fixed-direction field case. We  have shown that even though resonant spin conversion is too weak to affect solar neutrinos, it could have a remarkable consequence on supernova neutronization bursts where very intense magnetic fields are quite likely. We demonstrate how the flavor composition at Earth can be used as a probe to establish the presence of non-negligible magnetic moments, potentially down to $10^{-15}~\mu_B$ in upcoming neutrino experiments like the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK). Possible implications are analyzed.

\textbf{\emph{Introduction}.--} Wolfgang Pauli's 1930 letter \cite{Pauli:1930pc} not only postulates the neutrino's existence as an explanation for the apparent non-conservation of energy in radioactive decay but also suggests that these elusive particles possess a mass, along with non-zero magnetic moments. Later, in 1954, Cowan \textit{et al.} set the first limits on neutrino magnetic moments \cite{Cowan:1954pq}, even before neutrinos were discovered and Bernstein \textit{et al.} did a survey \cite{Bernstein:1963qh} of the experimental information on neutrino electromagnetic properties. In the late 80s and early 90s, the study of neutrino magnetic moments became a popular topic  in addressing the solar neutrino problem. In recent decades, several experiments have discovered neutrino oscillations, which conclusively demonstrated that neutrinos have masses and mixing, indicating the need for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). In such BSM theories, neutrinos establish interactions with photons via quantum loop correction, even though neutrinos are immune to electromagnetic interaction in the Standard Model (SM)\footnote{In SM, the chiral symmetry obeyed by massless neutrinos demands $\mu_\nu=0$. In the minimal $\text{SM}+\nu_R$ scenario, $\mu_\nu$ is expected to be:    $\mu_\nu = \frac{ e G_F m_\nu}{8 \sqrt{2}\pi^2} = 3 \times 10^{-20} \mu_B\, \left(\frac{m_\nu}{0.1~{\rm eV}}\right)~$\cite{Fujikawa:1980yx}.
}. There are now hundreds of potential neutrino mass models. Yet, not all models qualify to conceive large magnetic moments without upsetting neutrino masses (see Ref.~\cite{Babu:2020ivd} and references therein). 
Neutrinos with large magnetic moments can significantly impact searches at neutrino scattering experiments \cite{Beda:2012zz, Borexino:2017fbd, CONUS:2022qbb} and dark matter direct detection experiments \cite{Aprile:2020tmw, XENON:2022ltv, LZ:2022ufs}, astrophysical neutrino signals \cite{Jana:2022tsa, Akhmedov:2022txm, Kopp:2022cug, Ando:2002sk, Ahriche:2003wt,  Akhmedov:2003fu}, stellar cooling \cite{Viaux:2013lha, Viaux:2013hca,  Capozzi:2020cbu}, cosmological imprints \cite{Vassh:2015yza, Li:2022dkc, Grohs:2023xwa}  and charged lepton's magnetic moment \cite{Babu:2021jnu} (for a review, see Ref.~\cite{Giunti:2014ixa}). The presence of large transverse magnetic fields within the sun, supernovae, neutron stars, or other astrophysical objects can result in efficient spin precession \cite{Cisneros:1970nq, Okun:1986na} or resonant spin-flavor precession \cite{Lim:1987tk, Akhmedov:1988uk} of neutrinos (Lim-Akhmedov-Marciano mechanism). 

The majority of the  literature (see Ref.~\cite{Jana:2022tsa, Akhmedov:2022txm, Kopp:2022cug, Ando:2002sk, Ahriche:2003wt,  Akhmedov:2003fu} and references therein), however, assumes that the direction of the transverse magnetic field is fixed. Nevertheless, this is not always the case. In such scenarios, neutrinos travelling from the core of the supernova outwards and crossing such field configurations would encounter a transverse magnetic field whose direction changes continuously throughout their trajectory. It will introduce a new geometrical phase\footnote{The  Berry (geometrical or topological) phase \cite{Berry:1984jv} arises from the time dependency of (two or more) parameters entering the hamiltonian of a quantum system.} governed by the magnetic field rotation angle $\phi$ in addition to the usual dynamical phase, determined by the energy splitting of the neutrino eigenstates. In the early 1990s, although Vidal \textit{et al.} and Aneziris \textit{et al.} discussed the effect of such phases in the context of solar neutrino problem \cite{Vidal:1990fr, Aneziris:1990my}; Smirnov was the first to correctly recognize \cite{Smirnov:1991ia} the resonant structure of neutrino spin precession due to the solar magnetic field's geometrical phase, which was later explored by other authors \cite{Smirnov:1991ia, Akhmedov:1991vj, Balantekin:1993ys}.
However, we find that the impact of the geometrical phase on neutrino precession in the Sun is negligible, given a magnetic moment less than $\sim 10^{-11}~\mu_B$, which has been ruled out by current laboratory-based experiments \cite{XENON:2022ltv, LZ:2022ufs, CONUS:2022qbb}. One needs a perhaps unrealistically large magnetic field and magnetic moment combination for an emphatic effect. Here, we have shown that it could have a remarkable consequence on supernova neutronization bursts where very intense magnetic fields are quite likely. We analyze the neutrino spectra from the neutronization burst phase and demonstrate how its time variation can be used as a probe to establish the presence of non-negligible magnetic moments, potentially down to $10^{-15}~\mu_B$  in forthcoming neutrino experiments like the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) \cite{DUNE:2020zfm}, and the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) \cite{Hyper-Kamiokande:2021frf}. Considering a realistic setup, it will be extremely difficult to probe $\mu_\nu \gtrsim 10^{-12}~\mu_B$ in laboratory-based experiments  based on neutrino-electron scattering. Moreover, it has been argued that Dirac neutrino magnetic moments over $10^{-15}\mu_B$  would not be natural \cite{Bell:2005kz} because they would produce unacceptable neutrino masses at larger loops. Thus, the results presented here are in the borderline of the conceivable region for $\mu_\nu$.

\textbf{\emph{Evolution of neutrino system in twisting magnetic field}.--} Let us consider a system of left-handed neutrinos $\nu_L=(\nu_{eL},\nu_{\mu L}, \nu_{\tau L})$, and right-handed counterparts $\nu_R=(\nu_{eR},\nu_{\mu R}, \nu_{\tau R})$, with magnetic moment $\mu$ evolving in matter and a transverse magnetic field.  If the magnetic field rotates along the neutrino path in the transverse plane, denoted by $\textbf{\textsl{B}}= B_x +i B_y = B e^{i\phi}$, where $\phi(r)$ is the angle of rotation, the resulting evolution equation can be expressed as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:evolution}
    i \frac{d}{d r}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\nu_L \\
\nu_R
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
H_L + (\dot{\phi}/2) I &  \mu B(r) \\
\mu^\dagger B(r)  & H_R - (\dot{\phi}/2) I
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\nu_L \\
\nu_R
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the radial coordinate, $I$ is the identity matrix and $\mu=\text{diag}\{ \mu_\nu, \mu_\nu, \mu_\nu \}$ is the matrix of Dirac magnetic moments. Eq.~(\ref{eq:evolution}) is expressed  in a frame \cite{Akhmedov:1991vj} rotating with the magnetic field; see Fig.~\ref{energy-levels}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{schem_diag_1.png}
  \caption{Left: schematic representation of the rotating frame where z-axis denotes the direction of the neutrino momentum, $\dot{\phi}$ is the velocity of $B$ field rotation. The spins of $\nu_{L,R}$ are shown by thick red arrows. Right: neutrino energy levels
  in the resonance region for Normal Ordering (NO) and $\dot{\phi}<0$. See text for details.}
\label{energy-levels}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$H_L$ represents  the Hamiltonian for $\nu_L$ propagating in matter, given by $ H_L= \frac{1}{2E} U \Delta U^{\dagger} + V,$
where $U$ is the PMNS matrix, $\Delta=\text{diag}\{0,\Delta m^2_{21},\Delta m^2_{31} \}$ and $V=\text{diag}\{ V_e, V_\mu, V_\tau \}$  is the matter potential. Assuming charge neutrality, $V_e=\sqrt{2}G_F (n_e-0.5 n_n)$ and $V_\mu=V_\tau=-0.5\sqrt{2}G_F n_n$, where $n_e, n_p, n_n$ are the number densities of electron, proton and neutrons respectively and $Y_e = n_e/(n_p+n_n)$ is the electron fraction. $H_R$ is the Hamiltonian for $\nu_R$, which does not experience matter interactions, and $H_R= \frac{1}{2E} U \Delta U^{\dagger}$. For antineutrinos, $\Bar{\nu}_L$ are the ones that do not interact with matter. Furthermore, matter potentials for antineutrinos have the opposite sign: $\bar{V}_{e}=-V_e$ and $\bar{V}_{\mu, \tau}=-V_{\mu,\tau}$.

Now consider a neutrino system propagating in a background of the non-uniform matter and a rotating transverse magnetic field. As $V$ changes, strong resonant spin-flip conversion, $\nu_{L} \leftrightarrow \nu_{R}$, can occur. In the two-state approximation, the resonance condition for the $\nu_{\alpha L} \leftrightarrow \nu_{\alpha R}$ conversion  can be expressed as \cite{Akhmedov:1991vj}
\begin{equation} \label{resonance}
    V_\alpha+\dot{\phi}=0.
\end{equation} 
For antineutrinos, $\bar{\nu}_{\alpha L} \leftrightarrow \bar{\nu}_{\alpha R}$  resonance  condition is $\Bar{V}_\alpha - \dot{\phi} = 0$  and occurs at the same location. The dynamics  of spin-flip transition in the resonance region is governed by the adiabaticity coefficient $\gamma_\alpha$. Under two-state approximation, it can  be expressed as \cite{Akhmedov:1991vj}  
\begin{equation} \label{gamma}
    \gamma_\alpha = \frac{2(2 \mu_\nu B)^2}{|\dot{V}_\alpha+\ddot{\phi}|}.
\end{equation}
For our analysis, we study the three-flavor evolution (six states), described in Eq.~(\ref{eq:evolution}).
In such a scenario, coupled resonances (in which one resonance interferes with others owing to closeness) will exist between $\nu_{\alpha L}$ and all $\nu_R$ states since the right-handed (RH) states are linked among themselves as a result of mixing. The simplified neutrino energy levels in the resonance zone are depicted in Fig~\ref{energy-levels}. At high densities (to the right), $\nu_{eL}$ is heavier than all RH states since $V_e+\dot{\phi}(>0)$ is very large, but the converse occurs at low densities (to the left) where $V_e+\dot{\phi}<0$. The primed states in Fig.~\ref{energy-levels} are the eigenstates of $H_R$ and, to a decent approximation, of the whole system.

\textbf{\emph{Supernova environment}.--}
We focus on neutrinos released during the neutronization burst phase, which occurs right after the core bounces and lasts for a few tens of milliseconds. During this phase, the $\nu_e$ flux is dominant over other flavors in most of the energy spectrum \cite{deGouvea:2019goq,Jana:2022tsa}. Moreover,  collective neutrino oscillations, a significant source of complication to the flavor evolution, are expected to be suppressed during this stage \cite{deGouvea:2013zp}. The predicted neutrino fluxes during this phase have only about $\mathcal{O}(10 \%)$ uncertainty \cite{Serpico:2011ir,Wallace:2015xma,OConnor:2018sti,Kachelriess:2004ds}. As a result, we anticipate that the estimates of the SN neutrino flavor content during this period are more robust.

In this work, we explore the discovery potential of the Dirac magnetic moments of neutrinos coming from SNe with magnetic field strength $10^{10} - 10^{12}$ G in the iron core. Such magnetic fields are commonly associated with the formation of magnetar-like field structures in SN remnants \cite{Bugli:2019rax}. We define the radius of the iron core to be $r_0 \approx 2000$ Km and model the magnetic field as, $B(r)=B_0$ for $r<r_0$, and $B(r)=B_0(r_0/r)^3$ for $r>r_0$ \cite{Bugli:2019rax}. The matter potentials for $V_e$, $V_{\mu}$, and $V_{\tau}$ are determined by the matter density $\rho$ and electron number fraction $Y_e$, which we obtain from a simulation of an 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor \cite{Fischer:2009af} at $t=4.37$ ms \cite{Tang:2020pkp}. See Fig.~\ref{matter-profile} for further details.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The spin-flip transition in the resonance region is dictated by the adiabaticity coefficient $\gamma_\alpha$, which is heavily influenced by $\mu_\nu B_0$. When taking into account the electron fraction and density of matter in the SN [cf.~Fig.~\ref{matter-profile}], $\dot{V}_\alpha(r)$ varies as a function of $r$ only, while $\ddot{\phi}(r)$ can be arbitrary.  For simplicity, we assume $|\ddot{\phi}| < |\Dot{V}_\alpha|$, and we find the surface of the iron core at $[1,3]\times 10^3$ Km to be the most promising region\footnote{Note that the resonance criterion [cf. Eq.~(\ref{resonance})] cannot be achieved for  $\Dot{\phi}=0$ outside the region where neutrinos are produced, $r \gtrsim 100$ Km \cite{Janka:2017vlw}, and even when satisfied for $r \lesssim 100$ Km, it cannot be adiabatic unless considering unrealistically large magnetic moment and magnetic field combination.} as $\gamma_\alpha \gtrsim 1$  for values as small as  $\mu_\nu B_0 =\left(10^{-14} \mu_B \right) \left( 10^{12}\text{G} \right)= 10^{-2} \mu_B$G, the smallest over the whole profile. 
This is due to the fact that $\rho$ decreases with $r^{-3}$ and $\Dot{\rho}$ decreases with $-r^{-4}$, so $|\Dot{V}_\alpha|$ reduces as the distance ($r$) from the SN centre increases. At $r=r_0$, the smallest $|\Dot{V}_\alpha|$ occurs when the highest possible field strength, $B(r_0)=B_0$, is present. 

At the surface of the iron core, $Y_e \approx 0.5$ and $n_e \approx n_n$, see Fig.~\ref{matter-profile}. Thus, at this point, $V_e \approx 0.5 \sqrt{2} G_F n_e = -V_x$, where $x=\mu,\tau$. $V_e$ is a monotonically decreasing function in the region of interest, such that $2$ $\text{m}^{-1} \gtrsim V_e \gtrsim 0.05$ $ \text{m}^{-1}$. Therefore, the rate of rotation of of $B$ in the range $-0.05$ $\text{m}^{-1} \gtrsim \dot{\phi} \gtrsim -2$ $ \text{m}^{-1}$ produces a resonance in the $\nu_e$ and $ \Bar{\nu}_e$ channels, see Eq.~(\ref{resonance}), while the rotation in the opposite direction $2$ $\text{m}^{-1} \gtrsim \dot{\phi} \gtrsim 0.05$ $ \text{m}^{-1} $ produces a resonance in the $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ and $\Bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}$ channels. Futhermore, numerically, $|\dot{V}_\alpha| \approx 10^{-6} |V_\alpha|$ $\text{m}^{-1}$ at $r \sim r_0$. Using $|\ddot{\phi}| < |\dot{V}_\alpha|$ and $V_\alpha = \dot{\phi}$ at the resonance, we conclude that $|\ddot{\phi}| < 10^{-6} |\dot{\phi}|$ $\text{m}^{-1}$ and, as the resonance width is $\lesssim 10$ Km, $\phi(r)$ is approximately linear in the resonance region.

\textbf{\emph{Analysis and results}.--}
\begin{figure*}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Neutrino_spectra.pdf}
  \caption{Expected number of $\bar{\nu}_e$ events at HK (upper) and $\nu_e$ events at DUNE (lower) per time bin of $5$ ms for NO (left) and IO (right) in the time window between $-5$ ms and $40$ ms corresponding to the SN neutronization burst stage in which $0$ ms is the time of core bounce. Results are shown for the standard scenario ($\mu_\nu=0$) and for $\mu_\nu=10^{-14} \mu_B$ and $B_0=10^{12}$ G for both cases~\ref{case1} ($\Dot{\phi}<0$) and \ref{case2} ($\Dot{\phi}>0$).}
\label{events-plots}
\end{figure*}
Before analyzing the effect of non-zero neutrino magnetic moments, we briefly describe the signal for the standard  scenario ($\mu_\nu=0$). SN neutrinos are produced at the core where $V_e \gg V_{x}$ and the electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) becomes the heaviest of the three matter eigenstates, either as $\nu_{3m}$ for normal mass ordering (NO) or as $\nu_{2m}$ for inverted mass ordering (IO); while the muon neutrino ($\nu_\mu$) and tau neutrino ($\nu_\tau$) are a combination of the two remaining eigenstates. The opposite is true for antineutrinos, where the electron antineutrino ($\bar{\nu}_e$) becomes the lightest of the three eigenstates in matter, either as $\Bar{\nu}_{1m}$ in NO or as $\Bar{\nu}_{3m}$  in IO, because $\bar{V}_{e} \ll \bar{V}_{x}$. During the subsequent evolution, neutrinos and antineutrinos might cross the low ($L$) and high ($H$) Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonances \cite{Wolfenstein:1977ue,Mikheyev:1985zog,Mikheev:1987jp}. These happen when $|V_e-V_{x}|=|\Delta m^2_{n1}|\cos \theta_{1n}/2E$, where $n=2 (n=3)$ for $L (H)$ resonance. In NO, $L-$ and $H-$resonances occur exclusively in the neutrino channel, but in IO, $L-$resonance occurs for neutrinos and $H-$resonance for antineutrinos \cite{Dighe:1999bi}. Considering the best-fit values for the oscillation parameters \cite{deSalas:2020pgw}, $H-$resonance occurs at about $3 \times 10^4$ Km, whereas $L-$resonance occurs at approximately $2 \times 10^5$ Km from the centre of the SN. 
As the $L-$ and $H-$ resonances are crossed adiabatically, we can neglect intermediate transitions among eigenstates and determine the flavor content immediately out of the SN in the standard scenario by combining  the initial fluxes ($\Phi_i$) and the PMNS matrix elements. In NO, at the production region $\nu_e \approx \nu_{3m}$, so $\Phi_{i3} = \Phi_{ie}$. At vacuum, however, only a small component of $\nu_3$, $|U_{e3}|\approx 0.02$, remains as electron flavor. Therefore, only $0.02 \Phi_{ie}$ contributes to the final $\nu_e$ flux. Assuming the initial $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ fluxes to be equal, $\Phi_{i \mu}  = \Phi_{i \tau} = \Phi_{ix}$, the initial fluxes of the remaining matter eigenstates $\nu_{1m}$ and $\nu_{2m}$, which are mixtures of $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$, are also equal to $\Phi_{ix}$. Thus, their respective contributions to the final $\nu_e$ flux are $|U_{e1}|^2\Phi_{ix}$ and $|U_{e2}|^2\Phi_{ix}$. The total final $\nu_e$ flux in NO is then:
\begin{equation} \label{phi-e-no}
    \Phi_e^{NO}= |U_{e3}|^2\Phi_{ie}+(1-|U_{e3}|^2)\Phi_{ix} \approx  0.02 \Phi_{ie}+ 0.98\Phi_{ix},
\end{equation}
where we used the unitarity of the PMNS matrix to write $|U_{e1}|^2+|U_{e2}|^2=1-|U_{e3}|^2$. Similarly, for IO: $\Phi_{i2} = \Phi_{ie}$, while $\Phi_{i1}=\Phi_{i3}=\Phi_{ix}$, therefore:
\begin{equation} \label{phi-e-io}
    \Phi_e^{IO}= |U_{e2}|^2\Phi_{ie}+(1-|U_{e2}|^2)\Phi_{ix} \approx 0.3 \Phi_{ie}+ 0.7\Phi_{ix}.
\end{equation} 
For antineutrinos, at the production point, $\bar{\nu}_e \approx \Bar{\nu}_{1m}$ in NO and $\bar{\nu}_e \approx \Bar{\nu}_{3m}$ in IO. Then, we have:
\begin{equation} \label{phi-ebar-no}
    \Phi_{\bar{e}}^{NO}= |U_{e1}|^2\Phi_{i\bar{e}}+(1-|U_{e1}|^2)\Phi_{ix} \approx  0.7 \Phi_{i \bar{e}}+ 0.3 \Phi_{ix},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{phi-ebar-io}
    \Phi_{\bar{e}}^{IO}= |U_{e3}|^2\Phi_{i\bar{e}}+(1-|U_{e3}|^2)\Phi_{ix} \approx  0.02 \Phi_{i \bar{e}}+ 0.98\Phi_{ix}.
\end{equation}

\label{summary_NMM}
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now we analyze the effect of the new resonance due to twisting magnetic fields at the surface of the SN iron core. This resonance can happen anywhere in the range $[1,3] \times 10^3$ Km, before the $L$ and $H$ resonances take place and can have profound consequences to the fluxes, see Eqs.~(\ref{phi-e-no}-\ref{phi-ebar-io}), coming out of the collapsing star during the neutronization burst phase. The reason is that a sizable fraction of active neutrinos could be converted to their right-handed counterparts, effectively decreasing the initial fluxes before they reach the $L$ and $H$ resonances, \textit{i.e.}, 
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{i \alpha} \rightarrow e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma_\alpha} \Phi_{i \alpha},
\end{equation}
for the specific flavor $\alpha$ which has the resonance condition in Eq.~(\ref{resonance}) satisfied. The  Landau-Zener factor $e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma_\alpha}$ is the ``flip" probability that a transition happens between the states $\nu_{\alpha L} \leftrightarrow \nu'_{ R}$ at the resonance point.
In what follows, we analyze the limiting case of total adiabaticity, where $\gamma_\alpha > 1$. Indeed, Fig.~\ref{matter-profile} shows that for $\mu_\nu B_0=\left(10^{-14} \mu_B \right) \left( 10^{12}\text{G} \right)= 10^{-2}\mu_B\text{G}$, $\gamma_\alpha \approx 2$ and $e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma_\alpha} \approx 0.04$ in specific locations resulting in dramatic modifications to the expected neutronization fluxes. 

We obtain the initial neutrino fluxes from a spherically symmetric $25 M_\odot$ progenitor simulation \cite{garching} and consider the time interval between $-5$ ms and $40$ ms as corresponding to the neutronization burst phase. We separate the detected signal in two periods: $-5$ ms $<t < 20$ ms that encompasses the neutronization peak\footnote{See Refs.~\cite{deGouvea:2019goq,Jana:2022tsa} for the details on the neutronization burst signal.} and has initial fluxes that are roughly related by  $\Phi_{ie} \approx 10 \Phi_{ix}$ and $\Phi_{ix} \approx 10 \Phi_{i\Bar{e}}$, and $20$ ms $< t < 40$ ms which has initial fluxes $\Phi_{ie} \approx \Phi_{i\bar{e}} \approx \Phi_{ix}$. Here we compute the percentage reduction for the neutronization burst fluxes relative to the expectation described by Eqs.~(\ref{phi-e-no}-\ref{phi-ebar-io}) if the spin-flip resonance is crossed adiabatically:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{case1} For $-0.05$ $\text{m}^{-1} \gtrsim \dot{\phi} \gtrsim -2$ $ \text{m}^{-1}$, the resonance would lie in the $\nu_e$ and $\Bar{\nu}_{e}$ channels. We can account for the effect by making $\Phi_{ie} \rightarrow 0$ in (\ref{phi-e-no}) and (\ref{phi-e-io}) while $\Phi_{i\Bar{e}} \rightarrow 0$ in (\ref{phi-ebar-no}) and (\ref{phi-ebar-io}):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $t < 20$ ms: reduction of $17 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{NO}$, $81 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{IO}$, $19 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{NO}$ and $0 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{IO}$.

            \item $t > 20$ ms: reduction of $2 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{NO}$, $30 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{IO}$, $70 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{NO}$ and $2 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{IO}$.

        \end{itemize}

    \item \label{case2} For $2$ $\text{m}^{-1} \gtrsim \dot{\phi} \gtrsim 0.05$ $ \text{m}^{-1}$ there could be a resonance in the $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}$ channels. The consequence is that $\Phi_{ix} \rightarrow 0$ in all Eqs. from (\ref{phi-e-no}) to (\ref{phi-ebar-io}):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $t < 20$ ms: reduction of $83 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{NO}$, $19 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{IO}$, $81 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{NO}$ and $100 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{IO}$.

            \item $t > 20$ ms: reduction of $98 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{NO}$, $70 \%$ for $\Phi_e^{IO}$, $30 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{NO}$ and $98 \%$ for $\Phi_{\bar{e}}^{IO}$.
            
        \end{itemize}

These numbers indicate that twisting magnetic fields could have an effect on the time variation of the neutronization burst signal. In particular, Case 1 optimizes the impact of the new resonance for Inverted Ordering (IO), resulting in up to an 81$\%$ reduction in the $\nu_e$ neutronization peak, which occurs before 20 ms and is expected to be significant in the standard case for IO, see the difference between the green and red lines in the panel for DUNE, IO in Fig.~\ref{events-plots}. However, Case 2 has the highest potential for demonstrating the effects of twisting magnetic fields since it can cause a strong suppression (greater than 70$\%$) of neutrino fluxes in almost every detection channel and time window. 

Fig.~\ref{events-plots} depicts cases~\ref{case1} ($\dot{\phi}=-0.9 \hspace{0.1cm} \text{m}^{-1}$) and \ref{case2} ($\dot{\phi}=+0.9 \hspace{0.1cm} \text{m}^{-1}$) in future experiments like DUNE \cite{DUNE:2020zfm}, a $40$ Kt of liquid argon time projection chamber, which mainly detects $\nu_e$ via $\nu_e+{ }^{40} \mathrm{Ar} \rightarrow{ }^{40} \mathrm{~K}^*+e^{-}$, and HK \cite{Hyper-Kamiokande:2021frf}, a $374$ Kt water Cherenkov detector which detects mainly $\bar{\nu}_e$ via inverse beta decay, $\bar{\nu}_e+p \rightarrow e^{+}+n$. The number of detected events of $\nu_\alpha$ per energy is
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d N_{\nu_\alpha}}{d E_r}=\frac{N_{\mathrm{t}}}{4 \pi R^2} \int d E_t \Phi_{\alpha}\left(E_t\right) \sigma_\alpha\left(E_t\right) W\left(E_r, E_t\right)
\end{equation}
where $N_t$ is the number of target particles in the detector, $R=10$ Kpc is the benchmark distance between Earth and a galactic SN, $\Phi_\alpha$ is the flux of species $\nu_\alpha$ leaving the SN, $\sigma_\alpha$ is the interaction cross-section. The energy resolution functions are assumed to be $\sigma_E / \mathrm{MeV}=0.11 \sqrt{E_r / \mathrm{MeV}}+0.02 E_r / \mathrm{MeV}$ for DUNE and $\sigma_E / \mathrm{MeV}=0.6 \sqrt{E_r / \mathrm{MeV}}$ for HK. For other technical details, see Ref.~\cite{Jana:2022tsa}.
%%%%%
To study the sensitivity of DUNE and HK to a non-zero $\mu_\nu$ in the presence of a spin-flip resonance, we use the $\chi^2$ estimator
\begin{equation}
    \chi^2=\min _{\xi} \sum_{i=1}^n 2\left[(1+\xi) F_i-D_i+D_i \ln \left(\frac{D_i}{(1+\xi) F_i}\right)\right]+\frac{\xi^2}{\sigma^2},
\end{equation}
with $F_i$ and $D_i$ the number of events in the $i$-th time bin for finite and null values of $\mu_\nu$, respectively. We assume the overall normalization error to be $\sigma=50 \%$ so that the derived sensitivities are mostly dependent on the time variation of the flux and are conservative with respect to the overall normalization of the flux. $\xi$ is the nuisance parameter, which is allowed to vary in the $3\sigma$ range, and the $\chi^2$ is minimized over it. Discovery reaches for all situations is in the range $4-8 \times 10^{-15}\mu_B$ at $90 \%$ C.L. for $B_0=10^{12}$ G, see Table~\ref{summary_NMM} \footnote{However, larger magnetic fields, up to $10^{16}$ G \cite{Palenzuela:2021gdo}, are possible in neutron star mergers, and the interplay of matter effects in the merger ejecta and twisting magnetic fields could impact the perceived initial flavor ratios coming from these sources.}. 

There might be an impact from interstellar and intergalactic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ $\mu$G magnetic fields associated with very long astrophysical distances. In this situation, however, we want to emphasize that the magnetic moment-induced flux deficit is only expected to affect the overall normalization of the flux and is expected to remain constant across all time bins \cite{Kopp:2022cug}. Due to the fact that we are concentrating on the temporal variation of the flux caused by these new resonances, it will have no effect on our findings. Hence, if supernova flux is measured in the future and the flux deficit is seen to be different in various time bins, this will occur owing to the above-mentioned resonances caused by the magnetic field configuration's twisting structure.

{\textbf {\textit {Final remarks.--}}} We have shown that if the magnetic field inside the supernova has a twisting structure, then the rotation of the magnetic field along the neutrino trajectory can induce a resonant spin conversion, which will affect predictions for the event rates when detecting supernova neutrinos in future neutrino experiments such as DUNE and HK. If neutrinos are Dirac particles possessing large magnetic moments, this resonance effect will present the most optimal avenue towards unravelling the scenario at hand.

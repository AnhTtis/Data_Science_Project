    "abstract": "We present a formula for the signed area of a spherical polygon via prequantization. In contrast to the traditional formula based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that requires measuring angles, the new formula mimics Green's theorem and is applicable to a wider range of degenerate spherical curves and polygons.",

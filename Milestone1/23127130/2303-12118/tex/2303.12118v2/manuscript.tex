\begin{abstract}

In recent years, industry leaders and researchers have proposed to use technical provenance standards to address visual misinformation spread through digitally altered media. By adding immutable and secure provenance information such as authorship and edit date to media metadata, social media users could potentially better assess the validity of the media they encounter. However, it is unclear how end users would respond to provenance information, or how to best design provenance indicators to be understandable to laypeople. We conducted an online experiment with 595 participants from the US and UK to investigate how provenance information altered users' accuracy perceptions and trust in visual content shared on social media. We found that provenance information often lowered trust and caused users to doubt deceptive media, particularly when it revealed that the media was composited. We additionally tested conditions where the provenance information itself was shown to be incomplete or invalid, and found that these states have a significant impact on participants' accuracy perceptions and trust in media, leading them, in some cases, to disbelieve honest media. Our findings show that provenance, although enlightening, is still not a concept well-understood by users, who confuse \textit{media} credibility with the orthogonal (albeit related) concept of \textit{provenance} credibility. We discuss how design choices may contribute to provenance (mis)understanding, and conclude with implications for usable provenance systems, including clearer interfaces and user education.


% Current reactive techniques to combat visual misinformation, such as crowdsourcing human fact-checkers to flag problematic media and algorithmically comparing similar media for edits, are easily outpaced by the scale and speed of digital media distribution as well as increasing sophistication in media editing tools. Provenance standards illuminate a promising path forward. By allowing provenance information such as authorship and edit date to be immutably and securely chained onto media metadata, these standards can empower users to make a more informed decision about media validity without having to manually research the media's backstory themselves. However, understanding how users respond to provenance information in social media settings is not a well-studied area, despite its importance to the successful adoption of usable provenance systems. To address this gap, we conducted an online study with 595 participants from the US and UK to investigate how user perceptions of media validity---as defined by trust and truth judgements---changed upon the introduction of provenance information in a social media feed. We found that provenance mostly lowered trust and caused users to doubt the truth of media, even with authentic content. Although provenance was helpful in correcting initially misled truth judgements in deceptive media, it led participants farther away from the truth in some honest media. Additionally, signals of incomplete and invalid provenance triggered a more unfavourable outlook on media validity. Our findings show that provenance, although enlightening in some cases, is still not a concept well-understood by users, and that provenance authenticity can be easily confused with the orthogonal (albeit related) concept of media authenticity. We posit granular and high-level implications on the design of usable provenance systems going forward, with an emphasis on conceptual clarity in provenance-enabled UIs and user education.

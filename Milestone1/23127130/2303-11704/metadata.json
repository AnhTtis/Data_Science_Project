    "abstract": "Via the new weight $A_{\\vec p}^{θ}(\\varphi )$, the authors introduce a new class of multilinear square operators. The boundedness on the weighted Lebesgue space and the weighted Morrey space is obtained, respectively. Our results include the known results of the standard multilinear square operator and the weight $A_{\\vec p}$. Moreover, the results in this article seem to be new even for one-linear case.",

    "abstract": "The main observation of this short note is that methods for determining proportional representation in electoral systems may be suitable as alternatives to the pro-rata order matching algorithm used in stock exchanges. Our simulation studies provide strong evidence that the Jefferson/D'Hondt and the Webster/Saint-Laguë proportional representation methods provide order allocations which are closer to proportionality than the order allocations obtained from the pro-rata algorithm.",

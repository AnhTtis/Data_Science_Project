    "abstract": "Evolutionary searches were employed to predict the most stable structures of perovskites with helium atoms on their A-sites up to pressures of 10 GPa. The thermodynamics associated with helium intercalation into [CaZr]F6, structure that [He]2[CaZr]F6 adopts under pressure, and the mechanical properties of the parent perovskite and helium-bearing phase were studied via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The pressure-temperature conditions where the formation of HeAlF3, HeGaF3, HeInF3, HeScF3 and HeReO3 from elemental helium and the vacant A-site perovskites is favored were found. Our DFT calculations show that entropy can stabilize the helium-filled perovskites provided that the volume that the noble gas atom occupies within their pores is larger than within the elemental solid at that pressure. We find that helium incorporation will increase the bulk modulus of AlF3 from a value characteristic of tin to one characteristic of steel, and hinders rotations of its octahedra that occur under pressure.",

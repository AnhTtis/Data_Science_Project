abstract = {Thanks to the development of experimental high-pressure techniques and methods for crystal-structure prediction based on quantum mechanics, in the past decade, numerous new compounds, mostly binary, with atypical compositions have been predicted, and some have been synthesized. Differing from conventional solid-state materials, many of these new compounds are comprised of various homonuclear chemical species, such as dimers, trimers, pentagonal and heptagonal rings, polymeric chains, atomic layers and 3D networks. Strikingly, it has been shown that pressure can alter the chemistry of an element by activating its (semi)core electrons, unoccupied orbitals and even the non-atom-centred quantum orbitals located on the interstitial sites, leading to many new surprising phenomena. This Review provides a summary of atypical compounds that result from the effects of high pressure on either the chemical bonds or the local orbitals. We describe various unusual chemical species and motifs, show how the chemical properties of the elements are altered under pressure and illustrate how compound formation is favoured even in situations in which chemical bonds are not formed. An extraordinary new picture of chemistry emerges as we piece together these unexpected high-pressure phenomena. In marked contrast to the previously held beliefs regarding the behaviour of solids under pressure, we are learning that the quantum-mechanical features of electrons, such as those that lead to the formation of directional bonds, inhomogeneous distributions of electrons and atoms, as well as variations in symmetry, might be magnified under pressure. We discuss the influence of these phenomena on future studies that will probe chemistry at higher pressures and explore more complex chemical compositions than those that have been studied to date.

@article{Kurz_1982_Nature,
abstract = {Isotopic variations in oceanic igneous rocks provide important constraints on models of oceanic mantle structure. Of particular interest is the global negative correlation between 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd, which has been used to estimate 'bulk earth' values1-3 for 87Sr/86Sr, 87Rb/ 88Sr and 143Nd/144Nd. Simple two-reservoir models have failed to explain all the isotopic variations, however, because of the complicated trends in Pb isotopes4-6. This has led to suggestions that recycled oceanic crust or sediments must be considered in these models7-9. We report here the results of helium isotopic analyses in basaltic phenocrysts from the islands of Gough and Tristan da Cunha. Because basalts from the islands lie near bulk earth on the Sr-Nd correlation diagram3, the study was initiated to characterize the helium isotopic signature of this component. Whereas the 3He in mantle gases is mostly primordial, the 4He is primarily radiogenic, having been produced by decay of 238U, 235U and 232Th. High 3He/4He ratios in igneous rocks therefore indicate primordial volatiles10,11. We believe that the present results are inconsistent with the notion that the mantle beneath Gough and Tristan da Cunha is primitive or undepleted relative to mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). Helium isotopic results on basaltic glasses and phenocrysts from the rift zone of Kilauea confirm the previously reported high values from this area 12-15. We also report new analyses from Loihi Seamount (40km south-east of Kilauea), which does seem to be derived from a more primitive source. When these data are combined with values for MORBs (from ref. 16) and plotted with respect to 87Sr/86Sr, the observed trends offer insight into the different source regions for oceanic island basalts and the nature of mantle heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 1982 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The high 3He/4He ratio of volcanic rocks thought to be derived from mantle plumes is taken as evidence for the existence of a mantle reservoir that has remained largely undegassed since the Earth's accretion. The helium isotope composition of this reservoir places constraints on the origin of volatiles within the Earth and on the evolution and structure of the Earth's mantle. Here we show that olivine phenocrysts in picritic basalts presumably derived from the proto-Iceland plume at Baffin Island, Canada, have the highest magmatic 3He/4He ratios yet recorded. A strong correlation between 3He/4He and 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd and trace element ratios demonstrate that the 3He-rich end-member is present in basalts that are derived from large-volume melts of depleted upper-mantle rocks. This reservoir is consistent with the recharging of depleted upper-mantle rocks by small volumes of primordial volatile-rich lower-mantle material at a thermal boundary layer between convectively isolated reservoirs. The highest 3He/4He basalts from Hawaii and Iceland plot on the observed mixing trend. This indicates that a 3He-recharged depleted mantle (HRDM) reservoir may be the principal source of high 3He/4He in mantle plumes, and may explain why the helium concentration of the 'plume' component in ocean island basalts is lower than that predicted for a two-layer, steady-state model of mantle structure.},

@article{Hahm_2009_GPL,
abstract = {One of the most contentious issues in the debate on the origin of volcanic island and seamount chains is the significance of high 3He/ 4He ratios at such locations. The contemporary hotspot hypothesis calls for the high 3He/4He signature to be derived from a distinct source reservoir that lies deep in the mantle. The competing plate stress hypothesis claims that extreme isotopic signals, such as the high 3He/4He, come from dispersed crustal lithologies in the upper mantle. Here, we show that lavas from the East Pacific Rise - the ridge axis and near-ridge seamounts, which have radiogenic isotope compositions overlapping with other Pacific OIB, do not have high 3He/ 4He ratios. This suggests that high 3He/4He is not associated with dispersed, heterogeneous lithologies embedded in the upper mantle. We conclude that the mantle source of high 3He/4He OIB is unique to volcanic island and seamount chains and likely resides at depth in the mantle. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Strikingly, almost all types of chemical roles and interactions are found or predicted in these high-pressure noble gas compounds, ranging from cationic and anionic noble gases to covalent bonds between noble gas atoms, and to hydrogen bond-like noble gas bonds. Besides, the recently discovered He insertion reactions reveal a unique chemical force that displays no local chemical bonding, providing evidence that research into noble gas reactions can advance the frontier of chemistry at the very basic level.},

The bulk of the crystal is monotonically compressed with no detectable anomalies to 60$\%$ of the initial volume at 30 GPa. The experimental As4O6 crystal compression exceeds that obtained by various theoretical models within the density functional theory framework. The As4O6 molecules are deformed toward a more tetrahedral shape. A surprising property of arsenolite immersed in helium has been revealed above 3 GPa; the As4O6{\textperiodcentered}2He clathrate is formed in the surface layer increasingly deeper with pressure. Interestingly, this is the first example of helium clathrate formed in situ with a solid molecular oxide and proof that helium may permeate even nonporous single crystals in high-pressure diffraction studies. This indicates it is an important and general phenomenon that needs to be taken into account when conducting high-pressure diffraction studies in helium.},

abstract = {Compression curves and stability of melanophlogite, a natural mineral formed by Si O2 clathrate, have been studied up to about 25 GPa by using various pressure-transmitting media. We have studied both unheated and preheated samples to understand the role of guest gas molecules in clathrate. All the high-pressure experiments were made at room temperature using a diamond-anvil apparatus combined with synchrotron radiation. Unheated melanophlogite amorphized irreversibly without any structural transition at about 17 GPa, where the volume was decreased to about 70$\%$ of its original volume. Identical results were obtained in experiments using methane or an alcohol-water mixture as pressure-transmitting media or when direct compression was applied. Preheated melanophlogite, on the other hand, became much more compressible and amorphized only at around 3 GPa when the volume was decreased to 80%. The behavior changed completely when helium was used as the pressure-transmitting medium. The unheated sample was much less compressible but neither phase transition nor amorphization was observed up to about 25 GPa. Preheated samples had the same compression curve up to about 17 GPa, where an isostructural transition occurred, accompanied by a 10% increase in volume. This isostructural transition was a reversible process with a hysteresis of about 6 GPa. Completely different behaviors observed using helium media suggest that the small helium atom can penetrate into the cage structure of clathrate on compression. Present experimental results will provide useful information to consider the interaction of Si O2 cages and guest molecules in the clathrate structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

Experiments on this molecular solid at high pressures with different pressure-transmitting media have been interpreted thanks to state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Our results confirm arsenolite as one of the most compressible minerals and provide evidence for ordered helium trapping above 3 GPa between adamantane-type As4O6 cages.

All properties of As4O6{\textperiodcentered}2He are different from those of parent As4O6. In particular, pressure-induced amorphization, which occurs in arsenolite above 15 GPa, is impeded in As4O6{\textperiodcentered}2He, thus resulting in a mechanical stability of As4O6{\textperiodcentered}2He beyond 30 GPa.

abstract = {Diffusion of helium has been characterized in natural Fe-bearing olivine (Fo 90) and pure synthetic Mg 2SiO 4. Polished slabs of olivine, oriented normal to a, b or c-axes, were implanted with 3He, either at 100keV at a dose of 5�10 15/cm 2 or at 3.0MeV at a dose of 1�10 16/cm 2. A set of diffusion experiments on 3He implanted olivine were run in Pt capsules in 1-atm furnaces. In addition to the 1-atm experiments, experiments on implanted samples were also run at higher pressures (2.6-2.7GPa) to assess the potential effects of pressure on He diffusion and the applicability of the diffusion data in describing He transport in the mantle. The high-pressure experiments were conducted in a piston-cylinder apparatus using a special " soft" pressure cell, with the implanted forsterite samples directly surrounded by AgCl. 3He distributions following all experiments were measured with nuclear reaction analysis using the reaction 3He(d,p) 4He. For diffusion in forsterite we obtain the following Arrhenius relations: D{norm of matrix}a=3.73�10-8exp(-135�5kJmol-1/RT)m2s-1,D{norm of matrix}b=1.33�10-8exp(-137�13kJmol-1/RT)m2s-1,D{norm of matrix}c=3.61�10-6exp(-159�4kJmol-1/RT)m2s-1.The data for diffusion parallel to the c-axis define a single Arrhenius line spanning more than 7 orders of magnitude in values of diffusion coefficients, and a 700. �C range in temperature (250-950. �C). Diffusion parallel to the a-axis appears slightly slower, and diffusion parallel to the b-axis is slower than diffusion parallel to the a-axis by about two-thirds of a log unit. This anisotropy is broadly consistent with observations for diffusion of Ni and Fe-Mg in olivine. Diffusion in Fe-bearing natural olivine (transport parallel to b) agrees within uncertainty with findings for He diffusion in the pure Mg end-member olivine. The higher-pressure experiments yield diffusivities in agreement with those from the 1-atm experiments, indicating that the results reported here can be reasonably applied to modeling He transport in the upper mantle. The insensitivity of He diffusion to pressure over the investigated range of conditions suggests that compression of the mineral lattice is not sufficient to significantly influence migration of the relatively small helium atoms, which likely diffuse via crystal interstices.The He diffusivities measured in this work are generally consistent with results from the study of Futagami et al. (1993), who measured He diffusion in natural olivine by outgassing 4He implanted samples, and with the diffusivities measured by bulk-release of He by Shuster et al. (2004), but are about 2 orders of magnitude slower than the recent findings of Tolstikhin et al. (2010) and Blard et al. (2008). An up-temperature extrapolation of our data also show reasonable agreement with the higher-temperature measurements of Hart (1984); the coincident diffusivities from these studies under the high-temperature conditions used by Hart et al. (2008) in their He diffusion/production modeling supports the applicability of their modeling results. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Helium diffusion in mantle minerals is crucial for understanding mantle structure and the dynamic processes of Earth's degassing. In this paper, we report helium incorporation and the mechanism of its diffusion in perfect crystals of quartz and coesite. The diffusion pathways, activation energies (Ea), and frequency factors of helium under ambient and high pressure conditions were calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. The calculated diffusive coefficients of He in the quartz in different orientations are:D[100] = 1.24 � 10-6 exp. (-26.83 kJ / mol / RT) m2 /sD[010] = 1.11 � 10-6 exp. (-31.60 kJ / mol / RT) m2 /s and in the coesite:D[100] = 3.00 � 10-7 exp. (-33.79 kJ / mol / RT) m2 /sD[001] = 2.21 � 10-6 exp. (-18.33 kJ / mol / RT) m2 /s The calculated results indicate that diffusivity of helium is anisotropic in both quartz and coesite and that the degree of anisotropy is much more pronounced in coesite. Helium diffusion behavior in coesite under high pressures was investigated. The activation energies increased with pressure: Ea[100] increased from 33.79 kJ/mol to 58.36 kJ/mol, and Ea[001] increased from 18.33 kJ/mol to 48.87 kJ/mol as pressure increased from 0 GPa to 12 GPa. Our calculations showed that helium is not be quantitatively retained in silica at typical surface temperatures on Earth, which is consistent with the findings from previous studies. These results have implications for discussion of the Earth's mantle evolution and for recognition thermal histories of ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes.},

Structure predictions reveal two energetically stable NH3�He compounds with stoichiometries (NH3)2He and NH3He at high pressures. At low temperatures, (NH3)2He is ionic with NH3 molecules partially dissociating into (NH2)- and (NH4)+ ions. Simulations show that (NH3)2He transforms into intermediate phase at 100 GPa and 1000 K with H atoms slightly vibrate around N atoms, and then to a superionic phase at $\sim$2000 K with H and He exhibiting liquid behavior within the fixed N sublattice. Finally, (NH3)2He becomes a fluid phase at temperatures of 3000 K. The stability of (NH3)2He at high pressure and temperature could contribute to update models of the interiors of Uranus and Neptune.},

Noble gases as neutral species can serve as probes and be used for examining gas solubility in silicate melts and structural responses to any gas inclusion. Here, we report experimental results that reveal a strong effect of helium on the intermediate range structural order of SiO2 glass and an unusually rigid behavior of the glass. The structure factor data show that the first sharp diffraction peak position of SiO2 glass in helium medium remains essentially the same under pressures up to 18.6 GPa, suggesting that helium may have entered in the voids in SiO2 glass under pressure. The dissolved helium makes the SiO2 glass much less compressible at high pressures. GeO2 glass and SiO2 glass with H2 as pressure medium do not display this effect. These observations suggest that the effect of helium on the structure and compression of SiO2 glass is unique.},

The study of formation enthalpy of these structures reveals that the C2/m-II phase is the most energetically favorable structure with a pressure in the range of 40�98 GPa, while the R-3m phase is the most stable one with a pressure between 98�300 GPa.

It is of great interest whether ammonia and helium can react with each other under planetary conditions, and if so, what kinds of structures and states of matter can form. Here, using crystal structure prediction methods and first-principles calculations, we report three new stable stoichiometries and eight new stable phases of He-NH3 compounds under pressures up to 500 GPa. These structures may exhibit perovskitelike structures for HeNH3 and He2NH3, and a host-guest crystal structure for He(NH3)2. Superionic states are found in all these He-NH3 compounds under high pressures and temperatures in which the hydrogen atoms are diffusive while the nitrogen and helium atoms remain fixed. Such dynamical behavior in helium ammonia compounds is quite different from that in helium water compounds, where weakly interacting helium is more diffusive than stronger bound hydrogen. The low-density host-guest phase of space group I4cm is found to be stable at very low pressures (about 3 GPa) and it enters into a plastic state, characterized by freely rotating ammonia molecules. The present results suggest that plastic or superionic helium ammonia compounds may exist under planetary conditions, and helium contributes crucially to the exotic physics and chemistry observed under extreme conditions.},

Here we report on a detailed study of the helium-nitrogen system in a diamond-anvil cell using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and optical microscopy. We find that high pressure stabilizes the formation of a stoichiometric, solid van der Waals compound of composition He(N2)11.

Here we investigate the possibility of trapping helium or larger neon guest atoms under pressure within alkali-metal oxide and sulfide structures. We find stable helium and neon-bearing compounds at very low pressures. These structures are stabilized by a reduction in volume from incorporation of helium or neon atoms within the antifluorite structure. We predict that NeCs2S could be stable at ambient pressure.

Here we propose and demonstrate that there is a general driving force for helium to react with ionic compounds that contain an unequal number of cations and anions. The corresponding reaction products are stabilized not by local chemical bonds but by long-range Coulomb interactions that are significantly modified by the insertion of helium atoms, especially under high pressure. This mechanism also explains the recently discovered reactivity of He and Na under pressure. Our work reveals that helium has the propensity to react with a broad range of ionic compounds at pressures as low as 30 GPa. Since most of the Earth's minerals contain unequal numbers of positively and negatively charged atoms, our work suggests that large quantities of He might be stored in the Earth's lower mantle.},

abstract = {Helium (He) is, on par with Neon, the most inert element in the Periodic Table. Indeed, no conclusive proofs about stable compounds containing chemical bonds with He at ambient conditions have been reported so far. However, pressure significantly affects chemical properties of elements. By using USPEX [1], a software which has been successfully used in the past to predict unexpected high pressure crystal structure [1], we found that above 160 GPa He and Sodium exothermically combine to form the compound Na2He, whose structure is reported in Fig. 1. Quasiharmonic free energy calculations based on computed phonon spectra indicate that the free energy of formation of Na2He is negative and that the latter is barely affected by the temperature (0-800 K range was considered). In order to understand the cause of stability of Na2He, we carried out a thorough study of its electronic structure at various pressures by means of several different approaches including the examination of the band structure and the analysis of real-space descriptors such as the electron density in the framework of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules [2], the Electron Localization Function [3] and the deformation density. By examining the band structure, we found that such compound is an insulator whose band-gap increases with pressure. Regarding real-space descriptors, two remarkable features of Na2He are the negative charge on He (obtained both using Mulliken and Bader partitioning) and the presence of interstitially localized electrons (i.e. Non-Nuclear Attractors), the latter being detectable in all the analyses above mentioned. In the range 160-350 GPa, the exothermicity associated to the formation of Na2He is mainly due to the volume reduction, while at higher pressures the electronic energy plays a prominent role in the stabilization of this compound. In this contribution we present the results of our study with particular emphasis on the role played by He in the stabilization of Na2He.},

There are no prior examples of perovskites with noble gases on the A-sites. The insertion of helium gas into CaZrF6 both elastically stiffens the material and reduces the magnitude of its negative thermal expansion. It also suppresses the onset of structural disorder, which is seen on compression in other media. Measurements of the gas released on warming to room temperature and Rietveld analyses of neutron diffraction data at low temperature indicate that exposure to helium gas at 500 MPa leads to a stoichiometry close to (He1?1)(CaZr)F6. Helium has a much higher solubility in CaZrF6 than silica glass or crystobalite. An analogue with composition (H2)2(CaZr)F6 would have a volumetric hydrogen storage capacity greater than current US DOE targets.

abstract = {Perovskites are of great technological and geological importance, in large part, due to their considerable compositional and structural flexibility. However, the formation of perovskites with neutral species on their A-sites is very unusual. The formation, phase transitions, and properties of [He2][CaZr]F6, which is the first helium-containing perovskite to be made, are reported. It is likely that a large family of related materials can also be prepared. On compression in neon, the negative thermal expansion (NTE) material CaZrF6 amorphizes at ~0.5 GPa. However, on compression in helium at room temperature, the gas is inserted into the structure to form a perovskite with helium on the A-site. This suppresses the amorphization until >3 GPa. The volume versus pressure and Raman measurements suggest that filling of the A-site, to give [He2][CaZr]F6, is complete at >1 GPa. The presence of helium on the A-site in this perovskite leads to a reduction in the magnitude of NTE when compared to the parent phase CaZrF6, likely due to steric impediment of the transverse vibrational motion of fluoride. Helium also leads to considerable stiffening of the structure. At room temperature and ~2.5 GPa, the helium-containing hybrid perovskite has a bulk modulus of ~47 GPa, whereas CaZrF6 has a bulk modulus of ~40 GPa under ambient conditions. Cubic perovskite [He2][CaZr]F6 undergoes a structural phase transition at 15 K on compression, which may involve a cooperative tilting of framework octahedra to give a lower-symmetry phase, which is tentatively assigned as tetragonal.},

The elastic properties of the post-perovskite phase and its stability field explain several observed puzzling properties of the D" layer: its seismic anisotropy, the strongly undulating shear-wave discontinuity at its top and possibly the anticorrelation between shear and bulk sound velocities.},

abstract = {MgSiO3 perovskite has been assumed to be the dominant component of the Earth's lower mantle, although this phase alone cannot explain the discontinuity in seismic velocities observed 200-300 km above the core-mantle boundary (the D" discontinuity) or the polarization anisotropy observed in the lowermost mantle. Experimental and theoretical studies that have attempted to attribute these phenomena to a phase transition in the perovskite phase have tended to simply confirm the stability of the perovskite phase. However, recent in situ X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a transition to a 'post-perovskite' phase above 125 GPa and 2,500 K-conditions close to those at the D" discontinuity. Here we show the results of first-principles calculations of the structure, stability and elasticity of both phases at zero temperature. We find that the post-perovskite phase becomes the stable phase above 98 GPa, and may be responsible for the observed seismic discontinuity and anisotropy in the lowermost mantle. Although our ground-state calculations of the unit cell do not include the effects of temperature and minor elements, they do provide a consistent explanation for a number of properties of the D" layer.},

We present experimental evidence for spin-pairing transition in aluminum-bearing silicate perovskite (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O 3 under the lower mantle pressures. Our results demonstrate that as pressure increases, iron in perovskite transforms gradually from the initial high-spin state toward the final low-spin state. At 100 GPa, both aluminum-free and aluminum-bearing samples exhibit a mixed spin state. The residual magnetic moment in the aluminum-bearing perovskite is significantly higher than that in its aluminum-free counterpart. The observed spin evolution with pressure can be explained by the presence of multiple iron species and the occurrence of partial spin-paring transitions in the perovskite. Pressure-induced spin-pairing transitions in the perovskite would have important bearing on the magnetic, thermoelastic, and transport properties of the lower mantle, and on the distribution of iron in the Earth's interior.},

abstract = {Rheology of the lower mantle characterizes the dynamics of the earth's interior and it is often controlled by the textures of the constituting material which are (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite and ferro-periclase aggregate. We conducted high-pressure experiments to synthesize the (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite and ferro-periclase aggregates and measured two important textures of "grain size" and "dihedral angle". The grain growth rates of perovskite and (ferro-)periclase in two phase aggregates were influenced by the iron content and increased with factors of ~1.5 in iron-rich system. This difference in grain growth rates indicates that the viscosity of aggregates of iron-rich system is only a few times greater than that of iron-poor system for likely diffusion creep in the lower mantle. In contrast, the change of the dihedral angle of perovskite - periclase - perovskite at triple grain junction with variation of iron content was not observed systematically, but the dihedral angle decreases from ~110� to ~105� with an increase of temperature from 1673 to 2273 K. The dihedral angle of 105-110� would imply the interconnected network spatially of ferro-periclase in the aggregates and the connectivity increases with temperature. As a result, at higher temperature, ferro-periclase plays more important role for understanding the rheology of the lower mantle because ferro-periclase is a few order of magnitude softer than (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400 kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO3 perovskite phase and an Fe-rich phase with a hexagonal structure. This observation has implications for enigmatic seismic features beyond ~2000 kilometers depth and suggests that the lower mantle may contain previously unidentified major phases.},

However, its rheological properties at temperatures and pressures typical of the lower mantle are poorly known. Here we measured the plastic strength of cubic CaSiO3 perovskite at pressure and temperature conditions typical for a subducting slab up to a depth of about 1,200 kilometres. In contrast to tetragonal CaSiO3, previously investigated at room temperature3,4, we find that cubic CaSiO3 perovskite is a comparably weak phase at the temperatures of the lower mantle. We find that its strength and viscosity are substantially lower than that of bridgmanite and ferropericlase, possibly making cubic CaSiO3 perovskite the weakest lower-mantle phase. Our findings suggest that cubic CaSiO3 perovskite governs the dynamics of subducting slabs. Weak CaSiO3 perovskite further provides a mechanism to separate subducted oceanic crust from the underlying mantle. Depending on the depth of the separation, basaltic crust could accumulate at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, where cubic CaSiO3 perovskite may contribute to the seismically observed regions of low shear-wave velocities in the uppermost lower mantle5,6, or sink to the core�mantle boundary and explain the seismic anomalies associated with large low-shear-velocity provinces beneath Africa and the Pacific7�9.},

abstract = {Thorough characterization of the thermomechanical properties of materials requires difficult and time-consuming experiments. This severely limits the availability of data and is one of the main obstacles for the development of effective accelerated materials design strategies. The rapid screening of new potential materials requires highly integrated, sophisticated, and robust computational approaches. We tackled the challenge by developing an automated, integrated workflow with robust error-correction within the AFLOW framework which combines the newly developed "Automatic Elasticity Library" with the previously implemented GIBBS method. The first extracts the mechanical properties from automatic self-consistent stress-strain calculations, while the latter employs those mechanical properties to evaluate the thermodynamics within the Debye model. This new thermoelastic workflow is benchmarked against a set of 74 experimentally characterized systems to pinpoint a robust computational methodology for the evaluation of bulk and shear moduli, Poisson ratios, Debye temperatures, Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameters, and thermal conductivities of a wide variety of materials. The effect of different choices of equations of state and exchange-correlation functionals is examined and the optimum combination of properties for the Leibfried-Schl{\"{o}}mann prediction of thermal conductivity is identified, leading to improved agreement with experimental results than the GIBBS-only approach. The framework has been applied to the AFLOW.org data repositories to compute the thermoelastic properties of over 3500 unique materials. The results are now available online by using an expanded version of the REST-API described in the Appendix.},

It is shown that, under normal pressure, the cubic phase is stable down to T= 0 K, while the application of a hydrostatic pressure gives rise to a phonon branch in the vibrational spectrum (between points R and M of the Brillouin zone) with negative values of squares of frequencies. The condensation of soft mode R5 at the boundary point of the Brillouin zone leads to rhombohedral distortion of the cubic structure with the unit cell volume doubling. The calculated frequencies at q = 0 of the ScF3 lattice in the distorted rhombohedral phase are real-valued; the number and position of frequencies active in Raman scattering are in accord with the experimental values. {\textcopyright} 2002 MAIK "Nauka/Interperiodica".},

abstract = {ConspectusThe recent re-emergence of the halide perovskites, of the type AMX3, derives from a sea-changing breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics that has led to a whole new generation of solar devices with remarkable power conversion efficiency. The success in the field of photovoltaics has led to intense, combined research efforts to better understand these materials both from the fundamental chemistry and physics points of view and for the improvement of applied functional device engineering. This groundswell of activity has breathed new life into this long-known but largely "forgotten" class of perovskites. The impressive achievements of halide perovskites in photovoltaics, as well as other optoelectronic applications, stem from an unusually favorable combination of optical and electronic properties, with the ability to be solution processed into films. This defines them as a brand new class of semiconductors that can rival or exceed the performance of the venerable classes of III-V and II-IV semiconductors, which presently dominate the industries of applied optoelectronics.Our aim in this Account is to highlight the basic pillars that define the chemistry of the halide perovskites and their unconventional electronic properties through the prism of structure-property relationships. We focus on the synthetic requirements under which a halide perovskite can exist and emphasize how the synthetic conditions can determine the structural integrity and the bulk properties of the perovskites. Then we proceed to discuss the origins of the optical and electronic phenomena, using the perovskite crystal structure as a guide. Some of the most remarkable features of the perovskites dealt with in this Account include the evolution of a unique type of defect, which gives rise to superlattices. These can enhance or diminish the fluorescence properties of the perovskites. For example, the exotic self-doping ability of the Sn-based perovskites allows them to adopt electrical properties from semiconducting to metallic. We attempt to rationalize how these properties can be tuned and partially controlled through targeted synthetic procedures for use in electronic and optical devices. In addition, we address open scientific questions that pose big obstacles in understanding the fundamentals of perovskites. We anticipate that the answers to these questions will provide the impetus upon which future research directions will be founded.},

Both compounds are highly compressible and show strong anisotropic behavior. While the hexagonal a lattice parameters are shortened under pressure, the c parameters are elongated. These changes are associated with distortions of the TiF6 and FeF6 coordination octahedra, whereby the octahedron strain is stronger in TiF3 than in FeF3. The high-pressure behavior is characterized by cooperative tiltings of the octahedra, while simultaneously repulsive interactions between the cations probably cause the octahedral distortions.},

Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional "hard" matter such as metals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Simple, yet predictive bonding models are essential achievements of chemistry. In the solid state, in particular, they often appear in the form of visual bonding indicators. Because the latter require the crystal orbitals to be constructed from local basis sets, the application of the most popular density-functional theory codes (namely, those based on plane waves and pseudopotentials) appears as being ill-fitted to retrieve the chemical bonding information. In this paper, we describe a way to re-extract Hamilton-weighted populations from plane-wave electronic-structure calculations to develop a tool analogous to the familiar crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method. We derive the new technique, dubbed "projected COHP" (pCOHP), and demonstrate its viability using examples of covalent, ionic, and metallic crystals (diamond, GaAs, CsCl, and Na). For the first time, this chemical bonding information is directly extracted from the results of plane-wave calculations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Helium and methane are major components of giant icy planets and are abundant in the universe. However, helium is the most inert element in the periodic table and methane is one of the most hydrophobic molecules, thus whether they can react with each other is of fundamental importance. Here, our crystal structure searches and first-principles calculations predict that a He3CH4 compound is stable over a wide range of pressures from 55 to 155 GPa and a HeCH4 compound becomes stable around 105 GPa. As nice examples of pure van der Waals crystals, the insertion of helium atoms changes the original packing of pure methane molecules and also largely hinders the polymerization of methane at higher pressures. After analyzing the diffusive properties during the melting of He3CH4 at high pressure and high temperature, in addition to a plastic methane phase, we have discovered an unusual phase which exhibits coexistence of diffusive helium and plastic methane. In addition, the range of the diffusive behavior within the helium-methane phase diagram is found to be much narrower compared to that of previously predicted helium-water compounds. This may be due to the weaker van der Waals interactions between methane molecules compared to those in helium-water compounds, and that the helium-methane compound melts more easily.},

The main new ingredients are additional reference polarizabilities for highly-coordinated group 1-5 elements derived from pseudo-periodic electrostatically-embedded cluster calculations. To illustrate the performance of the updated method, several test cases are considered, for which we compare D4 to its predecessor D3(BJ), as well as to a comprehensive set of other dispersion-corrected methods. The largest improvements are observed for solid-state polarizabilities of 16 inorganic salts, where the D4 model achieves an unprecedented accuracy, surpassing its predecessor as well as other, computationally much more demanding approaches. For cell volumes and lattice energies of two sets of chemically diverse molecular crystals, the accuracy gain is less pronounced compared to the already excellently performing D3(BJ) method. For the challenging adsorption energies of small organic molecules on metallic as well as on ionic surfaces, DFT-D4 provides values in good agreement with experimental and/or high-level references. These results suggest the application of the proposed D4 model as a physically improved yet computationally efficient dispersion correction for standard DFT calculations as well as low-cost approaches like semi-empirical or even force-field models.},

We assume helium rain modified the interior temperature and composition profiles. Our calculation predicts zonal harmonic values to which measurements can be compared. Although some models fit the observed (pre-Juno) second- and fourth-order zonal harmonics to within their error bars, our preferred reference model predicts a fourth-order zonal harmonic whose absolute value lies above the pre-Juno error bars.

Gas solubilities in silicates are expected to become small under high pressure due to compaction of voids. Here we show anomalous behaviour of SiO2 glass in helium. Volume measurements clarify that SiO 2 glass is much less compressible than normal when compressed in helium, and the volume in helium at 10 GPa is close to the normal volume at 2 GPa. X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements suggest that voids are prevented from contracting when compressed in helium because helium penetrates into them. The estimated helium solubility is very high and is between 1.0 and 2.3 mol per mole of SiO2 glass at 10 GPa, which shows marked contrast with previous models. These results may have implications for discussions of the Earth's evolution as well as interpretations of various high-pressure experiments, and also lead to the creation of new materials. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Helium is a powerful tracer of primitive material in Earth-s mantle. Extremely high 3 He/4 He ratios in some ocean-island basalts suggest the presence of relatively undegassed and undifferentiated material preserved in Earth-s mantle. However, terrestrial lavas with high 3 He/4 He ratios have never been observed to host the primitive lead-isotopic compositions that are required for an early (roughly 4.5 Gyr ago) formation age. Here we show that Cenozoic-era Baffin Island and West Greenland lavas, previously found to host the highest terrestrial-mantle 3 He/4 He ratios, exhibit primitive lead-isotope ratios that are consistent with an ancient mantle source age of 4.55-4.45-Gyr. The Baffin Island and West Greenland lavas also exhibit 143 Nd/144 Nd ratios similar to values recently proposed for an early-formed (roughly 4.5 Gyr ago) terrestrial mantle reservoir. The combined helium-, lead-and Nd-isotopic compositions in Baffin Island and West Greenland lavas therefore suggest that their source is the most ancient accessible reservoir in the Earth-s mantle, and it may be parental to all mantle reservoirs that give rise to modern volcanism. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Helium isotopes provide an important tool for tracing early-Earth, primordial reservoirs that have survived in the planet's interior. Volcanic hotspot lavas, like those erupted at Hawaii and Iceland, can host rare, high 3 He/4 He isotopic ratios (up to 50 times the present atmospheric ratio, Ra) compared to the lower 3He/4He ratios identified in mid-ocean-ridge basalts that form by melting the upper mantle (about 8Ra; ref. 5). A long-standing hypothesis maintains that the high-3He/4 He domain resides in the deep mantle, beneath the upper mantle sampled by mid-ocean-ridge basalts, and that buoyantly upwelling plumes from the deep mantle transport high-3He/4 He material to the shallow mantle beneath plume-fed hotspots. One problem with this hypothesis is that, while some hotspots have 3He/4 He values ranging from low to high, other hotspots exhibit only low 3He/4 He ratios. Here we show that, among hotspots suggested to overlie mantle plumes, those with the highest maximum 3He/4 He ratios have high hotspot buoyancy fluxes and overlie regions with seismic low-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle, unlike plume-fed hotspots with only low maximum 3He/4 He ratios. We interpret the relationships between 3 He/4 He values, hotspot buoyancy flux, and upper-mantle shear wave velocity to mean that hot plumes - which exhibit seismic low-velocity anomalies at depths of 200 kilometres - are more buoyant and entrain both high- 3 He/4 He and low- 3 He/4 He material. In contrast, cooler, less buoyant plumes do not entrain this high- 3 He/4 He material. This can be explained if the high- 3 He/4 He domain is denser than low- 3 He/4 He mantle components hosted in plumes, and if high- 3 He/4 He material is entrained from the deep mantle only by the hottest, most buoyant plumes. Such a dense, deep-mantle high- 3 He/4 He domain could remain isolated from the convecting mantle, which may help to explain the preservation of early Hadean (>4.5 billion years ago) geochemical anomalies in lavas sampling this reservoir.},

abstract = {We have investigated the high-pressure behavior of cristobalite in helium by powder X-ray diffraction. Cristobalite transformed to a new phase at about 8 GPa. This phase is supposed to have a molar volume of about 30$\%$ larger than cristobalite, suggesting the dissolution of helium atoms in its interstitial voids. On further compression, the new phase transformed to a different phase which showed an X-ray diffraction pattern similar to cristobalite X-I at about 21 GPa. On the other hand, when the new phase was decompressed, it transformed to another new phase at about 7 GPa, which is also supposed to have a molar volume of about 25$\%$ larger than cristobalite. On further decompression, the second new phase transformed to cristobalite II at about 2 GPa. In contrast to cristobalite, quartz did not show anomalous behavior in helium. The behavior of cristobalite in helium was also consistent with that in other mediums up to about 8 GPa, where the volume of cristobalite became close to that of quartz. These results suggest that dissolution of helium may be controlled not only by the density (amount of voids) but also by the network structure of SiO4 tetrahedra (topology of voids). {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The insulator-to-metal transition in hcp solid helium at high pressure is studied with first-principles simulations. Diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations predict that the band gap closes at a density of 21.3g/cm3 and a pressure of 25.7 terapascals, which is 20$\%$ higher in density and 40$\%$ higher in pressure than predicted by density functional calculations based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The metallization density derived from GW calculations is found to be in very close agreement with DMC predictions. The zero point motion of the nuclei had no effect on the metallization density within the accuracy of the calculation. Finally, fit functions for the equation of state are presented, and the magnitude of the electronic correlation effects left out of the GGA approximation are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Recent development in the synthesis and characterization of noble-gas compounds is reviewed, i.e., noble-gas chemistry reported in the last five years with emphasis on the publications issued after 2017. XeF2 is commercially available and has a wider practical application both in the laboratory use and in the industry. As a ligand it can coordinate to metal centers resulting in [M(XeF2)x]n+ salts. With strong Lewis acids, XeF2 acts as a fluoride ion donor forming [XeF]+ or [Xe2F3]+ salts. Latest examples are [Xe2F3][RuF6]{\textperiodcentered}XeF2, [Xe2F3][RuF6] and [Xe2F3][IrF6]. Adducts NgF2{\textperiodcentered}CrOF4 and NgF2{\textperiodcentered}2CrOF4 (Ng = Xe, Kr) were synthesized and structurally characterized at low temperatures. The geometry of XeF6 was studied in solid argon and neon matrices. Xenon hexafluoride is a well-known fluoride ion donor forming various [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ salts. A large number of crystal structures of previously known or new [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ salts were reported, i.e., [Xe2F11][SbF6], [XeF5][SbF6], [XeF5][Sb2F11], [XeF5][BF4], [XeF5][TiF5], [XeF5]5[Ti10F45], [XeF5][Ti3F13], [XeF5]2[MnF6], [XeF5][MnF5], [XeF5]4[Mn8F36], [Xe2F11]2[SnF6], [Xe2F11]2[PbF6], [XeF5]4[Sn5F24], [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrVOF5]{\textperiodcentered}2CrVIOF4, [XeF5]2[CrIVF6]{\textperiodcentered}2CrVIOF4, [Xe2F11]2[CrIVF6], [XeF5]2[CrV2O2F8], [XeF5]2[CrV2O2F8]{\textperiodcentered}2HF, [XeF5]2[CrV2O2F8]{\textperiodcentered}2XeOF4, A[XeF5][SbF6]2 (A = Rb, Cs), Cs[XeF5][BixSb1-xF6]2 (x = $\sim$0.37-0.39), NO2XeF5(SbF6)2, XeF5M(SbF6)3 (M = Ni, Mg, Zn, Co, Cu, Mn and Pd) and (XeF5)3[Hg(HF)]2(SbF6)7. Despite its extreme sensitivity, many new XeO3 adducts were synthesized, i.e., the 15-crown adduct of XeO3, adducts of XeO3 with triphenylphosphine oxide, dimethylsulfoxide and pyridine-N-oxide, and adducts between XeO3 and N-bases (pyridine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine). [Hg(KrF2)8][AsF6]2{\textperiodcentered}2HF is a new example of a compound in which KrF2 serves as a ligand. Numerous new charged species of noble gases were reported (ArCH2 +, ArOH+, [ArB3O4]+, [ArB3O5]+, [ArB4O6]+, [ArB5O7]+, [B12(CN)11Ne]-). Molecular ion HeH+ was finally detected in interstellar space. The discoveries of Na2He and ArNi at high pressure were reported. Bonding motifs in noble-gas compounds are briefly commented on in the last paragraph of this review.},

abstract = {Quantum mechanical investigations at the MP4(SDTQ)/6-31 lG(2df,2pd)//MP2/6-31G(d,p) + ZPE level of theory show that helium is capable of forming strong bonds with carbon in cations and that even a neutral molecule containing He (HeBeO) can be thermodynamically stable in its ground state. The electronic state of a binding partner is crucially important for the bond strength and bond length of the He bond. He2C2+has a rather long (1.605 A) He-C atomic distance in its 1A1 ground state, but a much shorter bond (1.170 A) is found in the 3B1 excited state. The shortest He-C bonds (1.080-1.085 A) are found in the 2+(47 t) <states of HeCC2+, HeCCHe2+, and HeCC+. The bond dissociation energies of the dications in these electronic states yielding neutral He and a cationic fragment are predicted to be as high as 89.9 kcal/mol for HeCC2+. Helium compounds are best understood as donor-acceptor molecules consisting of He as electron donor and the respective acceptor fragment. Strong helium bonds are formed when a binding partner (acceptor) provides low-lying empty a orbitals (a-holes). Electronegative elements such as fluorine or oxygen are not suitable for binding He due to their highly filled valence shells. More promising candidates should provide empty orbitals which are still capable of attracting the low-lying Is electrons of the poor electron donor He. The stability of HeBeO is confirmed by CASSCF calculations with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set and an active space of all 14 electrons in 11 orbitals. The structures and energies of the helium compounds are rationalized by molecular orbital arguments and by analysis of the electron density and its associated Laplace field. The strongly bound helium ions are characterized by covalent semipolar He-C bonds, whereas the weaker bonds in some structures are caused by electrostatic interactions between closed-shell systems. The impact of our study on experiment, especially interstellar chemistry, is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1987, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

The calculations were performed for the electronic ground states and selected excited states of HeXn+. The trends in the interatomic distances and bond strengths of the helium bonds are discussed in terms of donor-acceptor interactions between neutral He as the donor and the cationic Xn+ fragment as the acceptor. In addition, the mechanism of bonding is analyzed by utilizing the properties of the calculated electron density $\rho$(r) and its associated Laplace concentration -∇2$\rho$(r). HeX+ ions in their ground states represent van der Waals complexes stabilized by charge-induced dipole interactions. In those excited states in which X+ becomes a stronger acceptor, covalent bonds are predicted. In contrast to the singly charged HeX+ ground-state species, all HeX2+ dications investigated in this work can be considered as covalently bonded molecules. Calculated properties of HeXn+ such as interatomic distances re and dissociation energies De are nicely explained within the donor-acceptor model. The results show that the electronic structure of Xn+ is more important for the stability of the corresponding HeXn+ system than the positive charge of Xn+. {\textcopyright} 1989 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Ab initio calculations at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels of theory disclose the conceivable existence of neutral complexes containing up to four helium atoms. These species are formally obtained by replacing the hydrogen atoms of parent molecules such as CH4, SiH4, NH3, PH 3, H2O, H2S, C2H2, C 2H4, and C6H6 with -NBeHe moieties, which behave as monovalent functional groups containing helium. The geometries and vibrational frequencies of these M(NBeHe)n (n>1: M = central moiety) polyhelium complexes have been investigated at the MP2(full)/6-31G(d) level of theory, and their stability with respect to the loss of helium atom(s) has been evaluated by means of single-point calculations at the CCSD(T)/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. Molecules such as HnC-(NBeHe) 4-n and HnSi(NBeHe)4-n (n = 0-3), C 2(NBeHe)2, and ortho-, meta-, and para-C6H 4(NBeHe)2 were invariably characterized as energy minima, and were found to be stable with respect to the loss of helium atom(s) by approximately 4-5 kcal mol-1. On the other hand, species such as C2-(NBeHe)4 and C6(NBeHe)6 were characterized as high-order saddle points on the potential-energy surface, and were unstable with respect to helium atom(s) loss owing to the bending motion of the -NBeHe groups. The molecules containing N, P, O, or S as the central atom also showed a variable topology and include second-order saddle points such as S(NBeHe)2, third-order saddle points such as HN-(NBeHe)2, but also minimum-energy structures such as O(NBeHe)2 and HP-(NBeHe)2, which are also stable by approximately 5 kcal mol -1 with respect to the helium atom(s) loss. These results suggest the conceivable existence of an, in principle, very large class of M(NBeHe) n (n>1) polyhelium complexes, whose stability may be substantially affected by the nature and the size of the central moiety M. Atoms-in-Molecules (AIM) calculations on selected species invariably suggest that, in our investigated M(NBeHe), (n>1) compounds, the beryllium-helium interaction is essentially electrostatic. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract = {The complexes of helium with nearly 30 neutral molecules (M) were investigated by various techniques of bonding analysis and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). The main investigated function was the local electron energy density H(r), analyzed, in particular, so to estimate the degree of polarization (DoP) of He in the various He(M). As we showed recently (Borocci et al., J. Comput. Chem., 2019, 40, 2318–2328), the DoP is a quantitative index that is generally informative about the role of polarization (induction plus charge transfer [CT]) and dispersion in noncovalent noble gas complexes. As further evidence in this regard, we presently ascertained quantitative correlations between the DoP(He) of the He(M) and indices based on the electron density $\rho$(r), including the molecular electrostatic potential at the HeM bond critical point, as well as the percentage contributions of induction and dispersion to the SAPT binding energies. Based also on the explicit evaluation of the CT, accomplished through the study of the charge-displacement function, we derived a quantitative scale that ranks the He(M) according to their dispersive, inductive, and CT bonding character. Our taken approach could be conceivably extended to other types of noncovalent complexes.},

Molecular beam experiments confirm that this is the case for He-CF4, Ne-CF4 adducts, but revealed that the interaction of He and Ne with CCl4 features an appreciable contribution of chemical components that arise from the anisotropy of the electron density of CCl4 that enhances a charge transfer from Ng (Ng=He, Ne). These findings furnish a novel assay of the bonding capabilities of helium and neon, and invite to revisit the neutral complexes of these elements as systems of chemical relevance. The CCl4-Ng are also peculiar examples of halogen bonds, a group of interactions of major current concern. Finally, this investigation is a prelude to the development of semi-empirical models for force fields aimed to the unified description of static and dynamical properties of systems of comparable or higher complexity.},

abstract = {A new algorithm, RANDSPG, that can be used to generate trial crystal structures with specific space groups and compositions is described. The program has been designed for systems where the atoms are independent of one another, and it is therefore primarily suited towards inorganic systems. The structures that are generated adhere to user-defined constraints such as: the lattice shape and size, stoichiometry, set of space groups to be generated, and factors that influence the minimum interatomic separations. In addition, the user can optionally specify if the most general Wyckoff position is to be occupied or constrain select atoms to specific Wyckoff positions. Extensive testing indicates that the algorithm is efficient and reliable. The library is lightweight, portable, dependency-free and is published under a license recognized by the Open Source Initiative. A web interface for the algorithm is publicly accessible at http://xtalopt.openmolecules.net/randSpg/randSpg.html. RANDSPG has also been interfaced with the XTALOPT evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, and it is illustrated that the use of symmetric lattices in the first generation of randomly created individuals decreases the number of structures that need to be optimized to find the global energy minimum. Program summary Program Title: RandSpg Program Files doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/v2nzgmpd37.1 Licensing provisions: BSD 3-clause [1] Programming language: C++ Nature of problem: Trial structure models are required for: (i) determining the crystal structure of a compound given its powder X-ray diffraction data using the direct space method, (ii) creating the first set of individuals using a priori crystal structure prediction. For both of these problems the initial guess can greatly influence the success rate of the algorithm used for structure determination, especially for crystals with large unit cells. The unit cells of over 99$\%$ of inorganic crystals possess some element of symmetry, and it may be possible to obtain partial information about their crystal structures experimentally. Therefore, an algorithm that is able to create trial structures with user-defined constraints including the crystal's composition, space group and unit cell parameters is desired. Solution method: The RandSpg algorithm is able to determine every possible combination of Wyckoff positions for a given space group and composition. The algorithm randomly picks one of these combinations and adds atoms to particular Wyckoff sites wherein the Cartesian coordinates are chosen randomly such that they satisfy user-defined minimum interatomic distance constraints. In addition, the program can optionally generate crystals where user-defined atoms are placed at specific Wyckoff sites. References: [1] http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause},

abstract = {Materials with the perovskite ABX3 structure play a major role across materials chemistry and physics as a consequence of their ubiquity and wide range of useful properties. ReO3-type structures can be described as ABX3 perovskites in which the A-cation site is unoccupied, giving rise to the general composition BX3, where B is typically a cation and X is a bridging anion. The chemical diversity of such structures is extensive, ranging from simple oxides and fluorides, such as WO3 and AlF3, to complex structures in which the bridging anion is polyatomic, such as in the Prussian blue-related cyanides Fe(CN)3 and CoPt(CN)6. The same ReO3-type structure is found in metal�organic frameworks, for example, In(im)3 (im = imidazolate) and the well-known MOF-5 structure, where the B-site cation is polyatomic. The extended 3D connectivity and openness of this structure type leads to compounds with interesting and often unusual properties. Notable among these properties are negative thermal expansion (for example, ScF3), photocatalysis (for example, CoSn(OH)6), thermoelectricity (for example, CoAs3) and superconductivity in a phase that is controversially described as SH3 with a doubly interpenetrating ReO3 structure. We present an account of this exciting family of materials and discuss future opportunities in the area.},

abstract = {Phase relations in $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ Mg2SiO4 have been investigated by first principles quasi-harmonic free energy computations. The computed phase boundaries obtained using the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) bracket the experimental ones, with LDA (GGA) calculations giving the lowest (highest) bound, while the Clapeyron slopes are in good agreement with the experimentally determined ones. This is the same trend displayed by previous similar computations. Further analyses reveal that despite the uncertainties in phase boundary determination, the calculated discontinuities in density, bulk modulus, and bulk sound velocity are quite insensitive to pressure and have small uncertainties and useful accuracy to discriminate potential sources of discontinuities in the mantle. We verify that ~ 3$\%$ density discontinuity at 410-km depth can be produced primarily by the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ transition in an aggregate with pyrolite composition, i.e. ~ 60-vol$\%$ of Mg2SiO4. However, the 1.3-2.9$\%$ density discontinuity observed in some places at 520-km depth cannot be accounted for solely by the $\beta$ to $\gamma$ transition but also requires changes in the coexisting pyroxene/garnet/Ca-perovskite system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We conducted high-pressure phase equilibrium experiments in the systems MgSiO3 with 15 wt$\%$ H2O and Mg2SiO4 with 5 wt$\%$ and 11 wt$\%$ H2O at 20 $\sim$ 27 GPa. Based on the phase relations in these systems, together with the previous works on the related systems, we have clarified the stability relations of dense hydrous magnesium silicates in the system MgO-SiO2-H2O in the pressure range from 10 to 27 GPa. The results show that the stability field of phase G, which is identical to phase D and phase F, expands with increasing water contents. Water stored in serpentine in the descending cold slabs is transported into depths greater than 200 km, where serpentine decomposes to a mixture of phase A, enstatite, and fluid. Reaction sequences of the hydrous phases which appear at higher pressures vary with water content. In the slabs with a water content less than about 2 wt$\%$, phase A carries water to a depth of 450 km. Hydrous wadsleyite, hydrous ringwoodite, and ilmenite are the main water reservoirs in the transition zone from 450 to 660 km. Superhydrous phase B is the water reservoir in the uppermost part of the lower mantle from 670 to 800 km, whereas phase G appears in the lower mantle only at depths greater than 800 km. In cold slabs with local water enrichment greater than 2 wt$\%$, the following hydrous phases appear with increasing depths; phase A to 450 km, phase A and phase G from 450 km to 550 km, brucite, superhydrous phase B, and phase G from 550 km to 800 km, and phase G at depths greater than 800 km.},

As an example of the new code, intermolecular interactions in several molecular crystals are presented and analyzed. The connection with QTAIM studies is established and a reinterpretation of the NCI domains is given regarding the current knowledge of the field. The connection between NCI domains and intermolecular vibrations is made apparent, as well as the ability of the method to reveal the locality of bonding. {\textcopyright} This journal is the Owner Societies 2012.},

abstract = {The NCI (Non-Covalent Interactions) method, a recently-developed theoretical strategy to visualize weak non-covalent interactions from the topological analysis of the electron density and of its reduced gradient, is applied in the present paper to document intra- and inter-molecular interactions in flexible molecules and systems of biological interest in combination with IR spectroscopy. We first describe the conditions of application of the NCI method to the specific case of intramolecular interactions. Then we apply it to a series of stable conformations of isolated molecules as an interpretative technique to decipher the different physical interactions at play in these systems. Examples are chosen among neutral molecular systems exhibiting a large diversity of interactions, for which an extensive spectroscopic characterization under gas-phase isolation conditions has been obtained using state-of-the-art conformer-specific experimental techniques. The interactions presently documented range from weak intra-molecular H-bonds in simple amino-alcohols, to more complex patterns, with interactions of various strengths in model peptides, as well as in chiral bimolecular systems, where invaluable hints for the understanding of chiral recognition are revealed. We also provide a detailed technical appendix, which discusses the choices of cut-offs as well as the applicability of the NCI analysis to specific constrained systems, where local effects require attention. Finally, the NCI technique provides IR spectroscopists with an elegant visualization of the interactions that potentially impact their vibrational probes, namely the OH and NH stretching motions. This contribution illustrates the power and the conditions of use of the NCI technique, with the aim of providing an easy tool for all chemists, experimentalists and theoreticians, for the visualization and characterization of the interactions shaping complex molecular systems. {\textcopyright} the Partner Organisations 2014.},

@article{Foroutan-Nejad2014,
abstract = {Currently, bonding analysis of molecules based on the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is popular; however, "misinterpretations" of the QTAIM analysis are also very frequent. In this contribution the chemical relevance of the bond path as one of the key topological entities emerging from the QTAIM's topological analysis of the one-electron density is reconsidered. The role of nuclear vibrations on the topological analysis is investigated demonstrating that the bond paths are not indicators of chemical bonds. Also, it is argued that the detection of the bond paths is not necessary for the "interaction" to be present between two atoms in a molecule. The conceptual disentanglement of chemical bonds/interactions from the bonds paths, which are alternatively termed "line paths" in this contribution, dismisses many superficial inconsistencies. Such inconsistencies emerge from the presence/absence of the line paths in places of a molecule in which chemical intuition or alternative bonding analysis does not support the presence/absence of a chemical bond. Moreover, computational QTAIM studies have been performed on some "problematic" molecules, which were considered previously by other authors, and the role of nuclear vibrations on presence/absence of the line paths is studied demonstrating that a bonding pattern consistent with other theoretical schemes appears after a careful QTAIM analysis and a new "interpretation" of data is performed.},

@article{Qin2020,
abstract = {Noble gas (NG) is often used as a hydrostatic pressure-transmitting medium in high-pressure experiments. However, the NG atoms under compression are found to be readily trapped in the voids of some ionic compounds. Electrides usually have large open frameworks and show strong hydrogen and oxygen affinities. To investigate the interaction of light NG with electrides under pressure, we perform the structural investigations of Ca2N in a diamond anvil cell under different NG (He, Ne, and Ar) conditions, assisted by density functional theory calculations. Experimental results find that in comparison with nonhydrostatic pressure, transition paths of Ca2N change with different pressure media and phase transition pressure is reduced significantly, and NG is chemically inert for electrides in the studied pressure range. Theoretical analysis indicates that the anionic electrons in Ca2N electride show strong repulsion with NG, preventing NG atoms from entering electrides. Such repulsion is due to the almost neutral character of noble atoms in electrides, which makes it difficult for them to interact with anionic electrons. Moreover, in the predicted metastable Ca2N-NG, the neutral features of NG atoms result in the reservation of the intrinsic electride character. Our results reveal that the NGs can be used as protective gases for electrides under ambient conditions or hydrostatic pressure-transmitting media for the studies of high-pressure electrides within 50 GPa.},

The amount of gas inside the fullerenes can be measured by heating to 1000�C to expel the gases, which can then be measured by mass spectroscopy. Information obtained from the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of helium-3-labeled fullerenes indicates that the magnetic field inside the cage is altered by aromatic ring current effects. Each higher fullerene isomer and each chemical derivative of a fullerene that has been studied so far has given a distinct helium nuclear magnetic resonance peak.},

Here we report the X-ray diffraction study of He@C 60 and the clear observation of a single helium atom inside C 60. In addition, the close packing of a helium atom and a nitrogen atom inside fullerenes is realized using two stepwise insertion techniques, that is, molecular surgery to synthesize the fullerenes encapsulating a helium atom, followed by nitrogen radio-frequency plasma methods to generate the fullerenes encapsulating both helium and nitrogen atoms. Electron spin resonance analysis reveals that the encapsulated helium atom has a small but detectable influence on the electronic properties of the highly reactive nitrogen atom coexisting inside the fullerene, suggesting the potential usage of helium for controlling electronic properties of reactive species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Diamond-anvil-cell and shock-wave technologies now permit the study of matter under multimegabar pressure (that is, of several hundred GPa). The properties of matter in this pressure regime differ drastically from those known at 1 atm (about 105 Pa). Just how different chemistry is at high pressure and what role chemical intuition for bonding and structure can have in understanding matter at high pressure will be explored in this account. We will discuss in detail an overlapping hierarchy of responses to increased density: a) squeezing out van der Waals space (for molecular crystals); b) increasing coordination; c) decreasing the length of covalent bonds and the size of anions; and d) in an extreme regime, moving electrons off atoms and generating new modes of correlation. Examples of the startling chemistry and physics that emerge under such extreme conditions will alternate in this account with qualitative chemical ideas about the bonding involved. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract = {Experimental studies of compressed matter are now routinely conducted at pressures exceeding 1 mln atm (100 GPa) and occasionally at pressures greater than 10 mln atm (1 TPa). The structure and properties of solids that have been so significantly squeezed differ considerably from those of solids at ambient pressure (1 atm), often leading to new and unexpected physics. Chemical reactivity is also substantially altered in the extreme pressure regime. In this feature paper we describe how synergy between theory and experiment can pave the road towards new experimental discoveries. Because chemical rules-of-thumb established at 1 atm often fail to predict the structures of solids under high pressure, automated crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods are increasingly employed. After outlining the most important CSP techniques, we showcase a few examples from the recent literature that exemplify just how useful theory can be as an aid in the interpretation of experimental data, describe exciting theoretical predictions that are guiding experiment, and discuss when the computational methods that are currently routinely employed fail. Finally, we forecast important problems that will be targeted by theory as theoretical methods undergo rapid development, along with the simultaneous increase of computational power.},

abstract = {Noble gases (Ngs) are the least reactive elements in the periodic table towards chemical bond formation when compared with other elements because of their completely filled valence electronic configuration. Very often, extreme conditions like low temperatures, high pressures and very reactive reagents are required for them to form meaningful chemical bonds with other elements. In this personal account, we summarize our works to date on Ng complexes where we attempted to theoretically predict viable Ng complexes having strong bonding to synthesize them under close to ambient conditions. Our works cover three different types of Ng complexes, viz., non-insertion of NgXY type, insertion of XNgY type and Ng encapsulated cage complexes where X and Y can represent any atom or group of atoms. While the first category of Ng complexes can be thermochemically stable at a certain temperature depending on the strength of the Ng-X bond, the latter two categories are kinetically stable, and therefore, their viability and the corresponding conditions depend on the size of the activation barrier associated with the release of Ng atom(s). Our major focus was devoted to understand the bonding situation in these complexes by employing the available state-of-the-art theoretic tools like natural bond orbital, electron density, and energy decomposition analyses in combination with the natural orbital for chemical valence theory. Intriguingly, these three types of complexes represent three different types of bonding scenarios. In NgXY, the strength of the donor-acceptor Ng?XY interaction depends on the polarizing power of binding the X center to draw the rather rigid electron density of Ng towards itself, and sometimes involvement of such orbitals becomes large enough, particularly for heavier Ng elements, to consider them as covalent bonds. On the other hand, in most of the XNgY cases, Ng forms an electron-shared covalent bond with X while interacting electrostatically with Y representing itself as [XNg]+Y-. Nevertheless, in some of the rare cases like NCNgNSi, both the C-Ng and Ng-N bonds can be represented as electron-shared covalent bonds. On the other hand, a cage host is an excellent moiety to examine the limits that can be pushed to attain bonding between two Ng atoms (even for He) at high pressure. The confinement effect by a small cage-like B12N12 can even induce some covalent interaction within two He atoms in the He2@B12N12 complex.},

Their NTE is comparable to that reported for framework solids containing multiatom bridges, such as metal cyanides and metal-organic frameworks. However, they are formable as ceramics, transparent over a wide wavelength range and can be handled in air; these characteristics can be beneficial for applications. The NTE of CaZrF6 is strongly temperature-dependent, and first-principles calculations show that it is largely driven by vibrational modes below ∼150 cm-1. CaZrF6 is elastically soft with a bulk modulus (K300K) of 37 GPa and, upon compression, starts to disorder at ∼400 MPa. The strong NTE of CaZrF6, which remains cubic to <10 K, contrasts with cubic CoZrF6, which only displays modest NTE above its rhombohedral to cubic phase transition at ∼270 K. CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 belong to a large and compositionally diverse family of materials, AIIBIVF6, providing for a detailed exploration of the chemical and structural factors controlling NTE and many opportunities for the design of controlled thermal expansion materials.},

The analysis of more than five million interatomic "non-bonded" distances has led to the proposal of a consistent set of van der Waals radii for most naturally occurring elements, and its applicability to other element pairs has been tested for a set of more than three million data, all of them compared to over one million bond distances. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {The van der Waals volume is a widely used descriptor in modeling physicochemical properties. However, the calculation of the van der Waals volume (V(vdW)) is rather time-consuming, from Bondi group contributions, for a large data set. A new method for calculating van der Waals volume has been developed, based on Bondi radii. The method, termed Atomic and Bond Contributions of van der Waals volume (VABC), is very simple and fast. The only information needed for calculating VABC is atomic contributions and the number of atoms, bonds, and rings. Then, the van der Waals volume (A(3)/molecule) can be calculated from the following formula: V(vdW) = summation operator all atom contributions - 5.92N(B) - 14.7R(A) - 3.8R(NR) (N(B) is the number of bonds, R(A) is the number of aromatic rings, and R(NA) is the number of nonaromatic rings). The number of bonds present (N(B)) can be simply calculated by N(B) = N - 1 + R(A) + R(NA) (where N is the total number of atoms). A simple Excel spread sheet has been made to calculate van der Waals volumes for a wide range of 677 organic compounds, including 237 drug compounds. The results show that the van der Waals volumes calculated from VABC are equivalent to the computer-calculated van der Waals volumes for organic compounds.},

abstract = {Tin and lead iodide perovskite semiconductors of the composition AMX3, where M is a metal and X is a halide, are leading candidates for high efficiency low cost tandem photovoltaics, in part because they have band gaps that can be tuned over a wide range by compositional substitution. We experimentally identify two competing mechanisms through which the A-site cation influences the band gap of 3D metal halide perovskites. Using a smaller A-site cation can distort the perovskite lattice in two distinct ways: by tilting the MX6 octahedra or by simply contracting the lattice isotropically. The former effect tends to raise the band gap, while the latter tends to decrease it. Lead iodide perovskites show an increase in band gap upon partial substitution of the larger formamidinium with the smaller cesium, due to octahedral tilting. Perovskites based on tin, which is slightly smaller than lead, show the opposite trend: they show no octahedral tilting upon Cs-substitution but only a contraction of the lattice, leading to progressive reduction of the band gap. We outline a strategy to systematically tune the band gap and valence and conduction band positions of metal halide perovskites through control of the cation composition. Using this strategy, we demonstrate solar cells that harvest light in the infrared up to 1040 nm, reaching a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 17.8$\%$, showing promise for improvements of the bottom cell of all-perovskite tandem solar cells. The mechanisms of cation-based band gap tuning we describe are broadly applicable to 3D metal halide perovskites and will be useful in further development of perovskite semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.},

Multiple isobaric contractions of radii are predicted and are explained by pressure-induced changes to the electronic ground state configurations of the atoms. The presented radii are predictive of drastically different chemistry under high pressure and permit an extension of chemical thinking to different thermodynamic regimes. For example, they can aid in assignment of bonded and non-bonded contacts, for distinguishing molecular entities, and for estimating available space inside compressed materials.

Two-dimensional (2D) 18-crown-6 N8 layers and three-dimensional (3D) sodalite-like N20 polynitrogen are identified within XeN8, XeN18, and XeN20 at 100 GPa, respectively. Notably, the 2D 18-crown-6 N8 layers persist to ambient pressure on decompression after the removal of xenon, forming not only a layered bulk P1� N8 phase, but also a P3� N8 monolayer, which are dynamically and thermally stable. However, the recovery of the sodalite-like N20 allotrope from Fm3� XeN20 is unlikely, due to the larger size of the Xe atom compared to that of the channel pores in the 3D-N20 net. Nevertheless, the calculations show that He and Ne are suitable for forming a stable Ng@N20 at 100 GPa, ideal high-pressure precursors to produce the Fm3� 3D-N20 allotrope. Furthermore, the estimated energy density for the layered bulk P1� N8 (7.3 kJ g-1) and sodalite-like N20 (10.3 kJ g-1) makes them stand out as promising high-energy density materials. This work is an effective effort to design and stabilize novel nitrogen allotropes with noble gases.},

It is found that bond density or electronic density, bond length, and degree of covalent bonding are three determinative factors for the hardness of a polar covalent crystal.

@article{Tang2009,
abstract = {A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales linearly with the number of grid points. The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{FonsecaGuerra2004,
abstract = {We present the Voronoi Deformation Density (VDD) method for computing atomic charges. The VDD method does not explicitly use the basis functions but calculates the amount of electronic density that flows to or from a certain atom due to bond formation by spatial integration of the deformation density over the atomic Voronoi cell. We compare our method to the well-known Mulliken, Hirshfeld, Bader, and Weinhold [Natural Population Analysis (NPA)] charges for a variety of biological, organic, and inorganic molecules. The Mulliken charges are (again) shown to be useless due to heavy basis set dependency, and the Bader charges (and often also the NPA charges) are not realistic, yielding too extreme values that suggest much ionic character even in the case of covalent bonds. The Hirshfeld and VDD charges, which prove to be numerically very similar, are to be recommended because they yield chemically meaningful charges. We stress the need to use spatial integration over an atomic domain to get rid of basis set dependency, and the need to integrate the deformation density in order to obtain a realistic picture of the charge rearrangement upon bonding. An asset of the VDD charges is the transparency of the approach owing to the simple geometric partitioning of space. The deformation density based charges prove to conform to chemical experience. {\textcopyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Density functional theory simulations were carried out to study the formation and migration energetics and geometric structures of the native point defects and protons in Mg2SiO4 polymorphs (namely, forsterite, wadsleyite and ringwoodite) up to 30 GPa pressure. The energetic favorability of the vacancy and interstitial defects was shown to strongly depend on the atomic and electron chemical potentials. Among the charge-balanced defects studied, the Mg2+-Frenkel defects are energetically most favorable in forsterite whereas the MgO pseudo-Schottky defects are energetically most favorable in wadsleyite and ringwoodite. Our results for the ion migration enthalpies calculated using the nudged-elastic-band technique suggest that the Mg migration is easiest in forsterite and ringwoodite whereas Si migration is easiest in wadsleyite. The proton incorporations at the interstitial and vacant cationic sites were investigated. In the extrinsic limit, the proton incorporation is energetically most favorable at VSi″″ site for up to three protons. Addition of one more proton prefers to go to VMg″ site. In the intrinsic limit, however, the interstitial and Mg-vacancy sites remain the most favorable. The predicted barrier for the interstitial-to-interstitial proton migration is smaller than that for the magnesium vacancy-to-interstitial migration, and among three phases ringwoodite has the lowest barrier. The effects of proton incorporation on the transition pressure and pressure-volume equation of state were shown to be significant.},

Using 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we have characterized OVs within six aluminous bridgmanite samples. In the resulting NMR spectra sixfold, fivefold, and fourfold coordinated Al species are resolved, in addition to near eightfold coordinated Al substituting for Mg. Fivefold coordinated Al is formed by single OV sites but fourfold coordination must result from short range ordering of OVs, producing OV clusters that may form through migration into twin domain walls. Characterizing the occurrence of such OV structures is an important prerequisite for understanding how transport properties change with depth and composition in the lower mantle.},

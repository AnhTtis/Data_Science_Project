\begin{abstract}
We tackle the problem of automatic generation of computer programs from a few pairs of input-output examples. The starting point of this work is the observation that in many applications a solution program must use external knowledge not present in the examples: we call such programs knowledge-powered since they can refer to information collected from a knowledge graph such as Wikipedia.
This paper makes a first step towards knowledge-powered program synthesis. We present WikiCoder, a system building upon state of the art machine-learned program synthesizers and integrating knowledge graphs. We evaluate it to show its wide applicability over different domains and discuss its limitations. WikiCoder solves tasks that no program synthesizers were able to solve before thanks to the use of knowledge graphs, while integrating with recent developments in the field to operate at scale.

The prediction model assigns to each candidate program a likelihood of being a solution to the task at hand. WikiCoder uses the HeapSearch algorithm, which is a bottom-up enumerative search algorithm~\cite{Fijalkow2022ScalingNP} outputting programs following the likelihood order of the prediction model. It has been shown superior to other enumeration methods (such as A* or Beam search) and easily deployed across parallel compute environments.
The candidate programs use the results of the \texttt{SPARQL} queries on the knowledge graph to be run on the examples.

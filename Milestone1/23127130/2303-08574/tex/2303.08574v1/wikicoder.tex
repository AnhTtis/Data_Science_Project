WikiCoder is a general-purpose grammar-based program synthesis tool, it was developed in Python integrating state of the art program synthesis techniques. It is publicly available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/ProgSynth/tree/WikiCoder}}.
The main functionality of WikiCoder is to solve programming by example tasks: the user inputs a few examples and WikiCoder synthesizes a knowledge-powered program satisfying the examples.
The programming language is specified as a domain specific language (DSL), designed to solve a common set of tasks.
WikiCoder supports a number of classical DSLs, including towers building~\cite{EllisWNSMHCST21}, list integer manipulations~\cite{Balog2017}, regular expressions, and string manipulation tasks à la FlashFill~\cite{Gulwani2011}: our experiments report on the latter DSL.
Following recent advances in machine learned program synthesizers~\cite{EllisWNSMHCST21,Fijalkow2022ScalingNP}, WikiCoder is divided into three components: compilation, examples processing, and search, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline} and discussed in the next three sections.
This is very different from Codex's architecture, which is based on auto-regressive very large models directly generating code.

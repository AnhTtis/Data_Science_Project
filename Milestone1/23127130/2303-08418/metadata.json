    "abstract": "The paper proposes a new algorithm called SymBa that aims to achieve more biologically plausible learning than Back-Propagation (BP). The algorithm is based on the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm, which is a BP-free method for training neural networks. SymBa improves the FF algorithm's convergence behavior by addressing the problem of asymmetric gradients caused by conflicting converging directions for positive and negative samples. The algorithm balances positive and negative losses to enhance performance and convergence speed. Furthermore, it modifies the FF algorithm by adding Intrinsic Class Pattern (ICP) containing class information to prevent the loss of class information during training. The proposed algorithm has the potential to improve our understanding of how the brain learns and processes information and to develop more effective and efficient artificial intelligence systems. The paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of SymBa algorithm compared to the FF algorithm and BP.",

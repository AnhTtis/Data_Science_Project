\begin{abstract}
%In a database system, estimating the cost of an execution plan is a fundamental operator and has been proven important to the query optimizer. Recent studies show that machine learning(ML)-based cost estimation methods can achieve promising results. However, state-of-the-art ML-based models tend to incorporate large models, leading to days of training or high model inference latency. 

We present {\LC}, a simple yet effective learning-based estimator for the cost of executing a database query plan. {\LC} uses significantly shorter training time and a lower inference cost than the state-of-the-art approaches, while achieving higher estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of {\LC} comes from embedding abundant explicit execution-plan-based features and incorporating a novel technique called cardinality calibration. Extensive experimental results show that {\LC} achieves orders of magnitude higher efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods: on the JOB-M benchmark dataset, it cuts off training plans by 98\%, reducing training time from more than two days to about eight minutes while entailing better accuracy. Furthermore, in dynamic environments, {\LC} can maintain satisfactory accuracy even without retraining, narrowing the gap between learning-based estimators and real systems.

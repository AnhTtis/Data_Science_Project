We introduce {\LC}, a novel lightweight tree-based neural network model designed to address the challenges of cost estimation. First, after comprehensive analysis, we adopt a lightweight tree-based model with more explicit inputs, which allows less training expense and model inference latency. Then, we present a fast sampling method to calibrate partial cardinalities in sub-plans, which significantly improves the accuracy of cost estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that {\LC} not only outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy, but also greatly improves the efficiency of training and inference. In a dynamic environment, {\LC} can be applied to 
minor updates without retraining, and the stale model can be replaced seamlessly with updated ones.

%Future work could advance in a number of directions. For example, the neural network architecture presented here could be adapted to handle a dynamic number of concurrent queries. Doing so would require modeling the resource contention among queries.

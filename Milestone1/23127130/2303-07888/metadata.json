    "abstract": "Target-to-user (T2U) association is a prerequisite to fully exploit the potential of the sensing function in communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, e.g., for beam and blockage management. This letter proposes to purposely mount a RIS on the roof of the vehicular user equipment (VUE), which can serve as an intentional back-reflector towards the base station. By controlling the reflection pattern over time, it is possible to transmit information to the sensing system, i.e., back-reflection as bit 1, no back-reflection as bit 0. The VUEs are configured to back-reflect a Hadamard code sequence, which enables T2U association. The numerical results confirm the validity of our proposal.",

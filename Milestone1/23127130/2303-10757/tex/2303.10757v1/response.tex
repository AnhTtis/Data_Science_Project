\noindent{We thank all the reviewers for their helpful comments.}\newline
\noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To Reviewer {\color{green}{\#2}}}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q1: Include relevant work~\cite{chen2022hts}.}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A1:}} {\textbf{To {\color{red}{Meta Reviewers}}}} Actually, we cited HTS-AT~\cite{chen2022hts} in the first sentence of the first paragraph in section 2. ``With large scale and realistic datasets,~\eg, AudioSet [22], advanced network architectures have been adopted for audio classification including convolutional neural networks [24, 25], convolutional-attention networks [26, 27], and recent pure-attention based networks~\cite{gong2021ast,chen2022hts}.'' We definitely add more content for HTS-AT~\cite{chen2022hts} and revise the wording of the claims. HTS-AT~\cite{chen2022hts} is a hierarchical, scalable and lightweight token-semantic transformer for audio classification. It achieves better accuracy on AudioSet and ESC-50. Furthermore, HTS-AT~\cite{chen2022hts} employs the token-semantic module to locate the event's start and end time.\newline
% \noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To reviewer\#2}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q2: The clustering improvement could be just because more data was added in the pooling.}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A2:}} We employ the same data processing as AST~\cite{gong2021ast}, and the inputs to these models are identical. The improvement is because the hierarchical design is able to extract semantically more separable representations than AST, which can be validated from higher accuracy on the four datasets.\newline
% \noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To reviewer\#2}}}\newline  Second, the claim that the network is learning hierarchical information just because performance improved over baseline pooling and because clusters are better, doesn't mean the network learned it. Certainly, more experiments are needed to confirm this.
\noindent{\textbf{Q3: This approach is outperforming others can be because there is more information being used, more attention layers, blocks, etc. Explorations of other types of comparable ``global'' scaling methods, other multiple hierarchical levels, or a pooling that would just consider more data (e.g. time/freq) than the baseline are needed.}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A3:}} Thank you for the comments. One contribution of the work is that it achieves much better accuracy while employing much fewer number of parameters and MACs. We did validate against multiple hierarchical levels in the second last paragraph of section 4.  We sincerely apologize that we cannot provide quantitative results of ``global'' scaling and pooling with more data in such a short time. Nevertheless, our method can potentially be improved by considering more data,~\etc. We will investigate them in the future work.  \newline
% \noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To reviewer\#2}}}\newline
% \noindent{\textbf{Q4:
% Authors claimed that the improvement in performance is because the network is learning from the hierarchical structure, but there aren't enough experiments to validate that the network is learning hierarchies. Authors only validate against the baseline of not using a multiscale pooling, however there was no exploration of other types of comparable "global" scaling methods, other multiple hierarchical levels, or a pooling that would just consider more data (e.g. time/freq) than the baseline.}}
% \noindent{\textbf{A4:}} Thank you for the comments. We sincerely apologize that we cannot provide quantitative results on these tasks in such a short time. Nevertheless, our method is potentially applicable in these scenes, and the extensions of our method to these tasks or models are very interesting. We will investigate them in the future work. \newline
\noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To Reviewer {\color{blue}{\#4}}}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q1: How do you think about using CNN layer in the feature extraction part before the embedding process?}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A1:} We agree that pooling in conventional CNN is quite important in audio classification. Using CNN layer in the feature extraction before the embedding can also improve the accuracy, as demonstrated in HTS-AT~\cite{chen2022hts} where window attention with local receptive field is employed, achieving a better accuracy. Simply combining CNN layer with a Transformer architecture introduces more computation and parameters. Designing a good balance and tradeoff between CNN layer and Transformer can be interesting.}\newline
% \noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To reviewer\#4}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q2: What is the main reason why the proposed method do not show significant improvement in AudioSet compared to other dataset?}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A2:}} We notice the phenomenon. We actually use the same hyperparameters for all the four datasets following [35], and do not tune the hyperparameters for any of the four datasets, as shown in the sixth paragraph of section 4. Even this, our method achieves better accuracy on all the four datasets.\newline
\noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To Reviewer {\color{magenta}{\#5}}}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q1: Please review all references. For instance, in [1] Ast:... $\rightarrow$ AST. [21] Vggsound $\rightarrow$ VGGSound.}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A1:} Thank you for the suggestion! We will carefully check all the references~\cite{gong2021ast,chen2020vggsound} and protect the titles by using additional braces in the bib file.}\newline
% \noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To reviewer\#5}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q2: Fig. 2. is too small to see important details. Maybe including a link to a web page with the image would help.}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A2:} Thank you for the great suggestion! Due to the page limitation, Fig. 2. is small. We will have a web page with the code once the process is approved.} \newline
% \noindent{\textcolor{black}{\textbf{To reviewer\#5}}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{Q3: Is the code to replicate the experiments available? If so, please include the link.}}\newline
\noindent{\textbf{A3:} Thank you for the great suggestion to make the work have high impact! We are working on the process. Once approved, the code will be available in~\url{https://github.com/amazon-science}.}

% \section{Formatting your paper}
% \label{sec:format}

% All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
% within a print area of 7 inches (178 mm) wide by 9 inches (229 mm) high. Do
% not write or print anything outside the print area. The top margin must be 1
% inch (25 mm), except for the title page, and the left margin must be 0.75 inch
% (19 mm).  All {\it text} must be in a two-column format. Columns are to be 3.39
% inches (86 mm) wide, with a 0.24 inch (6 mm) space between them. Text must be
% fully justified.

% \section{PAGE TITLE SECTION}
% \label{sec:pagestyle}

% The paper title (on the first page) should begin 1.38 inches (35 mm) from the
% top edge of the page, centered, completely capitalized, and in Times 14-point,
% boldface type.  The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title
% in capital and lower case letters.  Papers with multiple authors and
% affiliations may require two or more lines for this information. Please note
% that papers should not be submitted blind; include the authors' names on the
% PDF.

% \section{TYPE-STYLE AND FONTS}
% \label{sec:typestyle}

% To achieve the best rendering both in printed proceedings and electronic proceedings, we
% strongly encourage you to use Times-Roman font.  In addition, this will give
% the proceedings a more uniform look.  Use a font that is no smaller than nine
% point type throughout the paper, including figure captions.

% In nine point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high.  {\bf If you use the
% smallest point size, there should be no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch)
% vertically.}  This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make
% the paper much more readable.  Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger
% vertical spacing.  Please do not double-space your paper.  TrueType or
% Postscript Type 1 fonts are preferred.

% The first paragraph in each section should not be indented, but all the
% following paragraphs within the section should be indented as these paragraphs
% demonstrate.

% \section{MAJOR HEADINGS}
% \label{sec:majhead}

% Major headings, for example, "1. Introduction", should appear in all capital
% letters, bold face if possible, centered in the column, with one blank line
% before, and one blank line after. Use a period (".") after the heading number,
% not a colon.

% \subsection{Subheadings}
% \label{ssec:subhead}

% Subheadings should appear in lower case (initial word capitalized) in
% boldface.  They should start at the left margin on a separate line.
 
% \subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}
% \label{sssec:subsubhead}

% Sub-subheadings, as in this paragraph, are discouraged. However, if you
% must use them, they should appear in lower case (initial word
% capitalized) and start at the left margin on a separate line, with paragraph
% text beginning on the following line.  They should be in italics.

% \section{PRINTING YOUR PAPER}
% \label{sec:print}

% Print your properly formatted text on high-quality, 8.5 x 11-inch white printer
% paper. A4 paper is also acceptable, but please leave the extra 0.5 inch (12 mm)
% empty at the BOTTOM of the page and follow the top and left margins as
% specified.  If the last page of your paper is only partially filled, arrange
% the columns so that they are evenly balanced if possible, rather than having
% one long column.

% In LaTeX, to start a new column (but not a new page) and help balance the
% last-page column lengths, you can use the command ``$\backslash$pagebreak'' as
% demonstrated on this page (see the LaTeX source below).

% \section{PAGE NUMBERING}
% \label{sec:page}

% Please do {\bf not} paginate your paper.  Page numbers, session numbers, and
% conference identification will be inserted when the paper is included in the
% proceedings.

% \section{ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS}
% \label{sec:illust}

% Illustrations must appear within the designated margins.  They may span the two
% columns.  If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather
% than in the middle or at the bottom.  Caption and number every illustration.
% All halftone illustrations must be clear black and white prints.  Colors may be
% used, but they should be selected so as to be readable when printed on a
% black-only printer.

% Since there are many ways, often incompatible, of including images (e.g., with
% experimental results) in a LaTeX document, below is an example of how to do
% this \cite{Lamp86}.

% \section{FOOTNOTES}
% \label{sec:foot}

% Use footnotes sparingly (or not at all!) and place them at the bottom of the
% column on the page on which they are referenced. Use Times 9-point type,
% single-spaced. To help your readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and
% include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if
% you prefer, as in this sentence).

% Below is an example of how to insert images. Delete the ``\vspace'' line,
% uncomment the preceding line ``\centerline...'' and replace ``imageX.ps''
% with a suitable PostScript file name.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \begin{figure}[htb]

% \begin{minipage}[b]{1.0\linewidth}

% \section{COPYRIGHT FORMS}
% \label{sec:copyright}

% You must submit your fully completed, signed IEEE electronic copyright release
% form when you submit your paper. We {\bf must} have this form before your paper
% can be published in the proceedings.

% \section{RELATION TO PRIOR WORK}
% \label{sec:prior}

% The text of the paper should contain discussions on how the paper's
% contributions are related to prior work in the field. It is important
% to put new work in  context, to give credit to foundational work, and
% to provide details associated with the previous work that have appeared
% in the literature. This discussion may be a separate, numbered section
% or it may appear elsewhere in the body of the manuscript, but it must
% be present.

% You should differentiate what is new and how your work expands on
% or takes a different path from the prior studies. An example might
% read something to the effect: "The work presented here has focused
% on the formulation of the ABC algorithm, which takes advantage of
% non-uniform time-frequency domain analysis of data. The work by
% Smith and Cohen \cite{Lamp86} considers only fixed time-domain analysis and
% the work by Jones et al \cite{C2} takes a different approach based on
% fixed frequency partitioning. While the present study is related
% to recent approaches in time-frequency analysis [3-5], it capitalizes
% on a new feature space, which was not considered in these earlier
% studies."

% \section{REFERENCES}
% \label{sec:refs}

% List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the
% paper. The references can be numbered in alphabetic order or in
% order of appearance in the document. When referring to them in
% the text, type the corresponding reference number in square
% brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{C2}. An
% additional final page (the fifth page, in most cases) is
% allowed, but must contain only references to the prior
% literature.

% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: strings, refs, manuals). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.

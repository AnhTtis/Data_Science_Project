    "abstract": "It may be possible to reinvent how microelectronics are made using a two step process: (1) Synthesizing modular, nanometer-scale components -- transistors, sensors, and other devices -- and suspending them in a liquid \"ink\" for storage or transport; (2) Using a 3D-printer-like machine to create circuits by placing and wiring the components. Developments in nanotechnology, colloidal chemistry, precision additive manufacturing, and computer vision suggest this new process is possible. Herein, we describe a roadmap to these nanomodular electronics, which could enable a \"fab in a box\" and make fabricating microelectronics as straightforward as printing this document.",

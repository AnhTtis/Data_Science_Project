    "abstract": "Let $M$ be a compact hyperbolic $3$-manifold with volume $V$. Let $L$ be a link such that $M\\setminus L$ is hyperbolic. For any hyperbolic link $L$ in $M$, in this article, we establish an upper bound of the length of an $n^{th}$ shortest closed geodesic as a logarithmic function of $V$ in $M\\setminus L$. Our works complement the work of Lakeland and Leininger \\cite{Christopher} on the upper bound of systole length.",

  \section{Trigger Length Analysis }
\input{}
Figure \ref{Fig.trigger_length.png} shows the attack success rate with respect to length of triggers. The results are evaluated on the dev set.  We have the following observations:

(1) Triggers with different lengths generated by NURA achieve similar attack success rates. This means that the model does not bent on generating particularly long trigger statements, ensuring the stealthiness of the model.

(2) For particularly long samples, such as those in the AG's New dataset, it is also able to obtain a respectable attack success rate with very short generated triggers. This verifies that the input-unique triggers are effective to create backdoors by adding a few extra sentences.

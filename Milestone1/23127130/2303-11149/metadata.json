    "abstract": "In our recent work we identify the hybrid textures of neutrino mass matrix which simultaneously account for dark matter (DM) and neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$). We also obtained the bounds on dark matter mass and effective Majorana mass $|M_{ee}|$. In this work we look for those hybrid textures which altogether accounts for DM, $0νββ$ and leptogenesis. We have found correlation of baryon asymmetry of universe $Y$ with dark matter mass $M_1$ and effective Majorana mass $|M_{ee}|$. We use experimental bounds on relic density of dark matter ($Ωh^2$) and baryon asymmetry of universe to identify the hybrid textures. We found that out of five hybrid textures which simultaneously satisfies the physics observations of the DM and $0νββ$ only three hybrid textures altogether satisfy the DM, $0νββ$ and leptogenesis. It is interesting to note that these three hybrid textures gives lower bound to the effective Majorana mass $|M_{ee}|$ which can be probed in current and future experiments like SuperNEMO, KamLAND-Zen, NEXT, and nEXO (5 year) have sensitivity reaches of 0.05 eV, 0.045 eV, 0.03 eV, and 0.015 eV, respectively.",

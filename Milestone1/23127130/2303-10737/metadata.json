    "abstract": "We study the fundamental group of the configuration space of $n$ ordered points on the circle no three of which are equal. We compute it for $n<6$ and describe its homology for $n=6$. We also show how, for arbitrary $n$, this group can be assembled from planar braid groups, relate it to the pure cactus group and construct a cubical complex homotopy equivalent to its classifying space.",

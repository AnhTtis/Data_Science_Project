\section{Conclusions}\vspace{-5pt}

We introduced VisCo Grids, a novel grid-based surface reconstruction approach that leverages two novel geometrically motivated priors: viscosity and coarea. We advocate VisCo's prior for grid functions as an alternative to the implicit inductive bias of implicit neural representations for the task of surface reconstruction. One important limitation of our method, shared by all grid methods, is that its degrees of freedom, namely nodes' location, are set a-priori. In contrast, using non-linear function spaces, such as neural networks, allows a more flexible usage of the degrees of freedoms in the model and can adjust to areas with more detail. Nevertheless, we still believe that grid functions and direct priors, incorporated with modern computing power, are valuable add-ons to the surface reconstruction toolbox, providing few clear benefits over neural networks, such as a well-understood control over surface properties, instant inference time, and faster training.

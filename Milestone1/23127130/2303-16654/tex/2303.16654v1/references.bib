      Prior approaches to human guidance using robots inside a building have
      typically been limited to a single robot guide that navigates a human
      from start to goal. However, due to their limited mobility, the robot is
      often unable to keep up with the human's natural speed. In contrast, this
      paper addresses this difference in mobility between robots and people by
      presenting an approach that uses multiple robots to guide a human. Our
      approach uses a compact topological graph representation of the
      environment, and we first present the procedure for generating this
      representation. Next, we formulate the multi-robot guidance problem as a
      Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using a model of human motion in the
      presence of guiding robots, we define the transition function for this
      MDP. Finally, we solve the MDP using Value Iteration to obtain an
      optimal policy for placing robots and evaluate this policy's
      effectiveness.

    abstract = { Task allocation is an important aspect of many multi-robot systems. The features and complexity of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heterogenous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints. While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence draws important parallels between robotics and these fields. }

Policies are represented as joint stochastic finite-state controllers, which consist of a local controller for each agent. We also let a joint controller include a correlation device that allows the agents to correlate their behavior without exchanging information during execution, and show that this leads to improved performance. The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory, and each iteration is guaranteed to produce a controller with value at least as high as the previous one for all possible initial state distributions. For the case of a single agent, the algorithm reduces to Poupart and Boutilier's bounded policy iteration for POMDPs.},

abstract = {Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) are general models for decentralized decision making under uncertainty. However, they typically model a problem at a low level of granularity, where each agent's actions are primitive operations lasting exactly one time step. We address the case where each agent has macro-actions: temporally extended actions which may require different amounts of time to execute. We model macro-actions as 'options' in a factored Dec-POMDP model, focusing on options which depend only on information available to an individual agent while executing. This enables us to model systems where coordination decisions only occur at the level of deciding which macro-actions to execute, and the macro-actions themselves can then be executed to completion. The core technical difficulty when using options in a Dec-POMDP is that the options chosen by the agents no longer terminate at the same time. We present extensions of two leading Dec-POMDP algorithms for generating a policy with options and discuss the resulting form of optimality. Our results show that these algorithms retain agent coordination while allowing near-optimal solutions to be generated for significantly longer horizons and larger state-spaces than previous Dec-POMDP methods.},

A new MacDec-POMDP planning algorithm is presented that searches over policies represented as finite-state controllers, rather than the previous policy tree representation. Finite-state controllers can be much more concise than trees, are much easier to interpret, and can operate over an infinite horizon. The resulting policy search algorithm requires a substantially simpler simulator that models only the outcomes of executing a given set of motor controllers, not the details of the executions themselves and can solve significantly larger problems than existing MacDec-POMDP planners. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over previous methods and show that our method can be used for actual multi-robot systems through experiments on a cooperative multi-robot bartending domain. }

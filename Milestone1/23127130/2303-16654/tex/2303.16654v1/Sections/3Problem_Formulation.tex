\section{Problem Formulation}
Our multi-robot team is placed in a partially-mapped environment and tasked to find a point-goal located in unseen space in minimum expected cost (distance).
Each robot is equipped with a planar laser scanner, which it uses to localize and build an accurate map of its local surroundings, a problem setting recently coined by Merlin et al.~\cite{merlin2020locally} as a \emph{Locally} Observable Markov Decision Process (LOMDP).
We assume lossless communication between robots so that all robots have an up-to-date partial map represented as an occupancy grid, as revealed by all members of the team and the poses of each robot---collectively, the team's belief $b_t$.
Planning is centrally coordinated, and so at each time step, the team's collective action $a_t$ specifies how each robot should move so as to make progress towards the unseen goal in an effort to minimize the expected cost.

Formally, we represent this problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process \cite{kaelbling1998planning,littman1995learning} (POMDP). The expected cost $Q$ under this model can be written via a belief space variant of the Bellman equation \cite{Pineau-2002-8519}:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:POMDP}
    Q(b_t,a_t) = \sum_{b_{t+1}} P(b_{t+1}|b_t,a_t)\big[R(b_{t+1},b_t,a_t) \\[-10pt] + \min_{a_{t+1} \in \mathcal{A}(b_t+1)}Q(b_{t+1},a_{t+1})\big]
\end{multline}
Where $R(b_{t+1},b_t,a_t)$ is the cost accumulated by reaching belief state $b_{t+1}$ from $b_t$ by taking action $a_t$.

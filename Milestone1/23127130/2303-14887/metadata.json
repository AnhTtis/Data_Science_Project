    "abstract": "We study the Schur line defect correlation functions in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\\mathcal{N}=2^*$ $U(N)$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. We find exact closed-form formulae of the correlation functions of the Wilson line operators in the fundamental, antisymmetric and symmetric representations via the Fermi-gas method in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. All the Schur line defect correlators are shown to be expressible in terms of multiple series that generalizes the Kronecker theta function. From the large $N$ correlators we obtain generating functions for the spectra of the D5-brane giant and the D3-brane dual giant and find a correspondence between the fluctuation modes and the plane partition diamonds.",

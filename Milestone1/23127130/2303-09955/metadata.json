    "abstract": "We investigate the transition of a two-level atom as the Unruh-Dewitt detector accelerated in the electromagnetic field in this paper. The enhancement of the transition probability is found for different field states under the conditions that the anti-Unruh effect appears. In particular, the enhancement is the most prominent when the field state takes the squeezed state. We also construct a new atomic trajectory to realize the effect of acceleration-induced transparency. Based on this, we show that the anti-Unruh effect still exists even at the specific atomic energy difference where acceleration-induced transparency happens.",

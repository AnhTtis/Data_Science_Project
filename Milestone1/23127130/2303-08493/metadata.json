    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling within multiferroic structures is paramount from a fundamental as well as an applied point of view. We report here that the magnetoelectric properties, as well as the magnetization, of BaTiO$_3$-BiFeO$_3$ superlattices can be tuned by varying the BiFeO$_3$ layer thickness. The magnetoelectric voltage coefficient ($α_{ME}$) reaches its maximum of 60.2 Vcm$^{-1}$Oe$^{-1}$ at 300 K, one of the highest values reported so far, for a sample with a BiFeO$_3$ thickness of 5 nm and a BaTiO$_3$ thickness of 10 nm. To gain deeper insight into the increased magnetoelectric coupling, and both the local and macroscopic magnetic properties, samples with varying BiFeO$_3$ thicknesses have been investigated. Correlations were established between the hyperfine field (HFF), the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient and the magnetization. The possible mechanisms responsible for the strong magnetoelectric coupling are discussed.",

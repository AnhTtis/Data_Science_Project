    "abstract": "We investigate both from a qualitative as well as quantitative perspective the emergence of chaos in the QCD confining string in a magnetic field from a holographic viewpoint. We use an earlier developed bottom-up solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton action that mimics QCD and its thermodynamics quite well. Surprisingly, our predictions depend on the used frame: the magnetic field tends to suppress the chaos in both perpendicular and parallel directions relative to the magnetic field in the string frame whilst in the Einstein frame, the chaos suppression only happens in the perpendicular direction, with an enhanced chaos along the magnetic field. The amount of suppression/enhancement in both frames does depend on the relative orientation of the string and magnetic field.",

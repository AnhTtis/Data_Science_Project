    "abstract": "Let $V_{L}$ be the vertex algebra associated to a non-degenerate even lattice $L$, $θ$ the automorphism of $V_{L}$ induced from the $-1$ symmetry of $L$, and $V_{L}^{+}$ the fixed point subalgebra of $V_{L}$ under the action of $θ$. In this series of papers, we classify the irreducible weak $V_{L}^{+}$-modules and show that any irreducible weak $V_{L}^{+}$-module is isomorphic to a weak submodule of some irreducible weak $V_{L}$-module or to a submodule of some irreducible $θ$-twisted $V_{L}$-module. Let $M(1)^{+}$ be the fixed point subalgebra of the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra $M(1)$ under the action of $θ$. In this paper (Part $2$), we show that there exists an irreducible $M(1)^{+}$-submodule in any non-zero weak $V_{L}^{+}$-module and we compute extension groups for $M(1)^{+}$.",

The source codes of both simulators are available under an academic non-commercial use license, allowing researchers full access to standard-compliant simulation environments. Owing to the open source availability, the simulators enable reproducible research in wireless communications and comparison of novel algorithms. In this study, we explain how link and system level simulations are connected and show how the link level simulator serves as a reference to design the system level simulator. We compare the accuracy of the PHY modeling at system level by means of simulations performed both with bit-accurate link level simulations and PHY-model-based system level simulations. We highlight some of the currently most interesting research questions for LTE, and explain by some research examples how our simulators can be applied.},

  abstract = {Multi-dimensional model order selection (MOS) techniques achieve an improved accuracy, reliability, and robustness, since they consider all dimensions jointly during the estimation of parameters. Additionally, from fundamental identifiability results of multi-dimensional decompositions, it is known that the number of main components can be larger when compared to matrix-based decompositions. In this article, we show how to use tensor calculus to extend matrix-based MOS schemes and we also present our proposed multi-dimensional model order selection scheme based on the closed-form PARAFAC algorithm, which is only applicable to multi-dimensional data. In general, as shown by means of simulations, the Probability of correct Detection (PoD) of our proposed multi-dimensional MOS schemes is much better than the PoD of matrix-based schemes.},

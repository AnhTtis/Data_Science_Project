    "abstract": "We consider a class of nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problems over the Stiefel manifold where the objective function is the summation of a nonconvex smooth function and a nonsmooth Lipschitz continuous convex function composed with an linear mapping. We propose three numerical algorithms for solving this problem, by combining smoothing methods and some existing algorithms for smooth optimization over the Stiefel manifold. In particular, we approximate the aforementioned nonsmooth convex function by its Moreau envelope in our smoothing methods, and prove that the Moreau envelope has many favorable properties. Thanks to this and the scheme for updating the smoothing parameter, we show that any accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by the proposed algorithms is a stationary point of the original optimization problem. Numerical experiments on building graph Fourier basis are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",

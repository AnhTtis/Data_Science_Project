    "abstract": "We introduce a nonconforming virtual element method for the Poisson equation on domains with curved boundary and internal interfaces. We prove arbitrary order optimal convergence in the energy and $L^2$ norms, and validate the theoretical results with numerical experiments. Compared to existing nodal virtual elements on curved domains, the proposed scheme has the advantage that it can be designed in any dimension.",

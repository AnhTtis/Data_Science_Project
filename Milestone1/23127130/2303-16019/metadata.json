    "abstract": "We investigate the infinite temperature dynamics of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK$_4$) complimented with a single particle hopping term (SYK$_2$), leading to the chaos-to-integrable crossover of the many-body eigenstates. Due to the presence of the all-to-all connected SYK$_2$ term, a non-equilibrium prethermal state emerges for a finite time window $t_{th}\\propto 2^{a/\\sqrtλ}$ that scales with the relative interaction strength $λ$, between the SYK terms before eventually exhibiting thermalization for all $λ$. The scaling of the plateau with $λ$ is consistent with the many-body Fock space structure of the time-evolved wave function. In the integrable limit, the wavefunction in the Fock space has a stretched exponential dependence on distance. On the contrary, in the SYK$_4$ limit, it is distributed equally over the Fock space points characterizing the ergodic phase at long times.",

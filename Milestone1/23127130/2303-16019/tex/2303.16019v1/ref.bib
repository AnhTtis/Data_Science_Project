  Abstract                 = {The question whether Anderson insulators can persist to finite-strength interactions—a scenario dubbed many-body localization—has recently received a great deal of interest. The origin of such a many-body localized phase has been described as localization in Fock space, a picture we examine numerically. We then formulate a precise sense in which a single energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian can be adiabatically connected to a state of a non-interacting Anderson insulator. We call such a state a many - body localized state and define a many-body localized phase as one in which almost all states are many-body localized states. We explore the possible consequences of this; the most striking is an area law for the entanglement entropy of almost all excited states in a many-body localized phase. We present the results of numerical calculations for a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions. Our results are consistent with an area law and, by implication, many-body localization for almost all states and almost all regions for weak enough interactions and strong disorder. However, there are rare regions and rare states with much larger entanglement entropies. Furthermore, we study the implications that many-body localization may have for topological phases and self-correcting quantum memories. We find that there are scenarios in which many-body localization can help to stabilize topological order at non-zero energy density, and we propose potentially useful criteria to confirm these scenarios.},

abstract = {Quantum systems are predicted to be better at information processing than their classical counterparts, and quantum entanglement is key to this superior performance. But how does one gauge the degree of entanglement in a system? Brydges et al. monitored the build-up of the so-called Rényi entropy in a chain of up to 10 trapped calcium ions, each of which encoded a qubit. As the system evolved, interactions caused entanglement between the chain and the rest of the system to grow, which was reflected in the growth of the Rényi entropy. Science, this issue p. 260 The buildup of entropy in an ion chain reflects a growing entanglement between the chain and its complement. Entanglement is a key feature of many-body quantum systems. Measuring the entropy of different partitions of a quantum system provides a way to probe its entanglement structure. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring the second-order Rényi entropy based on statistical correlations between randomized measurements. Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits, prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts, in both the absence and presence of disorder. Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory, which is applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to several tens of qubits.}}

 

@article{Fleckenstein2021,
abstract = {We study the dynamics of periodically kicked many-body systems away from the high-frequency regime, and discuss a family of Floquet systems where the notion of prethermalization can be naturally extended to intermediate and low driving frequencies. We investigate numerically the dynamics of both integrable and nonintegrable systems, and report on the formation of a long-lived prethermal plateau, akin to the high-frequency limit, where the system thermalizes with respect to an effective Hamiltonian captured by the inverse-frequency expansion (IFE). Unlike the high-frequency regime, we find that the relevant heating times are model dependent: we analyze the stability of the prethermal plateau to small perturbations in the drive period and show that, in a spin chain whose IFE is intractable, the plateau duration is insensitive to the perturbation strength, in contrast to a chain where the IFE admits the resummation of an entire subseries. Infinitesimal perturbations are enough to restore the ergodic properties of the system, and decrease residual finite-size effects. Although the regime where the Floquet system leaves the prethermal plateau and starts heating up to infinite temperature is not captured by the IFE, we provide evidence that the evolved subsystem is described well by a thermal state with respect to the IFE Hamiltonian, with a gradually changing temperature, in accord with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.},

The latter is supposed to be superior within a limited and fixed auxiliary space dimension. Surprisingly, we find that the performance of algorithms depends on the model considered. In particular, many-body localized systems as well as the crossover regions between localized and delocalized phases are better described by tDMRG, contrary to the delocalized regime where TDVP indeed outperforms tDMRG in terms of accuracy and reliability. As an example, we study many-body localization transition in a large size Heisenberg chain. We discuss drawbacks of previous estimates [Phys. Rev.

  Abstract                 = {Messy, interacting quantum-mechanical systems are difficult to analyze theoretically. In a single spatial dimension, the calculations are still tractable, and experiments have recently confirmed the prediction that sufficiently strong disorder can disrupt the transport of interacting particles. In two dimensions, however, the theoretical blueprint is missing. Choi et al. used single-site imaging of cold 87Rb atoms in an optical lattice to show that similar localization occurs in two-dimensional (2D) systems. The study highlights the power of quantum simulation to solve problems that are currently inaccessible to classical computing techniques.Science, this issue p. 1547A fundamental assumption in statistical physics is that generic closed quantum many-body systems thermalize under their own dynamics. Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site{\textendash}resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments represent a demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization in a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers.},

In the non-ergodic phase a quantum state evolves in a much smaller fraction of the Hilbert space than would be allowed by the conservation of extensive observables. By the anomalous scaling of the participation ratios with system size we are led to consider the distribution of the wave function coefficients, a standard observable in modern studies of Anderson localization. We finally present a criterion for the identification of the ergodicity-breaking (many-body localization) transition based on these distributions which is quite robust and well suited for numerical investigations of a broad class of problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We benchmark a variant of the recently introduced density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-X algorithm against exact results for the localized random field XX chain. We find that the eigenstates obtained via DMRG-X exhibit a highly accurate l-bit description for system sizes much bigger than the direct, many-body, exact diagonalization in the spin variables is able to access. We take advantage of the underlying free fermion description of the XX model to accurately test the strengths and limitations of this algorithm for large system sizes. We discuss the theoretical constraints on the performance of the algorithm from the entanglement properties of the eigenstates, and its actual performance at different values of disorder. A small but significant improvement to the algorithm is also presented, which helps significantly with convergence. We find that, at high entanglement, DMRG-X shows a bias towards eigenstates with low entanglement, but can be improved with increased bond dimension. This result suggests that one must be careful when applying the algorithm for interacting many-body localized spin models near a transition.This article is part of the themed issue {\textquoteleft}Breakdown of ergodicity in quantum systems: from solids to synthetic matter{\textquoteright}.},

abstract = {We review the physics of many-body localization in models with incommensurate potentials. In particular, we consider one-dimensional quasiperiodic models with single-particle mobility edges. A conventional perspective suggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized states in the presence of of interactions. However, contrary to this intuition there is evidence that such systems can display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the delocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or topology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of such incommensurate models, in the non-interacting limit, shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and fully localized many-body states. Non-interacting incommensurate models cannot thermalize dynamically and remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for a certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e. metallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of ergodicity in these models. The phenomenon of localization and non-ergodicity in a system with interactions despite the presence of single-particle delocalized states is closely related to the so-called “many-body proximity effect” and can also be observed in models with disorder coupled to systems with delocalized degrees of freedom. Many-body localization in systems with incommensurate potentials (without single-particle mobility edges) have been realized experimentally, and we show how this can be modified to study the the effects of such mobility edges. Demonstrating the failure of thermalization in the presence of a single-particle mobility edge in the thermodynamic limit would indicate a more robust violation of the ETH.},

abstract = {We numerically explore the many body localization (MBL) transition through the lens of the entanglement spectrum. While a direct transition from localization to thermalization is believed to be obtained in the thermodynamic limit (the exact details of which remain an open problem), in finite system sizes there exists an intermediate 'quantum critical' regime. Previous numerical investigations have explored the crossover from thermalization to criticality, and have used this to place a numerical lower bound on the critical disorder strength for MBL. A careful analysis of the high energy part of the entanglement spectrum (which contains universal information about the critical point) allows us to study the crossover from criticality to MBL, and we find evidence for such a crossover which could allow us to place a numerical upper bound on the critical disorder strength for MBL.},

@article{Ghosh2022,
abstract = {We study the growth of the number entropy SN in one-dimensional number-conserving interacting systems with strong disorder, which are believed to display many-body localization. Recently a slow and small growth of SN has been numerically reported, which, if holding at asymptotically long times in the thermodynamic limit, would imply ergodicity and therefore the absence of true localization. By numerically studying SN in the disordered isotropic Heisenberg model we first reconfirm that, indeed, there is a small growth of SN. However, we show that such growth is fully compatible with localization. To be specific, using a simple model that accounts for expected rare resonances we can analytically predict several main features of numerically obtained SN: trivial initial growth at short times, a slow power-law growth at intermediate times, and the scaling of the saturation value of SN with the disorder strength. Because resonances crucially depend on individual disorder realizations, the growth of SN also heavily varies depending on the initial state, and therefore SN and von Neumann entropy can behave rather differently.},

We find evidence that in the regime which is expected to show many-body localization and where the entanglement entropy grows as S∼lnt as function of time t, the number entropy grows as SN∼lnlnt, indicating continuing subdiffusive particle transport at a very slow rate. We demonstrate that this growth is consistent with a relation between entanglement and number entropy recently established for noninteracting systems.},

We measure the time evolution of an initial charge density wave after a quench and analyze the corresponding relaxation exponents. We find clear signatures of MBL when the corresponding noninteracting model is deep in the localized phase. We also critically compare and contrast our results with those from a tight-binding Aubry-Andr{\'{e}} model, which does not exhibit a single-particle intermediate phase, in order to identify signatures of a potential many-body intermediate phase.},

	abstract = {Some one-dimensional disordered interacting quantum systems have been theoretically predicted to display a property termed many-body localization (MBL), where the system retains the memory of its initial state and fails to thermalize. However, proving experimentally that something does not occur is tricky. Instead, physicists have proposed monitoring the entanglement entropy of the system, which should grow logarithmically with evolution time in an MBL system. Lukin et al. observed this characteristic logarithmic trend in a disordered chain of interacting atoms of rubidium-87. This method should be generalizable to other experimental platforms and higher dimensions.Science, this issue p. 256An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system{\textquoteright}s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body{\textendash}localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered systems.},

abstract = {The vast complexity is a daunting property of generic quantum states that poses a significant challenge for theoretical treatment, especially in non-equilibrium setups. Therefore, it is vital to recognize states which are locally less complex and thus describable with (classical) effective theories. We use unsupervised learning with autoencoder neural networks to detect the local complexity of time-evolved states by determining the minimal number of parameters needed to reproduce local observations. The latter can be used as a probe of thermalization, to assign the local complexity of density matrices in open setups and for the reconstruction of underlying Hamiltonian operators. Our approach is an ideal diagnostics tool for data obtained from (noisy) quantum simulators because it requires only practically accessible local observations.},

abstract = {We analyze the saturation value of the bipartite entanglement and number entropy starting from a random product state deep in the many-body localized (MBL) phase. By studying the probability distributions of these entropies we find that the growth of the saturation value of the entanglement entropy stems from a significant reshuffling of the weight in the probability distributions from the bulk to the exponential tails. In contrast, the probability distributions of the saturation value of the number entropy are converged with system size, and exhibit a sharp cutoff for values of the number entropy which correspond to one particle fluctuating across the boundary between the two halves of the system. Our results therefore rule out slow particle transport deep in the MBL phase and confirm that the slow entanglement entropy production stems uniquely from configurational entanglement.},

	journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
	abstract = {For short-ranged disordered quantum models in one dimension, the many-body-localization is analyzed via the adaptation to the many-body context (Serbyn et al 2015 Phys. Rev. X 5 041047) of the Thouless point of view on the Anderson transition: the question is whether a local interaction between two long chains is able to reshuffle completely the eigenstates (delocalized phase with a volume-law entanglement) or whether the hybridization between tensor states remains limited (many-body-localized phase with an area-law entanglement). The central object is thus the level of hybridization induced by the matrix elements of local operators, as compared with the difference of diagonal energies. The multifractal analysis of these matrix elements of local operators is used to analyze the corresponding statistics of resonances. Our main conclusion is that the critical point is characterized by the strong-multifractality spectrum , well known in the context of Anderson localization in spaces of effective infinite dimensionality, where the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the volume. Finally, the possibility of a delocalized non-ergodic phase near criticality is discussed.}

Rev . X 4 011052) is described to produce the whole set of excited states, via the iterative construction of the local integrals of motion (LIOMs). The RG rules are then explicitly derived for arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonians (free-fermions models) and for the Kitaev chain with local interactions involving even numbers of consecutive Majorana fermions. The emphasis is put on the advantages of the Majorana language over the usual quantum spin language to formulate unified RSRG-X rules.},

@article{Modak2015,
abstract = {In one dimension, noninteracting particles can undergo a localization-delocalization transition in a quasiperiodic potential. Recent studies have suggested that this transition transforms into a many-body localization (MBL) transition upon the introduction of interactions. It has also been shown that mobility edges can appear in the single particle spectrum for certain types of quasiperiodic potentials. Here, we investigate the effect of interactions in two models with such mobility edges. Employing the technique of exact diagonalization for finite-sized systems, we calculate the level spacing distribution, time evolution of entanglement entropy, optical conductivity, and return probability to detect MBL. We find that MBL does indeed occur in one of the two models we study, but the entanglement appears to grow faster than logarithmically with time unlike in other MBL systems.},

  Abstract                 = { We review some recent developments in the statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems. We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden. },

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the length- and timescales needed to approach the critical region of MBL from the delocalised phase, studying both eigenstates and the time evolution of an initial state. For the eigenstates we show that in the delocalised region there is a single length, which is a function of disorder strength, controlling the finite-size flow. Small systems look localised, and only for larger systems do resonances develop which restore ergodicity in the form of the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis. For the transport properties, we study the time necessary to transport a single spin across a domain wall, showing how this grows quickly with increasing disorder, and compare it with the Heisenberg time. For a sufficiently large system the Heisenberg time is always larger than the transport time, but for a smaller system this is not necessarily the case. We conclude that the properties of the MBL transition cannot be explored using the system sizes or times available to current numerical and experimental studies.},

In the thermalizing region we identify the evolution under increasing system size of the eigenvalue distribution function, whose thermodynamic limit is close to (but possibly different from) the Marchenko–Pastur distribution. From the analysis we extract a correlation length ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2017/11/113102/jstataa9338ieqn001.gif] {$L_s(h)$} determining the minimum system size to enter the asymptotic region.

@article{Guo2021,
abstract = {Quantum emulators, owing to their large degree of tunability and control, allow the observation of fine aspects of closed quantum many-body systems, as either the regime where thermalization takes place or when it is halted by the presence of disorder. The latter, dubbed many-body localization (MBL) phenomenon, describes the nonergodic behavior that is dynamically identified by the preservation of local information and slow entanglement growth. Here, we provide a precise observation of this same phenomenology in the case where the quenched on-site energy landscape is not disordered, but rather linearly varied, emulating the Stark MBL. To this end, we construct a quantum device composed of 29 functional superconducting qubits, faithfully reproducing the relaxation dynamics of a nonintegrable spin model. At large Stark potentials, local observables display periodic Bloch oscillations, a manifesting characteristic of the fragmentation of the Hilbert space in sectors that conserve dipole moments. The flexible programmability of our quantum emulator highlights its potential in helping the understanding of nontrivial quantum many-body problems, in direct complement to simulations in classical computers.},

To understand that behavior, physicists have turned to quantum simulation, in which a tunable and clean system can be monitored as it evolves under the influence of interactions. Roushan et al. used a chain of nine superconducting qubits to create effective interactions between normally noninteracting photons and directly measured the energy levels of their system. The interplay of interactions and disorder gave rise to a transition to a localized state. With an increase in the number of qubits, the technique should be able to tackle problems that are inaccessible to classical computers.Science, this issue p. 1175Quantized eigenenergies and their associated wave functions provide extensive information for predicting the physics of quantum many-body systems. Using a chain of nine superconducting qubits, we implement a technique for resolving the energy levels of interacting photons. We benchmark this method by capturing the main features of the intricate energy spectrum predicted for two-dimensional electrons in a magnetic field{\textemdash}the Hofstadter butterfly. We introduce disorder to study the statistics of the energy levels of the system as it undergoes the transition from a thermalized to a localized phase. Our work introduces a many-body spectroscopy technique to study quantum phases of matter.},

  Abstract                 = {Disorder can stop the transport of noninteracting particles in its tracks. This phenomenon, known as Anderson localization, occurs in disordered solids, as well as photonic and cold atom settings. Interactions tend to make localization less likely, but disorder, interactions, and localization may coexist in the so-called many-body localized state. Schreiber et al. detect many-body localization in a one-dimensional optical lattice initially filled with atoms occupying alternating sites. Externally induced disorder and interactions prevented the system from evolving quickly to a state with a single atom on each site.Science, this issue p. 842Many-body localization (MBL), the disorder-induced localization of interacting particles, signals a breakdown of conventional thermodynamics because MBL systems do not thermalize and show nonergodic time evolution. We experimentally observed this nonergodic evolution for interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasirandom optical lattice and identified the MBL transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder, the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all initial ordering, whereas above a critical disorder strength, a substantial portion of the initial ordering persists. The critical disorder value shows a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Our experiment paves the way to further detailed studies of MBL, such as in noncorrelated disorder or higher dimensions.},

We study this transition in the XXZ model with disordered magnetic field and focus on the time evolution following a global quantum quench. While the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement and spin fluctuations are already known to provide insights into the nature of the many-body localized phases, we discuss the relevance of these quantities in the context of the localization transition. In particular, we observe that near the transition the long time limits of both quantities show behavior similar to divergent thermodynamic fluctuations.},

abstract = {We study time dynamics of 1D disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain focusing on a regime of large system sizes and a long time evolution. This regime is relevant for observation of many-body localization (MBL), a phenomenon that is expected to freeze the dynamics of the system and prevent it from reaching thermal equilibrium. Performing extensive numerical simulations of the imbalance, a quantity often employed in the experimental studies of MBL, we show that the regime of a slow power-law decay of imbalance persists to disorder strengths exceeding by at least a factor of 2 the current estimates of the critical disorder strength for MBL. Even though we investigate time evolution up to few thousands tunneling times, we observe no signs of the saturation of imbalance that would suggest freezing of system dynamics and provide a smoking gun evidence of MBL. We demonstrate that the situation is qualitatively different when the disorder is replaced by a quasiperiodic potential. In this case, we observe an emergence of a pattern of oscillations of the imbalance that is stable with respect to changes in the system size. This suggests that the dynamics of quasiperiodic systems remain fully local at the longest time scales we reach provided that the quasiperiodic potential is sufficiently strong. Our study identifies challenges in an unequivocal experimental observation of the phenomenon of MBL.},

abstract = {The article reviews the physics of Anderson localization on random regular graphs (RRG) and its connections to many-body localization (MBL) in disordered interacting systems. Properties of eigenstate and energy level correlations in delocalized and localized phases, as well at criticality, are discussed. In the many-body part, models with short-range and power-law interactions are considered, as well as the quantum-dot model representing the limit of the “most long-range” interaction. Central themes – which are common to the RRG and MBL problems – include ergodicity of the delocalized phase, localized character of the critical point, strong finite-size effects, and fractal scaling of eigenstate correlations in the localized phase.}

The long-time dynamics is particularly sensitive to changes in the spectrum and in the structures of the eigenstates. The study of the evolution of the survival probability, Shannon information entropy, and von Neumann entanglement entropy enables the distinction between the chaotic and the intermediate region.},

author = {Johannes Dieplinger and Soumya Bera and Ferdinand Evers},
abstract = {The Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model is a rare example of a strongly-interacting system that is analytically tractable. Tractability arises because the model is largely structureless by design and therefore artificial: while the interaction is restricted to two-body terms, interaction matrix elements are “randomized” and therefore the corresponding interaction operator does not commute with the local density. Unlike conventional density–density-type interactions, the SYK-interaction is, in this sense, not integrable. We here investigate a variant of the (complex) SYK model, which restores this integrability. It features a randomized single-body term and a density–density-type interaction. We present numerical investigations suggesting that the model exhibits two integrable phases separated by several intermediate phases including a chaotic one. The chaotic phase carries several characteristic SYK-signatures including in the spectral statistics and the frequency scaling of the Green’s function and therefore should be adiabatically connected to the non-Fermi liquid phase of the original SYK model. Thus, our model Hamiltonian provides a bridge from the SYK-model towards microscopic realism.}

Starting from a recently proposed mapping of the SYK model onto Liouville quantum mechanics, we obtain our results by exact integration over conformal Goldstone modes reparameterizing physical time. Perhaps, the least expected result of our analysis is that at time scales proportional to the number of particles the out of time order correlation function crosses over from a regime of exponential decay to a universal t−6 power-law behavior.}

abstract = {We present a replica path integral approach describing the quantum chaotic dynamics of the SYK model at large time scales. The theory leads to the identification of non-ergodic collective modes which relax and eventually give way to an ergodic long time regime (describable by random matrix theory). These modes, which play a role conceptually similar to the diffusion modes of dirty metals, carry quantum numbers which we identify as the generators of the Clifford algebra: each of the 2N different products that can be formed from N Majorana operators defines one effective mode. The competition between a decay rate quickly growing in the order of the product and a density of modes exponentially growing in the same parameter explains the characteristics of the system's approach to the ergodic long time regime. We probe this dynamics through various spectral correlation functions and obtain favorable agreement with existing numerical data.}

\section{Conclusion}

Bi-hand manipulation is taken for granted in humans, but it has been a long-standing challenge for real-world robotic systems due to planning and deployment difficulties. In this work, we present a system for enabling bi-manual assembly of multiple magnetic blocks, with the policy learned via RL in simulation without human demonstrations and then transferred zero-shot to the real world. We detail task and algorithm designs, and provide a list of generic techniques, such as behavior constraints and action interpolation, that could help facilitate other Sim2Real manipulation tasks with larger workspace and multi-arm coordination. We hope our work could serve as a proof-of-concept and inspire a series of future robot learning work to venture into more challenging and dexterous bi-manual manipulation tasks, such as assembly, tool construction, tool use, cloth folding, and cooking, and to deploy such systems in the real world. %\sg{will reword and shorten}

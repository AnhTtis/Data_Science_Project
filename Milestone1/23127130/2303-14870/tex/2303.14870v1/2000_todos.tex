% \sg{We shouldn't have too many Sections as that could make navigation difficult. We should be clear that this is a "system" paper to demonstrate result on a really challening task. i like paper structure like https://taochenshh.github.io/projects/in-hand-reorientation#  https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7uSBJDoP7tY. very simple and clear Section structure}

% \subsection{Task specification}
% put "Connect Task" here?

% observations, actions, reward, ..

% \subsection{Direct Joint-Space Control}

% \subsection{Reinforcement Learning Algorithm}
% PPO, SAC.

% \subsection{Behavior Constraints}

% \subsection{Perception and Actuation Noise}


\yc{Should we specify the dimension of each of the above observations/actions in this section (E)?}\sk{yeah let's addres if we have space (moved to TODO)}

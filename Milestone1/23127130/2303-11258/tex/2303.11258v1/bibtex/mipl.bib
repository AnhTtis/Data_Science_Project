  abstract = {We propose a new approach to robot path planning that consists of
	building and searching a graph connecting the local minima of a potential
	function defined over the robot's configuration space. A planner
	based on this approach has been implemented. This planner is consider
	ably faster than previous path planners and solves prob lems for
	robots with many more degrees of freedom (DOFs). The power of the
	planner derives both from the "good" properties of the potential
	function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape
	the local min ima of this function. The most powerful of these tech
	niques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local min ima by executing
	Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic
	use of distributed rep resentations (bitmaps) for the robot's work
	space and configuration space. We have experimented with the plan
	ner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects
	with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and
	manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces).
	Some of the most significant experiments are reported in this article.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Placement of electrophysiology catheters and pacing leads
	in the coronary sinus is challenging in some patients, particularly
	those with dilated cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that cannulation
	of the coronary sinus and its branches can be facilitated by direct
	visualization. This study reports our experience with navigation
	into and within the coronary sinus in a closed-chest animal preparation,
	using a flexible steerable fiberoptic infrared endoscope that allows
	visualization through flowing blood. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this
	study was to assess the feasibility of direct visualization of endocardial
	structures through infrared endoscopy. METHODS: Internal jugular
	venous access was obtained in 10 healthy mongrel dogs (weight 35-45
	kg). The infrared endoscope (2900 fiber imaging bundle, wavelength
	1,620 nm, frame rate 10-30/s, 320 x 256 pixels) was advanced to the
	coronary sinus ostium and branches by direct visualization of anatomic
	landmarks, such as the tricuspid valve and inferior vena cava. Localization
	was confirmed by fluoroscopy, contrast injection, and pathologic
	examination. RESULTS: Structures such as the tricuspid valve and
	inferior vena cava were visualized at distances of 1 to 2 cm, allowing
	successful coronary sinus identification and engagement in all 10
	dogs. Coronary sinus branch images closely resembled pathologic findings.
	CONCLUSION: Direct visualization of the coronary sinus ostium and
	branches is possible through infrared endoscopy. This technique likely
	will facilitate coronary sinus engagement and navigation for pacing
	lead and catheter placement.},

	multiple scans may be directly compared. This capability provides
	a novel quantitative method to address the fundamental problem of

  abstract = {Optimal-path maps tell robots or people the best way to reach a goal
	point from anywhere in a known terrain area, eliminating most of
	the need to plan during travel. The authors address the construction
	of optimal-path maps for two-dimensional polygonal weighted-region
	terrain, terrain partitioned into polygonal areas such that the cost
	per unit of distance traveled is homogeneous and isotropic within
	each area. This is useful for overland route planning across varied
	ground surfaces and vegetation. The authors propose a new algorithm
	that recursively partitions terrain into regions of similar optimal-path
	behavior, and defines corresponding "path subspaces" for these regions.
	This process constructs a piecewise-smooth function of terrain position
	whose gradient direction is everywhere the optimal-path direction,
	permitting quick path finding. The algorithm used is more complicated
	than the current path-caching and wavefront-propagation algorithms,
	but it gives more accurate maps requiring less space to represent.
	Experiments with an implementation confirm the practicality of the
	authors' algorithm.},

    "abstract": "We describe algorithms for computing supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs using algebraic models of modular curves. The algorithms we describe were used to compute all supersingular isogeny graphs for all pairs $(p,\\ell)$ with $p \\leq 2048$ and $\\ell \\leq 13$.\n  In addition, we use our results to prove a conjecture posed by Nakaya.",

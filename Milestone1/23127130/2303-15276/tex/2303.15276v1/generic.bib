  abstract = {One of the problems we face in many-valued logic is the difficulty of capturing the intuitive meaning of the connectives introduced through truth tables. At the same time, however, some logics have nice ways to capture the intended meaning of connectives easily, such as four-valued logic studied by Belnap and Dunn. Inspired by Dunn's discovery, we first describe a mechanical procedure, in expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic, to obtain truth conditions in terms of the behavior of the Truth and the False, which gives us intuitive readings of connectives, out of truth tables. Then, we revisit the notion of functional completeness, which is one of the key notions in many-valued logic, in view of Dunn's idea. More concretely, we introduce a generalized notion of functional completeness which naturally arises in the spirit of Dunn's idea, and prove some fundamental results corresponding to the classical results proved by Post and S{\l}upecki.},

The conditions for the procedure are given in terms of (purely syntactic) abstract properties of the base calculus; thus, the method applies to large classes of calculi and logics. If the calculus satisfies certain additional properties, we prove the converse direction, thus characterising the class of axioms that can be captured by structural display rules. Determining if an axiom belongs to this class or not is shown to be decidable. Applied to the display calculus for tense logic, we obtain a new proof of Kracht’s Display Theorem I.},

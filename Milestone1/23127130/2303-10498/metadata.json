    "abstract": "This work builds upon recent work exploiting the notion of structured singular values to capture nonlinear interactions in the analysis of wall-bounded shear flows. In this context, the structured uncertainty can be interpreted in terms of the flow structures most likely to be amplified (the optimal perturbations). Here we further analyze these perturbations through a problem reformulation that decomposes this uncertainty into three components associated with the streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise velocity correlations. We then demonstrate that the structural features of these correlations are consistent with nonlinear optimal perturbations and results from secondary stability analysis associated with streamwise streaks. These results indicate the potential of structured input-output analysis for gaining insight into both linear and nonlinear behavior that can be used to inform sensing and control strategies for transitional wall-bounded shear flows.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to quantize singular systems. This is an extension of the constant integration method (Belhadi et al. (2014)) which is applicable only for the case of exactly solvable systems. In our approach, we determine Dirac brackets at the initial instant with the help of Taylor expansion, and using their covariance, we deduce the brackets at any time. We also illustrate our approach by studying two systems: the self-dual model and the Dirac spinorial field. Keywords : quantization, singular systems, integration constants, Liouville operator, Taylor expansion.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized quasi-shuffle products and give a criterion for their associativity. These extend the quasi-shuffle products introduced by Hoffman, which are often used to describe the stuffle and shuffle product for multiple zeta values. For $q$-analogues of multiple zeta values, the description of an analogue for the shuffle product can often not be described with the classical notion of quasi-shuffle products. We show that our generalization gives a natural extension to also include these types of products and we prove a generalization of a duality between the $q$-shuffle product and the $q$-stuffle product.",

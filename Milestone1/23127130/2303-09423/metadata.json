    "abstract": "Quantum speed limits for isolated systems that take the form of a distance divided by a speed extend straightforwardly to closed systems. This is, for example, the case with the well-known Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit. Margolus and Levitin derived an equally well-known and ostensibly related quantum speed limit, and it seems to be widely believed that the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit can be similarly extended to closed systems. However, a recent geometrical examination of this limit reveals that it differs significantly from most quantum speed limits. In this paper, we show contrary to the common belief that the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit does not extend to closed systems in an obvious way. More precisely, we show that there exist closed systems that evolve between states with any given fidelity in an arbitrarily short time while keeping the normalized expected energy fixed at any chosen value. We also show that for isolated systems, the Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit and a slightly weakened version of this limit that we call the Bhatia-Davies quantum speed limit always saturate simultaneously. Both of these evolution time estimates extend straightforwardly to closed systems. We demonstrate that there are closed systems that saturate the Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit but not the Bhatia-Davies quantum speed limit.",

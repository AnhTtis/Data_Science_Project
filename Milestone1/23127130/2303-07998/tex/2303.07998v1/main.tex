\addchaptertocentry{Abstract}


In their study of pseudo-differential operators, Fefferman \& Phong showed in \cite{Fefferman-Phong} that every non-negative function \(f\in C^{3,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)\) can be written as a finite sum of squares of functions in \(C^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)\). In this thesis, we generalize their decomposition result to show that if \(f\in C^{k,\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n)\) is non-negative for \(0\leq k\leq 3\) and \(0<\alpha\leq 1\), then \(f\) can be written as a finite sum of squares of functions that are each `half' as regular as \(f\), in the sense that they belong to the H\"older space
\[
    C^\frac{k+\alpha}{2}(\mathbb{R}^n)=\begin{cases}\hfil C^{\frac{k}{2},\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^n) & k\textrm{ even}, \\ C^{\frac{k-1}{2},\frac{1+\alpha}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^n) & k\textrm{ odd}.
    \end{cases}
\]
We also investigate sufficient conditions for such regularity preserving decompositions to exist when \(k\geq 4\), and we construct examples of functions which cannot be decomposed into finite sums of half-regular squares.


The aforementioned result of \cite{Fefferman-Phong}, as well as its subsequent refinements by Tataru in \cite{Tataru} and Sawyer \& Korobenko in \cite{SOS_I}, have been repeatedly used to investigate the properties of certain differential operators. We discuss similar applications of our generalized decomposition result to several problems in partial differential equations. In addition, we develop techniques for constructing non-negative polynomials which are not sums of squares of polynomials, and we prove related results which could not be found in a review of the literature.

My greatest thanks goes to my supervisor, Dr. Eric Sawyer, for his indispensable guidance and helpful advice throughout my graduate studies at McMaster University. His encouragement and kind words have made the preparation of this thesis a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and I have learned a great deal under his mentorship.

I would also like to thank the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University for fostering a lively and supportive work environment, and my fellow graduate students for many helpful conversations and plenty of memorable experiences. I also graciously acknowledge my mentor and collaborator, Dr. Scott Rodney at Cape Breton University, for encouraging me to study at McMaster and for providing helpful advice and good conversation along the way. 

Finally, I want to thank all of my family and friends for their unwavering support and affirmations as I conducted this research. I am grateful to have you all in my life.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the Robinson graphon completion/recovery problem within the class of $L^p$-graphons, focusing on the range $5<p\\leq \\infty$. A graphon $w$ is Robinson if it satisfies the Robinson property: if $x\\leq y\\leq z$, then $w(x,z)\\leq \\min\\{w(x,y),w(y,z)\\}$. We demonstrate that if a graphon possesses localized near-Robinson characteristics, it can be effectively approximated by a Robinson graphon in terms of cut-norm. To achieve this recovery result, we introduce a function $Λ$, defined on the space of $L^p$-graphons, which quantifies the degree to which a graphon $w$ adheres to the Robinson property. We prove that $Λ$ is a suitable gauge for measuring the Robinson property when proximity of graphons is understood in terms of cut-norm. Namely, we show that (1) $Λ(w)=0$ precisely when $w$ is Robinson; (2) $Λ$ is cut-norm continuous, in the sense that if two graphons are close in the cut-norm, then their $Λ$ values are close; and (3) for $p > 5$, any $L^p$-graphon $w$ can be approximated by a Robinson graphon, with error of the approximation bounded in terms of $Λ(w)$. When viewing $w$ as a noisy version of a Robinson graphon, our method provides a concrete recipe for recovering a cut-norm approximation of a noiseless w. Given that any symmetric matrix is a special type of graphon, our results can be applicable to symmetric matrices of any size. Our work extends and improves previous results, where a similar question for the special case of $L^\\infty$-graphons was answered.",

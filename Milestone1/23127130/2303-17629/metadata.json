    "abstract": "Amidst the rapid advancements in experimental technology, noise-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices have become increasingly programmable, offering versatile opportunities to leverage quantum computational advantage. Here we explore the intricate dynamics of programmable NISQ devices for quantum reservoir computing. Using a genetic algorithm to configure the quantum reservoir dynamics, we systematically enhance the learning performance. Remarkably, a single configured quantum reservoir can simultaneously learn multiple tasks, including a synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators, chaotic motifs in gene regulatory networks, and the fractional-order Chua's circuit. Our configured quantum reservoir computing yields highly precise predictions for these learning tasks, outperforming classical reservoir computing. We also test the configured quantum reservoir computing in foreign exchange (FX) market applications and demonstrate its capability to capture the stochastic evolution of the exchange rates with significantly greater accuracy than classical reservoir computing approaches. Through comparison with classical reservoir computing, we highlight the unique role of quantum coherence in the quantum reservoir, which underpins its exceptional learning performance. Our findings suggest the exciting potential of configured quantum reservoir computing for exploiting the quantum computation power of NISQ devices in developing artificial general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining real-time communication quality in metaverse has always been a challenge, especially when the number of participants increase. We introduce a proprietary WebRTC SFU service to an open-source web-based VR platform, to realize a more stable and reliable platform suitable for educational communication of audio, video, and avatar transform. We developed the web-based VR platform and conducted a preliminary validation on the implementation for proof of concept, and high performance in both server and client sides are confirmed, which may indicates better user experience in communication and imply a solution to realize educational metaverse.",

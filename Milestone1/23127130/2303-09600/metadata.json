    "abstract": "For polycrystalline deformation in metals such as Zircaloy-4, the slip strength at different strain rates will control mechanical response and strongly influence the anisotropy of plastic deformation. In this work, the slip activity and strain rate sensitivity of the <a> basal, <a> prismatic, and <c+a> pyramidal slip systems were explored by testing at variable strain rates (1E-4 s^-1 and 125 s^-1) using single crystal micropillar compression tests. These systematic experiments enabled the direct fitting of the strain rate sensitivities of the different slip systems using a simple analytical model to reveal that deformation will be accommodated using different slip systems depending on the strain rate of deformation in addition to the stress state (i.e. Schmid's law). This insight helps inform metal forming and understanding of the mechanical performance of these engineering alloys in the extremes of service conditions.",

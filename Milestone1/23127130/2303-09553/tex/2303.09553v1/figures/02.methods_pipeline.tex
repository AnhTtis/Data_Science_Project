    \textbf{\algname{} Optimization:} 
    \textit{Left}: \algname{} represents a field of 3D volumes, parameterized by position $x,y,z$ and scale $s$ (orange cube). To render a CLIP embedding along a ray, the field is sampled and averaged according to NeRF's volume rendering weights. Physical scale corresponds to an image scale $s_\text{img}$ via projective geometry. \textit{Right}: We pre-compute a multi-scale feature pyramid of CLIP embeddings over training views, and during training interpolate this pyramid with $s_\text{img}$ and the ray's pixel location to obtain CLIP supervision. The CLIP loss maximizes cosine similarity, and other outputs are supervised with mean squared-error using standard per-pixel rendering.}

    \captionof{figure}{\textbf{\algfull{} (\algname).} \algname{} grounds CLIP representations in a dense, multi-scale 3D field. 
    A \algname{} can be reconstructed from a hand-held phone capture within 45 minutes, then can render dense relevancy maps given textual queries interactively in real-time. 
    \algname{} enables a broad range of concepts to be queried via natural language, from abstract queries like \textit{``Electricity''}, visual properties like \textit{``Yellow''}, long-tail objects such as \textit{``Waldo''}, and even reading text like \textit{``Boops''} on the mug. 
        For each prompt, an RGB image and relevancy map are rendered focusing on the location with maximum relevancy activation.

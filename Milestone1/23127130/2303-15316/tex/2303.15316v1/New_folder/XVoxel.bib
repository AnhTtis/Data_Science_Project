A relaxed formulation obtained by homogenization is used, whereby perforated composite materials are admitted as structural components. This approach has the advantage of placing no implicit restriction on the topology of the design. We compare our results with those of Bendsoe, Kikuchi, and Suzuki who used an approach similar to ours.},

The effective macroscopic properties of such materials are governed by the complex interaction of the individual constituents of the associated microstructure. A sufficient macroscopic phenomenological description of these materials up to a certain order of accuracy can be very complicated or even impossible. On the contrary, a whole resolution of the fine scale for the macroscopic boundary value problem by means of a classical discretization technique seems to be too elaborate.},

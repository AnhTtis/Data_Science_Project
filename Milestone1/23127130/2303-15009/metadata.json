    "abstract": "The subject matter of the paper concerns the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP) equations in the context of magnetic confinement. We study the long-time behavior of the VPFP system with an intense external magnetic field, when neglecting the curvature of the magnetic lines. When the intensity of the magnetic field tends to infinity, the long-time behavior of the particle concentration is described by a first-order nonlinear hyperbolic equation of the Euler type for fluid mechanics. More exactly, when the magnetic field is uniform, we find the vorticity formulation of the incompressible Euler equations in two-dimensional space. Our proofs rely on the modulated energy method.",

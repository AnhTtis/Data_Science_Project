    "abstract": "We demonstrate mid-circuit measurements in a neutral atom array by shelving data qubits in protected hyperfine-Zeeman sub-states while non-destructively measuring an ancilla qubit. Measurement fidelity was enhanced using microwave repumping of the ancilla during the measurement. The coherence of the shelved data qubits was extended during the ancilla readout with dynamical decoupling pulses, after which the data qubits are returned to mf = 0 computational basis states. We demonstrate that the quantum state of the data qubits is well preserved up to a constant phase shift with a state preparation and measurement (SPAM) corrected process fidelity of F = 97.0(5)%. The measurement fidelity on the ancilla qubit after correction for state preparation errors is F = 94.9(8)% and F = 95.3(1.1)% for |0> and |1> qubit states, respectively. We discuss extending this technique to repetitive quantum error correction using quadrupole recooling and microwave-based quantum state resetting.",

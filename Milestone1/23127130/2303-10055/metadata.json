    "abstract": "White dwarfs are the most common endpoints of stellar evolution. They are often found in close binary systems in which the white dwarf is accreting matter from a companion star, either via an accretion disc or channelled along the white dwarf magnetic field lines. The nature of this binary depends on the masses and the separation of the two stellar components, as well as other parameters such as the white dwarf magnetic field and the nature of the stars. This chapter looks at the formation of white dwarfs and intrinsic properties, before looking at the different populations of accreting white dwarf binary systems that exist. The chapter covers the characteristics of the various sub-populations and looks at how they evolve. The means to discover and study various sub-classes of accreting white dwarfs in the optical and other bands is discussed, and the role of these systems in the broader astrophysical context is considered. Future missions that will find new systems and new populations are also reviewed. Finally some of the current open questions regarding accreting white dwarfs are presented.",

    "abstract": "We describe a fabrication stackup for digital logic with 16 superconducting NbTiN layers, self-shunted a-silicon barrier Josephson Junctions (JJs), and low loss, high-$κ$ tunable HZO capacitors. The stack enables 400 MJJ/cm$^2$ device density, efficient routing, and AC power distribution on a resonant network. The materials scale beyond 28nm lithography and are compatible with standard high-temperature CMOS processes. We report initial results for two-metal layer NbTiN wires with 50nm critical dimension. A semi-ascendance wire-and-via process module using 193i lithography and 50nm critical dimension has shown cross-section uniformity of 1%=1s across the 300mm wafer, critical temperature of 12.5K, and critical current of 0.1mA at 4.2K. We also present a new design of the resonant AC power network enabled by NbTiN wires and HZO MIM capacitors. The design matches the device density and provides a 30 GHz clock with estimated efficiency of up to 90%. Finally, magnetic imaging of patterned NbTiN ground planes shows low intrinsic defectivity and consistent trapping of vorteces in 0.5 mm holes spaced on a 20 $μ$m x 20 $μ$m grid.",

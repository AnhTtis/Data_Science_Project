    "abstract": "The dissemination of information and the development of public opinion are essential elements of most social media platforms and are often described as distinct, man-made occurrences. However, what is often disregarded is the interdependence between these two phenomena. Information dissemination serves as the foundation for the formation of public opinion, while public opinion, in turn, drives the spread of information. In our study, we model the co-evolutionary relationship between information and public opinion on heterogeneous multiplex networks. This model takes into account a minority of individuals with steadfast opinions and a majority of individuals with fluctuating views. Our findings reveal the equilibrium state of public opinion in this model and a linear relationship between mainstream public opinion and extreme individuals. Additionally, we propose a strategy for regulating public opinion by adjusting the positions of extreme groups, which could serve as a basis for implementing health policies influenced by public opinion.",

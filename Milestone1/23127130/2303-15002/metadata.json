    "abstract": "In this note, we report on a record-breaking Condorcet domain (CD) for n=8 alternatives. We show that there exists a CD of size 224, which is optimal and essentially unique (up to isomorphism). If we consider the underlying permutations and focus on Condorcet domains containing the identity permutation, 56 isomorphic such Condorcet domains exist. Our work sheds light on the structure of CDs and UCDs and has potential applications in voting theory and social choice.",

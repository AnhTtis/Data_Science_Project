\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
%In this article, 
We have introduced {\textsf InnerCore}, which utilizes data depth-based core discovery to identify the influential nodes in temporal blockchain token networks. Furthermore, we have proposed two metrics, {\textsf InnerCore} expansion and decay, that provide a sentiment indicator for the networks and explain trader mood. 

Finally, with a centered-motif analysis in the {\textsf InnerCore}, we detected market manipulators and e-crime behavior. 
The scalability and computational efficiency of {\textsf InnerCore} discovery make it well-suited for analyzing large temporal graphs, including those found in Ethereum transaction and stablecoin networks. Our experiments, which compare our findings against external ground truth, baselines, and state-of-the-art attributed change detection
approach in dynamic graphs, show that {\textsf InnerCore} efficiently extracts useful information from large networks compared to existing methods. 
In future, we shall use {\textsf InnerCore} to explore network robustness against Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks.

Blockchains are significantly easing \textit{trade finance}, with billions of dollars worth of assets being transacted daily. However, analyzing these networks remains challenging due to the sheer volume and complexity of the data.
We introduce a method named {\textsf InnerCore} that detects market manipulators within blockchain-based networks and offers a sentiment indicator for these networks. This is achieved through data depth-based core decomposition and centered motif discovery, ensuring scalability. 
{\textsf InnerCore} is a computationally efficient, unsupervised approach suitable for analyzing large temporal graphs. 
We demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing and detecting three recent real-world incidents from our datasets: the catastrophic collapse of LunaTerra, the Proof-of-Stake switch of Ethereum, and the temporary peg loss of USDC -- while also verifying our results against external ground truth. Our experiments show that {\textsf InnerCore} can match the qualified analysis accurately without human involvement, automating blockchain analysis in a scalable manner, while being more effective and efficient than baselines and state-of-the-art attributed change detection approach in dynamic graphs.

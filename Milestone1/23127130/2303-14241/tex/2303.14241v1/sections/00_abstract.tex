Blockchains are now significantly easing \textit{trade finance}, with billions of dollars worth of assets being transacted daily. However, analyzing these networks remains challenging due to the large size and complexity of the data.
We introduce a scalable approach called {\sf InnerCore} for identifying key actors in blockchain-based networks and providing a sentiment indicator for the networks using data depth-based core decomposition and centered-motif discovery.  
{\sf InnerCore} is a computationally efficient, unsupervised approach suitable for analyzing large temporal graphs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies on the recent collapse of LunaTerra and the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) switch of Ethereum, using external ground truth collected by a leading blockchain analysis company. Our experiments show that {\sf InnerCore} can match the qualified analysis accurately without human involvement, automating blockchain analysis and its trend detection in a scalable manner.

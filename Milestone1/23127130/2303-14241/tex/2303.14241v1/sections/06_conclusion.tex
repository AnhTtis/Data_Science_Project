\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
In this article, we   introduced {\sf InnerCore}, which utilizes data depth-based core discovery to identify the most influential nodes in temporal blockchain networks. Furthermore, we proposed two metrics, {\sf InnerCore} expansion and decay, that provide a sentiment indicator for the networks and explain investor mood. These metrics help in understanding the behavior of the network and predicting its long-term stability.  
The scalability and computational efficiency of {\sf InnerCore} discovery make it well-suited for analyzing large temporal graphs, including those found in Ethereum transaction and stablecoin networks. Our experiments, which included comparing our findings with those of six forensic experts from the prominent blockchain data analytics company Nansen.ai, show that {\sf InnerCore} can efficiently extract useful information from large networks. 
As a future work, we plan to use {\sf InnerCore} to explore network robustness against Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks.

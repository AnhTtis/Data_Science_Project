\section{Conclusion}

We discover the sensitivity of audio spectrogram to positional transformations, which is important to audio analysis. 
%
Therefore, we introduce an Adversarial Sample Generation (ASG) mechanism, to enhance the discriminative power of learned audio representation. 
%
It first constructs the negative pair by flipping or translating spectrogram along time or frequency axis, then enforces the instances of negative pair to be pushed away in the latent space, driving CNN more sensitive to the positional information in spectrogram. 
%
Our experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ASG and extensive ablation studies are conducted to clarify the contribution of each adversarial data transformation. 
%
% The future work lies in two aspects. On the one hand, we will explore new architecture to directly address the position insensitivity in audio analysis. On the other hand, more positional transformations should be designed to improve the performance of general-purpose audio representation further.

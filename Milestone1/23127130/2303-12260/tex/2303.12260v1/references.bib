	abstract = {This paper presents the design and use of an artificial lateral-line system for a bio-inspired robotic fish capable of autonomous flow-speed estimation and rheotaxis (the natural tendency of fish to orient upstream), using only flow-sensing information. We first present a feedback controller based on the difference between pressure measurements collected on opposite sides of the fish robot. We then describe a dynamic rheotaxis controller based on a potential-flow model and a Bayesian observer that uses two or more pressure sensors in an arbitrary arrangement. Pressure sensor placements are selected based on nonlinear observability analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme, which include robustness to model error and sensor noise. The primary contribution of this paper is a framework for rheotaxis and flow-speed estimation based on pressure-difference information that does not require fitting model parameters to flow field conditions.},

@article{Ahuja_2010,
	abstract = {We present an estimator-based control design procedure for flow control, using reduced-order models of the governing equations linearized about a possibly unstable steady state. The reduced-order models are obtained using an approximate balanced truncation method that retains the most controllable and observable modes of the system. The original method is valid only for stable linear systems, and in this paper, we present an extension to unstable linear systems. The dynamics on the unstable subspace are represented by projecting the original equations onto the global unstable eigenmodes, assumed to be small in number. A snapshot-based algorithm is developed, using approximate balanced truncation, for obtaining a reduced-order model of the dynamics on the stable subspace.The proposed algorithm is used to study feedback control of two-dimensional flow over a flat plate at a low Reynolds number and at large angles of attack, where the natural flow is vortex shedding, though there also exists an unstable steady state. For control design, we derive reduced-order models valid in the neighbourhood of this unstable steady state. The actuation is modelled as a localized body force near the trailing edge of the flat plate, and the sensors are two velocity measurements in the near wake of the plate. A reduced-order Kalman filter is developed based on these models and is shown to accurately reconstruct the flow field from the sensor measurements, and the resulting estimator-based control is shown to stabilize the unstable steady state. For small perturbations of the steady state, the model accurately predicts the response of the full simulation. Furthermore, the resulting controller is even able to suppress the stable periodic vortex shedding, where the nonlinear effects are strong, thus implying a large domain of attraction of the stabilized steady state.},

	abstract = { Advances in experimental techniques and the ever-increasing fidelity of numerical simulations have led to an abundance of data describing fluid flows. This review discusses a range of techniques for analyzing such data, with the aim of extracting simplified models that capture the essential features of these flows, in order to gain insight into the flow physics, and potentially identify mechanisms for controlling these flows. We review well-developed techniques, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection, and discuss more recent techniques developed for linear systems, such as balanced truncation and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). We then discuss some of the methods available for nonlinear systems, with particular attention to the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator that completely characterizes the dynamics of a nonlinear system and provides an extension of DMD to nonlinear systems.},

@article{Tu_2013,
	abstract = {We demonstrate a three-step method for estimating time-resolved velocity fields using time-resolved point measurements and non-time-resolved particle image velocimetry data. A variant of linear stochastic estimation is used to obtain an initial set of time-resolved estimates of the flow field. These estimates are then used to identify a linear model of the flow dynamics. The model is incorporated into a Kalman smoother, which provides an improved set of estimates. We verify this method with an experimental study of the wake behind an elliptical-leading-edge flat plate at a thickness Reynolds number of 3,600. We find that, for this particular flow, the Kalman smoother estimates are more accurate and more robust to noise than the initial, stochastic estimates. Consequently, dynamic mode decomposition more accurately identifies coherent structures in the flow when applied to the Kalman smoother estimates. Causal implementations of the estimators, which are necessary for flow control, are also investigated. Similar outcomes are observed, with model-based estimation outperforming stochastic estimation, though the advantages are less pronounced.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors to estimate the states of linear dynamical systems. Specifically, the goal is to choose (at design-time) a subset of sensors (satisfying certain budget constraints) from a given set in order to minimize the trace of the steady state a priori or a posteriori error covariance produced by a Kalman filter. We show that the a priori and a posteriori error covariance-based sensor selection problems are both NP-hard, even under the additional assumption that the system is stable. We then provide bounds on the worst-case performance of sensor selection algorithms based on the system dynamics, and show that greedy algorithms are optimal for a certain class of systems. However, as a negative result, we show that certain typical objective functions are not submodular or supermodular in general. While this makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of greedy algorithms for sensor selection (outside of certain special cases), we show via simulations that these greedy algorithms perform well in practice.},

@article{Haller_2015,
	abstract = { Typical fluid particle trajectories are sensitive to changes in their initial conditions. This makes the assessment of flow models and observations from individual tracer samples unreliable. Behind complex and sensitive tracer patterns, however, there exists a robust skeleton of material surfaces, Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), shaping those patterns. Free from the uncertainties of single trajectories, LCSs frame, quantify, and even forecast key aspects of material transport. Several diagnostic quantities have been proposed to visualize LCSs. More recent mathematical approaches identify LCSs precisely through their impact on fluid deformation. This review focuses on the latter developments, illustrating their applications to geophysical fluid dynamics. },

@article{Horev_2017,
	abstract = {Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices in the form of covariance matrices, for example, are ubiquitous in machine learning applications. However, because their size grows quadratically with respect to the number of variables, high-dimensionality can pose a difficulty when working with them. So, it may be advantageous to apply to them dimensionality reduction techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a canonical tool for dimensionality reduction, which for vector data maximizes the preserved variance. Yet, the commonly used, naive extensions of PCA to matrices result in sub-optimal variance retention. Moreover, when applied to SPD matrices, they ignore the geometric structure of the space of SPD matrices, further degrading the performance. In this paper we develop a new Riemannian geometry based formulation of PCA for SPD matrices that (1) preserves more data variance by appropriately extending PCA to matrix data, and (2) extends the standard definition from the Euclidean to the Riemannian geometries. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our approach as pre-processing for EEG signals and for texture image classification.},

@article{Hinson_2014,
	abstract = { This work considers the optimal sensor placement problem for a general nonlinear system using the eigenvalues of the observability Gramian in the cost function. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer convex optimization problem. Using the empirical observability Gramian, the input data to this optimization problem are computed from a simulation of the nonlinear system with no analytical model required. A piecewise linear approximation to the observability Gramian is proposed using special ordered sets of type two, allowing a coarser sensor location mesh and thus fewer binary variables and shorter solution times compared with standard gridded approaches. The solution methodology is applied to vortex estimation in the wake of a flapping airfoil using velocity sensors on the surface of the airfoil, which is modeled using unsteady potential flow and a Joukowski conformal mapping. Resulting optimal sensor sets are found near the trailing edge in pairs on the upper and lower surface. Although the observability Gramian is computed from the linearized system, the optimal sensor sets yield improved performance of an unscented Kalman filter estimating wake vortex structure on the nonlinear dynamics; the optimal sets outperform more than 99\% of the sampled feasible sensor sets, thus validating the observability eigenvalues as a measure of nonlinear estimator performance. },

However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framewor},

	abstract = {SUMMARY We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

@article{Champion,
	abstract = {Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science.The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam{\textquoteright}s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

	abstract = {The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a ``black box'' integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered ...},

	abstract = { Abstract Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results. },

@article{BPOD,
	abstract = { Many of the tools of dynamical systems and control theory have gone largely unused for fluids, because the governing equations are so dynamically complex, both high-dimensional and nonlinear. Model reduction involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate the full high-dimensional dynamics. This paper compares three different methods of model reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced truncation, and a method called balanced POD. Balanced truncation produces better reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally tractable for very large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method for computing approximate balanced truncations, that has computational cost similar to that of POD. The method presented here is a variation of existing methods using empirical Gramians, and the main contributions of the present paper are a version of the method of snapshots that allows one to compute balancing transformations directly, without separate reduction of the Gramians; and an output projection method, which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs is large. The output projection method requires minimal additional computation, and has a priori error bounds that can guide the choice of rank of the projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation are also illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed as POD of a particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as an inner product. The three methods are illustrated on a numerical example, the linearized flow in a plane channel. },

Like any data processing technique, DMD's usefulness is limited by its ability to extract real and accurate dynamical features from noise-corrupted data. Here, we show analytically that DMD is biased to sensor noise, and quantify how this bias depends on the size and noise level of the data. We present three modifications to DMD that can be used to remove this bias: (1) a direct correction of the identified bias using known noise properties, (2) combining the results of performing DMD forwards and backwards in time, and (3) a total least-squares-inspired algorithm. We discuss the relative merits of each algorithm and demonstrate the performance of these modifications on a range of synthetic, numerical, and experimental datasets. We further compare our modified DMD algorithms with other variants proposed in the recent literature.},

@article{Emotion,
	abstract = {Subtle emotions are present in diverse real-life situations: in hostile environments, enemies and/or spies maliciouslyconceal their emotions as part of their deception; in life-threatening situations, victims under duress have no choice but to withhold theirreal feelings; in the medical scene, patients with psychological conditions such as depression could either be intentionally orsubconsciously suppressing their anguish from loved ones. Under such circumstances, it is often crucial that these subtle emotions arerecognized before it is too late. These spontaneous subtle emotions are typically expressed through micro-expressions, which are tiny,sudden and short-lived dynamics of facial muscles; thus, such micro-expressions pose a great challenge for visual recognition. Theabrupt but significant dynamics for the recognition task are temporally sparse while the rest, i.e. irrelevant dynamics, are temporallyredundant. In this work, we analyze and enforce sparsity constraints to learn significant temporal and spectral structures whileeliminating irrelevant facial dynamics of micro-expressions, which would ease the challenge in the visual recognition of spontaneoussubtle emotions. The hypothesis is confirmed through experimental results of automatic spontaneous subtle emotion recognition withseveral sparsity levels on CASME II and SMIC, the two well-established and publicly available spontaneous subtle emotion databases.The overall performances of the automatic subtle emotion recognition are boosted when only significant dynamics of the originalsequences are preserved.},

The eigenvalue distribution of DMD is symmetrical along the real axis of the plane, and the eigenvalues appear as conjugate pairs. The DMD method can accurately extract the frequency characteristics, and results show that the decomposed Mode at St = 2.224 is related to the shedding frequency of cloud cavitation, which agrees well with the shedding frequency of 2.208--2.805 in experimental measurement. The POD method can effectively analyze the major structure of high energy, in which the first four modes contain over 60\% total energy of flow field. In comparison of POD, the DMD is more effective to decompose the complex flow field into uncoupled coherent structures with specific dynamic modes and corresponding frequencies.},

@article{Pan_2017,
	abstract = {The dynamics of a large-scale stagnation vortex pair in an axisymmetric stagnation flow subject to a laminar wake disturbance is measured by time-resolved two-dimensional particle image velocimetry, and then quantitatively characterized by both the Eulerian velocity/vorticity fields and the Lagrangian finite-time Lyapunov exponents fields. This vortex pair is found to be the result of the forced response of the stagnation flow to the upstream shearing disturbances, and presents a dynamical evolution of quasi-periodic shedding due to short-wave elliptical instability. Dynamic mode decomposition analysis of both the Eulerian measure and the Lagrangian measure is taken for a quantitative description of this process. The sparsity-promoting scheme (Jovanovi{\'{c}} et al. Phys Fluids 26(2):024,103, 2014), which integrates the mode identification and truncation as a whole, is used to distinguish those modes with dynamical significance from irrelevant ones with transient behavior. The superiority of this scheme is evidenced by the facts that it avoids the eigenvalue contamination problem, and credits higher priority to the sub-dominant modes directly associated with the system dynamics. It is found that the energetic mode with a frequency of 0.177 Hz, or about 10{\%} of the maximum shear rate of the upstream wake, determines the quasi-periodical vortex formation process. Its half-order harmonic represents the vortex shedding event along one fixed direction. High-order even-quarter harmonics jointly contribute to the circular pattern of the vortex tube. In addition, a set of low-frequency odd-quarter harmonics are highlighted as the elliptical instability and the following vortex deformation process. Based on this finding, a reduce-order representation with 8 Eulerian modes or 56 Lagrangian modes is proposed to characterize the dominant dynamics of this unsteady vortical stagnation flow. In addition, the Eulerian measure seems to be more efficient than the Lagrangian measure in terms of reduced-order representation.},

@article{BRUNTON_2016,
	abstract = {Background
There is a broad need in neuroscience to understand and visualize large-scale recordings of neural activity, big data acquired by tens or hundreds of electrodes recording dynamic brain activity over minutes to hours. Such datasets are characterized by coherent patterns across both space and time, yet existing computational methods are typically restricted to analysis either in space or in time separately.
New method
Here we report the adaptation of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), an algorithm originally developed for studying fluid physics, to large-scale neural recordings. DMD is a modal decomposition algorithm that describes high-dimensional dynamic data using coupled spatial--temporal modes. The algorithm is robust to variations in noise and subsampling rate; it scales easily to very large numbers of simultaneously acquired measurements.
Results
We first validate the DMD approach on sub-dural electrode array recordings from human subjects performing a known motor task. Next, we combine DMD with unsupervised clustering, developing a novel method to extract spindle networks during sleep. We uncovered several distinct sleep spindle networks identifiable by their stereotypical cortical distribution patterns, frequency, and duration.
Comparison with existing methods
DMD is closely related to principal components analysis (PCA) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We may think of DMD as a rotation of the low-dimensional PCA space such that each basis vector has coherent dynamics.
Conclusions
The resulting analysis combines key features of performing PCA in space and power spectral analysis in time, making it particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale neural recordings.},

@article{ZHANG_2014,
	abstract = {A comprehensive comparison was conducted on the identification of coherent structures in fluid flow using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The influences that multi-dominant structures and high-order harmonics had on the decomposed modes were taken into extensive consideration. To this end, a series of fabricated patterns was constructed for the benchmark testing to simulate multi-dominant convective structures superimposed in a stationary field. The comparison showed that the temporal DMD method could clearly separate each structure in the spatial and spectral senses, while the POD mode corresponding to the desired structure is contaminated by the other uncorrelated structures. Subsequently, two case studies of the real wake flows, which were determined from high-repetition TR-PIV measurements, were employed to demonstrate the discrepancies of the POD and DMD algorithms in extracting coherent structures. For the wake flow behind a single cylinder at ReD=8000, the temporal DMD algorithm accurately determined the frequency, wavelength and convection speed of the Karman-like vortex street and its higher-order harmonics. However, although the first two POD modes are closely related to the Karman-like vortex street, the higher POD modes embedded as larger structures are obscure in the physical significance. Finally, the wake flow behind two side-by-side cylinders of different diameters at ReD=1000 based on the diameter of the small cylinder was measured; two configurations with different gaps were chosen for comparison, i.e., G/D=0.5 and 2.0. For the wake flow at G/D=0.5, the POD and DMD algorithms determined the major features of the single-dominant structure. For the wake flow at G/D=2.0, the first and second temporal DMD modes effectively and independently extracted the Karman-like vortex structures behind the large and small cylinders, respectively. Meanwhile, although the first and second pairs of POD modes generally captured these two convecting structures, respectively, there was obvious existence of the undesirable contamination of the POD mode, as reflected in the interaction between the desired and uncorrelated structures.},

	abstract = {We investigate experimentally the unsteady, three-dimensional vortex formation of low-aspect-ratio, trapezoidal flat-plate fins undergoing rotation from rest at a 90$\,^{\circ}$ angle of attack and Reynolds numbers of O (10 3 ). The objectives are to characterize the unsteady three-dimensional vortex structure, examine vortex saturation, and understand the effects of the root-to-tip flow for different velocity programs. The experiments are conducted in a water tank facility, and the diagnostic tools are dye flow visualization and digital particle image velocimetry. The dye visualizations show that the low-aspect-ratio plate produces symmetric ring-like vortices comprised mainly of tip-edge vorticity. They also indicate the presence of the root-to-tip velocity. For large rotational amplitudes, the primary ring-like vortex sheds and a secondary ring-like vortex is generated while the plate is still in motion, indicating saturation of the leading vortex. The time-varying vortex circulation in the flow symmetry plane provides quantitative evidence of vortex saturation. The phenomenon of saturation is observed for several plate velocity programs. The temporal development of the vortex circulation is often complex, which prevents an objective determination of an exact saturation time. This is the result of an interaction between the developing vortex and the root-to-tip flow, which breaks apart the vortex. However, it is possible to define a range of time during which the vortex reaches saturation. A formation-parameter definition is investigated and is found to reasonably predict the state corresponding to the pinch-off of the initial tip vortex across the velocity programs tested. This event is the lower bound on the saturation time range.},

The objectives are to characterize the fluid velocity near the tip of the plate for different plate kinematics. The experiments are conducted in a water tank facility, and digital particle image velocimetry is performed to obtain planar velocity measurements. The flow in the region near the tip is relatively insensitive to Reynolds number over the range studied. The component normal to the plate is unaffected by total rotational amplitude, while the tangential component has dependence on this angle. Also, an estimate of the first tip vortex pinch-off time is obtained from the near-tip velocity data and agrees very well with values estimated using circulation. The angle of incidence of the bulk root-to-tip flow relative to the plate normal becomes more oblique with increasing rotational amplitude. Accordingly, the peak magnitude of the tangential velocity is also increased and as a result advects fluid momentum away from the plate at a higher rate. The more oblique impingement of the root-to-tip flow for increasing rotational amplitude is shown to have a distinct effect on the associated fluid dynamic force normal to the plate. For impulsive plate deceleration the time that a nonnegligible force exists decreases, while for nonimpulsive plate deceleration both this time and the relative force magnitude decrease for larger rotational amplitudes.},

@article{sysID,
	abstract = { Dynamic mode decomposition has emerged as a leading technique to identify spatiotemporal coherent structures from high-dimensional data, benefiting from a strong connection to nonlinear dynamical systems via the Koopman operator. In this work, two recent innovations that extend dynamic mode decomposition to systems with actuation and systems with heavily subsampled measurements are integrated and unified. When combined, these methods yield a novel framework for compressive system identification. It is possible to identify a low-order model from limited input--output data and reconstruct the associated full-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to the state of the reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data are available, it is possible to dramatically accelerate downstream computations by first compressing the data. This unified framework is demonstrated on two model systems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of measurements (e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.), compression ratios, and different choices of actuation (e.g., localized, broadband, etc.). In the first example, this architecture is explored on a test system with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state dimension. The second example consists of a real-world engineering application given by the fluid flow past a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This example provides a challenging and realistic test case for the proposed method, and results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well characterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data. },

	abstract = {Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

	abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated {\textquotedblleft}reverse engineering{\textquotedblright} approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.},

We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality.

@article{ElasticNet,
	abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p ≫ n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

@inbook{Graff_2021,
	abstract = { Recent progress in sparse regression has enabled the construction of nonlinear dynamic models from data. This paper presents a method for discovering governing dynamic equations of data using Least Angle Regression (LARS) with an orthogonalization step. A library of candidate symbolic expressions is evaluated using measurements of the state components to create candidate covariates, which are vectors onto which the data is regressed. LARS is applied to select and appropriately scale covariates to fit time-derivative measurements of the state components. The symbolic expressions that correspond to the selected covariates are similarly weighted and summed to create a model of the system's dynamics. If the candidate covariate vectors are not orthogonal, performing Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix containing the covariates provides right-singular vectors that can serve as an orthogonal basis for LARS. The three-variable Lorenz system and two-vortex flow models provide test cases with known dynamics. The proposed model-construction method successfully recovers the Lorenz equations from data and identifies the governing equations of motion for two vortices advecting in a background potential flow. },

@article{Yang_2010,
	abstract = {Sensor placement at the extrema of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) is efficient and leads to accurate reconstruction of the ocean state from a limited number of measurements. In this paper, we develop important new extensions of this approach that optimize sensor placement to avoid redundant measurements, employ imperfect EOF modes, and take into account measurement errors. We use the simulation outputs of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model applied to the Nantucket Sound region to evaluate the performances of the new approach and compare it against other similar techniques. Specifically, we find that there exists a critical size of exclusion volume (whose value is unknown a priori) surrounding each sensor that prevents clustering of sensors while minimizing the reconstruction error. In addition, we propose a new algorithm that can be effective in incorporating gappy data in assimilation schemes. We also derive analytical formulas of the uncertainty in the reconstructed field given any inaccuracies in the measurements. Taken together these developments will aid further in the development of truly real-time adaptive sampling for ocean forecasting.},

@article{WILLCOX2006,
	abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been widely used in fluid dynamic applications for extracting dominant flow features. The ``gappy'' POD is an extension to this method that allows the consideration of incomplete data sets. In this paper, the gappy POD is extended to handle unsteady flow reconstruction problems, such as those encountered when limited flow measurement data is available. In addition, a systematic approach for effective sensor placement is formulated within the gappy framework using a condition number criterion. This criterion allows for accurate flow reconstruction results and yields sensor configurations that are robust to sensor noise. Two applications are considered. The first aims to reconstruct the unsteady flow field using a small number of surface pressure measurements for a subsonic airfoil undergoing plunging motion. The second considers estimation of POD modal content of a cylinder wake flow for active control purposes. In both cases, using the dominant POD basis vectors and a small number of sensor signals, the gappy approach is found to yield accurate flow reconstruction results.},

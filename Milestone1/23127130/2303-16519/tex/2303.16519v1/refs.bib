 abstractNote={In his formal papers on existential graphs, Peirce tended to obscure the simplicity of EGs with distracting digressions. In MS 514, however, he presented his simplest introduction to the EG syntax, semantics, and rules of inference. This article reproduces Peirce’s original words and diagrams with further commentary, explanations, and examples. Unlike the syntax-based approach of most current textbooks, Peirce’s method addresses the semantic issues of logic in a way that can be transferred to any notation. The concluding section shows that his rules of inference can clarify the foundations of proof theory and relate diverse methods, such as resolution and natural deduction. To relate EGs to other notations for logic, this article uses the Existential Graph Interchange Format (EGIF), which is a subset of the CGIF dialect of Common Logic. EGIF is a linear notation that can be mapped to and from the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants of EGs. It can also be translated to or from other formalisms, algebraic or geometrical.},

 abstractNote={An ontology, in the Knowledge Engineering and Artificial Intelligence sense, is a framework for the domain knowledge of an intelligent system. An ontology structures the knowledge, and acts as a container for the knowledge. We define knowledge conjunction as one or more agents using multiple ontologies to perform tasks and understand the domain. Once a common ontology is agreed upon, the agents then have a common background in which to share knowledge. No current method exists that allows intelligent agents to agree on a common framework for sharing knowledge, although there has been some work in comparing semantic meanings within an ontology [44]. This means that agents are unable to use the knowledge of another agent, as the knowledge is meaningless if it isn’t presented in a proper context or a common `language’.},

Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research.}, note={arXiv:1102.1889 [cs, math]}, number={1}, journal={PLoS ONE}, author={Spivak, David I. and Kent, Robert E.}, year={2012}, month={Jan}, pages={e24274} }

This research area is constituted from multiple disciplines, including cognitive science and psychology as well as computer science, artificial intelligence, logic and mathematics. But it should not be overlooked that there has been until today a long-standing prejudice against non-symbolic representation in mathematics and logic. Without doubt diagrams are often used in mathematical reasoning, but usually only as illustrations or thought aids. Diagrams, many mathematicians say, are not rigorous enough to be used in a proof, or may even mislead us in a proof. This attitude is captured by the quotation below: [The diagram] is only a heuristic to prompt certain trains of inference; ... it is dispensable as a proof-theoretic device; indeed ... it has no proper place in a proof as such. For the proof is a syntactic object consisting only of sentences arranged in a finite and inspectable area. Neil Tennant 1991, quotation adopted from [?] Nonetheless, there exist some diagrammatic systems which were designed for mathematical reasoning. Well-known examples are Euler circles and Venn diagrams. More important to us, at the dawn of modern logic, two diagrammatic systems had been invented in order to formalize logic. The first system is Frege’s Begriffsschrift, where Frege attempted to provide a formal universal language. The other one is the systems of existential graphs (EGs) by Charles Sanders Peirce, which he used to study and describe logical argumentation. But none of these systems is used in contemporary mathematical logic. In contrast: For more than a century, linear symbolic representation systems (i.e., formal languages which are composed of signs which are a priori meaningless, and which are therefore manipulated by means of purely formal rules) have been the exclusive subject for formal logic. There are only a few logicians who 2 1 Introduction}, author={Dau, F.}, year={2005} }

We argue in this paper that so-called ontologies present their own methodological and architectural peculiarities: on the methodological side, their main peculiarity is the adoption of a highly interdisciplinary approach, while on the architectural side the most interesting aspect is the centrality of the role they can play in an information system, leading to the perspective of ontology-driven information systems.},

    abstract = {We present the OWL API, a high level Application Programming Interface (API) for working with OWL ontologies. The OWL API is closely aligned with the OWL 2 structural specification. It supports parsing and rendering in the syntaxes defined in the W3C specification (Functional Syntax, RDF/XML, OWL/XML and the Manchester OWL Syntax); manipulation of ontological structures; and the use of reasoning engines. The reference implementation of the OWL API, written in Java, includes validators for the various OWL 2 profiles - OWL 2 QL, OWL 2 EL and OWL 2 RL. The OWL API has widespread usage in a variety of tools and applications.},

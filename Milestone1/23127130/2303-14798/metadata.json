    "abstract": "We report on the optical control of the recently observed electromechanical instability of ferroelectric liquid droplets exposed to the photovoltaic field of a lithium niobate ferroelectric crystal substrate. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets irradiated by unfocused beam undergo an electromechanical instability and disintegrate by the explosive emission of fluid jets. We show here that the regions of jets emission can be controlled by focusing the light beam in areas close to the droplet's edge. Once emitted, the fluid jets can be walked by moving the beam up to millimeter distance from the mother droplet. Reverting the lithium niobate substrate, jets become thinner and show the tendency of being repelled by the beam instead of being attracted, thus offering an additional tool for their optical manipulation. These observations may pave the way to intriguing applications of ferroelectric nematic fluids related to manipulation, actuation, and control of soft, flexible materials.",

\begin{abstract}
The determinant lower bound of Lov\'{a}sz, Spencer, and Vesztergombi
[European Journal of Combinatorics, 1986] is a general way to
prove lower bounds on the hereditary discrepancy of a set system. In
their paper, Lov\'{a}sz, Spencer, and Vesztergombi asked if hereditary
discrepancy can also be bounded from above by a function of the determinant lower bound. This was answered in the negative by Hoffman,
and the largest known multiplicative gap between the two quantities
for a set system of $m$ subsets of a universe of size $n$ is on the order
of $\max\{\log n,\sqrt{\log m}\}$. On the other hand, building upon work of Matou\v{s}ek [Proceedings of the AMS, 2013], Jiang and Reis [SOSA, 2022] showed that this gap is always bounded up to constants by $\sqrt{\log(m)\log(n)}$. This is tight when $m$ is polynomial in $n$, but leaves open the case of large $m$. We show that the bound of Jiang and Reis is tight for nearly the entire range of $m$. Our proof amplifies the discrepancy lower bounds of a set system derived from the discrete Haar basis via Kronecker products.

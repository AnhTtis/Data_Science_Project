\section{VLU Tasks}
\label{sec:vlu}

We present three VLU tasks to probe the ability of our models to understand language with implied visual context: concreteness prediction (Section \ref{sec:concreteness}), color association prediction (Section \ref{sec:color}) and shape association prediction (Section \ref{sec:shape}). Note that each of these tasks is performed on text alone, but requires visual reasoning to complete.

\subsection{Prompts used per task}

We present further implementation details elaborating the list of prompts used per task.

\medskip \noindent \textbf{Concreteness Prediction}
As explained in the main paper, we use the following prompts to probe our models for the concreteness of words in context by using a cloze task paradigm with Stroop probing. For each word tested, we insert the masked prompt and the prompt with the tested word and calculate the cosine similarity between them.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Alice giving the $\SMASK$ to Bob}
  \item \emph{Bob giving the $\SMASK$  to Alice}
  \item \emph{I see the $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{A photo of my $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{A close-up photo of a $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{A painting of the $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{A photo of the $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{A photo of a nice $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{A drawing of the $\SMASK$}
\end{itemize}

\medskip \noindent \textbf{Color Association Prediction}
For the color association prediction, we use the following prompts. For each given object denoted as \W, we use all color options to probe for the correct color.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{A picture of a $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{A photo of a $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{A photo of the $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{A $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{$\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{The normal color of a \W is $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{\W usually has a $\SMASK$ color}
  \item \emph{\W s have a $\SMASK$ color}
  \item \emph{What is the color of a \W? $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{The natural color of a \W is $\SMASK$}
\end{itemize}

\medskip \noindent \textbf{Shape Association Prediction}
For the shape association prediction, we use the following prompts. For each given object denoted as \W, we use the given shape o to probe for the correct object shape.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{A photo of a $\SMASK$ shaped \W}
  \item \emph{A photo of a $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{A photo of the $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{A $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{$\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{An image of a $\SMASK$ \W}
  \item \emph{A \W usually has a $\SMASK$ shape}
  \item \emph{\W s commonly have a $\SMASK$ shape}
  \item \emph{The basic shape of a \W is $\SMASK$}
  \item \emph{What is the shape of a \W? $\SMASK$}
\end{itemize}

\medskip \noindent \textbf{Sentiment Analysis}
For sentiment analysis, we concatenate the following prompts to the given reviews and use the different options for sentiment prediction.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Is this review positive? $\SMASK$; Yes, No}
  \item \emph{Is this a good movie? $\SMASK$; Yes, No}
  \item \emph{I conclude the movie was $\SMASK$; good, bad}
  \item \emph{The film was $\SMASK$; good, bad}
  \item \emph{I had a $\SMASK$ time; good, bad}
  \item \emph{The following movie review expresses what sentiment? $\SMASK$; Positive, Negative}
  \item \emph{Sentiment expressed for the movie is $\SMASK$; Positive, Negative}
  \item \emph{The overall review of the film is $\SMASK$; good, bad}
  \item \emph{The movie was $\SMASK$; good, bad}
  \item \emph{This movie is $\SMASK$; good, bad}
\end{itemize}

    "abstract": "Here we report the anisotropic magnetotransport properties in the superconducting state of Sn$_4$Au single crystal. Sn$_4$Au single crystal is synthesized through an easy melt growth method. Superconducting properties are evidenced by resistivity vs. temperature and DC magnetization measurements. Isothermal magnetization measurements hint toward type-II superconductivity in Sn$_4$Au. In-plane and out-of-plane resistivity measurements show anisotropic behavior of the upper critical field at temperatures below superconducting transition (T$_c$ = 2.3 K). The observed anisotropy is more elucidated in resistivity measurements performed below Tc at different tilt angles. The anisotropy parameter is found to be 1.26. The observed results show the presence two-fold anisotropic superconducting state in Sn$_4$Au single crystal, which may be induced due to the layered structure of synthesized Sn$_4$Au single crystal.",

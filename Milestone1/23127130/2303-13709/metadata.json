    "abstract": "Given a set $\\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\\mathcal{F}$ an $\\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $ι(G,\\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $ι(G,\\{K_1\\})$ is the domination number of $G$. For any integer $k \\geq 1$, let $\\mathcal{F}_{0,k} = \\{K_{1,k}\\}$, let $\\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ be the set of regular graphs of degree at least $k-1$, let $\\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$ be the set of graphs whose chromatic number is at least $k$, and let $\\mathcal{F}_{3,k}$ be the union $\\mathcal{F}_{0,k} \\cup \\mathcal{F}_{1,k} \\cup \\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. We prove that if $G$ is a connected $n$-vertex graph and $\\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{F}_{0,k} \\cup \\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$, then $ι(G, \\mathcal{F}) \\leq \\frac{n}{k+1}$ unless $G$ is a $k$-clique or $k = 2$ and $G$ is a $5$-cycle. This generalizes a classical bound of Ore on the domination number, a bound of Caro and Hansberg on the $\\{K_{1,k}\\}$-isolation number, a bound of the author on the cycle isolation number, and a bound of Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the author on the $k$-clique isolation number. By Brooks' Theorem, the same inequality holds if $\\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{F}_{3,k}$. The bounds are sharp.",

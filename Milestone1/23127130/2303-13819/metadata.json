    "abstract": "$L_1$ adaptive control ($L_1$AC) is a control design technique that can handle a broad class of system uncertainties and provide transient performance guarantees. In this work-in-progress abstract, we discuss how existing formal verification tools can be applied to check the performance of $L_1$AC systems. We show that the theoretical transient performance and robustness guarantees of an $L_1$ adaptive controller for an 18-dimensional quadrotor system can be verified using the recently developed Verse reachability analysis tool. We will further consider the performance verification of $L_1$AC on systems with learning-enabled components.",

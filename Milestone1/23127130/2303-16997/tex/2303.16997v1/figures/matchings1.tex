\caption{The matchings between $S(x_1)$, $S(x_2)$, $S(z_1)$, and $S(z_2)$, as described in Claim \ref{keyclaim}. The matching $M_{x_2x_1}$ is omitted for clarity. We assume there exists a colour $d_1 \in S(x_1)$ and $d_2 \in S(x_2)$ such that $z_2[x_1,d_1] = z_2[x_2,d_2]$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the solid edges in the matchings are as shown. No matter the remainder of the edges in $M_{z_1z_2}$ and $M_{x_1z_2}$, there exist colours $c_i \in S(z_1)$ and $c_3 \in S(z_2)$ such that $c_i$ is unmatched in $M_{x_1z_1}$, such that $c_3$ is unmatched in $M_{x_1z_2}$ and $M_{x_2z_2}$, and such that $c_3 \neq z_2[z_1, c_i]$.}

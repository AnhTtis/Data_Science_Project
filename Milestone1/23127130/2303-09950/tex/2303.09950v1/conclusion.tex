\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed \ours{} to effectively prune outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. 
Based on the local rigidity of deformations, we introduce a graph-based local spatial consistency criterion to measure the compatibility of two correspondences.
Next, we further design a non-rigid correspondence embedding module which leverages the local spatial consistency to extract correspondence features.
The spatial-consistency-aware correspondence features are further used to filter outliers.
To our knowledge, this is the first learning-based outlier rejection method for non-rigid registration.
Extensive experiments on three benchmarks have demonstrated the efficacy of our method.
However, as our method is based on deformation graphs and local rigidity, it could have difficulty in modeling sudden geometric changes.
In the future, we would like to extend our method for end-to-end non-rigid registration.

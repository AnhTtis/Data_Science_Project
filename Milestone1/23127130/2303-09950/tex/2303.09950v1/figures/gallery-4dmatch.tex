  Comparison of different methods on 4DMatch and 4DLoMatch.
  Our method provides much better outlier rejection results in low-overlap and large-deformation scenes and achives better registration results.
  Benefiting from the more accurate correspondences, our method successfully recover the geometry in non-overlap regions (see the registration results enclosed by the red boxes).}

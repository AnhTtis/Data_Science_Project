  \caption{Graph-based local spatial consistency for non-rigid registration. The {\color{green}green} lines represent the inliers while the outliers are in {\color{red}red}. And the inconsistent distances between two correspondences are also highlighted in {\color{red}red} dotted lines. (a) In rigid scenarios, the distances are identical between any two inliers, while being inconsistent if outliers exist. (b) In non-rigid scenarios, global spatial consistency does not hold as the distances between inliers could be different due to irregular movements. (c-d) Our graph-based local spatial consistency measures the distances between two correspondences within a local region based on local rigidity of deformations. }

  \caption{Pipeline of \ours{}. Given a set of putative correspondences $\mathcal{C}$, our method first extracts initial features $\mathbf{F}_{\text{init}}$ from the point coordinates. The features are enhanced by a stack of graph-based non-rigid correspondence embedding module which encodes the local spatial consistency. The spatial-consistency-aware features $\mathbf{F}_{\text{sc}}$ are then used to predict the confidence scores $\mathbf{S}$. At last, N-ICP is used to estimate the warping function.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for guiding a robot manipulator to capture and bring a tumbling satellite to a state of rest. The proposed approach includes developing a coordination control for the combined system of the space robot and the target satellite, where the satellite acts as the manipulator payload. This control ensures that the robot tracks the optimal path while regulating the attitude of the chase vehicle to a desired value. Two optimal trajectories are then designed for the pre- and post-capture phases. In the pre-capturing phase, the manipulator manoeuvres are optimized by minimizing a cost function that includes the time of travel and the weighted norms of the end-effector velocity and acceleration, subject to the constraint that the robot end-effector and a grapple fixture on the satellite arrive at the rendezvous point with the same velocity. In the post-grasping phase, the manipulator dumps the initial velocity of the tumbling satellite in minimum time while ensuring that the magnitude of the torque applied to the satellite remains below a safe value. Overall, this method offers a promising solution for effectively capturing and bringing tumbling satellites to a state of rest.",

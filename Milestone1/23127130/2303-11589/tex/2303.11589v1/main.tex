%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    Creating graphic layouts is a fundamental step in graphic designs.
    In this work, we present a novel generative model named LayoutDiffusion for automatic layout generation.
    As layout is typically represented as a sequence of discrete tokens, LayoutDiffusion models layout generation as a discrete denoising diffusion process.
    It learns to reverse a mild forward process, in which layouts become increasingly chaotic with the growth of forward steps and layouts in the neighboring steps do not differ too much.
    Designing such a mild forward process is however very challenging as layout has both categorical attributes and ordinal attributes.
    To tackle the challenge, we summarize three critical factors for achieving a mild forward process for the layout, i.e., legality, coordinate proximity and type disruption.
    Based on the factors, we propose a block-wise transition matrix coupled with a piece-wise linear noise schedule.
    Experiments on RICO and PubLayNet datasets show that LayoutDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. 
    Moreover, it enables two conditional layout generation tasks in a plug-and-play manner without re-training and achieves better performance than existing methods.

\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-2.5px}
In this work, we propose \textit{LayoutDiffusion} to improve graphic layout generation by discrete diffusion models. 
The core of our method lies in realizing a mild forward process by considering the heterogeneous characteristics of the layout. 
Our method also enables two conditional generation tasks without re-training. 
Experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayoutDiffusion over leading approaches for layout generation and existing diffusion models.
In the future, we plan to incorporate diverse conditions~\cite{nichol2021glide,ho2022classifier} in LayoutDiffusion.
Besides, we will also explore how to extend LayoutDiffusion to handle other heterogeneous data.

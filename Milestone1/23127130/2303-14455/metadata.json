    "abstract": "In this article we apply reduced order techniques for the approximation of parametric eigenvalue problems. The effect of the choice of sampling points is investigated. Here we use the standard proper orthogonal decomposition technique to obtain the basis of the reduced space and Galerking orthogonal technique is used to get the reduced problem. We present some numerical results and observe that the use of sparse sampling is a good idea for sampling if the dimension of parameter space is high.",

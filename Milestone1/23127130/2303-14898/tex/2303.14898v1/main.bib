abstract = {Representation learning for temporal knowledge graphs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we study the problem of learning dynamic embeddings for temporal knowledge graphs. We address this problem by proposing a Dynamic Bayesian Knowledge Graphs Embedding model (DBKGE), which is able to dynamically track the semantic representations of entities over time in a joint metric space and make predictions for the future. Unlike other temporal knowledge graph embedding methods, DBKGE is a novel probabilistic representation learning method that aims at inferring dynamic embeddings of entities in a streaming scenario. To obtain high-quality embeddings and model their uncertainty, our DBKGE embeds entities with means and variances of Gaussian distributions. Based on amortized inference, an online inference algorithm is proposed to jointly learn the latent representations of entities and smooth their changes across time. Experiments on Yago and Wiki datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art static and temporal knowledge graph embedding models.},

abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been established as a fundamental approach for representation learning on graphs, based on convolution operations on non-Euclidean domain, defined by graph-structured data. GCNs and variants have achieved state-of-the-art results on classification tasks, especially in semi-supervised learning scenarios. A central challenge in semi-supervised classification consists in how to exploit the maximum of useful information encoded in the unlabeled data. In this paper, we address this issue through a novel self-training approach for improving the accuracy of GCNs on semi-supervised classification tasks. A margin score is used through a rank-based model to identify the most confident sample predictions. Such predictions are exploited as an expanded labeled set in a second-stage training step. Our model is suitable for different GCN models. Moreover, we also propose a rank aggregation of labeled sets obtained by different GCN models. The experimental evaluation considers four GCN variations and traditional benchmarks extensively used in the literature. Significant accuracy gains were achieved for all evaluated models, reaching results comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art. The best results were achieved for rank aggregation self-training on combinations of the four GCN models.}

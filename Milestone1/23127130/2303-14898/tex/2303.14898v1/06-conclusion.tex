\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we studied a realistic but underexplored cross-lingual temporal knowledge graph reasoning problem, which aims at facilitating TKG reasoning in low-resource languages by distilling knowledge from a corresponding TKG in high-resource language through a small set of entity alignments as bridges. To this end, we proposed a novel mutually-paced teacher student framework, namely \model. During training, \model iteratively generates pseudo alignments to expand the cross-lingual connection, as well as transfers temporal facts to facilitate student model training in low-resource languages.  Our alignment module is learned to adjust the alignment strength for different entities at different time, thereby maximizing the benefits of knowledge transferring. We empirically validated the effectiveness of \model on 12 language pairs of EventKG data, on which the proposed framework significantly outperforms an extensive set of state-of-the-art baselines.

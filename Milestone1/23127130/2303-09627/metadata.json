    "abstract": "Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) techniques attempt to increase the visibility of images captured in low-light scenarios. However, as a result of enhancement, a variety of image degradations such as noise and color bias are revealed. Furthermore, each particular LLIE approach may introduce a different form of flaw within its enhanced results. To combat these image degradations, post-processing denoisers have widely been used, which often yield oversmoothed results lacking detail. We propose using a diffusion model as a post-processing approach, and we introduce Low-light Post-processing Diffusion Model (LPDM) in order to model the conditional distribution between under-exposed and normally-exposed images. We apply LPDM in a manner which avoids the computationally expensive generative reverse process of typical diffusion models, and post-process images in one pass through LPDM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing post-processing denoisers by increasing the perceptual quality of enhanced low-light images on a variety of challenging low-light datasets.

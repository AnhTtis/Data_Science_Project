\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:8}

This survey focuses on data-centric AI, an emerging and important research field in AI. We motivated the need for data-centric AI by showing how carefully designing and maintaining data can make AI solutions more desirable across academia and industry. Next, we provided a background of data-centric AI, which includes its definition and a goal-driven taxonomy. Then, guided by the research questions posed, we reviewed various data-centric AI techniques for different purposes from the perspectives of automation and collaboration. Furthermore, we collected data benchmarks from different domains and analyzed them at a meta-level. Lastly, we discussed data-centric AI from a global view and shared our perspectives on the blurred boundaries between data and model. We also presented potential future directions for this field. To conclude in one line, we believe that data will play an increasingly important role in building AI systems. At the same time, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed.  We hope our survey could inspire collaborative initiatives in our community to push forward this field.

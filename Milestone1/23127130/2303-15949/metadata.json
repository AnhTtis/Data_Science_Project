    "abstract": "We prove that the generator of the $L^2$ implementation of a KMS-symmetric quantum Markov semigroup can be expressed as the square of a derivation with values in a Hilbert bimodule, extending earlier results by Cipriani and Sauvageot for tracially symmetric semigroups and the second-named author for GNS-symmetric semigroups. This result hinges on the introduction of a new completely positive map on the algebra of bounded operators on the GNS Hilbert space. This transformation maps symmetric Markov operators to symmetric Markov operators and is essential to obtain the required inner product on the Hilbert bimodule.",

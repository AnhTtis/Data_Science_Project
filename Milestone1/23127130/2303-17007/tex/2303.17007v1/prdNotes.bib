@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="If solar-neutrino flux is assumed known, one can in principle use it to measure the cross section below 14 MeV and bound it from below for energies above 14 MeV."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="See Ref.~\cite {Capozzi2018} for discussion of energies below 15~MeV."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Knowledge of energy resolution is more important for bias in extracted parameters than specific value of energy resolution. For the purpose of this study, which is focused on the effect of cross-section uncertainty, we assume that the detector response is perfectly known."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="This criterion is satisfactory given that the statistical regime is such that a Poisson distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian."}

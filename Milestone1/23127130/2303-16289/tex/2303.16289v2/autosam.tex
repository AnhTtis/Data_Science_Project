% The accelerating introduction of renewable electricity and increased consumption through electrification of the transport and heating sector challenges grid stability. The development requires new solutions, where one is \loadshifting\ through \dsm. This work presents a four month experimental study of a low complexity, hierarchical \mpc\ (\MPC) implemented on a real \singleFam\ house occupied by its residents. The house---located in Denmark---is a \nzeb\ heated by a commercial, weather compensated \atow\ heat pump in combination with floor heating. % and equipped with photovoltaic panels on the roof.
%  The upper-layer \MPC\ uses the price signal, weather forecast, a single-zone building model and a non-linear heat pump efficiency model to generate a \spaceHeating\ schedule. The commercial heat pump is made to act \smartGrid-ready through input-manipulation to enable heat boosting. 
% %The pre-installed heat pump is then input-manipulated, using a fake ambient temperature signal, in order to ramp production up and down according to a provided heating schedule, which, in effect, makes the \hp\ act \smartGrid\ ready.
% %The price signal is modelled based on the actual market spot-price, for the price area DK2, and the, so called, \textit{Tariff model 3.0} providing a realistic foundation for the experiment.

% The question, today, is not whether a complex \MPC\ algorithm is superior to rule-based controllers---this is known---but whether the benefits outweigh the costs and whether the method will ever be broadly accepted and implemented. To answer this, we need to carry out realistic, long running studies to prove the benefits, discuss the costs and uncover the performance loses going from simulation to reality, to finally determine whether this is a viable path forward.

% The cost reduction, gained from the controller, ranged from \comfThreeCostPercNoDec-\comfOneCostPercNoDec\% depending on the comfort level, we share empirical evidence of the following: (1) The test house have a large time-of-heating flexibility without having an energy storage. (2) It is still possible to save a reasonable amount of money, in a low energy house, just by lowering the temperature reference half a degree; (3) The current price scheme provides incentive for Danish end-consumers to shift heating loads. (4) Concrete floors can be boosted with heat without degrading indoor comfort.
% %The study contains the following: (1) Proof of concept that existing commercial \hp\ with \fh\ can be retrofitted for coordinated control instead of the individual control widely implemented today; (2) Design  (2) Investigation of energy flexibility of a \NZEB\ house; (3) Experimental evaluation of the chosen control algorithm.
% Although, the experiment itself is a success, the authors have identified several issues related to controlling the heat pump through input-manipulation and proposes a more prosperous path forward, which entails coordination with the manufactures, in order to make commercial heat pumps more \smartGrid\ ready.% Despite the solution presented here concerns future perspectives for \DSM\ two immediately implementable rules, for the Danish end-consumers, have been derived from the data: The rules are: \textit{If comfort allows it, block the heat pump in the four hour cooking-peak period} and \textit{All thermostats in a low energy house should be lowered with half a degree to see if comfort is reduced}.
% %Although, the experiment itself is a success, the authors have identified a gab between general expectations from the academic community with respect to \smartGrid readiness of fielded heat pumps and their actual control capabilities. 
% %This gab can partly be closed with the method presented here, but the view of the authors is that a more prosperous path forward is to include the manufactures in the process and develop a heat pump which can mitigate future stability challenges for the electric grid.

% %Having shown that a \NZEB\ house can \loadShift\ \spaceHeating and thereby support the electricity grid.

% The continuous introduction of renewable electricity and increased consumption through electrification of the transport and heating sector pose stability challenges to the grid.
% This study investigates load shifting through demand side management as a solution. We present a four-month experimental investigation of a low-complexity, hierarchical Model Predictive Control approach for demand side management in a near-zero emission single-family house in Denmark. The control algorithm uses a price signal, weather forecast, a building model, and a non-linear heat pump efficiency model to generate a space-heating schedule. The cost reduction from the controller ranged from 3-36\% depending on the comfort level. The experiment demonstrates that load shifting is feasible and cost-effective, even without energy storage, and that the current price scheme provides an incentive for Danish end-consumers to shift heating loads. However, issues related to controlling the heat pump through input-manipulation were identified, and the authors propose a more prosperous path forward involving coordination with manufacturers and regulators to make commercial heat pumps more smart grid-ready.

\begin{abstract}
The continuous introduction of renewable electricity and increased consumption through electrification of the transport and heating sector challenges grid stability. This study investigates \loadshifting\ through \dsm\ as a solution. We present a four-month experimental study of a low-complexity, hierarchical Model Predictive Control approach for \dsm\ in a near-zero emission occupied single-family house in Denmark. The control algorithm uses a price signal, weather forecast, a single-zone building model, and a non-linear heat pump efficiency model to generate a \spaceHeating\ schedule. The weather-compensated, commercial heat pump is made to act \smartGrid-ready through outdoor temperature input override to enable heat boosting and forced stops to accommodate the heating schedule. The cost reduction from the controller ranged from \comfThreePercSaveNoDec-\comfFourPercSaveNoDec\% depending on the chosen comfort level. The experiment demonstrates that \loadshifting\ is feasible and cost-effective, even without energy storage, and that the current price scheme provides an incentive for Danish end-consumers to shift heating loads. However, issues related to controlling the heat pump through input-manipulation were identified, and the authors propose a more promising path forward involving coordination with manufacturers and regulators to make commercial heat pumps truly smart grid-ready.% Besides being expensive and time consuming, long-term experiments are difficult to evaluate because of the many uncontrollable externalities, but due to the fundamental importance of field experiments extra emphasis is put on the evaluation procedure and subsequent discussion.% This is done to invite scrutiny of method and provide direction for future experiments of such kind.
%Long-term experiments are rare because they are expensive and time consuming, Further, the many uncontrollable externalities make them difficult to evaluate, but due to their fundamental importance extra emphasis is put on the evaluation procedure and subsequent discussion.

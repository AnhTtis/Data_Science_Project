\section{Resident statements}
\label{app_resident_statement}
The $11^\text{th}$ Jan. 2023, the residents were sent a questionnaire about the experienced indoor climate comfort. Before reading the questionnaire, note that it was not conducted anonymously and the text is translated from Danish. The questions and answers are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Have you experienced an increase in discomfort with respect to indoor climate when you compare with last heating season?}
    \begin{description}
    \item [Answer:] I actually think that we have felt a better comfort than I remember from last year. There was an experience of discomfort in the beginning of the experiment, which we talked about, thereafter it has been quite comfortable.
    \end{description}
    \item \textit{When you have experienced discomfort, has it been too warm, too cold or do you experience both too warm and too cold periods?}
    \begin{description}
    \item [Answer:] No, we don't have any periods with unpleasantly low temperatures. We have as always lower temperatures in the cinema/hobby-room, but that has been fine.
    \end{description}
    \item \textit{Is there any time of day where the discomfort most often occurs?}
    \begin{description}
    \item [Answer:] No comment
    \end{description}
    \item What have you noticed with respect to floor temperatures?
    \begin{description}
    \item [Answer:] It has actually been pleasantly warm, and I don't think that we have experienced cold floors, which we typically experience at middle-high outdoor temperatures.
    \end{description}
    \item Have you experienced that the radiation from the floors has been too high?
    \begin{description}
    \item [Answer:] No
    \end{description}
    \item Have you experienced that the radiation was too low? A feeling of being cold even though the room temperature was high.
    \begin{description}
    \item [Answer:] No, as said, we have not experienced that for long.
    \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

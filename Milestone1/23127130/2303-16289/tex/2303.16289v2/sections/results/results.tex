\section{Results}
This section presents the results gained from the experiment period. Note that with respect to the cost analysis comfort level 3 ({\color{ref3}\FilledBigTriangleUp}) and 4 ({\color{ref4}\FilledBigTriangleUp}) should be given the highest attention since they both, on average, feature higher indoor temperatures than the benchmark period and therefor provides the best foundation for investigating the savings potential. Comfort level 1 ({\color{ref1}\FilledBigTriangleUp}) and 2 ({\color{ref2}\FilledBigTriangleUp}) are included to provide a broader overview of the challenges related to carrying out the experiment.

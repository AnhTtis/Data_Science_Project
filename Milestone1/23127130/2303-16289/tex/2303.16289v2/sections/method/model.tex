\section{Models and parameter identification}
\label{sec_model}
This section presents the model and the subsequent parameter identification for each module that is included in the \MIOCP.
 Subsections \ref{sec_house_model}-\ref{sec_pv_model} presents models used directly for control while subsection \ref{sec_price_model} contains the price model which is used both for guiding the price-aware controller and evaluation. Finally, subsection \ref{sec_validation} describes how benchmark data from previous heating season, where the baseline controller was running, is used to evaluate the proposed controller.

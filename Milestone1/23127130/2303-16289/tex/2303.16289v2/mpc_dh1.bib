In this work, a control-oriented first order model was identified in a dedicated experiment on a super-insulated single-family house. First, parameters resulting from CTSM and the MATLAB System Identification toolbox were compared. Then, a comparison of model predictions and measurements showed that this simple model captures well the main dynamics of the building-averaged indoor temperature, after one week of training on rich data with sample time below 15 min. It was also observed that this prediction performance was not affected by the configuration of internal doors.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the potential of economic model predictive control of complex residential energy systems with electric coupling to the public grid. The examined system includes a battery energy storage system, photovoltaic power generation, an air-to-water heat pump, thermal energy storage and a building model. The said power generation provides energy for electric loads as well as domestic hot water and space heating. Model predictive control algorithms manage the energy system by nonlinear global optimization. Within this optimization, a time-varying state space model, which is derived from the energy system simulation model, reflects the system dynamics. Owing to the resulting high complexity, two algorithms for distributed model predictive control are developed. In addition, the developed approaches are compared to a common reference control concept as well as centralized model predictive control. For the comparison of annual operational costs, current German energy prices and subsidies are implemented into the economic calculation. Results show an improved performance of the developed approaches with 11.6\% cost reduction in comparison to the reference. This is achieved through an increase of the heat pump seasonal performance factor by 3.4\%, reduced curtailment of electrical photovoltaic energy to 21.5\% of the reference value and prevention of auxiliary heater operation. Furthermore, increased photovoltaic self-consumption by the heat pump results in a slight reduction of battery storage operation. In conjunction with monetary and energetic advantages, model predictive control increases the comfort in regards to the violation of minimum limits for the comfort criteria.},

	abstract = {Floor heating (FH) system is a widely-used thermally active building system, which can take advantage of building thermal mass to shift energy demands to off-peak hours. Its ability of effective utilization of low-temperature energy resources also helps to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, control of FH systems remains a challenge due to the large thermal inertia of the pipe-embedded concrete floor. In the context of smart grids, the control issue becomes more complicated because the dynamic electricity prices need to be taken into consideration to achieve economic benefits and encourage demand response participation. In this study, an advanced optimal control method, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is developed for FH systems, which can simultaneously consider all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy and dynamic electricity prices. Considering the on-line computational efficiency, a control-oriented dynamic thermal model for a room integrated with FH system is developed and represented in a stochastic state-space form. An economic MPC controller, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, is designed for FH systems. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test and compare different control methods under various operating conditions in terms of energy consumption, thermal comfort and operating costs. Test results show that, compared to the conventional on-off controller, the MPC controller is able to use building thermal mass to optimally shift energy consumption to low-price periods, improve thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy, reduce energy demand during peak periods, and save electricity costs for residential end-users. The weather conditions and electricity prices have influences on the start-up time and duration of preheating, energy flexibility potential and electricity cost savings of FH systems.},

	abstract = {This paper aims at modeling and controlling an air-to-water heat pump for building energy efficiency applications. First, a detailed model of a generic heat pump, here called reference model, is developed and experimentally validated. Then, the reference model is used to formulate several control-oriented models of the heat pump, namely the ones defining the Coefficient of Performance (COP) based on increasing level of complexity. Finally, the paper explores the impact of the simplification level of the heat pump model on the overall quality of temperature control in a building, and on the electrical energy consumption. In particular, the pilot case here considered consists of a heat pump supplying water to a load through a hot water tank, and for control structure a linear time varying Model Predictive Control is designed. The impact of the power peaks is also investigated, which shows a significant improvement in the COP prediction based on the level of approximation. This study presents also how the load flexibility can take advantage from a correct COP prediction. The results can be seamlessly extended to the application of the real-time pricing, where the prediction of the COP trajectory can be used for the economic load shifting, thanks to the inertia of the hot water tank and the load.},

	abstract = {Heating and cooling buildings cause a large and growing portion of the world’s carbon emissions. These emissions could be reduced by replacing inefficient or fossil-fueled equipment with efficient electric heat pumps. Recent research has shown that variable-speed heat pumps (VSHPs) could also provide a variety of power system services, such as price- or carbon-based load shifting, peak demand reduction, emergency demand response, and frequency regulation. By providing some or all of these services, VSHPs could facilitate the integration of wind and solar power into the grid, accelerating decarbonization of other economic sectors. However, the provision of power system services poses new and challenging VSHP control problems. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising approach to these problems. MPC combines weather and load predictions, online optimization, and a mathematical model of a VSHP’s performance under varying ambient conditions. With few exceptions, existing VSHP models neglect two important features that arise in practice: (1) dependence of efficiency and capacity on compressor speed and indoor and outdoor temperatures, and (2) inability of VSHPs to operate at low compressor speeds. In this paper, we develop a new VSHP control model that considers both features. The model expresses the VSHP’s power consumption and heat production as affine functions of the driving temperatures and compressor speed. The model also includes a binary variable that constrains the VSHP to be either turned off, or operating within a range of acceptable compressor speeds using mixed-integer programming (MIP). This VSHP model and optimization strategy is combined with neural network based heat load prediction in MPC simulations. These simulations suggest that this approach could reduce energy costs by 9–22\% and carbon emissions by up to 22\%, relative to MPC with existing VSHP models.},

These are described by linear dynamic equations subject to linear inequalities involving real and integer variables. MLD systems include linear hybrid systems, finite state machines, some classes of discrete event systems, constrained linear systems, and nonlinear systems which can be approximated by piecewise linear functions. A predictive control scheme is proposed which is able to stabilize MLD systems on desired reference trajectories while fulfilling operating constraints, and possibly take into account previous qualitative knowledge in the form of heuristic rules. Due to the presence of integer variables, the resulting on-line optimization procedures are solved through mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), for which efficient solvers have been recently developed. Some examples and a simulation case study on a complex gas supply system are reported.},

Instead, a multi-step MPC scheme may be needed in order to establish near optimal performance of the closed-loop system. This behavior is analyzed in detail, and we show that under suitable dissipativity and controllability conditions, desired closed-loop performance guarantees as well as convergence to the optimal periodic orbit can be established.},

Instead, we consider a simple, intuitive implementation and derive theoretical guarantees under a stabilizability condition on the system and suitable conditions on the reference trajectory. We provide sufficient conditions for exponential reference tracking for reachable reference trajectories. In addition, we study unreachable reference trajectories and derive sufficient conditions to ensure practical stability of the unknown optimal reachable reference trajectory. For both cases, we characterize the region of attraction.

	abstract = {Control performance and cost optimization can be conflicting goals in the management of industrial processes. Even when optimal or optimization-based control synthesis tools are applied, the economic cost associated with plant operation is often only optimized according to static criteria that pick, among all feasible steady states, those with minimal cost. In mathematical terms, an economic cost functional differs from stage costs commonly adopted in model predictive control (MPC) as it need not be minimal at its best equilibrium. This note collects and illustrates some recent advances in receding horizon optimization of nonlinear systems that allow the control designer to simultaneously and dynamically optimize transient and steady-state economic performance. In particular, we show that average performance of economic MPC is never worse than the optimal steady-state operation. We introduce a dissipation inequality and supply function that extend previous sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of economic MPC. Dissipativity is also shown to be a sufficient condition for concluding that steady-state operation is optimal. We show how to modify an economic cost function so that steady-state operation is asymptotically stable when that feature is deemed desirable. Finally, for the case when steady-state operation is not optimal, we develop two modified MPC controllers that asymptotically guarantee 1) improved performance compared to optimal periodic control and 2) satisfaction of constraints on average values of states and inputs. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

	abstract = {In the standard model predictive control implementation, first a steady-state optimization yields the equilibrium point with minimal economic cost. Then, the deviation from the computed best steady state is chosen as the stage cost for the dynamic regulation problem. The computed best equilibrium point may not be the global minimum of the economic cost, and hence, choosing the economic cost as the stage cost for the dynamic regulation problem, rather than the deviation from the best steady state, offers potential for improving the economic performance of the system. It has been previously shown that the existing framework for MPC stability analysis, which addresses to the standard class of problems with a regulation objective, does not extend to economic MPC. Previous work on economic MPC developed new tools for stability analysis and identified sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. These tools were developed for the terminal constraint MPC formulation, in which the system is stabilized by forcing the state to the best equilibrium point at the end of the horizon. In this work, we relax this constraint by imposing a region constraint on the terminal state instead of a point constraint, and adding a penalty on the terminal state to the regulator cost. We extend the stability analysis tools, developed for terminal constraint economic MPC, to the proposed formulation and establish that strict dissipativity is sufficient for guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. We also show that the average closed-loop performance outperforms the best steady-state performance. For implementing the proposed formulation, a rigorous analysis for computing the appropriate terminal penalty and the terminal region is presented. A further extension, in which the terminal constraint is completely removed by modifying the regulator cost function, is also presented along with its stability analysis. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the differences between the terminal constraint and the proposed terminal penalty formulation.},

	abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics.},

	abstract = {For implementation in controllers with limited computational power, simplified optimal control formulations are desirable. For the case of a modulating heat pump system, the optimization problem is nonlinear due to the supply water temperature and load dependency of the heat pump coefficient of performance (COP). By neglecting these nonlinearities, e.g., by assuming a constant COP, the optimization problem becomes convex and fast convergence to the global minimum is ensured. This study quantifies the impact of these simplifications for the case of a modulating air-to-water heat pump connected to a residential floor heating system. A first comparison suggests a significant deterioration of the control performance. While the nonlinear formulations result in continuous operation at part load, the convex approximations give rise to large power fluctuations, increasing the energy cost with 7\% to 16\%. However, by penalizing power peaks in the cost function, the achieved control performances are almost identical. This reveals that the cost function is flat near the optimum. Compared to a conventional heating curve control strategy, the energy cost savings amount to 5\% for optimization-based control strategies (in the case of a day/night tariff structure). Although less than expected, this improvement is still significant given the wide spread presence of the application.},

These can handle multiple inputs and outputs, uncertainties in forecast data, and plant constraints, amongst other features. One of the main issues identified in the literature regarding deploying these controllers is the lack of experimental demonstrations using standard components and communication protocols. In this original work, the economic-MPC-based optimal scheduling of a real-world heat pump-based building energy plant is demonstrated, and its performance is evaluated against two conventional controllers. The demonstration includes the steps to integrate an optimization-based supervisory controller into a typical building automation and control system with off-the-shelf HVAC components and usage of state-of-art algorithms to solve a mixed integer quadratic problem. Technological benefits in terms of fewer constraint violations and a hardware-friendly operation with MPC were identified. Additionally, a strong dependency of the economic benefits on the type of load profile, system design and controller parameters was also identified. Future work for the quantification of these benefits, the application of machine learning algorithms, and the study of forecast deviations is also proposed.},

In this paper, we present a study on applying a model predictive control approach to the problem of efﬁciently optimizing microgrid operations while satisfying a time-varying request and operation constraints. The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which can be solved in an efﬁcient way by using commercial solvers without resorting to complex heuristics or decompositions techniques. Then, the MILP formulation leads to signiﬁcant improvements in solution quality and computational burden. A case study of a microgrid is employed to assess the performance of the online optimization-based control strategy and the simulation results are discussed. The method is applied to an experimental microgrid located in Athens, Greece. The experimental results show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Small heat pump heating systems are controlled almost exclusively by relaytype controllers whose setpoint is chosen as a function of the outdoor temperature. The main strategy of such controllers is to optimally control the heat delivery system. Special demands on the heat pump, such as extended running times, high portions of low-tariff heating, or low usage of auxiliary power, are given secondary attention only. A new controller for heat pumps has been developed at the Measurement and Control Laboratory using the model predictive control concept. Contrary to conventional heat pump controller strategies, which exclusively use the actual measurements, the model predictive controller calculates the required heat energy by means of the predicted course of the outdoor temperature, the efficiency of the heat pump, the power costs (high and low tariff), and the power cut-off times imposed by electric power providers. To transform the required heat energy into an on/off switch signal for the heat pump, the pulse-width modulation technique is used. To solve the model predictive control problem for the specific problem of house heating, a dynamic linear model of the house is required. The model for the controller is based on simple thermodynamic laws. The resulting equations contain a set of a priori unknown parameters; furthermore, since the parameters of the model differ from one house to another, an identification mechanism is indispensable. Within the scope of this doctoral thesis a selfadapting MPC controller has been developed. Its function is to automatically detect the thermal behavior of the house and its heating system by on-line parameter identification techniques in order to adjust the controller parameters according to preset demands. Different families of recursive parameter identification methods are compared. Furthermore, the robustness with respect to disturbances, the detection of solar radiation, and the consistency of the identified parameters are investigated. The identified model must be able to predict reliably the house dynamics for the next day. In order to compare different control concepts sequentially under identical conditions, a test bench for dynamic tests on a brine-to-water heat pump was},

	abstract = {This paper presents a hierachical model predictive control (MPC) structure with decoupled MPCs for building heating control using weather forcasts and occupancy information. The two level control structure embeds a fuzzy MPC (FMPC) for user comfort optimization and a mixed-integer MPC (MI-MPC) for energy optimization at minimal costs. As FMPC uses a set of local linear models classical linear MPC theory is applicable, though the underlying system dynamics is non-linear. The supply level in a large modern office building always features switching states of aggregates, hence an MI-MPC is used for energy supply optimization. Additionally, both FMPC and MI-MPC consider all relevant constraints. The innovation in this study, beside the usage of FMPC for building control, is the decoupling of the energy supply level and the user comfort with a single coupling node. Although a global optimum is not guaranteed, a decoupled control system often is more attractive for industrial applications and building operators. The perfomance of the proposed control structure is demonstrated in a simulation with a validated building model, and two different disturbance scenarios are presented.},

We present an approach to replacing the mixed-integer program by a simpler quadratic program by means of learning techniques. To be more specific, we design a neural network and a support vector machine to classify the optimal control policies for the binary inputs offline and evaluate this decision in the online step as the basis for the solution of the quadratic program. As a result, we achieve a controller suitable for implementation on embedded hardware. We demonstrate its applicability to a domestic heating system.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) based energy scheduling of a smart microgrid equipped with non-controllable (i.e., with fixed power profile) and controllable (i.e., with flexible and programmable operation) electrical appliances, as well as photovoltaic (PV) panels, and a battery energy storage system (BESS). The proposed control strategy aims at a simultaneous optimal planning of the controllable loads, the shared resources (i.e., the storage system charge/discharge and renewable energy usage), and the energy exchange with the grid. The control scheme relies on an iterative finite horizon on-line optimization, implementing a mixed integer linear programming energy scheduling algorithm to maximize the self-supply with solar energy and/or minimize the daily cost of energy bought from the grid under time-varying energy pricing. At each time step, the resulting optimization problem is solved providing the optimal operations of controllable loads, the optimal amount of energy to be bought/sold from/to the grid, and the optimal charging/discharging profile for the BESS. The proposed energy scheduling approach is applied to the demand side management control of the marina of Ballen, Samsø (Denmark), where a smart microgrid is currently being implemented as a demonstrator in the Horizon2020 European research project SMILE. Simulations considering the marina electric consumption (340 boat sockets, a service building equipped with a sauna and a wastewater pumping station, and the harbour master’s office equipped with a heat pump), PV production (60kWp), and the BESS (237 kWh capacity) based on a public real dataset are carried out on a one year time series with a 1 h resolution. Simulations indicate that the proposed approach allows 90\% exploitation of the production of the PV plant. Furthermore, results are compared to a naïve control approach. The MPC based energy scheduling improves the self-supply by 1.6\% compared to the naïve control. Optimization of the business economy using the MPC approach, instead, yields to 8.2\% savings in the yearly energy cost with respect to the naïve approach.},

	abstract = {The European Commission calls for more small-scale renewable energy producers to actively participate in the energy value chain. In this study, we model an illustrative peer-to-peer (P2P) market with tariffs based on the reservation prices of market participants under the German levy regime. The study is conducted by modeling representative residential buildings with home energy management systems, modulating heat pumps, and photovoltaics, in combination with electrical and thermal storage systems. The resulting mixed-integer linear program is solved over the course of a year, using a rolling horizon approach with a time resolution of one hour. By analyzing the cost- and discomfort-minimizing behavior of the market participants, we evaluate the current levy regime and propose two additional designs. We find that in the current case, a P2P market is not economically viable. Based on feed-in tariffs (FiT) and levies no agreeable market price can be found. With no FiT or reduced levies, all participants benefit from the P2P market. The market split—where each household sources their energy from—is altered only little by the specific details of the market design when staying in the agreeable price range. As prosumagers do not consume on the P2P market, they benefit only marginally from the reduced levies—consumers are most affected. Adjusting the regime could be a measure to rebalance the distribution of renewable energy benefits towards consumers in order to foster social cohesion. Our input data and the model written in the Julia JuMP programming language are available in an open-source format.},

	abstract = {Efficient residential sector coupling plays a key role in supporting the energy transition. In this study, we analyze the structural properties associated with the optimal control of a home energy management system and the effects of common technological configurations and objectives. We conduct this study by modeling a representative building with a modulating air-sourced heat pump, a photovoltaic(PV) system, a battery, and thermal storage systems for floor heating and hot-water supply. In addition, we allow grid feed-in by assuming fixed feed-in tariffs and consider user comfort. In our numerical analysis, we find that the battery, naturally, is the essential building block for improving self-sufficiency. However, in order to use the PV surplus efficiently grid feed-in is necessary. The commonly considered objective of maximizing self-consumption is not economically viable under the given tariff structure; however, close-to-optimal performance and significant reduction in solution times can be achieved by maximizing self-sufficiency. Based on optimal control and considering seasonal effects, the dominant order of PV distribution and the target states of charge of the storage systems can be derived. Using a rolling horizon approach, the solution time can be reduced to less than 1min (achieving a time resolution of 1h per year). By evaluating the value of information, we find that the common horizon of 24h for prediction and control results in unintended but avoidable end-of-horizon effects.

In particular, we review the algebraic and spectral properties of graph adjacency, Laplacian, incidence, and resistance matrices and how they relate to the analysis, networkreduction, and dynamics of certain classes of electrical networks. We study these relations for models of increasing complexity ranging from static resistive DC circuits, over dynamic RLC circuits, to nonlinear AC power ﬂow.

To aim at the balance between thermal comfortable and energy-saving of the heating system for high-rise residential buildings, this paper proposes a method for the central heating system of high-rise residential buildings based on distributed model predictive control. The method analyzes the coupling factors between adjacent rooms’ temperature. Based on the state space method, a multivariable indoor temperature model is established and verified. The distributed model predictive control method is used to control and optimize the indoor temperature, and the load distribution of the circulating water pump in the heat exchange station is optimized according to the predicted heat demand. The results demonstrate that the indoor temperature after distributed model predictive control can stable near the set value. Compared with the centralized control methods, the proposed methodology can reduce energy consumption by 14.28\%. Meanwhile, the efficiency of water pumps is increased by 16.74\% after using the distributed control strategy.},

	abstract = {Air-to-water heat pumps are one of the most common and energy efficient heating systems for buildings, particularly floor-heating plants. One way to further improve their effectiveness is to control the heat pump exploiting the dependence of its coefficient of performance (COP) on the external temperature and temperature of the return water from the load. In particular, it is possible to exploit the heat pump when its efficiency is higher, so optimizing its performance in a predictive manner, anticipating the impact of external conditions. For the case of an air-to-water heat pump, the optimization problem is nonlinear due to the load dependence of the heat pump COP and variable supply water flow rate. This may pose implementation problems. If we address a standard control hardware, simplified optimal control formulations are more effective. In this paper, we specifically address this issue, and a reduced-order, linear, but adaptive time-varying predictive model of the heat pump COP is designed. Our solution takes into account the variation of the heat pump efficiency based on the external temperature and the load profile, which are changing within the control horizon. The proposed COP model is then used within a linear time-varying model predictive controller formulation which provides a prediction of the heat pump dynamical behavior based on the load dependence of the heat pump COP, while tackling the nonlinearities of the system imposed by the variable water flow rate in the hot water tank and also by the load dependence of the heat pump COP. The proposed approach has been implemented and in detail tested on a reference model based on a real case study from the Denmark Technical University, Risø Campus, SYSLAB. An intensive simulation analysis and complements the testing, showing the accuracy and the potential of the method, also in the perspective of practical implementation.},

	abstract = {In Denmark, the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has increased from 44\% in 2015 to 55\% in 2020 and is scheduled to increase up to 100\% by 2050. To overcome the intermittency and volatility of the RES, demand-side flexibility is an alternative solution for the Danish Electricity Market (DEM). In the residential sector, the heat pump is a practical solution to hedge against the supply-side uncertainties associated with RES. To fulfill the aim, this paper suggests a novel hierarchical structure for residential heat pumps to provide power system flexibility. An Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) is proposed to unlock the heat flexibility of residential buildings in response to RES availability. The three-stage stochastic programming is addressed to schedule, adjust, and regulate the heat flexibilities of buildings hierarchically in three trading floors of short-term electricity markets, including day-ahead, intraday, and balancing market floors, on long, mid, and short advance notices, respectively. Leveraging heat flexibility based on occupancy patterns, the thermal dynamics of buildings are developed to address different temperature zones in residential buildings. Finally, a Danish Test House with 4 temperature zones is simulated to show the applicability and proficiency of the suggested approach. The results confirm that the proposed approach not only provides flexibility to the DEM but also reduces the energy consumption cost of households.},

Investigation on the behavior of air source heat pump systems based on the analysis of real data is important to improve the system performance and attain optimum performance during winter. This will assist governments and industry sectors in formulating energy policies and improving this technology efficiently. Currently, there is no available studies relating the use of data-driven models for improving air source heat pump system. Thus, a large experimental dataset was obtained from four real projects in Beijing, and a hybrid and general model (ambient temperature –20 °C to + 17 °C) coupling various data-driven models was established. A methodology was developed to assess and detect outliers in the dataset that cause incorrect results for the developed model. After removing the outliers, a regression analysis revealed an excellent agreement between almost 8000 experimental data samples and the predictions, with a coefficient of determination of 0.87. Two scenarios were considered for improving and optimizing the thermal performance of air source heat pump systems using the developed predictive model. A growth of 8.18\% was observed in the coefficient of performance compared with that of the real operation when the indoor temperature was 18–20 °C. The total system performance increased by an average of 15.93\% when the indoor temperature was set between 18 and 20 °C and the rated capacity increased from 11.5 to 12 kW.},

Heating is the largest energy end-use, accounting for almost half of total energy consumption in most countries. This paper presents an extensive review of previous works on several aspects of heat pumps, including their role in the decarbonisation of the heating sector. In addition, themes related to recent technological advances of heat pumps, as well as, their roles in terms of adding flexibility to renewable-rich systems and carbon abatement are examined. Challenges and barriers facing large-scale deployment of heat pumps are identified. Generally, as the share of renewables in the energy mix increases, heat pumps can play a role in addressing a multitude of problems induced by climate change. The potential of heat pumps to abate emissions, however, is highly dependent on the type of technology, location and electricity mix. Heat pumps can be a source of flexibility in the power system and can upgrade waste heat to provide low-cost heating in district heating networks. They are environment friendly and provide a viable pathway for decarbonising the heating sector. However, economic, regulatory, structural and infrastructural barriers exist, which may hinder heat pump integration rate.},

	abstract = {The largest parts of energy demand within the residential sector are used for space heating (SH), domestic hot water (DHW) and space cooling (SC). The thermal and electrical needs can be mainly covered by energy systems that consist of Photovoltaics (PVs), solar thermal collectors (STCs), heat pumps (HPs) and flexibility sources, e.g. battery energy storage (BES) and thermal energy storage (TES). In this paper, various control strategies for the optimal day-to-day operation of residential energy systems that consist of a variable-speed HP, STCs, PVs, as well as BES and TES units are examined. The proposed strategies are based on the concepts of self-consumption maximization (SCM) and time-of-use arbitrage (ToUA) considering priorities on BES and TES charging. A typical Greek single-family building is assumed examining multiple criteria for the assessment of the rule-based approaches. The results demonstrate that priority on TES charging can lead to higher system performance than on BES charging. Regardless of the number of ToU tariff zones, during off/mid-peak periods the upper energy needs of the SH/SC trajectory should be fulfilled only in case of excess PV power, otherwise the cost of imported energy increases significantly. Both SCM and ToUA strategies can lead to rates of self-consumption and self-sufficiency that deviate in average per about 4\% from the optimal values. Moreover, the ToUA-based strategies can approach the minimum cost of imported energy with a relative increase of 22\% compared to the optimum. However, the minimum thermal discomfort due to space temperature cannot be achieved without the prediction of the daily SH/SC demand. Furthermore, the proposed strategies can reach the minimum thermal discomfort due to DHW losses, while leading to lower BES degradation rates than the optimization. Finally, from the multi-objective optimization for the first year of system operation, it is verified that the optimal dimensioning of PV, BES and TES is considerably affected by the type of rule-based strategy selected.},

The results show that during the heating season the available storage capacity increases from new to old buildings. Part of the thermal energy shifted is lost through the envelope after the events, resulting in lower efficiencies for old buildings. In general, upwards and downwards modulation events are preferable just before and just after the peak load periods, respectively. The paper shows that severe weather conditions and intermittent set-point schedules lead to exceptions to this general rule. In the heating season, forced modulation events do not bring to significant variation of thermal comfort in well-insulated buildings, whereas they do in old ones. During the cooling season, the choice of the best event is more difficult due to the high variability of diurnal heat gains and the indoor thermal conditions depend on the start time of events rather than on the type of building envelope.},

	abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising technique to address growing needs for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to operate more efficiently and with greater flexibility. However, due to a number of factors, including the required implementation expertise, lack of high quality data, and a risk-adverse industry, MPC has yet to gain widespread adoption. While many previous studies have shown the advantages of MPC, few analyzed the implementation effort and associated practical challenges. In addition, previous work has developed an open-source, Modelica-based tool-chain that automatically generates optimal control, parameter estimation, and state estimation problems aimed at facilitating MPC implementation. Therefore, this study demonstrates usage of this tool-chain to implement MPC in a real office building, discusses practical challenges of implementing MPC, and estimates the implementation effort associated with various tasks in order to inform the development of future workflows and serve as an initial benchmark for their impact on reducing implementation effort. This study finds that the implemented MPC saves approximately 40\% of HVAC energy over the existing control during a two-month trial period and that tasks related to data collection and controller deployment activities can each require as much effort as model generation.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) power generation can help reduce households’ electricity from the power grid and thus reduce electricity bills. However, due to the intermittence and time-varying nature of PV power generation, part of the clean energy will be wasted. Especially in some places where PV power is allowed to be sold to the power grid, the PV power that exceeds the feed-in limit will be curtailed to reduce the pressure on the infrastructure of the power grid. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) as energy buffers have attracted increasing attention to help improve the penetration of PV power to households. This paper presents an adaptive energy management method to minimize the energy cost of residential PV-battery systems. First, the uncertainty of the predictive electricity demand and PV power supply is modeled. Then a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) strategy is used to determine the optimal power flow of the system. Due to the deviation between the predictive input values and the actual ones, the power flow from SMPC is adjusted based on the improved correction strategy (ICS) proposed in this paper. By comparing with the other two methods (one considers the uncertainty and the other does not), the proposed method can increase the economic benefits of the system by 18\% and 63\%, respectively. The wasted PV power that exceeds the feed-in limit can also be reduced by 24\% and 31\%. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method to improve the system's economic benefits and self-consumption of clean energy.},

	abstract = {With the increased amount of volatile renewable energy sources connected to the electricity grid, and the phase-out of fossil fuel based power plants, there is an increased need for frequency regulation. On the demand side, frequency regulation services can be offered by buildings or districts that are equipped with electric heating or cooling systems, by exploiting their thermal inertia. Existing approaches for tapping into this potential typically rely on dynamic building models, which in practice can be challenging to obtain and maintain. As a result, practical implementations of such systems are scarce. Moreover, actively controlling buildings requires extensive control infrastructure and may cause privacy concerns in district energy systems. Motivated by this, we exploit the thermal inertia of buffer storage for reserves, reducing the building models to demand forecasts here. By combining a control scheme based on Robust Model Predictive Control, with affine policies, and heating demand forecasting based on Artificial Neural Networks with online correction methods, we offer frequency regulation reserves and maintain user comfort with a system comprising a heat pump and buffer storage. While the robust approach ensures occupant comfort, the use of affine policies reduces the effect of disturbance uncertainty on the system state. In a first-of-its-kind experiment with a real district-like building energy system, we demonstrate that the scheme is able to offer reserves in a variety of conditions and track a regulation signal while meeting the heating demand of the connected buildings. 13.4\% of the consumed electricity is flexible. In additional numerical studies, we demonstrate that using affine policies significantly decreases the cost function and increases the amount of offered reserves and we investigate the suboptimality in comparison to an omniscient control system.},

This integrated energy system (IES) consists of power grid, photovoltaic/wind power generator, buildings, electric batteries, and heat pumps with thermal energy storages (HPTES). Peak load shifting index, a new indicator, is proposed for evaluating the capability of energy storages for peak-shaving and valley-filling of the grid power and thermal load, and the stability of the power grid with renewables. Comparison of the performances of IES under three scenarios shows that through adopting high-efficient HPTES together with an optimal coordinated scheduling strategy, the penetration rate of renewable energy and the stability of IES can be enhanced significantly; while the operation cost, peak power, grid interactive power, peak load shifting index and CO2 emissions can be reduced significantly. Moreover, compared with the optimal scheduling strategy previously developed based on a linear model, the optimal scheduling strategy developed based on a dynamic nonlinear model can help to reduce the grid-connected time of the IES containing HPTES. This study would be useful for increasing the penetration rate of renewables and the stability of grid, as well as reducing the grid-disconnected time of an IES at a low operation cost in practice.},

However, the operating energy performance in practice conditions is limited due to the traditional control strategy. An efficient-cost advanced control strategy is desired to improve the overall operating performance. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for an air source heat pump (ASHP) heating system to optimize the overall operating performance. Based on the control-oriented model and objective function, MPC can provide the optimized compressor frequency and water mass flow rate in real-time, which can lead to the optimized real-time variable water temperature difference. Thus, the total power consumption can be minimized for the heating system by coordinating the compressor power consumption and water pump power consumption in the real-time operating condition. A high-fidelity physical model is first built to produce the required data source, and then the control-oriented model is derived based on the machine learning technique. MPC is designed to minimize the total power consumption providing that the heating capacity is well maintained. The MPC strategy is evaluated and compared with the traditional PI control under three operating cases.},

The method considers both thermal and hydraulic coupling among different building zones. The iterative and parallel distributed optimization approach builds upon an uncooperative approach for thermal coupling using the Nash equilibrium approach and a cooperative approach for the hydraulic coupling using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Apart from thermal coupling through walls, the modeling takes thermal coupling through doors into account using a data-driven approach, which calculates the inter-zone air exchanges based on temperature differences between door-coupled zones. The hydraulic coupling enables consideration of interactions between the zones introduced by a shared, central Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The distributed MPC framework is structured in an easy-scalable, plug-and-play composition, where local systems are automatically assigned to the global coordination scheme. The distributed MPC method is applied to a simulative nonlinear case study, consisting of a six-room-building Modelica model considering both thermal and hydraulic interactions. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated and compared against centralized and decentralized control concepts in terms of energy consumption, discomfort and computation time.},

The significant penetration of electrical loads and domestic photovoltaic (PV) plants has therefore become an important topic for researchers and engineers working in the building sector. In this context, this paper presents a recently constructed laboratory for testing efficient management strategies in all-electric houses. The article describes the laboratory and the Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy developed to minimize economic costs for space heating while ensuring thermal comfort in the indoor environment with a simulated rooftop PV system. The proposed controller leverages prior knowledge about the physical and geometric properties of the building and the optimization problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming. This article reports the results of calibration and optimization performed in open loop, as well as two tests where the MPC actually controls the HVAC system using receding horizon. The predictive controller was able to substantially increase PV self-consumption in both tests compared to a conventional thermostat, thus cutting electricity costs for heat pump by 10-17\%. Such improvement was obtained at the price of a higher thermal comfort violations, mainly due to oversimplified HVAC system models. In light of these findings, the article analyses the effect of such simplifications and suggests possible alternative modelling approaches.},

Specific aims of the study were to investigate: (i) model predictive control vs. fixed order control, (ii) existing and future wind-influenced electricity tariffs, and (iii) optimal cost size combinations of heat pump and hot water tank. The lowest levelized cost of heat for the existing tariffs was for a time-of-use tariff, 750 kW heat pump and 500 m3 hot water tank combination. For the future wind-influenced tariff a 1000 kW heat pump and 2000 m3 hot water tank was cost optimal and showed model predictive control benefits over fixed order control with levelized heat costs reducing 41 \%, and heat demand met by renewables increasing 18 \%.

	abstract = {District heating networks transport thermal energy from one or more sources to a plurality of consumers. Lowering the operating temperatures of district heating networks is a key research topic to reduce energy losses and unlock the potential of low-temperature heat sources, such as waste heat. With an increasing share of uncontrolled heat sources in district heating networks, control strategies to coordinate energy supply and network operation become more important. This paper focuses on the modeling, control, and optimization of a low-temperature district heating network, presenting a case study with a high share of waste heat from high-performance computers. The network consists of heat pumps with temperature-dependent characteristics. In this paper, quadratic correlations are used to model temperature characteristics. Thus, a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained program is presented that optimizes the operation of heat pumps in combination with thermal energy storages and the operating temperatures of a pipe network. The network operation is optimized for three sample days. The presented optimization model uses the flexibility of the thermal energy storages and thermal inertia of the network by controlling its flow and return temperatures. The results show savings of electrical energy consumption of 1.55\%–5.49\%, depending on heat and cool demand.},

	abstract = {Handling of varying energy sources and flexible connection to smart grids is a current challenge. Minimizing the overall monetary cost and maximizing the use of renewable energy sources are not the exclusive optimization goals, but also guaranteeing the thermal comfort is an important goal. This paper deals with a comprehensive approach of a mixed-integer quadratic-programming model predictive control scheme based on the thermal building model and the building energy management system. Calculating the global optima while handling continuous and binary constraints as well as variables and considering both the thermal and electrical part of a smart home are the key aspect of the proposed model predictive controller. By inclusion of disturbance forecasts, occupancy prediction, and individual user weights the control scheme is optimally suited for implementation in real buildings. Furthermore, the occupancy prediction in this research is based on an unsupervised method, which is useful for an effective implementation. This work demonstrates the optimal management of appliances such as heating, a battery storage, a freezer, a dishwasher, a photo-voltaic system, and the opportunities to buy from and sell to the smart grid. Optimal utilization of the building’s thermal storage capacity helps to minimize necessary battery capacity. Simulation results underline the efficient global optimization while demonstrating all proposed features of the complex control scheme.},

The presence of renewable and storage can help the optimal operation only if a good control manages all the elements of the grid. New models of green buildings and energy communities are proposed. For a real application they need an appropriate and advanced power system equipped with a building automation control system. This article presents an economic model predictive control approach to the problem of managing the electric and heating resources in a smart building in a coordinated way, for the purpose of achieving in real time nearly zero energy consumption and automated participation to demand response programs. The proposed control, leveraging a mixed integer quadratic programming problem, allows to meet manifold thermal and electric users' requirements and react to inbound demand response signals, while still guaranteeing stable operation of the building's electric and thermal storage equipment.

These hybrid systems represent a promising solution for the energy retrofit of existing buildings and new installations, being able to increase the efficiency of monovalent systems, especially at low external temperatures. The use of thermal storage can furtherly minimize both the operating cost and the primary energy consumption, shifting the operation of the heat pump to the most profitable periods. In this work, the optimal control problem has been investigated by means of mixed-integer linear programming, considering an ideal forecast of external temperature and thermal load on given horizon periods (i.e. model predictive control). Achievable cost savings with respect to a traditional rule-based control strategy with no storage are presented as a function of both prediction horizon and storage capacity in a dimensionless form. A relation between prediction horizon length and optimal storage capacity is shown. An example of application of the method is illustrated, showing cost savings up to 8\%. A sensitivity analysis on the storage tank losses, climatic conditions, generators efficiency, and energy prices is also presented, showing the cost saving potential in all these different conditions.},

	abstract = {For implementation in controllers with limited computational power, simplified optimal control formulations are desirable. For the case of a modulating heat pump system, the optimization problem is nonlinear due to the supply water temperature and load dependency of the heat pump coefficient of performance (COP). By neglecting these nonlinearities, e.g., by assuming a constant COP, the optimization problem becomes convex and fast convergence to the global minimum is ensured. This study quantifies the impact of these simplifications for the case of a modulating air-to-water heat pump connected to a residential floor heating system. A first comparison suggests a significant deterioration of the control performance. While the nonlinear formulations result in continuous operation at part load, the convex approximations give rise to large power fluctuations, increasing the energy cost with 7\% to 16\%. However, by penalizing power peaks in the cost function, the achieved control performances are almost identical. This reveals that the cost function is flat near the optimum. Compared to a conventional heating curve control strategy, the energy cost savings amount to 5\% for optimization-based control strategies (in the case of a day/night tariff structure). Although less than expected, this improvement is still significant given the wide spread presence of the application.},

	abstract = {European policies are fostering the electrification of energy use, including space heating and cooling systems, in order to decarbonise the building stock. The significant penetration of electrical loads and domestic photovoltaic (PV) plants has therefore become an important topic for researchers and engineers working in the building sector. In this context, this paper presents a recently constructed laboratory for testing efficient management strategies in all-electric houses. The article describes the laboratory and the Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy developed to minimize economic costs for space heating while ensuring thermal comfort in the indoor environment with a simulated rooftop PV system. The proposed controller leverages prior knowledge about the physical and geometric properties of the building and the optimization problem is formulated using mixedinteger quadratic programming. This article reports the results of calibration and optimization performed in open loop, as well as two closed loop tests where the MPC controls the HVAC system using receding horizon. The predictive controller was able to substantially increase PV self-consumption in both tests compared to a con­ ventional thermostat, thus cutting electricity costs for heat pump by 10–17\%. Such improvement was obtained at the price of a higher thermal comfort violations, mainly due to oversimplified HVAC system models. In light of these findings, the article analyses the effect of such simplifications and suggests possible alternative modelling approaches.},

To deal with the in­ crease in electricity consumption, the intermittency of renewable energy generation and grid contingencies, a greater effort is required towards residential management optimisation. A novel adaptive model predictive control algorithm is proposed to achieve this objective. The challenges for this research included recognising and modelling the economic and technical constraints of the sources and appliances and addressing the uncertainties concerning the weather and user behaviour. Data-driven models are developed and trained to predict the user behaviour and buildings. Artificial neural networks and statistical models based on the weighted moving average are proposed to capture the patterns of deferrable and non-deferrable appliances, battery storage, electric ve­ hicles, photovoltaic modules, buildings and grid connections. A dual optimisation method is devised to minimise the electricity bill and achieve thermal comfort. The proposed optimisation solver is a two-step optimisation method based on genetic algorithm and mixed integer linear programming. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method through a set of simulation scenarios. The results of the quantitative analysis undertaken as part of this study show the effectiveness of the proposed al­ gorithm towards reducing electricity charges and improving grid elasticity.},

In all ﬁelds heat pumps - when controlled in an appropriate manner - can help easing the transition to a decentralized energy system accompanied by a higher share of prosumers and renewable energy sources. Predictive controls are successfully used in the majority of studies, often assuming idealized conditions.

In this paper an open-source planning-level modelling tool, PyLESA, is presented and applied to a sizing study to demonstrate the capturing of these beneﬁts at the planning-level. Speciﬁc aims of the study were to investigate: (i) model predictive control vs. ﬁxed order control, (ii) existing and future wind-inﬂuenced electricity tariffs, and (iii) optimal cost size combinations of heat pump and hot water tank. The lowest levelized cost of heat for the existing tariffs was for a time-of-use tariff, 750 kW heat pump and 500 m3 hot water tank combination. For the future wind-inﬂuenced tariff a 1000 kW heat pump and 2000 m3 hot water tank was cost optimal and showed model predictive control beneﬁts over ﬁxed order control with levelized heat costs reducing 41 \%, and heat demand met by renewables increasing 18 \%.

	abstract = {Air-to-water heat pumps are quite often integrated with a hot-water tank, to better decouple the generation from the delivery of heat in buildings and to improve the overall performance of the system. The estimation and prediction of the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is extremely important to enforce efficiency, but it is also a very challenging task, due to the strong dependency of the performance on disturbances and operating conditions. Another source of potential model mismatch is the variable water flow rate in the condenser side induced by the heat pump low-level control logic, which gives rise to a non-trivial nonlinear system. In this letter, we tackle the problem to develop and properly tune an equivalent control-oriented model for the system, i.e. heat pump and tank, under variable flow rate conditions on both the condenser and load side, while still preserving good prediction capabilities of the model, with no tank temperature nor mass flow rate sensors. In particular, we focus on a real case study consisting in an air-to-water heat pump system and a 150m2 building located in SYSLAB, Department for Electrical Engineering, Risoe Campus, Denmark Technical University. The quality of the developed models is then evaluated through a nonlinear model predictive controller suitably designed and checked against detailed reference models previously developed. Finally, different sensitivity analyses are performed, which witness the robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

Nonlinear model predictive control is an effective way to deal with many physical constraints and nonlinear formulations. Alternatively, linear time-varying MPC can be used, based on successive linearizations around a reference trajectory. The goal of the paper is to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of those MPC techniques for temperature control in radiant-floor buildings. The results show that nonlinear on-line optimization is real-time feasible for the application considered here, as the slow dynamics allows for a fairly long sampling time. Alternatively, the linear time-varying MPC approach shows a significantly better performance compared to the Standard MPC scheme if a feasible reference trajectory is provided. Nonlinear MPC can save up to 6\% energy and improve the comfort by 4\% with respect to Standard MPC for the given application, while its difference with LTV-MPC is negligible. Moreover, a robustness analysis has been conducted, showing the impact of the heat pump efficiency on the control performance.},

First, a detailed model of a generic heat pump, here called reference model, is developed and experimentally validated. Then, the reference model is used to formulate several control-oriented models of the heat pump, namely the ones defining the Coefficient of Performance (COP) based on increasing level of complexity. Finally, the paper explores the impact of the simplification level of the heat pump model on the overall quality of temperature control in a building, and on the electrical energy consumption. In particular, the pilot case here considered consists of a heat pump supplying water to a load through a hot water tank, and for control structure a linear time varying Model Predictive Control is designed. The impact of the power peaks is also investigated, which shows a significant improvement in the COP prediction based on the level of approximation. This study presents also how the load flexibility can take advantage from a correct COP prediction. The results can be seamlessly extended to the application of the real-time pricing, where the prediction of the COP trajectory can be used for the economic load shifting, thanks to the inertia of the hot water tank and the load.},

	abstract = {Energy efﬁciency in building heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment requires the development of accurate models for testing HVAC control strategies and corresponding energy consumption. In order to make the HVAC control synthesis computationally affordable, such control-oriented models are typically a simpliﬁed version of more elaborate building simulation environments (e.g. EnergyPlus, Modelica, TRNSYS). Despite their simplicity, control-oriented models must effectively catch all the interactions between HVAC equipment, in order achieve system integration and avoid fragmentation in HVAC modelling and control synthesis, which is one of the main causes of suboptimal performance in the building sector. In this work we propose an integrated control-oriented modelling for HVAC performance benchmarking. The following HVAC equipment and their interaction are modelled: condensing boiler, radiator, air handling unit, heat pump, chiller, fan, pump, pipe, duct, and multiple thermal zones. The proposed modelling approach is modular so that the user can add and remove as many components as desired, depending on the building to be modelled. Appropriate procedures for synthesis of control strategies and benchmarking are proposed. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which can lead to improvements in occupants' thermal comfort while at the same time consistently attaining energy savings.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach for building energy systems based on Modelica. The MPC approach takes into account two characteristics that are very common for building energy systems: nonlinearities (inherent in the building envelope and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems) and discontinuities (in the form of on/ off operation, discrete operation states and operation modes). The hybrid MPC approach integrates both continuous and discrete optimization variables into the control concept and thus is capable of controlling building energy systems with binary or integer decision variables, switching dynamics or logic if-then-else constraints. By employing a time-variant linearization approach, nonlinear Modelica optimization problems are approximated with high accuracy and transformed into a linearized state-space representation. Based on the linearization output, a linearized optimization problem is generated automatically in every MPC iteration, which is extensible by various integer characteristics and is accessible for a wide range of mixed-integer solvers. A simulation study on a nonlinear Modelica building energy system demonstrates the control quality of the proposed toolchain revealing a small linearization error and successful integration of multiple integer characteristics. The benefits of the approach are manifested by comparing its performance with different reference control strategies.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the impact of using different types of energy storages integrated with a heat pump for energy efficiency in radiant-floor buildings. In particular, the performance of the building energy resources management system is improved through the application of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) to better anticipate the effects of disturbances and real-time pricing together with following the modular structure of the system under control. To this end, the load side and heating system are decoupled through a three-element mixing valve, which enforces a fixed water flow rate in the building pipelines. Hence, the building temperature control is executed by a linear model predictive control, which in turn is able to exchange the building information with the heating system controller. On the contrary, there is a variable action of the mixing valve, which enforces a variable circulated water flow rate within the tank. In this case, the optimization problem is more complex than in literature due to the variable circulation water flow rate within the tank layers, which gives rise to a nonlinear model. Therefore, an adaptive linear model predictive control is designed for the heating system to deal with the system nonlinearity trough a successive linearization method around the current operating point. A battery is also installed as a further storage, in addition to the thermal energy storage, in order to have the option between the charging and discharging of both storages based on the electricity price tariff and the building and thermal energy storage inertia. A qualitative comparative analysis has been also carried out with a rule-based heuristic logic and a centralized model predictive control (CMPC) algorithm. Finally, the proposed control algorithm has been experimentally validated in a well-equipped smart grid research laboratory belonging to the ERIGrid Research Infrastructure, funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.},

	abstract = {Buildings are dynamical systems with several control challenges: large storage capacities, switching aggregates, technical and thermal constraints, and internal and external disturbances (occupancy, ambient temperature, solar radiation). Conflicting optimization goals naturally arise in buildings, where the maximization of user comfort versus the minimization of energy consumption poses the main trade-off to be balanced. Model predictive control (MPC) is the ideal control strategy to deal with such problems. Especially the knowledge and use of future disturbances in the optimization makes MPC such a powerful and valuable control tool in the area of building automation. MPC compromises a class of control algorithms that utilizes an online process model to optimize the future response of a plant. The main benefits of MPC are the explicit consideration of building dynamics, available predictions of future disturbances, constraints, and conflicting optimization goals to provide the optimal control input. MPC technology has been applied to process control for several decades and it is an upcoming field in building automation. This is a consequence of the large potential for saving energy in buildings and also allows to maximize the use of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the added flexibility enables to integrate such buildings in future smart grids. In this work ten questions concerning model predictive control for energy efficient buildings are posed and answered in detail.},

The MPC algorithm requires an accurate but also computationally efficient mathematical model of the building thermal behavior. In this paper, several lumped-parameter thermal models of a passive house with an integrated photovoltaic system are compared to evaluate the model complexity needed to capture the basic thermal behavior of the entire building. In order to reduce implementation costs, the state and parameters of the finally chosen 1R1C model are estimated online with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In addition, this self-adaptive thermal model provides online estimations of the unmeasured heat flows caused by the inhabitants. The results show that the EKF yields a robust convergence of the parameters after approximately three weeks and that the adapted model is able to generate a prediction of the heat demand for several days. The predicted reference room temperature shows average deviations of less than 1°C for two-day predictions and of less than 3°C for four-day predictions. Therefore, the proposed self-adaptive thermal building model is well suited to be used in a MPC environment.},

What is less known is the subtleness of the metering practices of energy suppliers behind the reported energy values. This paper discusses the implications of applying different net metering methods on a prosumer’s energy exchanges with the grid, and subsequently the effect on costs and self-consumption. The methods differ on whether netting is based on each individual phase (or on the overall energy flow) and the netting interval used for settlement. Besides describing and illustrating those differences, real data from a Danish household is used to quantify their impact. Results show that self-consumption increases from 38\% to 53\%, when moving from instantaneous per phase netting to hourly summation netting. The corresponding annual energy imports decrease from 1459 kWh to 1087 kWh. The economic implications of applying different netting methods are quantified and discussed, and we show that annual savings of at least €50 can be achieved by simply switching to a summation smart meter.},

Due to the intermittency and volatility of renewable energies, demand-side management is a practical solution to overcome the problem. This paper proposes a stochastic model predictive control for heat pumps to supply space heating and domestic hot water consumption of residential buildings. Continuous-Time Stochastic Model is coded in R language to address the model identification approach. The approach uses the sensor data of households to extract the thermal dynamics of the building. The controller participates in three floors of power markets with high renewable power penetration. The three-stage stochastic programming is suggested to unlock power-to-heat flexibility in the day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets on long, mid, and short advance notices, respec­ tively. Regarding the close correlation between renewable power availability and electricity price, the price data is modeled as probabilistic scenarios through Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average. The ambient tem­ perature, as well as the domestic hot water consumption, are addressed as envelope-bounds with upper and lower thresholds. Finally, the operational strategies of the controller are examined on a 150 m2 test house under uncertain electricity prices, weather variables, and occupancy patterns.},

	abstract = {Recent research has indicated a significant potential for providing demand response using Economic Model Predictive Control (E-MPC) of radiators in residential space heating systems. Previous studies indicate the need for distinct temperatures in different rooms, which would require an E-MPC with different temperature constraints across the dwelling. Studies on E-MPC concepts for this purpose often assume that it is possible to measure the heating power delivered to each room separately. However, this assumption is not valid in typical existing residential buildings heated by hydronic radiators; they only have one heat meter measuring the heating use of the entire housing unit. This study presents a simulation-based study of a novel dual-zone E-MPC scheme that relies on indoor air temperature measurements in individual rooms of the housing unit, and only one heat meter measuring the total heating use for space heating and domestic hot water. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has the same load shifting potential as an E-MPC using room-level heat metering. The proposed scheme thus reduces the additional hardware and data infrastructure needed for the practical realization of E-MPC of residential space heating systems for demand response purposes.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control can reduce heating systems’ operating costs and energy consumption. This especially applies to heat pumps, whose operation efficiency highly depends on the heating system’s source and sink temperatures. In literature, process models for heat pumps mostly introduce the coefficient of performance as a parameter thus assuming constant supply temperatures. However, supply temperature adjustment is crucial to overcharge buffer storages and hence shift energy to more favorable times, which is the basis of model predictive control concepts. We close this gap by developing two different air-source heat pump modeling approaches using the supply temperature as control variable: a piecewise linear model based on simulation results and a quadratic modeling approach. Both methods are benchmarked with a simplified linear model representing the state of research. The simplified linear model underestimates the cost of storage charging as it neglects the supply temperature’s influence on the coefficient of performance and results in 8.7\% higher operating costs and 12.1\% higher energy demand than the piecewise linear approach. However, the simplified linear model yields the lowest average computation time compared to the piecewise and quadratic approaches. The quadratic approach results in both lower operating costs (-1.9\%) and energy demand (-1.8\%), as well as lower computation times than the piecewise approach, consequently representing the best trade-off between performance and computational effort. We recommend future work to apply the method to a ground- or water-source heat pump and to a coupled building energy system to investigate the transferability of our findings.},

	abstract = {Residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems usually employ on/off controllers to regulate the temperature. Generally, there is no supervisory controller which can use the weather forecast and electricity time of use (TOU) price information to reduce the overall operating cost of the equipment. Lack of a supervisory controller results in higher operating costs of the HVAC system. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) based supervisory controller is designed to shift the heating and cooling load of a house to off-peak hours. Supervisory MPC generates the temperature set-points trajectory for on/off controllers. The approach was verified through extensive experiments in an experimental archetype house. By employing the supervisory controller with variable set-points 16\% cost savings were obtained when compared to the fixed zone temperature set-points at 25°C. More significant savings of about 50\% were seen when MPC-based centralized controller was compared with the fixed zone temperature set-points of 24°C.},

These can handle multiple inputs and outputs, uncertainties in forecast data, and plant constraints, amongst other features. One of the main issues identified in the literature regarding deploying these controllers is the lack of experimental demonstrations using standard components and communication protocols. In this original work, the economic-MPC-based optimal scheduling of a real-world heat pump-based building energy plant is demonstrated, and its performance is evaluated against two conventional controllers. The demonstration includes the steps to integrate an optimization-based supervisory controller into a typical building automation and control system with off-the-shelf HVAC components and usage of state-of-art algorithms to solve a mixed integer quadratic problem. Technological benefits in terms of fewer constraint violations and a hardware-friendly operation with MPC were identified. Additionally, a strong dependency of the economic benefits on the type of load profile, system design and controller parameters was also identified. Future work for the quantification of these benefits, the application of machine learning algorithms, and the study of forecast deviations is also proposed.},

However, the economically viable realisation of E-MPC in residential buildings requires an effort to minimise the need for additional equipment and labour-intensive modelling processes. This paper reports on an experiment where a novel E-MPC setup was used for thermostatically control of a hydronic radiator in a highly-insulated residential building located on the NTNU Campus in Trondheim, Norway. The E-MPC utilized data from a heating meter, two temperature sensors and an existing weather forecast web service to train a linear black-box model. The results showed that the precision of model trained on excitation data that was generated using setpoints of either 21 or 24 °C was sufficient to obtain good control of the indoor air temperature while shifting consumption from high to low price periods. The findings of the experiment indicate that a minimal E-MPC setup is able to realize the significant DR potential that lies in utilizing the inherent thermal mass in residential buildings.},

In single family houses, the heat pump, in combination with thermal energy storage, can shift their energy comsumption according to price signals in order to reduce consumer costs. This paper analyses the impact of different heat storage sizes and heat pump powers on cost savings and shifting potential, focussing on the Luxembourgish context, when variable electricity prices based on the electricity market are applied. A model predictive controller determines the cost-optimal operating cycles of the heat pump. The building’s heat demand is predicted with the help of a neural network. The results of the parametric study show significant differences in energy efficiency and cost savings. Furthermore limitations of taking advantage of variable electicity prices due to the price structure are disclosed. The cost savings however do not give a sufficient incentive for the consumer to invest in optimizing the heating system for Demand-Side-Management purposes. By consequence, the potential and the efficiency of Demand-Side-Management are limited and further incentives are necessary.},

	abstract = {Using a detailed building simulation model, the amount of thermal buffering, with and without phase change material (PCM), needed to time-shift an air source heat pump's operation to off-peak periods, as defined by the UK ‘Economy 10’ tariff, was investigated for a typical UK detached dwelling. The performance of the buffered system was compared to the case with no load shifting and with no thermal buffering. Additionally, the load shifting of a population of buffered heat pumps to off-peak periods was simulated and the resulting change in the peak demand on the electricity network was assessed. The results from this study indicate that 1000 L of hot water buffering or 500 L of PCM-enhanced hot water buffering was required to move the operation of the heat pump fully to off-peak periods, without adversely affecting the provision of space heating and hot water for the end user. The work also highlights that buffering and load shifting increased the heat pump's electrical demand by over 60\% leading to increased cost to the end user and increased CO2 emissions (depending on the electricity tariff applied and time varying CO2 intensity of the electricity generation mix, respectively). The study also highlights that the load-shifting of populations of buffered heat pumps wholly to off-peak periods using crude instruments such as tariffs increased the peak loading on the electrical network by over 50\% rather than reducing it and that careful consideration is needed as to how the load shifting of a group of heat pumps is orchestrated.},

	abstract = {Energy flexible buildings through smart demand-side management (DSM) or smart demand response (DR) using efficient energy storage, are currently one of the most promising options to deploy low-carbon technologies in the electricity networks without the need of reinforcing existing networks. Although, many ignore the potential, economic and energetic benefits these alternatives could hold for buildings, users and tariffs. In the study carried out a control system of demand management measures is analyzed, based on the use of the buildings' thermal mass as thermal storage (preheating, precooling and night ventilation). This demand management system is analyzed in five existing residential buildings in the so-called reference scenario (construction, user and current prices). Subsequently, comes the analysis of the optimal management strategy choice from the system, when facing changes in the housings' constructive characteristics and electric tariffs. The dynamism of the management system stands out from the results achieved, as well as the dependence of the possible strategy choices on the climate zones. In the reference situation, the maximum economic savings obtained after the implementation of the management system correspond to 3.2\% for heating and 8.5\% for cooling. In this same manner, when the buildings are previously rehabilitated, the savings can double even generating energy savings. Finally, it can be concluded that the low installation costs of these measures make them a winning solution, as long as the electric pricing and user behavior allow the required flexibility.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control can reduce heating systems’ operating costs and energy consumption. This especially applies to heat pumps, whose operation efficiency highly depends on the heating system’s source and sink temperatures. In literature, process models for heat pumps mostly introduce the coefficient of performance as a parameter thus assuming constant supply temperatures. However, supply temperature adjustment is crucial to overcharge buffer storages and hence shift energy to more favorable times, which is the basis of model predictive control concepts. We close this gap by developing two different air-source heat pump modeling approaches using the supply temperature as control variable: a piecewise linear model based on simulation results and a quadratic modeling approach. Both methods are benchmarked with a simplified linear model representing the state of research. The simplified linear model underestimates the cost of storage charging as it neglects the supply temperature’s influence on the coefficient of performance and results in 8.7 \% higher operating costs and 12.1 \% higher energy demand than the piecewise linear approach. However, the simplified linear model yields the lowest average computation time compared to the piecewise and quadratic approaches. The quadratic approach results in both lower operating costs (−1.9 \%) and energy demand (−1.8 \%), as well as lower computation times than the piecewise approach, consequently representing the best trade-off between performance and computational effort. We recommend future work to apply the method to a ground- or water-source heat pump and to a coupled building energy system to investigate the transferability of our findings.},

	abstract = {In educational buildings, the HVAC system is a major contributor to the total energy use. It is well-known that energy reductions could be achieved by more advanced control strategies for HVAC systems. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy could be a viable solution. Contrary to the standard rule based control (RBC), the predictive control can adjust in the supply air temperature, airflow rate prior to the start of a lecture. This study aims to develop and demonstrate an MPC framework for an all-air system that controls both the room temperature and the CO2-concentrations. To predict these variables two model identification techniques were compared: auto-regressive with exogenous input (ARX-MPC) linear model and a grey-box resistor–capacitor nonlinear model (RC-NMPC). In addition, a cost function that minimized the energy use while guaranteeing thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) was formulated. This study showed that the ARX-MPC was preferred over the RC-NMPC given its simplicity. As for the model identification, the ARX model was less computationally time-consuming than the grey-box model. Furthermore, the RC-NMPC required more computational time than the ARX-MPC, since the RC-NMPC required a non-linear solver while the ARXMPC used a linear one. The developed MPC framework was than implemented through BACnet in a real-use educational building to test its actual performance. The energy savings calculated for the implemented MPC strategies with an occupancy based heating set-point were respectively 10\%–40\% for electric energy use and 21\%–55\% for thermal energy use.},

	abstract = {It has been proven that advanced building control, like model predictive control (MPC), can notably reduce the energy use and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, despite intensive research efforts, the practical applications are still in the early stages. There is a growing need for multidisciplinary education on advanced control methods in the built environment to be accessible for a broad range of researchers and practitioners with different engineering backgrounds. This paper provides a unified framework for model predictive building control technology with focus on the real-world applications. From a theoretical point of view, this paper presents an overview of MPC formulations for building control, modeling paradigms and model types, together with algorithms necessary for real-life implementation. The paper categorizes the most notable MPC problem classes, links them with corresponding solution techniques, and provides an overview of methods for mitigation of the uncertainties for increased performance and robustness of MPC. From a practical point of view, this paper delivers an elaborate classification of the most important modeling, co-simulation, optimal control design, and optimization techniques, tools, and solvers suitable to tackle the MPC problems in the context of building climate control. On top of this, the paper presents the essential components of a practical implementation of MPC such as different control architectures and nuances of communication infrastructures within supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The paper draws practical guidelines with a generic workflow for implementation of MPC in real buildings aimed for contemporary adopters of this technology. Finally, the importance of standardized performance assessment and methodology for comparison of different building control algorithms is discussed.},

Energy reduction in this sector by means of cost-effective and scalable approaches could have an enormous economic, social and environmental impact. Achievement in substantial energy reduction in buildings may require to rethink the entire processes of design, construction and operation of buildings. As almost half of the energy consumed in this area is used for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning, one possible way to achieve the savings in building sector is to improve the building heating control strategy. A shiny example of the improvement can be the use of model based predictive control (MPC). In this paper, we describe the complete process of the MPC implementation for a real office building in Hasselt, Belgium. Starting with building description and data collection, followed by the discussion about the suitable model structure design and proper identification methods selection, the paper attains to a flexible two-level control concept. Finally, the proposed control scheme leads in average to a 17\% energy consumption reduction compared to the conventional control strategy.},

Third, the costs and benefits of building MPC for cases similar to the investigated building are analyzed. In the experiments, MPC controlled the building reliably and achieved a good comfort level. The simulations suggested a significantly improved control performance in terms of energy and comfort compared with the previously installed industry-standard control strategy. However, for similar buildings and with the tools currently available, the required initial investment is likely too high to justify the deployment in everyday building projects on the basis of operating cost savings alone.

	abstract = {An inferential model-based predictive control scheme is described that can optimize the control of boilers in multi-zone heating systems in order to save energy and to improve thermal comfort. The controller has only three inputs: a measurement of the outside air temperature, an estimate of the total solar radiation falling on the exterior of the building, and a measurement of the temperature of the water being supplied by the boiler, and one output: the boiler control signal. The parameters of the model are estimated from input-output data collected using portable temperature loggers, which are temporarily installed in the building to monitor the room temperatures during a short commissioning period of one or two weeks. The performance of the control scheme in different heating systems is investigated using a heating system simulator, which had been developed and validated in previous projects. The simulation results show that the control scheme can significantly improve the overall performance of heating systems compared with conventional boiler control schemes and is easy to commission. The results of an experimental evaluation of the controller in a real building are also presented.},

	abstract = {The paper presents field demonstration results from the implementation of a model predictive control formulation to optimize the operation of a variable volume, dual-duct, multi-zone HVAC unit serving an existing mid-size commercial building. This full-scale study is used to estimate the benefits of advanced building control technologies that can be integrated during a retrofit. The predictive control approach uses dynamic estimates and predictions of zone loads and temperatures, outdoor weather conditions, and HVAC system models to minimize energy consumption while meeting equipment and thermal comfort constraints. The paper describes the on-line hierarchical control system, including communication of the optimal control scheme with the building automation system, the controlled set points and the componentlevel feedback loops, as well as the performance benefits from the demonstration. The experiments conducted and the receding control algorithm implementation results are described. Site measurements show this algorithm, when implemented in state-of-the-art direct digital control systems, consistently yields energy savings of 60\% or more relative to pre-configured rule-based schedules, without sacrificing indoor comfort conditions.},

	abstract = {A model predictive control (MPC) has been implemented in a medium-sized office building in Brussels, Belgium. This paper presents the implementation of the controller and the measured performance in comparison with the default, rule-based control (RBC). The building has two floors and a total size of 960m2. The controllable system is the hybrid heat production consisting of two air/water heat pumps and a condensing gas boiler. The practical situation does not allow controlling end-units in the different zones of the building. The MPC makes use of a Modelica grey-box control model resulting from a system identification with monitoring data. The paper covers the monitoring, model identification, forecasting of disturbances, state estimation, formulation and solving of the optimal control problem (OCP) and transmission of the control signals. The performance is evaluated on a daily basis based on analysis of heating degree days, thermal comfort, energy costs and primary energy consumption. The results show that the model predictive controller is able to provide a similar or better thermal comfort than the reference control while reducing the energy costs by more than 30\%. This is due among others, to a better use of the heat pumps and an adapted hot water supply temperature.},

	abstract = {The identification, quantification, and control of demand flexibility is the major challenge for future grid operations and requires innovative methods and new control strategies. Optimal control strategies such as economic model predictive control have gained attention in building energy management systems. The present experimental case study demonstrates the application of an economic model predictive controller under real-time pricing, including day-ahead prices and imbalance prices. For real-time prices in balancing and spot markets, we introduce a method that presents a flexibility service to provide demand flexibility for a notification time of 1h{\textless}t{\textless}tdayend in advance. The flexibility service can be used as an ancillary service for innovative flexibility markets. The flexibility service includes a dynamic modification of the day-ahead prices to enable the adaption of energy consumption to errors in forecasting of renewable energy generation. The developed method was tested under real-life conditions, which also included the stochastic behaviour of occupants and the dynamic behaviour of the building and heating system. During the test periods, the controller managed the total operational costs of the heat pump’s electricity consumption and achieved a prediction performance of Root Mean Square Error between 0.17 and 0.22 kWh. To show the provision of demand flexibility, key performance indicators were quantified according to the categories 1) energy and power, 2) energy efficiency, and 3) energy costs. We introduce this categorization to present the benefits of using flexibility indicators along with conventional performance indicators in real-life applications.},

The MPC consists of a whole building optimization for energy that is supplemented with a zone operative temperature (ZOT) comfort metric. A ZOT based metric was used to evaluate thermal comfort, as traditional air temperature metrics neglect radiative impacts on comfort. The comfort metric is employed after the energy optimization to ensure comfort is the highest priority and maintained in each zone. A final layer of occupant feedback is incorporated to allow for users to provide feedback as to their comfort level and allow for changes in the comfort temperature range for their space. A four-month experimental test period shows a 29\% HVAC electric energy reduction and a 63\% thermal energy reduction compared to previous years for the same time period.},

	abstract = {Active latent heat storage (ALHS) involving phase-change materials constitutes a promising energy-efficient solution for building energy management (BEM) by reshaping building energy demands without occupant comfort degradation. Current BEM systems based on conventional reactive control lack the level of control delicacy required to exploit the full potential of ALHS for BEM under certain conditions, such as highly dynamic electricity prices. This study proposes a smart model predictive control (MPC) approach for BEM to minimize the energy cost while maintaining the indoor climate by fully applying ALHS. More specifically, a reduced-order, high-fidelity state-space model (SSM) of ALHS is proposed for fast building control. An MPC framework considering highly dynamic electricity prices and ALHS dynamics is developed based on the proposed ALHS SSM integrated with a building SSM. A case study entailing a set of simulations is designed based on a single-family house with a space heating system, including an ALHS, ground source heat pump, and radiator. The proposed MPC approach, compared to conventional reactive control, enables substantial reductions in the electricity cost (ranging from 53.2\% to 122.7\% depending on the MPC settings and ALHS capacity), even financial gains under certain scenarios. Further analysis reveals that coupling ALHS with MPC is critical to ensure that ALHS adoption is economically convincing: while conventional reactive control of an ALHS-equipped building increases the electricity cost, an MPC-enabled building could reduce the electricity cost by 45.1\% due to ALHS adoption. The proposed MPC approach also exhibits promising feasibility for real-world BEM applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper a mixed-integer model predictive controller for hybrid energy supply systems in buildings is presented. This approach is based on a hierarchical building control concept where the energy supply level is coupled to the energy consumption level only by the heat load. The supply level is characterized by non-linear dynamics due to a stratified water storage tank and a switched heat pump with minimum on/off times. The mixed-integer model predictive controller optimizes the unit commitment problem at minimum costs while satisfying the consumption level’s predicted heat load. The hybrid system is formulated as a piecewise affine model comprising continuous and discrete system inputs. Moreover, the proposed controller is able to manage the stratified storage tank including switching sequences of the heat pump with respect to energy price forecasts. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by a comparison to a model predictive controller with an a priori fixed operation mode profile, where the heat pump is only operating at night, and discussing the effect of the variation of the stratified storage tank size. The proposed concept is able to flexibly manage all sizes of stratified storage tanks with better performance than the reference control strategy, which is only effective for larger tanks. Additionally, a robustness analyses demonstrates that the mixed-integer model predictive controller can handle errors in the heat load prediction from the consumption level. Both analyses show promising results for the practical use of the proposed controller within the hierarchical control concept or as a control module in a similar but more general application.},

In particular, a practically effective and computationally efficient model predictive control algorithm is proposed to optimize building energy usage while maintaining thermal comfort in a multi-zone medium-sized commercial building. This article has two themes. Driven by the challenge of fully evaluating the benefit of the proposed model predictive controller against baseline control, a model predictive control design framework is first presented with its performance benchmarked based on a high-fidelity building HVAC simulation environment to verify its effectiveness and feasibility. Following the same model predictive control design framework, the experimental results from the same building located at the Philadelphia Navy Yard are then presented. For the simulation study, the performance of the model predictive control algorithm was estimated relative to baseline days with exactly the same internal loads and outdoor conditions, and it was estimated that model predictive control reduced the total electrical energy consumption by around 17.5\%. For the subsequent experimental demonstration, the performance of the model predictive control algorithm was estimated relative to baseline days with similar outdoor air temperature patterns during the cooling and shoulder seasons, and it was concluded that model predictive control reduced the total electrical energy consumption by more than 20\% on average while improving thermal comfort in terms of zone air temperature.},

	abstract = {Small and medium-sized commercial buildings (SMCB) are significant demand response resources, and it is important to develop grid-responsive control algorithms that exploit those resources and create financial benefits for building owners and HVAC service providers. Furthermore, unlike large-sized commercial buildings, there is an opportunity to have universally applicable control solutions for many SMCBs since those buildings have a consistent HVAC system configuration: SMCBs are commonly served by multiple-staged air conditioning units controlled by their own thermostats. Despite the demand response potential and scalability, however, very few control solutions are available for SMCBs. Typical model predictive control (MPC) and heuristic control approaches for cooling load shifting that lower thermostat setpoints before an electric price jump are suitable mainly for large-sized commercial buildings where a continuous capacity modulation is possible, e.g., via dampers in variable air volume terminal units. However, those approaches can cause undesired, high peaks for SMCBs due to the nature of ON/OFF unit staging and narrow thermostat deadbands. This could discourage the use of advanced grid-responsive controls for SMCBs due to the concern of high demand charges, and has to be resolved. This paper presents a MPC solution that overcomes this challenge. It has a hierarchical MPC structure where an upper level MPC is responsible for electrical load shifting in response to an electric price signal while a lower level MPC is responsible for coordinating compressor stages to eliminate unnecessary peaks and follows the setpoints determined by the upper level MPC. Two one-month, comprehensive laboratory tests have been carried out to demonstrate load shifting and cost savings for the algorithm. Interesting trade-offs between energy efficiency and load flexibility were observed and are discussed, and lessons learned for applying MPCs for SMCBs are also presented.},

	abstract = {Residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems usually employ on/off controllers to regulate the temperature. Generally, there is no supervisory controller which can use the weather forecast and electricity time of use (TOU) price information to reduce the overall operating cost of the equipment. Lack of a supervisory controller results in higher operating costs of the HVAC system. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) based supervisory controller is designed to shift the heating and cooling load of a house to off-peak hours. Supervisory MPC generates the temperature set-points trajectory for on/off controllers. The approach was verified through extensive experiments in an experimental archetype house. By employing the supervisory controller with variable set-points 16\% cost savings were obtained when compared to the fixed zone temperature set-points at 25°C. More significant savings of about 50\% were seen when MPC-based centralized controller was compared with the fixed zone temperature set-points of 24°C.},

We present conditions and an algorithm that ensures minimum run-time requirements in linear MPC. The control performance for a heating application is compared to linear MPC with rule-based post-processing and hybrid MPC. The results show that our approach ensures the up-and down-time requirements at a high control performance and is significantly faster than hybrid MPC.},

Buildings equipped with electric heating systems can provide demand-response services because their electricity consumption is inherently flexible due to their thermal inertia. This paper reports on the results of a large-scale demand-response demonstration involving a population of more than 300 residential buildings with heat pumps. Based on a procedure to autonomously estimate the electric flexibility of individual systems from energy meter data and outdoor air temperature measurements, we show how the aggregate demand-response potential of the systems can be quantified and predicted. The results of various experiments illustrate that load reductions of 40–65\% of the total load can be achieved by throttling the heat pumps, and that these load reductions can be delivered precisely with a median absolute percentage error of below 7\%. In addition, a rebound damping strategy is proposed that was shown to reduce the peak rebound power by 50\% in practice.},

	abstract = {Hot water heat pumps are well suited for demand side management, as the heat pump market faced a rapid growth in the past years with the trend to decentralized domestic hot water use. Sales were accelerated through wants and needs of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and less restrictive rules regarding Legionella. While in literature the model predictive control potential for heat pumps is commonly shown in simulations, the share of experimental studies is relatively low. To this day, experimental studies considering solely domestic hot water use are not available. In this paper, the realistic achievable model predictive control potential of a hot water heat pump is compared to the standard hysteresis control, to provide an experimental proof. We show for the first time, how state-of-the-art approaches (model predictive control, system identification, live state estimation, and demand prediction) can be transferred from electric hot water heaters to hot water heat pumps, combined, and implemented into a real-world hot water heat pump setup. The optimization approach, embedded in a realistic experimental setting, leads to a decrease in electric energy demand and cost per unit electricity by approximately 12\% and 14\%, respectively. Further, an increase in efficiency by approximately 13\% has been achieved.},

	abstract = {Active latent heat storage (ALHS) involving phase-change materials constitutes a promising energy-efficient solution for building energy management (BEM) by reshaping building energy demands without occupant comfort degradation. Current BEM systems based on conventional reactive control lack the level of control delicacy required to exploit the full potential of ALHS for BEM under certain conditions, such as highly dynamic electricity prices. This study proposes a smart model predictive control (MPC) approach for BEM to minimize the energy cost while maintaining the indoor climate by fully applying ALHS. More specifically, a reduced-order, high-fidelity state-space model (SSM) of ALHS is proposed for fast building control. An MPC framework considering highly dynamic electricity prices and ALHS dynamics is developed based on the proposed ALHS SSM integrated with a building SSM. A case study entailing a set of simulations is designed based on a single-family house with a space heating system, including an ALHS, ground source heat pump, and radiator. The proposed MPC approach, compared to conventional reactive control, enables substantial reductions in the electricity cost (ranging from 53.2\% to 122.7\% depending on the MPC settings and ALHS capacity), even financial gains under certain scenarios. Further analysis reveals that coupling ALHS with MPC is critical to ensure that ALHS adoption is economically convincing: while conventional reactive control of an ALHS-equipped building increases the electricity cost, an MPC-enabled building could reduce the electricity cost by 45.1\% due to ALHS adoption. The proposed MPC approach also exhibits promising feasibility for real-world BEM applications.},

	abstract = {Cost-effective energy storage is a critical enabler for the large-scale deployment of renewable electricity. Significant resources have been directed toward developing cost-effective energy storage, with research and development efforts dominated by work on lithium ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Though Li-ion batteries have many attractive qualities, it is not clear whether they can provide an affordable levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for certain applications, such as buildings. Buildings consume most of the world's electricity, and as much as 50\% of their consumption goes toward meeting thermal loads. Thermal energy storage (TES) can provide a cost-effective alternative to Li-ion batteries for buildings; however, two questions remain to be answered. First, how much of total building energy storage requirements can be met via thermal storage for building loads? Second, can the LCOS for TES be favorable compared with Li-ion batteries? In this perspective, using the United States as a case study, we show that the total requirement for TES in buildings is in the range of ∼1200–4500 electrical GW h, depending on the fraction of solar versus wind in the generation mix. Furthermore, we show that with at least 25\% wind generation, all of the storage needed by buildings to support the grid can be met by TES. We also introduce a framework to calculate LCOS for on-site TES in buildings to enable a direct comparison with electrical storage technologies such as Li-ion batteries. This is not trivial, because the input energy type for TES (electricity) differs from the output energy type (thermal energy), and the efficiency can depend on ambient conditions. Our LCOS analysis shows that in many situations, TES can be more cost-effective for buildings than Li-ion batteries. We conclude our perspective by discussing future research and development opportunities that can significantly advance the deployment of TES for buildings to help enable a renewable electricity-dependent grid.},

	abstract = {While model predictive control (MPC) is a widely studied tool for integrating residential heat pumps with the smart grid, modeling difficulties and hardware requirements are significant barriers to adoption. In response, we present a nonintrusive plug-and-play methodology for model identification and model predictive control using only two increasingly popular smart-home devices: a smart thermostat and smart electricity meter, which makes the overall approach highly scalable. However, this minimal hardware approach requires new methods to overcome modeling challenges due to the lack of data diversity. A data-driven heat pump power model is identified without the need for submetering by using energy disaggregation. By incorporating the heat pump control data from the smart thermostat, we provide implicit load classification data to the model, substantially simplifying the signal decomposition task. Building and heat pump model parameters are then identified by a novel algorithm that combats overfitting caused by limited state excitation. Finally, we show the advantage of this scalable approach in an aggregate model predictive controller enabled by the communication ability provided by the smart thermostat. Results show that this aggregate control approach can provide improved grid services, such as reduced peak demand, while at the same time reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort. The proposed method has the potential to greatly lower the barrier for residential energy aggregation.},

	abstract = {Building performance simulation (BPS) is a powerful tool for engineers working in building design and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. Many case studies using BPS investigate the potential of demand response (DR) measures with heat pumps. However, the models are often simplified for the components of the heat pump system (i.e. heat pump, electric auxiliary heater and storage tank) and for their interactions. These simplifications may lead to significant differences in terms of DR performance so that more comprehensive models for a heat pump system may be necessary. The contribution of this work is twofold. Firstly, this work investigates the influence of the modeling complexity of the heat pump control on different key performance indicators for the energy efficiency, the DR potential and the heat pump operation. To this end, the performance of six different heat pump controls is compared. Secondly, it describes the implementation of a comprehensive control for a heat pump system in BPS tools. This control is not often documented in the BPS literature and is error-prone. Generic pseudo-codes are provided, whereas IDA ICE is taken as an example in the case study. A predictive rule-based control is implemented to study price-based DR of residential heating. It is shown that a realistic operation of the heat pump system can be achieved using the proposed modeling approach. The results prove that the modeling complexity of the system control has a significant impact on the performance indicators, meaning that this aspect should not be overlooked. For some performance indicators, e.g. the annual energy use for heating and average water tank temperature, it is shown that a proportional (P-) and proportional-integral (PI-) control can lead to similar results. If the heat pump operation is investigated in detail and a short-time resolution is required, the difference between P- and PI-controls and their tuning is important. As long as the heat pump operation and electrical power at short timescales are not of importance, the choice of controller (P or PI) is not crucial. However, the use of P-control significantly simplifies the modeling work compared to PI-control. If DR is performed for domestic hot water, it is also demonstrated that the prioritization of domestic hot water heating can indirectly influence the operation of auxiliary heaters for space-heating, significantly increasing the use of electricity. However, the electricity use is only slightly increased if DR control is only used for space heating.},

	abstract = {This work presents a whole-year simulation study on nonlinear mixed-integer Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a complex thermal energy supply system which consists of a heat pump, stratified water storages, free cooling facilities, and a large underground thermal storage. For solution of the arising Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programs (MINLPs) we apply an existing general and optimal-control-suitable decomposition approach. To compensate deviation of forecast inputs from measured disturbances, we introduce a moving horizon estimation step within the MPC strategy. The MPC performance for this study, which consists of more than 50,000 real-time suitable MINLP solutions, is compared to an elaborate conventional control strategy for the system. It is shown that MPC can significantly reduce the yearly energy consumption while providing a similar degree of constraint satisfaction, and autonomously identify previously unknown, beneficial operation modes.},

	abstract = {Incorporating phase-change material (PCM) wallboards into building envelopes can help reduce electricity costs associated with heating and enhance demand flexibility in dynamic building energy management in response to electricity price volatility. The conventional control strategies adopted in current building energy management systems are ‘reactive’ in nature, hence, they are not ready to exploit the full potential of PCM wallboards for price-based, demand-responsive building control applications. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) framework for price-based, demand-responsive control of PCM-wallboard-enhanced space heating systems to minimize electricity costs and maximize demand flexibility by fully exploiting PCM wallboards. A high-fidelity, linear PCM wallboard and building thermodynamics model are developed for computationally efficient building control. The model is then incorporated into an MPC framework considering the PCM wallboard dynamics and dynamic electricity prices. A simulation case study is conducted for a single-family house employing the proposed MPC approach to control its space heating system. Compared to conventional control, the MPC approach reduces space heating electricity costs by more than 60 \%. The MPC approach also shifts more than 80 \% of peak heating loads to off-peak periods, much higher than conventional control achieves (less than40 \%). The simulation results also show good synergistic benefits of MPC in fully exploiting PCM wallboards in optimizing building space heating operation: achieving additional 31.1 \% electricity cost savings and 38.7 \% peak load shifting than without leveraging PCM wallboards. In contrast, conventional control cannot achieve such synergistic benefits. The proposed MPC framework is also proven computationally viable for real-time building control.},

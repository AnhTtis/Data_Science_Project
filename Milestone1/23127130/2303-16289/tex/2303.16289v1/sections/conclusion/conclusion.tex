\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}
During this study an implementation oriented, price-responsive \MPC\ controller has been tested on a commercial \hp, over the course of four months in the winter 2022-2023. The results show that \loadshifting\ can reduce heating costs by at least \comfThreeCostPerc\%, only by activating the heat capacity of the building structure and without reducing the indoor temperature. The production patterns have been shifted to support the grid through increased consumption at night and by shutting the \hp\ down in the \cookingPeak. Further, it has been established that under the current danish price scheme the \cookingPeak\ is the decisive cost factor, and about \percPeakSave\% of the savings provided by the \MPC\ can be obtained just by blocking the \hp\ in the \cookingPeak. Full or partial shutdown in the \cookingPeak should immediately be broadly implemented. This rule creates correlated consumption patterns, which might become problematic for the grid later. In case the grid operators wish to use more coordinated approach controllers of the type presented here are needed, but, at the moment the cost reduction obtained from price responsiveness cannot cover the costs of acquiring such capabilities, so more financial incentive needs to be provided.

The ambient temperature overwrite applied to control the heat flow of the \hp\ has proven to be a functional but inefficient way to make the it \smartGrid-ready. A dedicated input for reference control as a standard is to be desired if advanced control of \hp s should be the norm. 

Several publications have suggested that the upper layer, in a hierarchical control structure can be controlled using a building model having only one heating zone without degrading indoor comfort. We can report that the results presented here support this idea. Although, it has to be mentioned that the highly insulated shell of the house might me a large contributor.

Future work is to automate the process of gathering quality data from the sensors and apply an update the models for building, \hp\ and \pv\ regularly. The next natural step for the \MPC\ is to upgrade the \hp\ retrofit to include control of domestic hot water production which, at this moment, is a randomly occurring process, often taking place in the \cookingPeak.% Further, the house should be equipped with a battery to study the difference between this \MPC\ and one which features an energy storage medium.

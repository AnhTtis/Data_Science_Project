\subsection{Photovoltaic power forecast}
\label{sec_pv_model}
The forecast model for the power output of the photovoltaic panels (\pv) is based on the data from the weather forecast service Yr.no \cite{yr} and measured historical time series of the power output from the \pv. In this work it is chosen to be a regression expression, although the model for the predicted \pv\ output could in principle be any suitable non-linear model (neural network, decision tree, etc.) since the produced electricity is not dependent on any influenceable variables.

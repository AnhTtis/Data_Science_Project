    "abstract": "Constraining the approach direction of grasps is important when picking objects in confined spaces, such as when emptying a shelf. Yet, such capabilities are not available in state-of-the-art data-driven grasp sampling methods that sample grasps all around the object. In this work, we address the specific problem of training approach-constrained data-driven grasp samplers and how to generate good grasping directions automatically. Our solution is GoNet: a generative grasp sampler that can constrain the grasp approach direction to lie close to a specified direction. This is achieved by discretizing SO(3) into bins and training GoNet to generate grasps from those bins. At run-time, the bin aligning with the second largest principal component of the observed point cloud is selected. GoNet is benchmarked against GraspNet, a state-of-the-art unconstrained grasp sampler, in an unconfined grasping experiment in simulation and on an unconfined and confined grasping experiment in the real world. The results demonstrate that GoNet achieves higher success-over-coverage in simulation and a 12%-18% higher success rate in real-world table-picking and shelf-picking tasks than the baseline.",

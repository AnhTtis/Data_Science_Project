\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:problem}

In this work, we address the problem of synthesizing successful (S=1) parallel-jaw grasps $\matr{G}$ on partially observed object point clouds $\matr{O} \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{N}\times 3}$ where the approach directions $\Vec{a} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ of the grasps are constrained to a subset $\text{C}\subset \mathrm{SO}(3)$ of the rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. Mathematically, the objective is to learn the joint distribution $\prob{(\matr{G}, \text{S}=1 | \matr{O}, \text{C})}$. 

If we assume that the success of a grasp $\text{S}$ is conditionally independent of $\text{C}$ given $\matr{G}$, we can factorize the joint distribution into $\prob{(\text{S}=1 | \matr{G}, \matr{O})}\prob{(\matr{G}|\matr{O}, \text{C})}$, where the first distribution $\prob{(\text{S}=1 | \matr{G}, \matr{O})}$ is a grasp discriminator and the second $\prob{(\matr{G}|\matr{O}, \text{C})}$ is a grasp generator. We approximate these distributions with separate \acp{dnn} $\mathcal{Q}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\matr{G}|\matr{O}, \text{C})\approx \prob{(\matr{G}|\matr{O}, \text{C})}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}(\text{S}=1 | \matr{G}, \matr{O}) \approx \prob{(\text{S}=1 | \matr{G}, \matr{O})}$, each with their own trainable parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\psi}$. 

%The goal of this work then becomes to design these networks to best fit to grasping data. 

Central to both networks are the 6-D grasp poses $\matr{G}$. In this work, we represent grasp poses $\matr{G}=[\matr{R}, \matr{T}]\in \mathbb{R}^7$ by a rotation $\matr{R}$ expressed as a 4-D quaternion and a translation $\matr{T}$ expressed as a 3-D vector. It is possible to  further decompose the rotation component $\matr{R}$ as visualized in \figref{fig:yaw-pitch-cam} into a unit length approach vector $\Vec{a}\in \mathbb{R}^3$ and a hand orientation angle $\alpha$ or, in terms of Euler angles, as a roll ($\alpha$), pitch ($\beta$) and yaw ($\gamma$) angle. Out of these components, the approach vector (pitch and yaw angles) is explicitly constrained by C, while the hand orientation (roll angle) is learned.

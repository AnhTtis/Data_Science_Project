\section{conclusion}

We proposed \methodname{}, the first \ac{dl}-based data-driven grasp sampler capable of generating approach-constrained grasps in all of $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and a geometrical method to extract the specific grasp approach directions automatically from the object's \pc{}. In both simulation and real-world experiments, \methodname{} achieved an 8--18\% higher grasp success rate and kept more than 7 times as many grasps than an unconstrained data-driven grasp sampler. Especially the real-world shelf-picking experiment demonstrated \methodname{}'s ability to pick from confined spaces, highlighting the benefits of constraining the grasp approach directions to collision-free directions instead of sampling all around the object. 

We envision \methodname{} to be able to generate not only approach-constrained grasps but also pose-constrained ones, such as only reachable grasps or grasps with high manipulability. However, to reach those goals, we believe that the discrete constraint needs to be replaced with a continuous one and that the orientation constraints should be combined with the position constraint proposed in \cite{lundell2023constrained}, both of which are non-trivial but exciting future work directions.

%Grasping from confined spaces where the environment poses constraint on the possible grasps is challenging...
This work addresses the problem of learning approach-constrained data-driven grasp samplers. To this end, we propose \methodname{}: a generative grasp sampler that can constrain the grasp approach direction to a subset of $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. The key insight is to discretize $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ into a predefined number of bins and train \methodname{} to generate grasps whose approach directions are within those bins.  At run-time, the bin aligning with the second largest principal component of the observed \pc{} is selected. \methodname{} is benchmarked against \graspnet{}, a \sota{} unconstrained grasp sampler, in an unconfined grasping experiment in simulation and on an unconfined and confined grasping experiment in the real world. The results demonstrate that \methodname{} achieves higher success-over-coverage in simulation and a 12\%--18\% higher success rate in real-world table-picking and shelf-picking tasks than the baseline.

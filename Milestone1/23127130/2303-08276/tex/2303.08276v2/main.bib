Signatures of the transition are present in the interfacial mechanics{,} the domain geometry{,} and the domain statistics{,} thus linking all three fields of study. This transition persists for all cell size distributions{,} but its exact position is crucially dependent on fluctuations in the parameter values of the functional (quenched disorder). The magnitude of fluctuations can be matched to the observed shape distribution of cells{,} so that visual observation of cell shapes and statistics provides information about the mechanical state of the tissue. Comparing with experimental data from the Cucumis epidermis{,} we find that the system is located right at the transition{,} allowing the tissue to relieve most of the local stress while maintaining integrity."}

Here, we revisit the concept that CIL plays a central role in the migration of single cells and in collective migration, during both health and disease. Importantly, malignant cells exhibit a diminished CIL behaviour which allows them to invade healthy tissues. Accumulating evidence indicates that CIL occurs in vivo and that regulation of small Rho GTPases is important in the collapse of cell protrusions upon cell contact, the first step of CIL. Finally, we propose possible cell surface proteins that could be involved in the initial contact that regulates Rho GTPases during CIL.}

abstract = {Collective cell migration in tissues occurs throughout embryonic development, during wound healing, and in cancerous tumor invasion, yet most detailed knowledge of cell migration comes from single-cell studies. As single cells migrate, the shape of the cell body fluctuates dramatically through cyclic processes of extension, adhesion, and retraction, accompanied by erratic changes in migration direction. Within confluent cell layers, such subcellular motions must be coupled between neighbors, yet the influence of these subcellular motions on collective migration is not known. Here we study motion within a confluent epithelial cell sheet, simultaneously measuring collective migration and subcellular motions, covering a broad range of length scales, time scales, and cell densities. At large length scales and time scales collective migration slows as cell density rises, yet the fastest cells move in large, multicell groups whose scale grows with increasing cell density. This behavior has an intriguing analogy to dynamic heterogeneities found in particulate systems as they become more crowded and approach a glass transition. In addition we find a diminishing self-diffusivity of short-wavelength motions within the cell layer, and growing peaks in the vibrational density of states associated with cooperative cell-shape fluctuations. Both of these observations are also intriguingly reminiscent of a glass transition. Thus, these results provide a broad and suggestive analogy between cell motion within a confluent layer and the dynamics of supercooled colloidal and molecular fluids approaching a glass transition.}}

ABSTRACT={The healthy and mature epithelial layer is ordinarily quiescent, non-migratory, solid-like, and jammed. However, in a variety of circumstances the layer transitions to a phase that is dynamic, migratory, fluid-like and unjammed. This has been demonstrated in the developing embryo, the developing avian airway, the epithelial layer reconstituted in vitro from asthmatic donors, wounding, and exposure to mechanical stress. Here we examine the extent to which ionizing radiation might similarly provoke epithelial layer unjamming. We exposed primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells maintained in air-liquid interface (ALI) to sub-therapeutic doses (1 Gy) of ionizing radiation (IR). We first assessed: (1) DNA damage by measuring p-H2AX, (2) the integrity of the epithelial layer by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and (3) the extent of epithelial cell differentiation by detecting markers of differentiated airway epithelial cells. As expected, IR exposure induced DNA damage but, surprisingly, disrupted neither normal differentiation nor the integrity of the epithelial cell layer. We then measured cell shape and cellular migration to determine the extent of the unjamming transition (UJT). IR caused cell shape elongation and increased cellular motility, both of which are hallmarks of the UJT as previously confirmed. To understand the mechanism of IR-induced UJT, we inhibited TGF-β receptor activity, and found that migratory responses were attenuated. Together, these observations show that IR can provoke epithelial layer unjamming in a TGF-β receptor-dependent manner.}

Morphogenetic cell rearrangements such as cell sorting and mutual tissue spreading have been compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which they closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been proposed that tissues behave as liquids and possess a characteristic surface tension, which arises as a collective, macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering cells. But how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories have been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties such as cell–cell adhesion and contractility of cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface tensions. Although recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on these mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show explicitly that the ratio of adhesion to cortical tension determines tissue surface tension. Our minimal model successfully explains the available experimental data and makes predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical energy and geometry, about the shapes of aggregate surface cells, which we verify experimentally. This model indicates that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio between these two quantities.}, number={28}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Manning, M.

	abstract = {Using a self-propelled Voronoi model of epithelia known to predict a liquid{\textendash}solid transition, we examine the interplay between cell motility and cell shape, tuned by cortex contractility and cell{\textendash}cell adhesion, in controlling the mechanical properties of tissue. Our work provides a unifying framework for existing, seemingly distinct notions of stress in tissues and relates stresses to material properties. In particular, we show that the temporal correlation function of shear stresses can be used to define an effective tissue viscosity that diverges at the liquid{\textendash}solid transition. This finding suggests a unique way of analyzing traction force microscopy data that may provide information on tissue rheology.Collective cell migration is a highly regulated process involved in wound healing, cancer metastasis, and morphogenesis. Mechanical interactions among cells provide an important regulatory mechanism to coordinate such collective motion. Using a self-propelled Voronoi (SPV) model that links cell mechanics to cell shape and cell motility, we formulate a generalized mechanical inference method to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of cellular stresses from measured traction forces in motile tissues and show that such traction-based stresses match those calculated from instantaneous cell shapes. We additionally use stress information to characterize the rheological properties of the tissue. We identify a motility-induced swim stress that adds to the interaction stress to determine the global contractility or extensibility of epithelia. We further show that the temporal correlation of the interaction shear stress determines an effective viscosity of the tissue that diverges at the liquid{\textendash}solid transition, suggesting the possibility of extracting rheological information directly from traction data.},

Here, we find that, while expanding with an edge speed independent of initial conditions, millimeter-scale epithelial monolayers exhibit internal patterns of proliferation and migration that depend not on the current but on the initial tissue size, indicating memory effects. Specifically, the core of large tissues becomes very dense, almost quiescent, and ceases cell-cycle progression. In contrast, initially-smaller tissues develop a local minimum of cell density and a tissue-spanning vortex. To explain vortex formation, we propose an active polar fluid model with a feedback between cell polarization and tissue flow. Taken together, our findings suggest that expanding epithelia decouple their internal and edge regions, which enables robust expansion dynamics despite the presence of size- and history-dependent patterns in the tissue interior.            ,              Cells do not exist in isolation. Instead, they form tissues, where individual cells make contact with their neighbors and form microscopic ‘architectures’. Epithelia are a type of tissue where cells are arranged in flat sheets, and are found in organs such as the lining of the kidney or the skin.              Tissues need to grow, especially early in life. If tissues are damaged – for example, if the skin is cut or grazed – cells also need to divide (to create new healthy cells) and move as a group (to close the wound). Such coordinated motions result in cells exhibiting distinct group behaviors, similar to those observed within crowds of people or schools of fish. If coordination breaks down, problems can happen such as uncoordinated tissue growth seen in cancer.              However, how cell movements are coordinated is still not fully understand. For example, researchers know that cells’ positions within a group can determine how they behave, meaning that even the same type of cell could behave differently at the edge or center of a tissue. This suggests that the initial size and shape of a tissue should influence its subsequent growth and behavior; however, the nature of this influence is still largely unknown. Heinrich et al. therefore wanted to determine the differences in the way larger and smaller tissues grow.              Microscope imaging was used to track the growth of circular, artificial tissues made from single-layered sheets of dog kidney cells grown in the laboratory. Comparing how quickly the tissues expanded revealed that the area of tissue circles that started out smaller increased at a much faster rate than that of tissue circles that were larger to begin with. This turned out to be because the edges of the tissues grew at a constant speed, independent of their initial size or shape, but circles with a smaller area have a larger proportion of cells on their edges. The motions of the cells at the center of the tissues had no effect on how the edges of the tissue grew. A final observation was that the way tissues of a given size behaved depended on whether they had grown to be that size, or they started off that big.              These results shed light on how groups of cells interact in growing tissues. In the future, this information could be used to predict how different tissues grow over time, potentially helping scientists engineer better artificial tissues or organs for transplantation.}, journal={eLife}, author={Heinrich, Matthew A and Alert, Ricard and LaChance, Julienne M and Zajdel, Tom J and Košmrlj, Andrej and Cohen, Daniel J}, year={2020}, month={Aug}, pages={e58945}, language={en} }

Although many of the molecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth is still poorly understood. A simple form of inhibition of cell proliferation is encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures and is known as “contact inhibition.” The study presented here provides a quantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and single cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells we demonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows inhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local expansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and cell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change across the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing cell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising through reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of cell size, and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area falls below a critical value. We also present a simple computational model of growth mechanics which captures all aspects of the observed behavior. Our measurements and analysis show that contact inhibition is a consequence of mechanical interaction and constraint rather than interfacial contact alone, and define quantitative phenotypes that can guide future studies of molecular mechanisms underlying contact inhibition.}, number={3}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Puliafito, Alberto and Hufnagel, Lars and Neveu, Pierre and Streichan, Sebastian and Sigal, Alex and Fygenson, D.

The corresponding increase in cell density can result in arrested motion, analogous to the “jamming” of soft materials such as glasses and gels. Here, we show that cells with reduced motility and proliferation organize into branching clusters, reminiscent of aggregation in nonliving colloidal particles. Subsequently, “leader cells” guide collective migration to link clusters together into spanning networks. These arrested dynamics occur at unusually low density and are reminiscent of gelation. Furthermore, increased motility and proliferation recover a glass-like transition at higher density. Overall, arrested motion in living cells has striking similarities with nonliving colloidal particles, suggesting physical signatures of clustering and branching morphogenesis in development and disease.            ,                              Migratory cells transition between dispersed individuals and multicellular collectives during development, wound healing, and cancer. These transitions are associated with coordinated behaviors as well as arrested motility at high cell densities, but remain poorly understood at lower cell densities. Here, we show that dispersed mammary epithelial cells organize into arrested, fractal-like clusters at low density in reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF). These clusters exhibit a branched architecture with a fractal dimension of Df=1.7 reminiscent of diffusion-limited aggregation of nonliving colloidal particles. First, cells display diminished motility in reduced EGF, which permits irreversible adhesion upon cell–cell contact. Subsequently, leader cells emerge that guide collectively migrating strands and connect clusters into space-filling networks. Thus, this living system exhibits gelation-like arrest at low cell densities, analogous to the glass-like arrest of epithelial monolayers at high cell densities. We quantitatively capture these behaviors with a jamming-like phase diagram based on local cell density and EGF. These individual to collective transitions represent an intriguing link between living and nonliving systems, with potential relevance for epithelial morphogenesis into branched architectures.}, number={35}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Leggett, Susan E. and Neronha, Zachary J. and Bhaskar, Dhananjay and Sim, Jea Yun and Perdikari, Theodora Myrto and Wong, Ian Y.}, year={2019}, month={Aug}, pages={17298–17306}, language={en} }

abstract={From coffee beans flowing in a chute to cells remodelling in a living tissue, a wide variety of close-packed collective systems-- both inert and living--have the potential to jam. The collective can sometimes flow like a fluid or jam and rigidify like a solid. The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly understood, however, and structural properties characterizing these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly, the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell-cell adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural signature for classification and investigation of bronchial epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics play a prominent role.},

  abstract  = {The traditional picture of tissues, where they are treated as liquids defined by properties such as surface tension or viscosity has been redefined during the last few decades by the more fundamental question: under which conditions do tissues display liquid-like or solid-like behaviour? As a result, basic concepts arising from the treatment of tissues as solid matter, such as cellular jamming and glassy tissues, have shifted into the current focus of biophysical research. Here, we review recent works examining the phase states of tissue with an emphasis on jamming transitions in cancer. When metastasis occurs, cells gain the ability to leave the primary tumour and infiltrate other parts of the body. Recent studies have shown that a linkage between an unjamming transition and tumour progression indeed exists, which could be of importance when designing surgery and treatment approaches for cancer patients.},

abstract={Plasticity of cancer invasion and metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells to switch between collective and single-cell dissemination, controlled by cadherin-mediated cell--cell junctions. In clinical samples, E-cadherin-expressing and -deficient tumours both invade collectively and metastasize equally, implicating additional mechanisms controlling cell--cell cooperation and individualization. Here, using spatially defined organotypic culture, intravital microscopy of mammary tumours in mice and in silico modelling, we identify cell density regulation by three-dimensional tissue boundaries to physically control collective movement irrespective of the composition and stability of cell--cell junctions. Deregulation of adherens junctions by downregulation of E-cadherin and p120-catenin resulted in a transition from coordinated to uncoordinated collective movement along extracellular boundaries, whereas single-cell escape depended on locally free tissue space. These results indicate that cadherins and extracellular matrix confinement cooperate to determine unjamming transitions and stepwise epithelial fluidization towards, ultimately, cell individualization.},

    abstract = "{During development, cells often switch between static and migratory behaviours. Such transitions are fundamental events in development and are linked to harmful consequences in pathology. It has long been considered that epithelial cells either migrate collectively as epithelial cells, or undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migrate as individual mesenchymal cells. Here, we assess what is currently known about in vivo cell migratory phenomena and hypothesise that such migratory behaviours do not fit into alternative and mutually exclusive categories. Rather, we propose that these categories can be viewed as the most extreme cases of a general continuum of morphological variety, with cells harbouring different degrees or combinations of epithelial and mesenchymal features and displaying an array of migratory behaviours.}",

abstract = {The origins of the mesenchymal cells participating in tissue repair and pathological processes, notably tissue fibrosis, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis, are poorly understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) represent one important source of these cells. As we discuss here, processes similar to the EMTs associated with embryo implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development are appropriated and subverted by chronically inflamed tissues and neoplasias. The identification of the signaling pathways that lead to activation of EMT programs during these disease processes is providing new insights into the plasticity of cellular phenotypes and possible therapeutic interventions.},

    abstract = { Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are complex cellular processes where cells undergo dramatic changes in signaling, transcriptional programming, and cell shape, while directing the exit of cells from the epithelium and promoting migratory properties of the resulting mesenchyme. EMTs are essential for morphogenesis during development and are also a critical step in cancer progression and metastasis formation. Here we provide an overview of the molecular regulation of the EMT process during embryo development, focusing on chick and mouse gastrulation and neural crest development. We go on to describe how EMT regulators participate in the progression of pancreatic and breast cancer in mouse models, and discuss the parallels with developmental EMTs and how these help to understand cancer EMTs. We also highlight the differences between EMTs in tumor and in development to arrive at a broader view of cancer EMT. We conclude by discussing how further advances in the field will rely on in vivo dynamic imaging of the cellular events of EMT. }

journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {Cells have traditionally been viewed either as independently moving entities or as somewhat static parts of tissues. However, it is now clear that in many cases, multiple cells coordinate their motions and move as collective entities. Well-studied examples comprise development events, as well as physiological and pathological situations. Different ex vivo model systems have also been investigated. Several recent advances have taken place at the interface between biology and physics, and have benefitted from progress in imaging and microscopy, from the use of microfabrication techniques, as well as from the introduction of quantitative tools and models. We review these interesting developments in quantitative cell biology that also provide rich examples of collective out-of-equilibrium motion.}

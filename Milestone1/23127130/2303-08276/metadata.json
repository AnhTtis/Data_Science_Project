    "abstract": "We introduce an active version of the recently proposed finite Voronoi model of epithelial tissue. The resultant Active Finite Voronoi (AFV) model enables the study of both confluent and non-confluent geometries and transitions between them, in the presence of active cells. Our results indicate a rich phase diagram which unifies the study of the route to collective motility via unjamming with the study of motility enabled by EMT, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This approach should prove useful for issues arising in both developmental biology systems and during cancer metastasis.",

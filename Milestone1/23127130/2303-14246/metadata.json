    "abstract": "The widely used experimental technique of continuous-wave detection assumes counting pulses of photocurrent from a click-type detector inside a given measurement time window. With such a procedure we miss out the photons detected after each photocurrent pulse during the detector dead time. Additionally, each pulse may initialize so-called afterpulse, which is not associated with the real photons. We derive the corresponding quantum photocounting formula and experimentally verify its validity. Statistics of photocurrent pulses appears to be nonlinear with respect to quantum state, which is explained by the memory effect of the previous measurement time windows. Expressions -- in general, nonlinear -- connecting statistics of photons and pulses are derived for different measurement scenarios. We also consider an application of the obtained results to quantum state reconstruction with unbalanced homodyne detection.",

    "abstract": "Helly's selection theorem provides a criterion for compactness of sets of single-variable functions with bounded pointwise variation. Fra{ň}kov{á} has given a proper extension of Helly's theorem to the setting of single-variable regulated functions. We show how a similar approach yields extensions of the standard compactness criterion for multi-variable functions of bounded variation.",

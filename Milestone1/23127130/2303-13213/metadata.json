    "abstract": "Autonomous driving has witnessed incredible advances in the past several decades, while Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) promises to satisfy the essential need of autonomous vehicle control in a wireless connected vehicle networks. In MARL, how to effectively decompose a global feedback into the relative contributions of individual agents belongs to one of the most fundamental problems. However, the environment volatility due to vehicle movement and wireless disturbance could significantly shape time-varying topological relationships among agents, thus making the Value Decomposition (VD) challenging. Therefore, in order to cope with this annoying volatility, it becomes imperative to design a dynamic VD framework. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic VMIX (SVMIX) methodology by taking account of dynamic topological features during the VD and incorporating the corresponding components into a multi-agent actor-critic architecture. In particular, Stochastic Graph Neural Network (SGNN) is leveraged to effectively capture underlying dynamics in topological features and improve the flexibility of VD against the environment volatility. Finally, the superiority of SVMIX is verified through extensive simulations.",

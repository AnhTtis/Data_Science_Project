abstract = {Graph burning is a deterministic discrete time graph process that can be interpreted as a model for the spread of influence in social networks. The burning number b(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of steps in a graph burning process for G. Bonato et al. (2014) conjectured that b(G)≤⌈n⌉ for any connected graph G of order n. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for caterpillars. We also determine the burning numbers of caterpillars with at most two stems and a subclass of the class of caterpillars all of whose spine vertices are stems.}

abstract = {Graph burning is one model for the spread of memes and contagion in social networks. The corresponding graph parameter is the burning number of a graph G, written b(G), which measures the speed of the social contagion. While it is conjectured that the burning number of a connected graph of order n is at most ⌈n⌉, this remains open in general and in many graph families. We prove the conjectured bound for spider graphs, which are trees with exactly one vertex of degree at least 3. To prove our result for spiders, we develop new bounds on the burning number for path-forests, which in turn leads to a 32-approximation algorithm for computing the burning number of path-forests.}

(Burning a Graph as a Model of Social Contagion, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8882 (2014) 13-22) define the burning number b(G) of a graph G as the smallest integer k for which there are vertices x1,…,xk such that for every vertex u of G, there is some i∈{1,…,k} with distG(u,xi)≤k−i, and distG(xi,xj)≥j−i for every i,j∈{1,…,k}. For a connected graph G of order n, they prove that b(G)≤2n−1, and conjecture b(G)≤n. We show that b(G)≤3219⋅n1−ϵ+2719ϵ and b(G)≤12n7+3≈1.309n+3 for every connected graph G of order n and every 0<ϵ<1. For a tree T of order n with n2 vertices of degree 2, and n≥3 vertices of degree at least 3, we show b(T)≤(n+n2)+14+12 and b(T)≤n+n≥3. Furthermore, we characterize the binary trees of depth r that have burning number r+1.}

Linial conjectured that if G has N vertices and minimum degree k, then L(G)⩾((k − 2)⧸(k + 1))N + ck where ck depends on k. We prove that if k = 4, L(G) 25N + 85; if k = 5, L(G) ⩾ 12N + 2. We give examples showing that these bounds are sharp.}

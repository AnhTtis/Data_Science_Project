    "abstract": "We give what we believe is an optimal condition for the uniqueness of Doeblin measures ($g$-measures) in terms of the variations of a Doeblin function ($g$-function). We prove that if the Doeblin function $g$ satisfies \\[\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{{\\mbox var}_n \\log g}{\\sqrt{n}^{-1}} < 2,\\] then we have a unique Doeblin measure.\n  We believe that there is a phase transition in this regime, namely that there exists a Doeblin function $g$ satisfying \\[\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{{\\mbox var}_n \\log g}{\\sqrt{n}^{-1}} < \\infty,\\] which possesses multiple Doeblin measures. This would be analogous to the theory of long-range Ising models. We further conjecture that $2$ is the critical value for uniqueness.\n  We also provide an example of a Doeblin function with a unique Doeblin measure that is not weakly mixing, which implies that the sequence of iterates of the transfer operator does not converge. Previously it was only known that uniqueness does not imply the Bernoulli property.",

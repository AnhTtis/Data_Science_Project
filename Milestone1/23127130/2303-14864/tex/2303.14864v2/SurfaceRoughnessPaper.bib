	abstract = {Silicon spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for large scale quantum computers, due to their excellent coherence and compatibility with CMOS technology for upscaling. Advanced industrial CMOS process flows allow wafer-scale uniformity and high device yield, but off the shelf transistor processes cannot be directly transferred to qubit structures due to the different designs and operation conditions. To therefore leverage the know-how of the micro-electronics industry, we customize a 300mm wafer fabrication line for silicon MOS qubit integration. With careful optimization and engineering of the MOS gate stack, we report stable and uniform quantum dot operation at the Si/SiOx interface at milli-Kelvin temperature. We extract the charge noise in different devices and under various operation conditions, demonstrating a record-low average noise level of 0.61 \$\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$eV/\$\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{Hz\}\}\$ at 1 Hz and even below 0.1 \$\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$eV/\$\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{Hz\}\}\$ for some devices and operating conditions. By statistical analysis of the charge noise with different operation and device parameters, we show that the noise source can indeed be well described by a two-level fluctuator model. This reproducible low noise level, in combination with uniform operation of our quantum dots, marks CMOS manufactured MOS spin qubits as a mature and highly scalable platform for high fidelity qubits.},

	abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum computers that can solve hard problems rely on quantum error correction1. One of the most promising error correction codes is the surface code2, which requires universal gate fidelities exceeding an error correction threshold of 99 per cent3. Among the many qubit platforms, only superconducting circuits4, trapped ions5 and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond6 have delivered this requirement. Electron spin qubits in silicon7–15 are particularly promising for a large-scale quantum computer owing to their nanofabrication capability, but the two-qubit gate fidelity has been limited to 98 per cent owing to the slow operation16. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.5 per cent, along with single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.8 per cent, in silicon spin qubits by fast electrical control using a micromagnet-induced gradient field and a tunable two-qubit coupling. We identify the qubit rotation speed and coupling strength where we robustly achieve high-fidelity gates. We realize Deutsch–Jozsa and Grover search algorithms with high success rates using our universal gate set. Our results demonstrate universal gate fidelity beyond the fault-tolerance threshold and may enable scalable silicon quantum computers.},

We demonstrate, at a temperature above one Kelvin, single-qubit rotations together with the two-qubit gates CROT, CPHASE and SWAP. Furthermore we realize adiabatic, diabatic and composite sequences to optimize the qubit control fidelity and the gate time. We find two-qubit gates that can be executed within 67 ns and by theoretically analyzing the experimental noise sources we predict fidelities exceeding 99\%.

Classical computing, which previously faced such issues, currently relies on silicon chips hosting billions of fin field-effect transistors. These devices are small enough for quantum applications: at low temperatures, an electron or hole trapped under the gate can serve as a spin qubit. Such an approach potentially allows the quantum hardware and its classical control electronics to be integrated on the same chip. However, this requires qubit operation at temperatures above 1 K, where the cooling overcomes heat dissipation. Here we show that silicon fin field-effect transistors can host spin qubits operating above 4 K. We achieve fast electrical control of hole spins with driving frequencies up to 150 MHz, single-qubit gate fidelities at the fault-tolerance threshold and a Rabi-oscillation quality factor greater than 87. Our devices feature both industry compatibility and quality, and are fabricated in a flexible and agile way that should accelerate further development.},

We show that a g-matrix formalism can simultaneously capture and discriminate the contributions of two mechanisms so far independently discussed in the literature: one associated with the modulation of the g factor, and measurable by Zeeman energy spectroscopy, the other not.

	abstract = {We have studied the statistical properties of random surface roughness at the Si-SiO2 interface using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The spectral properties of the HRTEM roughness on normally prepared and intentionally roughened samples appears to be well characterized as a first-order autoregressive or Markovian process which corresponds to an exponential decay in the autocovariance function rather than the usual Gaussian approximation which has been widely used. Such an exponential decay is characterized by tails in the spectrum which are directly attributable to the discrete or steplike nature of the interface roughness which is restricted to occur on crystalline atomic sites. Using a simplified model, we have estimated the effect of projecting the two-dimensional interface roughness through the cross-section thickness to form the one-dimensional boundary studied here. For an isotropic medium, we find that the statistical character of the roughness is preserved during this transformation, but that the rms fluctuation of the roughness is attenuated so that the actual interface is rougher than indicated by the HRTEM technique. After correcting for such averaging, the parameters estimated from the HRTEM are more in agreement with the same parameters used to fit the surface-roughness-limited Hall mobility in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor devices. © 1985 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {We theoretically model the spin-orbit interaction in silicon quantum dot devices, relevant for quantum computation and spintronics. Our model is based on a modified effective mass approach which properly accounts for spin-valley boundary conditions, derived from the interface symmetry, and should have applicability for other heterostructures. We show how the valley-dependent interface-induced spin-orbit 2D (3D) interaction, under the presence of an electric field that is perpendicular to the interface, leads to a g-factor renormalization in the two lowest valley states of a silicon quantum dot. These g-factors can change with electric field in opposite direction when intervalley spin-flip tunneling is favored over intravalley processes, explaining recent experimental results. We show that the quantum dot level structure makes only negligible higher order effects to the g-factor. We calculate the g-factor as a function of the magnetic field direction, which is sensitive to the interface symmetry. We identify spin-qubit dephasing sweet spots at certain directions of the magnetic field, where the g-factor renormalization is zeroed: these include perpendicular to the interface magnetic field, and also in-plane directions, the latter being defined by the interface-induced spin-orbit constants. The g-factor dependence on electric field opens the possibility for fast all-electric manipulation of an encoded, few electron spin qubit, without the need of a nanomagnet or a nuclear spin-background. Our approach of an almost fully analytic theory allows for a deeper physical understanding of the importance of spin-orbit coupling to silicon spin qubits.},

Ideally, this rationale would extend to quantum dots, and quantum computation could be performed by merely controlling the outer-shell electrons of dot-based qubits. Imperfections in semiconductor materials disrupt this analogy, so real devices seldom display a systematic many-electron arrangement. We demonstrate here an electrostatically confined quantum dot that reveals a well defined shell structure. We observe four shells (31 electrons) with multiplicities given by spin and valley degrees of freedom. Various fillings containing a single valence electron—namely 1, 5, 13 and 25 electrons—are found to be potential qubits. An integrated micromagnet allows us to perform electrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR), leading to faster Rabi rotations and higher fidelity single qubit gates at higher shell states.

We find that high conversion fidelity is possible for a wide range of phase differences, while taking into account experimentally observed valley splittings and tunnel couplings. We also show that the control of the valley splitting together with the optimization of the readout detuning can compensate the effect of the valley phase difference. To increase the measurement fidelity and extend the relaxation time we propose a latching protocol that requires a triple quantum dot and exploits weak long-range tunnel coupling.

First, using atomistic tight-binding calculations we show that the g-factors and their Stark shifts undergo variations due to these steps. We compare our theoretical predictions with experiments on QDs at a Si/SiO2 interface, in which we observe significant differences in Stark shifts between QDs in two different samples. We also experimentally observe variations in the g-factors of one-electron and three-electron spin qubits realized in three neighboring QDs on the same sample, at a level consistent with our calculations. The dephasing times of these qubits also vary, most likely due to their varying sensitivity to charge noise, resulting from different interface conditions. More importantly, from our calculations we show that by employing the anisotropic nature of the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in a Si QD, we can minimize and control these variations. Ultimately, we predict that the dephasing times of the Si QD spin qubits will be anisotropic and can be improved by at least an order of magnitude, by aligning the external dc magnetic field towards specific crystal directions, given other decoherence mechanisms do not dominate over charge noise.},

It is found that tensile strain monotonically enhances electron μsr with the increase in the amount of strain but does not enhance hole μsr even when the strain is quite high (in the S1-xGev relaxed layers with 40\% Ge content). This different strain dependence of electron and hole μsr can be explained by a combination of a slight reduction in the roughness height (Δ) of the Si/SiO2 interfaces and a decrease in the correlation length (Λ), induced by tensile strain. The strain-induced Δ reduction is confirmed by direct transmission electron microscopy measurements for the first time. © 2009 IEEE.},

The high single qubit fidelities possible in these systems, combined with quantum error correcting codes, could potentially offer a route to fault-tolerant quantum computing. To achieve fault tolerance, however, gate error rates must be reduced to below a certain threshold and, in general, correlated errors must be removed. Here we show that pulse engineering techniques can be used to reduce the average Clifford gate error rates for silicon quantum dot spin qubits down to 0.043\%. This represents a factor of three improvement over state-of-the-art silicon quantum dot devices and extends the randomized benchmarking coherence time to 9.4 ms. By including tomographically complete measurements in our randomized benchmarking, we infer a higher-order feature of the noise called the unitarity, which measures the coherence of noise. This, in turn, allows us to theoretically predict that average gate error rates as low as 0.026\% may be achievable with further pulse improvements. These spin qubit fidelities are ultimately limited by incoherent noise, which we attribute to charge noise from the silicon device structure or the environment.},

Using pulsed electron-spin resonance, we perform coherent control of both types of qubits, addressing them via an electric field dependent g factor. We perform randomized benchmarking and find that both qubits can be operated with high fidelity. Surprisingly, we find that the g factors of the one-electron and three-electron qubits have an approximately linear but opposite dependence as a function of the applied dc electric field. We develop a theory to explain this g-factor behavior based on the spin-valley coupling that results from the sharp interface. The outer "shell" electron in the three-electron qubit exists in the higher of the two available conduction-band valley states, in contrast with the one-electron case, where the electron is in the lower valley. We formulate a modified effective mass theory and propose that intervalley spin-flip tunneling dominates over intravalley spin flips in this system, leading to a direct correlation between the spin-orbit coupling parameters and the g factors in the two valleys. In addition to offering all-electrical tuning for single-qubit gates, the g-factor physics revealed here for one-electron and three-electron qubits offers potential opportunities for different qubit control approaches.},

On larger scales, the roughness was no more dependent on the scale, showing the (macroscopic) RMS roughness in the conventional sense. The observed structure (self-affine fractal with a finite-length cut-off) is consistent with the prediction of the theory of kinetic roughening in a far-from-equilibrium growth, where the fluctuation on smaller scales evolves into roughness on larger scales. Statistical description of the Si/SiO2 interface roughness was also given in terms of autocorrelation function and power spectral density. It was found that the autocorrelation function of the Si/SiO2 interface roughness is well approximated by an exponential form rather than a Gaussian form.

One major challenge for scalable quantum dots is the presence of charge impurities. Electron-beam lithography (EBL), almost universally used to fabricate quantum dot devices, is known to create such defects at the Si/SiO2 interface. To eliminate the need for EBL, we have transferred the metal gate pattern of a quantum dot onto the silicon substrate using nano-imprint lithography. Critical features with 50 nm scale and separation can be dependably reproduced. By characterizing the bias-dependent charge transport through a quantum point contact barrier, the prevalence of impurities is found to be largely diminished in nano-imprinted devices when compared to similar electron-beam-written counterparts. High-quality charge transport and charge sensing of several quantum dots are obtained. Additionally, gate noise is measured with an average of 1.5 μeV Hz-1/2 equivalent to previous measurements made on devices fabricated with EBL, which suggests that the leading source of impurities produced by EBL are deep, fixed charges.

Here, for qubits encoded on the electron spin states of gate-defined quantum dots, we demonstrate Bell state tomography with fidelities ranging from 80 to 89 per cent, and two-qubit randomized benchmarking with an average Clifford gate fidelity of 94.7 per cent and an average controlled-rotation fidelity of 98 per cent. These fidelities are found to be limited by the relatively long gate times used here compared with the decoherence times of the qubits. Silicon qubit designs employing fast gate operations with high Rabi frequencies16,17, together with advanced pulsing techniques18, should therefore enable much higher fidelities in the near future.},

Pairs of closely spaced Si atomic columns appear in the HREM image as black dots. The next step involves measuring the HREM image intensity distribution along each black-dot layer parallel to the interface. Then these intensity distributions, which are affected by interfacial roughness, are examined layer-by-layer by Fourier analysis. Moreover, to enable detailed observation of the interfacial roughness, we developed a specimen-preparation technique in which CF4-O2 plasma etching is used to remove ion-milling artifacts. We demonstrate that this examination can provide quantitative indices of the interfacial roughness.

Recent analytical models and simulations enable quantitative prediction of these properties from knowledge of the power spectral density (PSD) of the surface topography. The utility of the PSD is that it contains statistical information that is unbiased by the particular scan size and pixel resolution chosen by the researcher. In this article, we first review the mathematical definition of the PSD, including the one- and two-dimensional cases, and common variations of each. We then discuss strategies for reconstructing an accurate PSD of a surface using topography measurements at different size scales. Finally, we discuss detecting and mitigating artifacts at the smallest scales, and computing upper/lower bounds on functional properties obtained from models. We accompany our discussion with virtual measurements on computer-generated surfaces. This discussion summarizes how to analyze topography measurements to reconstruct a reliable PSD. Analytical models demonstrate the potential for tuning functional properties by rationally tailoring surface topography - however, this potential can only be achieved through the accurate, quantitative reconstruction of the PSDs of real-world surfaces.},

	abstract = {Silicon quantum dots are considered an excellent platform for spin qubits, partly due to their weak spin-orbit interaction. However, the sharp interfaces in the heterostructures induce a small but significant spin-orbit interaction that degrades the performance of the qubits or, when understood and controlled, could be used as a powerful resource. To understand how to control this interaction, we build a detailed profile of the spin-orbit interaction of a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum-dot system. We probe the derivative of the Stark shift, g-factor and g-factor difference for two single-electron quantum-dot qubits as a function of external magnetic field and find that they are dominated by spin-orbit interactions originating from the vector potential, consistent with recent theoretical predictions. Conversely, by populating the double dot with two electrons, we probe the mixing of singlet and spin-polarized triplet states during electron tunneling, which we conclude is dominated by momentum-term spin-orbit interactions that vary from 1.85 MHz up to 27.5 MHz depending on the magnetic field orientation. Finally, we exploit the tunability of the derivative of the Stark shift of one of the dots to reduce its sensitivity to electric noise and observe an 80\% increase in T2∗. We conclude that the tuning of the spin-orbit interaction will be crucial for scalable quantum computing in silicon and that the optimal setting will depend on the exact mode of qubit operations used.},

In the spin mode, the qubit is more robust with respect to inelastic relaxation and decoherence but is hardly addressable electrically. It can, however, be brought into the valley mode for electrical manipulation, then back to the spin mode. This opens new possibilities for the development of robust and scalable, electrically addressable spin qubits on silicon.

Moreover, we analyze the probability distribution of fermionic expectation values, which can be non-Gaussian and fat-tailed when the FSP is severe. As a practical application, we consider electrons and dipolar atoms in a harmonic confinement, and the uniform electron gas in the warm dense matter regime.

Conversely, lithographically defined quantum dots have an exchange coupling that can be precisely engineered1, but strong coupling to noise has severely limited their dephasing times and control fidelities. Here, we combine the best aspects of both spin qubit schemes and demonstrate a gate-addressable quantum dot qubit in isotopically engineered silicon with a control fidelity of 99.6\%, obtained via Clifford-based randomized benchmarking and consistent with that required for fault-tolerant quantum computing7,8.

Our approach - based on Green's-function renormalization-decimation techniques - is asymptotically exact for the infinite chain and shows the formation of these states regardless of whether or not a confining electric field is applied. The renormalization language naturally leads to the central role played by the chemical bond of the atoms immediately across the interface. In the adopted decimation procedure, the convergence rate to a fixed point directly relates the valley splitting and the spread of the wave function, consequently connecting the splitting to geometrical experimental parameters such as the capacitance of a two-dimensional electron gas - explicitly calculated here.

Here, we propose an architecture for a silicon-based quantum computer processor based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. We show how a transistor-based control circuit together with charge-storage electrodes can be used to operate a dense and scalable two-dimensional qubit system. The qubits are defined by the spin state of a single electron confined in quantum dots, coupled via exchange interactions, controlled using a microwave cavity, and measured via gate-based dispersive readout. We implement a spin qubit surface code, showing the prospects for universal quantum computation.

Many physical realizations of qubits exist, including single photons, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, single defects or atoms in diamond and silicon, and semiconductor quantum dots, with single-qubit fidelities that exceed the stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite this, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid state that can be manufactured using standard lithographic techniques have so far been limited to superconducting qubits, owing to the difficulties of coupling qubits and dephasing in semiconductor systems. Here we present a two-qubit logic gate, which uses single spins in isotopically enriched silicon and is realized by performing single- and two-qubit operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal. We realize CNOT gates via controlled-phase operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a switchable exchange interaction that is used in the two-qubit controlled-phase gate. By independently reading out both qubits, we measure clear anticorrelations in the two-spin probabilities of the CNOT gate.},

	abstract = {Device physics and material science meet at the atomic scale of novel nanostructured semiconductors, and the distinction between new device or new material is blurred. Not only the quantum-mechanical effects in the electronic states of the device but also the granular atomistic representation of the underlying material are important. Approaches based on a continuum representation of the underlying material typically used by device engineers and physicists become invalid. Ab initio methods used by material scientists typically do not represent the band gaps and masses precisely enough for device design, or they do not scale to realistically large device sizes. The plethora of geometry, material, and doping configurations in semiconductor devices at the nanoscale suggests that a general nanoelectronic modeling tool is needed. The 3-D NanoElectronic MOdeling (NEMO 3-D) tool has been developed to address these needs. Based on the atomistic valence force field and a variety of nearest neighbor tight-binding models (e.g., s, sp3s*, and sp3d5s*), NEMO 3-D enables the computation of strain and electronic structure for more than 64 and 52 million atoms, corresponding to volumes of (110 nm)3 and (101 nm)3, respectively. The physical problem may involve very large scale computations, and NEMO 3-D has been designed and optimized to be scalable from single central processing units to large numbers of processors on commodity clusters and supercomputers. NEMO 3-D has been released with an open-source license in 2003 and is continually developed by the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). A web-based online interactive version for educational purposes is freely available on the NCN portal (http://www.nanoHUB.org).

This interaction is controllable by electrically tailoring the overlap between electronic wavefunctions in quantum dot systems, as long as they occupy neighbouring dots. An alternative route is the exploration of superexchange - the coupling between remote spins mediated by a third idle electron that bridges the distance between quantum dots. We experimentally demonstrate direct exchange coupling and provide evidence for second neighbour mediated superexchange in a linear array of three single-electron spin qubits in silicon, inferred from the electron spin resonance frequency spectra. We confirm theoretically through atomistic modeling that the device geometry only allows for sizeable direct exchange coupling for neighbouring dots, while next nearest neighbour coupling cannot stem from the vanishingly small tail of the electronic wavefunction of the remote dots, and is only possible if mediated.},

We fabricate using a multi-layer technique to achieve tightly confined quantum dots and compare integration processes. While SiMOS can benefit from a larger temperature budget and Ge/SiGe can make an Ohmic contact to metals, the overlapping gate structure to define the quantum dots can be based on a nearly identical integration. We realize charge sensing in each platform, for the first time in Ge/SiGe, and demonstrate fully functional linear and two-dimensional arrays where all quantum dots can be depleted to the last charge state. In Si/SiGe, we tune a quintuple quantum dot using the N + 1 method to simultaneously reach the few electron regime for each quantum dot. We compare capacitive crosstalk and find it to be the smallest in SiMOS, relevant for the tuning of quantum dot arrays.

	abstract = {Spin qubits hosted in silicon (Si) quantum dots (QD) are attractive due to their exceptionally long coherence times and compatibility with the silicon transistor platform. To achieve electrical control of spins for qubit scalability, recent experiments have utilized gradient magnetic fields from integrated micro-magnets to produce an extrinsic coupling between spin and charge, thereby electrically driving electron spin resonance (ESR). However, spins in silicon QDs experience a complex interplay between spin, charge, and valley degrees of freedom, influenced by the atomic scale details of the confining interface. Here, we report experimental observation of a valley dependent anisotropic spin splitting in a Si QD with an integrated micro-magnet and an external magnetic field. We show by atomistic calculations that the spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which is often ignored in bulk silicon, plays a major role in the measured anisotropy. Moreover, inhomogeneities such as interface steps strongly affect the spin splittings and their valley dependence. This atomic-scale understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors controlling the valley dependent spin properties is a key requirement for successful manipulation of quantum information in Si QDs.},

However, as for every device with nanoscale dimensions, disorder at the atomic level is detrimental to quantum dot uniformity. Here we investigate two spin qubits confined in a silicon double quantum dot artificial molecule. Each quantum dot has a robust shell structure and, when operated at an occupancy of 5 or 13 electrons, has single spin-12 valence electron in its p- or d-orbital, respectively. These higher electron occupancies screen static electric fields arising from atomic-level disorder. The larger multielectron wavefunctions also enable significant overlap between neighbouring qubit electrons, while making space for an interstitial exchange-gate electrode. We implement a universal gate set using the magnetic field gradient of a micromagnet for electrically driven single qubit gates, and a gate-voltage-controlled inter-dot barrier to perform two-qubit gates by pulsed exchange coupling. We use this gate set to demonstrate a Bell state preparation between multielectron qubits with fidelity 90.3\%, confirmed by two-qubit state tomography using spin parity measurements.},

Here we demonstrate that valley separation can be accurately tuned via electrostatic gate control in a metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot, providing splittings spanning 0.3-0.8 meV. The splitting varies linearly with applied electric field, with a ratio in agreement with atomistic tight-binding predictions. We demonstrate single-shot spin read-out and measure the spin relaxation for different valley configurations and dot occupancies, finding one-electron lifetimes exceeding 2 s. Spin relaxation occurs via phonon emission due to spin-orbit coupling between the valley states, a process not previously anticipated for silicon quantum dots. An analytical theory describes the magnetic field dependence of the relaxation rate, including the presence of a dramatic rate enhancement (or hot-spot) when Zeeman and valley splittings coincide. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to outperform conventional computers in several important applications, from molecular simulation to search algorithms, once they can be scaled up to large numbers—typically millions—of quantum bits (qubits)1–3. For most solid-state qubit technologies—for example, those using superconducting circuits or semiconductor spins—scaling poses a considerable challenge because every additional qubit increases the heat generated, whereas the cooling power of dilution refrigerators is severely limited at their operating temperature (less than 100 millikelvin)4–6. Here we demonstrate the operation of a scalable silicon quantum processor unit cell comprising two qubits confined to quantum dots at about 1.5 kelvin. We achieve this by isolating the quantum dots from the electron reservoir, and then initializing and reading the qubits solely via tunnelling of electrons between the two quantum dots7–9. We coherently control the qubits using electrically driven spin resonance10,11 in isotopically enriched silicon12 28Si, attaining single-qubit gate fidelities of 98.6 per cent and a coherence time of 2 microseconds during ‘hot’ operation, comparable to those of spin qubits in natural silicon at millikelvin temperatures13–16. Furthermore, we show that the unit cell can be operated at magnetic fields as low as 0.1 tesla, corresponding to a qubit control frequency of 3.5 gigahertz, where the qubit energy is well below the thermal energy. The unit cell constitutes the core building block of a full-scale silicon quantum computer and satisfies layout constraints required by error-correction architectures8,17. Our work indicates that a spin-based quantum computer could be operated at increased temperatures in a simple pumped 4He system (which provides cooling power orders of magnitude higher than that of dilution refrigerators), thus potentially enabling the integration of classical control electronics with the qubit array18,19. A scalable silicon quantum processor unit cell made of two qubits confined to quantum dots operates at about 1.5 K, achieving 98.6\% single-qubit gate fidelities and a 2 μs coherence time.},

Here we demonstrate a potential solution to this problem by using a three-dimensional dielectric resonator to broadcast a global microwave signal across a quantum nanoelectronic circuit. Critically, this technique utilizes only a single microwave source and is capable of delivering control signals to millions of qubits simultaneously.

	abstract = {Inspired by the challenge of scaling up existing silicon quantum hardware, we investigate compilation strategies for sparsely-connected 2d qubit arrangements and propose a spin-qubit architecture with minimal compilation overhead. Our architecture is based on silicon nanowire split-gate transistors which can form finite 1d chains of spin-qubits and allow the execution of two-qubit operations such as Swap gates among neighbors. Adding to this, we describe a novel silicon junction which can couple up to four nanowires into 2d arrangements via spin shuttling and Swap operations. Given these hardware elements, we propose a modular sparse 2d spin-qubit architecture with unit cells consisting of diagonally-oriented squares with nanowires along the edges and junctions on the corners. We show that this architecture allows for compilation strategies which outperform the best-in-class compilation strategy for 1d chains, not only asymptotically, but also down to the minimal structure of a single square. The proposed architecture exhibits favorable scaling properties which allow for balancing the trade-off between compilation overhead and co-location of classical control electronics within each square by adjusting the length of the nanowires. An appealing feature of the proposed architecture is its manufacturability using complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes. Finally, we note that our compilation strategies, while being inspired by spin-qubits, are equally valid for any other quantum processor with sparse 2d connectivity.},

Despite attempts to enhance the valley energy splitting deterministically, by engineering a sharp interface, valley splitting fluctuations remain a serious problem for qubit uniformity, needed to scale up to large quantum processors. Here, we elucidate, predict, and control the valley splitting by the holistic integration of 3D atomic-level properties, theory and transport. We find that the concentration fluctuations of Si and Ge atoms within the 3D landscape of Si/SiGe interfaces explain the observed large spread of valley splitting from measurements on many quantum dot devices. Against the prevailing belief, we propose to boost these random alloy composition fluctuations by incorporating Ge atoms in the Si quantum well to statistically enhance valley splitting.},

	abstract = {The spin of an electron confined in semiconductor quantum dots is currently a promising candidate for quantum bit (qubit) implementations. Taking advantage of existing CMOS integration technologies, such devices can offer a platform for large scale quantum computation. However, a quantum mechanical framework bridging a device's physical design and operational parameters to the qubit energy space is lacking. Furthermore, the spin to charge coupling introduced by intrinsic or induced Spin-Orbit-Interaction (SOI) exposes the qubits to charge noise compromising their coherence properties and inducing quantum gate errors. We present here a co-modelling framework for double quantum dot (DQD) devices and their charge noise environment. We use a combination of an electrostatic potential solver, full configuration interaction quantum mechanical methods and two-level-fluctuator models to study the quantum gate performance in realistic device designs and operation conditions. We utilize the developed models together alongside the single electron solutions of the quantum dots to simulate one- and two- qubit gates in the presence of charge noise. We find an inverse correlation between quantum gate errors and quantum dot confinement frequencies. We calculate X-gate fidelities {\textgreater}97\% in the simulated Si-MOS devices at a typical TLF densities. We also find that exchange driven two-qubit SWAP gates show higher sensitivity to charge noise with fidelities down to 91\% in the presence of the same density of TLFs. We further investigate the one- and two- qubit gate fidelities at different TLF densities. We find that given the small size of the quantum dots, sensitivity of a quantum gate to the distance between the noise sources and the quantum dot creates a strong variability in the quantum gate fidelities which can compromise the device yields in scaled qubit technologies.},

	abstract = {We have studied the statistical properties of random surface roughness at the Si-SiO2 interface using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The spectral properties of the HRTEM roughness on normally prepared and intentionally roughened samples appears to be well characterized as a first-order autoregressive or Markovian process which corresponds to an exponential decay in the autocovariance function rather than the usual Gaussian approximation which has been widely used. Such an exponential decay is characterized by tails in the spectrum which are directly attributable to the discrete or steplike nature of the interface roughness which is restricted to occur on crystalline atomic sites. Using a simplified model, we have estimated the effect of projecting the two-dimensional interface roughness through the cross-section thickness to form the one-dimensional boundary studied here. For an isotropic medium, we find that the statistical character of the roughness is preserved during this transformation, but that the rms fluctuation of the roughness is attenuated so that the actual interface is rougher than indicated by the HRTEM technique. After correcting for such averaging, the parameters estimated from the HRTEM are more in agreement with the same parameters used to fit the surface-roughness-limited Hall mobility in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor devices.},

We find that this method reduces the dephasing effect of charge noise by more than a factor of 5 in comparison to operation near a charge-state anticrossing, increasing the number of observable exchange oscillations in our qubit by a similar factor.

We find that exchange splitting can be strongly suppressed at finite valley phase differences between the dots because of the valley-phase-dependent dressing of the ground states and Coulomb exchange integrals, and a small valley splitting can render the exchange Hamiltonian incomplete in describing low-energy dynamics due to nearby excited valley states. The higher orbital states are also vital in calculating the exchange splitting, which is crucial for applications such as exchange gates for spin qubits.},

Despite the scalability advantage of using silicon technology, realising a quantum computer with the millions of qubits required to run some of the most demanding quantum algorithms poses several outstanding challenges, including how to control many qubits simultaneously. Recently, compact 3D microwave dielectric resonators were proposed as a way to deliver the magnetic fields for spin qubit control across an entire quantum chip using only a single microwave source. Although spin resonance of individual electrons in the globally applied microwave field was demonstrated, the spins were controlled incoherently. Here we report coherent Rabi oscillations of single electron spin qubits in a planar SiMOS quantum dot device using a global magnetic field generated off-chip. The observation of coherent qubit control driven by a dielectric resonator establishes a credible pathway to achieving large-scale control in a spin-based quantum computer.},

We resonantly drive a two-level system and add a tailored modulation to the dressing field to increase robustness to frequency detuning noise and microwave amplitude fluctuations. We measure a coherence time of 2 ms, corresponding to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to a bare spin, and an average Clifford gate fidelity exceeding 99\%, despite the relatively long qubit gate times. We stress that the potential of this work lies in the scalability of the protocol and the relaxation of the engineering constraints for a large-scale quantum processor.

Paradoxically, a common control strategy is the integration of micromagnets to enhance the coupling between spins and electric fields, which, in turn, hampers noise immunity and adds architectural complexity. Here we exploit a switchable interaction between spins and orbital motion of electrons in silicon quantum dots, without a micromagnet. The weak effects of relativistic spin–orbit interaction in silicon are enhanced, leading to a speed up in Rabi frequency by a factor of up to 650 by controlling the energy quantization of electrons in the nanostructure. Fast electrical control is demonstrated in multiple devices and electronic configurations. Using the electrical drive, we achieve a coherence time T2,Hahn ≈ 50 μs, fast single-qubit gates with Tπ/2 = 3 ns and gate fidelities of 99.93\%, probed by randomized benchmarking.

It is, therefore, necessary to understand how reproducible the qubits can be, in order to assess strategies to cope with variability, and to set constraints on the quality of materials and fabrication. Here we model the variability of single-qubit properties (Larmor and Rabi frequencies) due to disorder at the Si/SiO2 interface (roughness, charge traps) in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. We consider both electron qubits (with synthetic spin-orbit coupling fields created by micromagnets) and hole qubits (with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling). We show that charge traps are much more limiting than interface roughness, and can scatter Rabi frequencies over one order of magnitude. We discuss the implications for the design of spin qubits and for the choice of materials.},

	abstract = {Spin qubits are contenders for scalable quantum computation because of their long coherence times demonstrated in a variety of materials, but individual control by frequency-selective addressing using pulsed spin resonance creates severe technical challenges for scaling up to many qubits. This individual resonance control strategy requires each spin to have a distinguishable frequency, imposing a maximum number of spins that can be individually driven before qubit crosstalk becomes unavoidable. Here we describe a complete strategy for controlling a large array of spins in quantum dots dressed by an on-resonance global field, namely, a field that is constantly driving the spin qubits, to dynamically decouple from the effects of background magnetic field fluctuations. This approach—previously implemented for the control of single electron spins bound to electrons in impurities—is here harmonized with all other operations necessary for universal quantum computing with spins in quantum dots. We define the logical states as the dressed qubit states and discuss initialization and readout utilizing Pauli spin blockade, as well as single- and two-qubit control in the new basis. Finally, we critically analyze the limitations imposed by qubit variability and potential strategies to improve performance.},

Here we show that by modulating a global field simultaneously applied to the entire array, we are able to encode qubits that are less sensitive to the statistical scatter in qubit resonance frequency and microwave amplitude fluctuations, which are problems expected in a large-scale system. We name this approach the SMART (sinusoidally modulated, always rotating, and tailored) qubit protocol. We show that there exist optimal modulation conditions for qubits in a global field that robustly provide improved coherence times. We discuss in further detail the example of spins in silicon quantum dots, in which universal one- and two-qubit control is achieved electrically by controlling the spin-orbit coupling of individual qubits and the exchange coupling between spins in neighboring dots.

Understanding the impact of architecture design choices for a scaled quantum stack for specific applications, prior to full realization of the quantum system, is an important open challenge. To this end, we develop a framework for quantum resource estimation, abstracting the layers of the stack, to estimate resources required across these layers for large-scale quantum applications. Using a tool that implements this framework, we assess three scaled quantum applications and find that hundreds of thousands to millions of physical qubits are needed to achieve practical quantum advantage. We identify three qubit parameters, namely size, speed, and controllability, that are critical at scale to rendering these applications practical. A goal of our work is to accelerate progress towards practical quantum advantage by enabling the broader community to explore design choices across the stack, from algorithms to qubits.},

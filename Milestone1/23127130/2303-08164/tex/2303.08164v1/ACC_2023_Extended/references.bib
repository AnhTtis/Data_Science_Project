    abstract = { In this paper we consider optimization problems where the objective function is given in a form of the expectation. A basic difficulty of solving such stochastic optimization problems is that the involved multidimensional integrals (expectations) cannot be computed with high accuracy. The aim of this paper is to compare two computational approaches based on Monte Carlo sampling techniques, namely, the stochastic approximation (SA) and the sample average approximation (SAA) methods. Both approaches, the SA and SAA methods, have a long history. Current opinion is that the SAA method can efficiently use a specific (say, linear) structure of the considered problem, while the SA approach is a crude subgradient method, which often performs poorly in practice. We intend to demonstrate that a properly modified SA approach can be competitive and even significantly outperform the SAA method for a certain class of convex stochastic problems. We extend the analysis to the case of convex-concave stochastic saddle point problems and present (in our opinion highly encouraging) results of numerical experiments. }

@article{Pic22,
Abstract = {In this paper we propose an approach based on an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller with grid input–output sensitivity estimation for real-time grid operation, e.g., at subsecond time scales. The OFO controller uses grid measurements as feedback to update the value of the controllable elements in the grid, and track the solution of a time-varying AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF). Instead of relying on a full grid model, e.g., grid admittance matrix, OFO only requires the steady-state sensitivity relating a change in the controllable inputs, e.g., power injections set-points, to a change in the measured outputs, e.g., voltage magnitudes. Since an inaccurate sensitivity may lead to a model-mismatch and jeopardize the performance, we propose a recursive least-squares estimation that enables OFO to learn the sensitivity from measurements during real-time operation, turning OFO into a model-free approach. We analytically certify the convergence of the proposed OFO with sensitivity estimation, and validate its performance on a simulation using the IEEE 123-bus test feeder, and comparing it against a state-of-the-art OFO with constant sensitivity.

Accelerating their training is a major challenge and techniques range from distributed algorithms to low-level circuit design. In this survey, we describe the problem from a theoretical perspective, followed by approaches for its parallelization. We present trends in DNN architectures and the resulting implications on parallelization strategies. We then review and model the different types of concurrency in DNNs: from the single operator, through parallelism in network inference and training, to distributed deep learning. We discuss asynchronous stochastic optimization, distributed system architectures, communication schemes, and neural architecture search. Based on those approaches, we extrapolate potential directions for parallelism in deep learning.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we accelerate power flow computation used in modeling and analysis of electric power distribution systems utilizing the GPU. We use kernels and parallel computation patterns (i.e., segmented scan and reduction) running on the GPU to accelerate a common method that is used to perform power flow computation called ``forward-backward sweep''. To evaluate our approach, we compare the GPU-accelerated parallel implementation of this method written in CUDA to the serial implementation that runs on the CPU. We perform our tests on binary power distribution trees that have number of nodes between 1K to 256K. Our results show that the parallel implementation brings up to 3.9x total speedup over the serial implementation. As expected, for the parts of the computation that entirely run on the GPU, larger speedups are achieved as the size of the distribution tree increases. We also provide a discussion on how the topology of the tree would affect the results.},

	Abstract = {Convex programming involves a convex set F ⊆ Rn and a convex cost function c : F → R. The goal of convex programming is to find a point in F which minimizes c. In online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in F before seeing the cost function for that step. This can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. We introduce an algorithm for this domain. We also apply this algorithm to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of infinitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (GIGA) is universally consistent.},

	Abstract = {We study a general online convex optimization problem. We have a convex set S and an unknown sequence of cost functions c1, c2,..., and in each period, we choose a feasible point xt in S, and learn the cost ct(xt). If the function ct is also revealed after each period then, as Zinkevich shows in [25], gradient descent can be used on these functions to get regret bounds of O(√n). That is, after n rounds, the total cost incurred will be O(√n) more than the cost of the best single feasible decision chosen with the benefit of hindsight, minx Σ ct(x).We extend this to the "bandit" setting, where, in each period, only the cost ct(xt) is revealed, and bound the expected regret as O(n3/4).Our approach uses a simple approximation of the gradient that is computed from evaluating ct at a single (random) point. We show that this biased estimate is sufficient to approximate gradient descent on the sequence of functions. In other words, it is possible to use gradient descent without seeing anything more than the value of the functions at a single point. The guarantees hold even in the most general case: online against an adaptive adversary.For the online linear optimization problem [15], algorithms with low regrets in the bandit setting have recently been given against oblivious [1] and adaptive adversaries [19]. In contrast to these algorithms, which distinguish between explicit explore and exploit periods, our algorithm can be interpreted as doing a small amount of exploration in each period.},

	Abstract = {We address the online linear optimization problem when theactions of the forecaster are represented by binary vectors.Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the minimax regretfor the worst possible set of actions. We study the problemunder three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial information models of theso-called ``semi-bandit'', and ``bandit'' problems. We consider both L_∞-, and L_2-type of restrictions forthe losses assigned by the adversary.We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers \citeGLLO07, DHK08, AHR08, CL09, HW09, KWK10, UNK10, KRS10 and \citeAB10. We provide simpleproofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower boundsare tight, up to a constant factor.Finally, we answer a question asked by \citeKWK10 by showing that the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against L_∞ adversaries.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents an algorithm for the prediction and estimation of the state of a road network comprising freeways and arterials, described by a Cell Transmission Model (CTM). CTM divides the network into a collection of links. Each link is characterized by its fundamental diagram, which relates link speed to link density. The state of the network is the vector of link densities. The state is observed through measurements of speed and flow on some links. Demand is specified by the volume of vehicles entering the network at some links, and by split ratios according to which vehicles are routed through the network. There is model uncertainty: the parameters of the fundamental diagram are uncertain. There is uncertainty in the demand around the nominal forecast. Lastly, the measurements are uncertain. The uncertainty in each model parameter, demand, and measurement is specified by an interval. Given measurements over a time interval [0,t] and a horizon τ⩾0, the algorithm computes a set of states with the guarantee that the actual state at time (t+τ) will lie in this set, consistent with the given measurements. In standard terminology the algorithm is a state prediction or an estimate accordingly as τ>0 or =0. The flow exiting a link may be controlled by an open- or closed-loop controller such as a signal or ramp meter. An open-loop controller does not change the algorithm, indeed it may make the system more predictable by tightening density bounds downstream of the controller. In the feedback case, the value of the control depends on the estimated state bounds, and the algorithm is extended to compute the range of possible closed-loop control values. The algorithm is used in a proposed design of a decision support system for the I-80 integrated corridor.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a simple representation of traffic on a highway with a single entrance and exit. The representation can be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space, including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation, and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within moving queues.},

	Abstract = {Fast time-scale voltage regulation is needed to enable high penetration of renewables in power distribution networks. A promising approach is to control the reactive power injections of inverters to maintain the voltages. However, existing voltage regulation algorithms require the exact knowledge of line parameters, which are not known for most distribution systems and are difficult to infer. In this work, by utilizing the convexity results of voltage regulation problem, we design an input convex neural network to learn the underlying mapping between the power injections and the voltage deviations. By using smart meter data, our proposed data-driven approach not only accurately fits the system behavior, but also provides a tractable and optimal way to find the reactive power injections. Various numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed voltage control scheme.},

	Abstract = {The finiteness of fossil fuels implies that future electric power systems may predominantly source energy from fuel-free renewable resources like wind and solar. Evidently, these power systems without fuel will be environmentally benign, sustainable, and subject to milder failure scenarios. Many of these advantages were projected decades ago with the definition of the soft energy path, which describes a future where all energy is provided by numerous small, simple, and diverse renewable sources. Here we provide a thorough investigation of power systems without any fuel-based generation from technical and economic standpoints. The paper is organized by timescale and covers issues like the irrelevance of unit commitment in networks without large, fuel-based generators, the dubiousness of nodal pricing without fuel costs, and the need for new system-level models and control methods for semiconductor-based energy-conversion interfaces.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a distributed algorithm, resilient against communication delays and packet drops, for coordinating the response of distributed energy resources (DERs) in AC microgrids so as to minimize electrical line losses and generation cost, and to ensure that the microgrid network constraints are satisfied. The proposed algorithm can be utilized as a secondary or tertiary controller for frequency regulation in islanded microgrids, or to coordinate DERs for providing frequency regulation services to the bulk grid when microgrid is in grid-connected mode. We validate the practical usefulness of the theoretical results through numerical simulations involving the IEEE 39-bus system.},

@article{Nedic17,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of distributed optimization over time-varying graphs. For the case of undirected graphs, we introduce a distributed algorithm, referred to as DIGing, based on a combination of a distributed inexact gradient method and a gradient tracking technique. The DIGing algorithm uses doubly stochastic mixing matrices and employs fixed stepsizes and, yet, drives all the agents' iterates to a global and consensual minimizer. When the graphs are directed, in which case the implementation of doubly stochastic mixing matrices is unrealistic, we construct an algorithm that incorporates the push-sum protocol into the DIGing structure, thus obtaining the Push-DIGing algorithm. Push-DIGing uses column stochastic matrices and fixed step-sizes, but it still converges to a global and consensual minimizer. Under the strong convexity assumption, we prove that the algorithms converge at R-linear (geometric) rates as long as the stepsizes do not exceed some upper bounds. We establish explicit estimates for the convergence rates. When the graph is undirected it shows that DIGing scales polynomially in the number of agents. We also provide some numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and to validate our theoretical findings.},

abstract = {Microgrids are now emerging from lab benches and pilot demonstration sites into commercial markets, driven by technological improvements, falling costs, a proven track record, and growing recognition of their benefits. They are being used to improve reliability and resilience of electrical grids, to manage the addition of distributed clean energy resources like wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) generation to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and to provide electricity in areas not served by centralized electrical infrastructure. This review article (1) explains what a microgrid is, and (2) provides a multi-disciplinary portrait of today's microgrid drivers, real-world applications, challenges, and future prospects.}

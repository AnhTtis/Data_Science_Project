Key GRBs are highlighted. The downward arrows indicate GRBs best fit by a PL spectral model, which must turnover somewhere, so they are shown as upper limits.

We do not utilize their luminosity measures as they are averaged (not peak).}

In order to calculate burst energetics the PPU-corrected data within the two \gbm BTI regions must be used. As was done with the $\textrm{T}_{90}$ analysis, all non-BTI regions shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:main} were also fit with a  Band function. For intervals where a Band function is not the preferred spectral form, we find it still produces an adequate fit and therefore introduces negligible errors in our results.

We derive the total isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}}$) in the 1-10,000\,keV range from the fluences in the individual time intervals from \t0-2.7\,s to \t0+1449.5\,s and perform k-corrections in all intervals. We find the total Fluence = $(9.47\pm0.07)\times10^{-2}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$ and $E_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}}=(1.01\pm0.007)\times10^{55}\,\erg$. Assuming an opening angle of 2 degrees \citep{Negro_2023}, the beaming corrected energy is $E_{\gamma}=6.1\times10^{51} \left(\theta_j/2\right)^2$\,erg. We obtain the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, by integrating the spectrum in the \t0+230.8\,s to \t0+231.8\,s interval. The energy flux here is $F=(8.48 \pm 0.06)\times10^{-2}$\,erg s$^{-1}$\,cm$^{-2}$. After k-correction, we find the 1\,s peak luminosity to be $L_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}}=(9.91 \pm 0.06)\times 10^{53}$\,erg s$^{-1}$. An event with such a high $L_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}}$ value is unlikely to be produced by a magnetar. These values are consistent with those independently produced by \citet{Konus_221009A}, \citet{GRBAplha_221009A}, and \citet{HTMX_GECAM-C_221009A} which demonstrate the validity of the \gbm PPU-correction technique for this GRB.

Figure\,\ref{fig:energetics} places the isotropic energy and luminosity into context with a broad sample of \gbm and \lat bursts with known redshift through 2017 \citep{Abbott2017a}, with updated spectral measures from \citet{Poolakkil2021}. \grb stands alone. It is the highest $E_{iso}$ in the \gbm sample, and with no higher claim existing in the literature, it is the brightest $E_{iso}$ ever recorded for a GRB. It is four orders of magnitude higher than GRBs seen at comparable redshifts and is an order of magnitude greater than the \enquote{Nearby Ordinary Monster} GRB\,130427A\, making \grb a nearerby extraordinary monster. In $L_{\rm iso}$, only GRB\,160625B is marginally higher; however, effects due to PPU and calibration issues caused by the geometry of incident photons with respect to \fermi make this our most limited measure.

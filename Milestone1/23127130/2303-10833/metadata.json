    "abstract": "Linear codes are the most important family of codes in coding theory. Some codes have only a few weights and are widely used in many areas, such as authentication codes, secret sharing schemes, association schemes and strongly regular graphs. By setting $ p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4 $, we construct an infinite family of linear codes using two weakly regular unbalanced (and balanced) plateaued functions with index $ \\frac{p-1}{2} $. Most of our constructed codes have a few weights and are minimal. After analysing their punctured version, we find that they are projective codes containing some optimal ones.",

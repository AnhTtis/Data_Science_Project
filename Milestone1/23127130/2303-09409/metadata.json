    "abstract": "The light curve of Gaia23bab (= SPICY 97589) shows two significant ($ΔG>2$ mag) brightening events, one in 2017 and an ongoing event starting in 2022. The source's quiescent spectral energy distribution indicates an embedded ($A_V>5$ mag) pre-main-sequence star, with optical accretion emission and mid-infrared disk emission. This characterization is supported by the source's membership in an embedded cluster in the star-forming cloud DOBASHI 1604 at a distance of $900\\pm45$~pc. Thus, the brightening events are probable accretion outbursts, likely of EX Lup-type.",

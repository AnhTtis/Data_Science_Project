    "abstract": "We propose a novel device concept using spin-orbit-torques to realize a magnetic field sensor, where we eliminate the sensor offset using a differential measurement concept. We derive a simple analytical formulation for the sensor signal and demonstrate its validity with numerical investigations using macrospin simulations. The sensitivity and the measurable linear sensing range in the proposed concept can be tuned by either varying the effective magnetic anisotropy or by varying the magnitude of the injected currents. We show that undesired perturbation fields normal to the sensitive direction preserve the zero-offset property and only slightly modulate the sensitivity of the proposed sensor. Higher-harmonics voltage analysis on a Hall cross experimentally confirms the linearity and tunability via current strength. Additionally, the sensor exhibits a non-vanishing offset in the experiment which we attribute to the anomalous Nernst effect.",

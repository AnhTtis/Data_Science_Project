  Abstract                 = {We study the use of a pair of qubits as a decoherence probe of a nontrivial environment. This dual-probe configuration is modelled by three two-level systems (TLSs), which are coupled in a chain in which the middle system represents an environmental TLS. This TLS resides within the environment of the qubits and therefore its coupling to perturbing fluctuations (i.e.Â its decoherence) is assumed much stronger than the decoherence acting on the probe qubits. We study the evolution of such a tripartite system including the appearance of a decoherence-free state (dark state) and non-Markovian behaviour. We find that all parameters of this TLS can be obtained from measurements of one of the probe qubits. Furthermore, we show the advantages of two qubits in probing environments and the new dynamics imposed by a TLS that couples to two qubits at once.},

  abstract  = {We propose a high-sensitivity magnetometry scheme based on a diamond Raman laser with visible pump absorption by an ensemble of coherently microwave driven negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centres (NV−) in the same diamond crystal. The NV− centres’ absorption and emission are spin-dependent. We show how the varying absorption of the NV− centres changes the Raman laser output. A shift in the diamond Raman laser threshold and output occurs with the external magnetic field and microwave driving. We develop a theoretical framework with steady-state solutions to describe the effects of coherently driven NV− centres including the charge state switching between NV− and its neutral charge state NV0 in a diamond Raman laser. We discuss that such a laser working at the threshold can be employed for magnetic field sensing. In contrast to previous studies on NV− magnetometry with visible laser absorption, the laser threshold magnetometry method is expected to have low technical noise, due to low background light in the measurement signal. For magnetic-field sensing, we project a shot-noise limited DC sensitivity of a few pT  in a well-calibrated cavity with realistic parameters. This sensor employs the broad visible absorption of NV− centres and unlike previous laser threshold magnetometry proposals it does not rely on active NV− centre lasing or an infrared laser medium at the specific wavelength of the NV− centre’s infrared absorption line.},

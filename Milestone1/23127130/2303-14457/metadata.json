    "abstract": "In-betweening is a technique for generating transitions given initial and target character states. The majority of existing works require multiple (often $>$10) frames as input, which are not always accessible. Our work deals with a focused yet challenging problem: to generate the transition when given exactly two frames (only the first and last). To cope with this challenging scenario, we implement our bi-directional scheme which generates forward and backward transitions from the start and end frames with two adversarial autoregressive networks, and stitches them in the middle of the transition where there is no strict ground truth. The autoregressive networks based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) are optimized by searching for a pair of optimal latent codes that minimize a novel stitching loss between their outputs. Results show that our method achieves higher motion quality and more diverse results than existing methods on both the LaFAN1 and Human3.6m datasets.",

    "abstract": "For graphs $G$ and $F$, the saturation number $\\textit{sat}(G,F)$ is the minimum number of edges in an inclusion-maximal $F$-free subgraph of $G$. In 2017, Korándi and Sudakov initiated the study of saturation in random graphs. They showed that for constant $p\\in (0,1)$, whp $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p),K_s\\right)=\\left(1+o(1)\\right)n\\log_{\\frac{1}{1-p}}n$.\n  We show that for every graph $F$ and every constant $p\\in (0,1)$, whp $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p), F\\right)=O(n\\ln n)$. Furthermore, if every edge of $F$ belongs to a triangle, then the above is the right asymptotic order of magnitude, that is, whp $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p),F\\right)=Θ(n\\ln n)$. We further show that for a large family of graphs $\\mathcal{F}$ with an edge that does not belong to a triangle, which includes all the bipartite graphs, for every $F\\in \\mathcal{F}$ and constant $p\\in(0,1)$, whp $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p),F\\right)=O(n)$. We conjecture that this sharp transition from $O(n)$ to $Θ(n\\ln n)$ depends only on this property, that is, that for any graph $F$ with at least one edge that does not belong to a triangle, whp $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p),F\\right)=O(n)$.\n  We further generalise the result of Korándi and Sudakov, and show that for a more general family of graphs $\\mathcal{F}'$, including all complete graphs $K_s$ and all complete multipartite graphs of the form $K_{1,1,s_3,\\ldots, s_{\\ell}}$, for every $F\\in \\mathcal{F}'$ and every constant $p\\in(0,1)$, whp $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p),F\\right)=\\left(1+o(1)\\right)n\\log_{\\frac{1}{1-p}}n$. Finally, we show that for every complete multipartite graph $K_{s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{\\ell}}$ and every $p\\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)$, $\\textit{sat}\\left(G(n,p),K_{s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_{\\ell}}\\right)=\\left(1+o(1)\\right)n\\log_{\\frac{1}{1-p}}n$.",

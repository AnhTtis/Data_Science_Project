\begin{abstract}

Benefited from deep learning techniques, remarkable progress has been made within the medical image analysis area in recent years. However, it is very challenging to fully utilize the relational information (the relationship between tissues or organs or images) within the deep neural network architecture. Thus in this thesis, we propose two novel solutions to this problem called implicit and explicit deep relational learning. We generalize these two paradigms of deep relational learning into different solutions and evaluate them on various medical image analysis tasks.

Automated segmentation of brain glioma in 3D magnetic resonance imaging plays an active role in glioma diagnosis, progression monitoring and surgery planning. In this work, we propose a novel Context-Aware Network that effectively models implicit relation information between features to perform accurate 3D glioma segmentation. We evaluate our proposed method on publicly accessible brain tumor segmentation datasets BRATS2017 and BRATS2018 against several state-of-the-art approaches using different segmentation metrics. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better or competitive performance, compared to the standard approaches.

Subsequently, we propose a new hierarchical homography estimation network to achieve accurate medical image mosaicing by learning the explicit spatial relationship between adjacent frames. We use the UCL Fetoscopy Placenta dataset to conduct experiments and our hierarchical homography estimation network outperforms the other state-of-the-art mosaicing methods while generating robust and meaningful mosaicing results on unseen frames.

First of all, I want to thank my father Mr. Yuhua Du, my mother Mrs. Zengxia Xiao and my fiancee Miss. Xinyu Wang. Thank them for their support to me and the family. I cannot repay the support from my family, and it is also my biggest motivation to continue scientific research.

Secondly, I want to thank my first supervisor, Prof. Huiyu Zhou. Prof. Huiyu Zhou has a rigorous attitude towards science. He also dedicates himself to his work. He is both a good teacher and a good friend. I am grateful to him for his continuous criticism and teaching, which have benefited me for life. At the same time, I would also like to thank my second supervisor, Prof. Yudong Zhang, for his professional guidance on my academic work.

Also, I would like to thank all colleagues of Biomedical Image Processing Lab (BIPL), especially Mr. Zheheng Jiang, Mr. Lei Tong, Mr. Long Chen, Mr. Feixiang Zhou, Mr. Jialin Lyu, Mr. Honghui Du. Thank all of you for your continuous support and help.

Finally, I would also like to thank all the collaborators, including, Dr. Qianni Zhang from Queen Mary Univeristy of London, Dr. Yinhai Wang from AstraZeneca R$\&$D Cambridge, Dr. Caifeng Shan from Philips Research Edinhoven, Prof. Ling Li from University of Kent, Prof. Xiangrong Zhang from Xidian University. Prof. Bin Yang from University of Leicester, Prof. Stephen McKenna from University of Dundee, Prof. Jianguo Zhang from Southern University of Science and Technology, Dr. Tianjun Huang from Southern University of Science and Technology. Dr. Sophia Bano from University College London. It is my honor to collaborate with these world-class researchers. Thank all collaborators for their trust, support and communication, which broadened my horizons and enabled me to move forward in the direction of machine learning and medical image processing. At the same time, I would also like to thank all the staff at the School of Informatics at the University of Leicester. Their professionalism has provided logistical support during my research work.

This thesis was written during the COVID epidemic in 2020. I hope you can stay safe and stay healthy if you are reading this dissertation.

    "abstract": "Recently, Sun [preprint, arXiv: 2210.07238v7] proposed two conjectural series\nfor the mathematical constant $\\zeta(4)$ and two conjectural series for the\nmathematical constant $\\zeta(5)$. In terms of the operator method and two\nhypergeometric transformations, we prove these four conjectures. Furthermore,\nwe also find some new series for the two constants in this paper.",

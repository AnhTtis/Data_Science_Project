    "abstract": "Relative motion of particles is examined in the context of relational space-time. It is shown that de Broglie waves may be derived as a representation of the coordinate maps between the rest-frames of these particles. Energy and momentum are not absolute characteristics of these particles, they are understood as parameters of the coordinate maps between their rest-frames. It is also demonstrated the position of a particle is not an absolute, it is contingent on the frame of reference used to observe the particle.",

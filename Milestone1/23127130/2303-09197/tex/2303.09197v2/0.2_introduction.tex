\section{Introduction}
    
    The abstract argumentation framework (AAF), first introduced in~\cite{dung_acceptability_1995}, provides a suitable framework for representing and reasoning about contradicting information. % through arguments.
    It makes it possible to find sets of arguments that can be accepted together and provides explanations on why such sets have been accepted or not. Thus, AAF provides convenient tools to model and reason about debates. 
    % \Camu{Indeed (irait avec modif précèdente)} 
    However, it is a static framework which does not include a notion of temporality that seems crucial for modelling dialogues. Several types of approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. One type modifies the argumentation graph by adding or deleting attacks and arguments using specific operators~\cite{doutre2017dynamic}, and amounts to considering an AAF at each time step. Another proposal is to transform an argumentation system into a logical formalism and then use revision or belief change operators to update the argumentation system~\cite{de2016argumentation}. We propose to use another logical formalism, action languages, to model the dynamics of a dialogue.
    % This approach also allows modeling quite naturally interactions between agents. In this context, we are particularly interested in two notions: the modeling capacities of the framework and the generation of explanations adapted to humans. This last point has recently been the subject of particular attention in argumentation~\cite{cyras_survey}. Nevertheless, although this formalism is very well adapted to the modeling of interactions, it is a static framework which, by default, does not include a notion of temporality. \Camu{}It seems possible to artificially add it by considering an argumentation graph at each time step, \Isa{or an time-based attributed graph?}. However, this is not the approach we have chosen here \Isa{because...?}.\Camu{}

    On the other hand, action languages offer tools to reason about action and change and have been naturally conceived to include the notion of time. The action language introduced by~\cite{sarmiento_action_2022-1}
    %is one of them. It 
    has been designed to determine the evolution of the world given a set of actions corresponding to deliberate choices of the agent, the occurrence of which can trigger a chain reaction through external events. We choose this action language for three reasons. First, it allows for concurrency of events. Other languages also offering this advantage, such as~$\mathcal{C}$~\cite{giunchiglia_action_1998} or PDDL+~\cite{fox_modelling_2006},
    %also offer this advantage. However, their semantics 
    are adapted to non-deterministic or durative actions, which increases complexity and is not useful in our framework. Secondly, there exists a definition of actual causality that is suitable for this action language. 
    % According to~\cite{miller_explanation_2018}, causality is essential for the generation of explanations. 
    Finally,~\cite{sarmiento_action_2023} propose a  sound and complete translation into ASP. 
    %In this paper, we 
    We propose to take advantage of these properties to  study the causal relations in a dialogue, paving the way for the search of explanations.
    
    
    This work constitutes a first step of a proposition to bring together different existing tools from the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning field to tackle issues that arise in abstract argumentation when considering causality and temporality together. This paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:AAF} briefly recalls the principles of  %introduces~\cite{dung_acceptability_1995}'s formalism of
    abstract argumentation. Section~\ref{sec:Action_language} 
    %provides a description of 
    describes the chosen action language and the actual causality definition suitable for it. Section~\ref{sec:translation} proposes the main contributions of this paper: a formalisation of acyclic abstract argumentation graphs into an action language, with its corresponding implementation in ASP.
    Section~\ref{sec:formalProp} establishes its formal properties, 
    %of this transformation such as 
    including its soundness and completeness, as well as the relevance of the temporality inclusion. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} illustrates the exploitation of the proposed formalisation to get enriched information, as graphical representations and causal relations. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}  concludes the paper. 
    %and opens some perspectives on the generation of explanations. \Isa{on peut ne pas mentionner la section 7 dans le plan s'il faut gagner deux lignes}

    "abstract": "Given an $ω$-automaton and a set of word homomorphisms, we look at which accepted words have such a substitutive structure, and in particular if there is at least one. We introduce a method using desubstitution of $ω$-automata to describe the structure of preimages of accepted words under arbitrary sequences of homomorphisms: this takes the form of a meta-$ω$-automaton.\n  We decide the existence of an accepted purely substitutive word, as well as the existence of an accepted fixed point. In the case of multiple substitutions (non-erasing homomorphisms), we decide the existence of an accepted infinitely desubstitutable word, with possibly some constraints on the sequence of substitutions (e.g. Sturmian words or Arnoux-Rauzy words). As an application, we decide when a set of finite words codes e.g. a Sturmian word. As another application, we also show that if an $ω$-automaton accepts a Sturmian word, it accepts the image of the full shift under some Sturmian morphism.",

\section{Conclusion}
This work introduces the task of location-free scene graph generation (LF-SGG), where we break the dependency of scene graph generation on object location information. Along with this new task, we introduce the first scene graph generation method, Pix2SG, which does not use object location information at any stage of the pipeline. Pix2SG uses autoregressive sequence modeling to directly generate the scene graph from the input image. Finally, we provide an efficient heuristic tree search-based algorithm for the complex problem of scene graph matching. This allows the evaluation of LF-SGG without object localization also for future pipelines. Our new task and its objective evaluation can pave the way to more efficient scene interpretation from visual content in the form of scene graphs.

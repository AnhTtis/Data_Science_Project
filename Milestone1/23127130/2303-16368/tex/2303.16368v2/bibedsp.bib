@article{Haffner:2005aa,
	abstract = {Schr{\"o}dinger's hypothetical cat was both dead and alive thanks to a paradox of quantum mechanics, in which a system exists in two or more states at once in a `superposition'of entangled states. Creating this situation experimentally is very difficult, especially for systems made up of many particles, as interactions with the environment destroy superposition in a process called decoherence. So far, entangled states of just a handful of atoms or photons have been achieved. Now, two groups have extended the limits of quantum state engineering by creating the largest entangled atomic systems to date. Working with atoms held in an ion trap by an electromagnetic field to limit decoherence, a team from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, has created `cat states'of up to six beryllium atoms. A second group, based at Innsbruck University in Austria, has achieved a similar feat by making a related entangled state, a `W state', containing up to eight particles. As the states are created `on demand'and should be scalable to many more particles, there is hope that this technology will pave the way for building a large-scale quantum computer.},

@article{Friis_2017,
	abstract = {Quantum metrology offers a quadratic advantage over classical approaches to parameter estimation problems by utilising entanglement and nonclassicality. However, the hurdle of actually implementing the necessary quantum probe states and measurements, which vary drastically for different metrological scenarios, is usually not taken into account. We show that for a wide range of tasks in metrology, 2D cluster states (a particular family of states useful for measurement-based quantum computation) can serve as flexible resources that allow one to efficiently prepare any required state for sensing, and perform appropriate (entangled) measurements using only single qubit operations. Crucially, the overhead in the number of qubits is less than quadratic, thus preserving the quantum scaling advantage. This is ensured by using a compression to a logarithmically sized space that contains all relevant information for sensing. We specifically demonstrate how our method can be used to obtain optimal scaling for phase and frequency estimation in local estimation problems, as well as for the Bayesian equivalents with Gaussian priors of varying widths. Furthermore, we show that in the paradigmatic case of local phase estimation 1D cluster states are sufficient for optimal state preparation and measurement.},

@article{Len:2022aa,
	abstract = {The impact of measurement imperfections on quantum metrology protocols has not been approached in a systematic manner so far. In this work, we tackle this issue by generalising firstly the notion of quantum Fisher information to account for noisy detection, and propose tractable methods allowing for its approximate evaluation. We then show that in canonical scenarios involving N probes with local measurements undergoing readout noise, the optimal sensitivity depends crucially on the control operations allowed to counterbalance the measurement imperfections---with global control operations, the ideal sensitivity (e.g., the Heisenberg scaling) can always be recovered in the asymptotic N limit, while with local control operations the quantum-enhancement of sensitivity is constrained to a constant factor. We illustrate our findings with an example of NV-centre magnetometry, as well as schemes involving spin-1/2 probes with bit-flip errors affecting their two-outcome measurements, for which we find the input states and control unitary operations sufficient to attain the ultimate asymptotic precision.},

Here we provide a comprehensive framework exploiting matrix product operators (MPO) type tensor networks for quantum metrological problems. The maximal achievable estimation precision as well as the optimal probe states in previously inaccessible regimes can be identified including models with short-range noise correlations. Moreover, the application of infinite MPO (iMPO) techniques allows for a direct and efficient determination of the asymptotic precision in the limit of infinite particle numbers. We illustrate the potential of our framework in terms of an atomic clock stabilization (temporal noise correlation) example as well as magnetic field sensing (spatial noise correlations). As a byproduct, the developed methods may be used to calculate the fidelity susceptibility---a parameter widely used to study phase transitions.},

A rule of thumb for sensing is that a collective measurement taken by M independent sensors can improve the sensitivity by , known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezed light can be harnessed to surpass the SQL. Distributed quantum sensing is an emerging subject dedicated to investigating the performance gain enabled by entangled states shared by multiple sensors in tackling different measurement problems. This review formulates distributed quantum sensing (DQS) from a quantum-information perspective and describes DQS protocols and their experimental demonstrations.

A number of models of quantum computation exist. These models have been shown to be formally equivalent, but their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. A particularly exciting paradigm is that of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state. We review recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation with a view to both fundamental and practical issues, in particular the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps towards experimental realization.

	abstract = {From a practical perspective it is advantageous to develop methods that verify entanglement in quantum states with as few measurements as possible. In this paper we investigate the minimal number of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) needed to detect bound entanglement in bipartite -dimensional states, i.e. entangled states that are positive under partial transposition. In particular, we show that a class of entanglement witnesses (EWs) composed of MUBs can detect bound entanglement if the number of measurements is greater than . This is a substantial improvement over other detection methods, requiring significantly fewer resources than either full quantum state tomography or measuring a complete set of d + 1 MUBs. Our approach is based on a partial characterisation of the (non-)decomposability of EWs. We show that non-decomposability is a universal property of MUBs, which holds regardless of the choice of complementary observables, and we find that both the number of measurements and the structure of the witness play an important role in the detection of bound entanglement.},

	abstract = {Generalizing a decision problem for bipartite perfect matching, J. Edmonds introduced in [14] the problem (now known as the Edmonds Problem) of deciding if a given linear subspace of M(N) contains a nonsingular matrix, where M(N) stands for the linear space of complex NxN matrices. This problem led to many fundamental developments in matroid theory etc.Classical matching theory can be defined in terms of matrices with nonnegative entries. The notion of Positive operator, central in Quantum Theory, is a natural generalization of matrices with nonnegative entries. (Here operator refers to maps from matrices to matrices.) First, we reformulate the Edmonds Problem in terms of of completely positive operators, or equivalently, in terms of bipartite density matrices. It turns out that one of the most important cases when Edmonds' problem can be solved in polynomial deterministic time, i.e. an intersection of two geometric matroids, corresponds to unentangled (aka separable) bipartite density matrices. We introduce a very general class (or promise) of linear subspaces of M(N) on which there exists a polynomial deterministic time algorithm to solve Edmonds' problem. The algorithm is a thoroughgoing generalization of algorithms in [23], [26], and its analysis benefits from an operator analog of permanents, so called Quantum Permanents. Finally, we prove that the weak membership problem for the convex set of separable normalized bipartite density matrices is NP-HARD.},

	abstract = {Algorithms such as quantum factoring1 and quantum search2 illustrate the great theoretical promise of quantum computers; but the practical implementation of such devices will require careful consideration of the minimum resource requirements, together with the development of procedures to overcome inevitable residual imperfections in physical systems3,4,5. Many designs have been proposed, but none allow a large quantum computer to be built in the near future6. Moreover, the known protocols for constructing reliable quantum computers from unreliable components can be complicated, often requiring many operations to produce a desired transformation3,4,5,7,8. Here we show how a single technique---a generalization of quantum teleportation9---reduces resource requirements for quantum computers and unifies known protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that single quantum bit (qubit) operations, Bell-basis measurements and certain entangled quantum states such as Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) states10---all of which are within the reach of current technology---are sufficient to construct a universal quantum computer. We also present systematic constructions for an infinite class of reliable quantum gates that make the design of fault-tolerant quantum computers much more straightforward and methodical.},

	abstract = {Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) represents a relaxation of the security assumptions made in usual quantum key distribution (QKD). As in usual QKD, the security of DIQKD follows from the laws of quantum physics, but contrary to usual QKD, it does not rely on any assumptions about the internal working of the quantum devices used in the protocol. In this paper, we present in detail the security proof for a DIQKD protocol introduced in Ac{\'\i}n et al (2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 230501). This proof exploits the full structure of quantum theory (as opposed to other proofs that exploit only the no-signaling principle), but only holds against collective attacks, where the eavesdropper is assumed to act on the quantum systems of the honest parties independently and identically in each round of the protocol (although she can act coherently on her systems at any time). The security of any DIQKD protocol necessarily relies on the violation of a Bell inequality. We discuss the issue of loopholes in Bell experiments in this context.},

	abstract = {To process information using quantum-mechanical principles, the states of individual particles need to be entangled and manipulated. One way to do this is to use trapped, laser-cooled atomic ions. Attaining a general-purpose quantum computer is, however, a distant goal, but recent experiments show that just a few entangled trapped ions can be used to improve the precision of measurements. If the entanglement in such systems can be scaled up to larger numbers of ions, simulations that are intractable on a classical computer might become possible.},

@article{Friis:2019aa,
	abstract = {Entanglement is an important resource for quantum technologies. There are many ways quantum systems can be entangled, ranging from the two-qubit case to entanglement in high dimensions or between many parties. Consequently, many entanglement quantifiers and classifiers exist, corresponding to different operational paradigms and mathematical techniques. However, for most quantum systems, exactly quantifying the amount of entanglement is extremely demanding, if at all possible. Furthermore, it is difficult to experimentally control and measure complex quantum states. Therefore, there are various approaches to experimentally detect and certify entanglement when exact quantification is not an option. The applicability and performance of these methods strongly depend on the assumptions regarding the involved quantum states and measurements, in short, on the available prior information about the quantum system. In this Review, we discuss the most commonly used quantifiers of entanglement and survey the state-of-the-art detection and certification methods, including their respective underlying assumptions, from both a theoretical and an experimental point of view.},

From the mathematical perspective bipartite EWs provide highly non-trivial generalization of positive operators and establish elegant correspondence with the theory of positive maps in matrix algebras. We concentrate on theoretical analysis of various important notions like decomposability, atomicity, optimality, extremality and exposedness. Several methods of construction are provided as well. Our discussion is illustrated by many examples enabling the reader to see the intricate structure of these objects. It is shown that the theory of EWs finds elegant geometric formulation in terms of convex cones and related geometric structures.},

Being a peculiar form of entanglement, bound entanglement emerges in certain mixed quantum states. This form of entanglement is not distillable by local operators and classical communication. Bound-entangled states are different from both the free entangled (distillable) and separable states. Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of a four-qubit polarization bound-entangled state, the so-called Smolin state. We have fully characterized its entanglement properties. Moreover, we have realized unlocking of the entanglement protocol for this state. The special properties of the Smolin state constitute a useful quantum resource for new multiparty communication schemes.},

	abstract = {While entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities were initially thought to be equivalent quantum phenomena, we now have different examples of entangled states whose correlations can be described by local hidden-variable models and, therefore, do not violate any of the Bell inequalities. We provide an up-to-date overview of the existing literature regarding local hidden-variable models for entangled quantum states, in both the bipartite and multipartite cases, and discuss some of the most relevant open questions in this context. Our review covers twenty five years of this line of research, beginning with the seminal work by Werner (1989 Phys. Rev. A 40 8), which provided the first example of an entangled state with a local model. Wernerʼs work, in turn, appeared twenty five years after the seminal work by Bell (1964 Physics 1 195), about the impossibility of recovering the predictions of quantum mechanics using a local hidden-variable theory.

This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to `50 years of Bell's theorem'.},

	abstract = {Gate-model quantum computers promise to solve currently intractable computational problems if they can be operated at scale with long coherence times and high-fidelity logic. Neutral-atom hyperfine qubits provide inherent scalability owing to their identical characteristics, long coherence times and ability to be trapped in dense, multidimensional arrays1. Combined with the strong entangling interactions provided by Rydberg states2--4, all the necessary characteristics for quantum computation are available. Here we demonstrate several quantum algorithms on a programmable gate-model neutral-atom quantum computer in an architecture based on individual addressing of single atoms with tightly focused optical beams scanned across a two-dimensional array of qubits. Preparation of entangled Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) states5 with up to six qubits, quantum phase estimation for a chemistry problem6 and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)7 for the maximum cut (MaxCut) graph problem are demonstrated. These results highlight the emergent capability of neutral-atom qubit arrays for universal, programmable quantum computation, as well as preparation of non-classical states of use for quantum-enhanced sensing.},

@article{Augusiak_2011,
	abstract = {Very recently, a conjecture saying that the so-called structural physical approximations (SPAs) to optimal positive maps (optimal entanglement witnesses) give entanglement breaking (EB) maps (separable states) has been posed (Korbicz et al 2008 Phys. Rev. A 78 062105). The main purpose of this contribution is to explore this subject. First, we extend the set of entanglement witnesses supporting the conjecture. Then, we ask whether SPAs constructed from other than the depolarizing channel maps also lead to EB maps and show that in general this is not the case. On the other hand, we prove an interesting fact that for any positive map Λ, there exists an EB channel Φ such that the SPA of Λ constructed with the aid of Φ is again an EB channel. Finally, we ask similar questions in the case of continuous variable systems. We provide a simple way of constructing SPA and prove that in the case of the transposition map it gives the EB channel.},

	abstract = {Communication networks have multiple users, each sending and receiving messages. A multiple access channel (MAC) models multiple senders transmitting to a single receiver, such as the uplink from many mobile phones to a single base station. The optimal performance of a MAC is quantified by a capacity region of simultaneously achievable communication rates. We study the two-sender classical MAC, the simplest and best-understood network, and find a surprising richness in both a classical and quantum context. First, we find that quantum entanglement shared between senders can substantially boost the capacity of a classical MAC. Second, we find that optimal performance of a MAC with bounded-size inputs may require unbounded amounts of entanglement. Third, determining whether a perfect communication rate is achievable using finite-dimensional entanglement is undecidable. Finally, we show that evaluating the capacity region of a two-sender classical MAC is in fact NP-hard.},

@article{Cavalcanti_2016,
	abstract = {Quantum steering refers to the non-classical correlations that can be observed between the outcomes of measurements applied on half of an entangled state and the resulting post-measured states that are left with the other party. From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an entanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised measurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that lies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Moreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum information protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted. Because of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an overview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite programming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to address a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and applications. We also give a brief overview of some important results that are not directly related to semidefinite programming. Finally, we make available a collection of semidefinite programming codes that can be used to study the topics discussed in this article.},

@article{doi:10.1098/rspa.1985.0070,
	abstract = { It is argued that underlying the Church--Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory. },

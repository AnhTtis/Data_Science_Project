    "abstract": "Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a collection of observables that can characterize separable states and, experimentally, estimating EWs can verify entangled states. In this work, we show that a fixed measurement setting on a multipartite entangled state, which we introduce as a network state for the purpose, can estimate EWs. Namely, entangled states can be fully verified in a measurement-based manner, in which experimenters do not necessarily change measurement settings. We present a fixed measurement setting and network states for estimating decomposable EWs, equivalent to the partial transpose criteria. We also consider non-decomposable EWs that detect bound entangled states beyond the partial transpose criteria. The results can be extended to multipartite states such as graph states, a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, and readily applied to distributed settings such as quantum metrology or sensor networks where multipartite entangled states are resourceful.",

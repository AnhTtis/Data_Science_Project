	abstract = {We present the R package mgm for the estimation of k-order mixed graphical models (MGMs) and mixed vector autoregressive (mVAR) models in high-dimensional data. These are a useful extensions of graphical models for only one variable type, since data sets consisting of mixed types of variables (continuous, count, categorical) are ubiquitous. In addition, we allow to relax the stationarity assumption of both models by introducing time-varying versions of MGMs and mVAR models based on a kernel weighting approach. Time-varying models offer a rich description of temporally evolving systems and allow to identify external influences on the model structure such as the impact of interventions. We provide the background of all implemented methods and provide fully reproducible examples that illustrate how to use the package.},

	abstract = {We introduce varbvs, a suite of functions written in R and MATLAB for regression analysis of large-scale data sets using Bayesian variable selection methods. We have developed numerical optimization algorithms based on variational approximation methods that make it feasible to apply Bayesian variable selection to very large data sets. With a focus on examples from genome-wide association studies, we demonstrate that varbvs scales well to data sets with hundreds of thousands of variables and thousands of samples, and has features that facilitate rapid data analyses. Moreover, varbvs allows for extensive model customization, which can be used to incorporate external information into the analysis. We expect that the combination of an easy-to-use interface and robust, scalable algorithms for posterior computation will encourage broader use of Bayesian variable selection in areas of applied statistics and computational biology. The most recent R and MATLAB source code is available for download at Github (https://github.com/pcarbo/varbvs), and the R package can be installed from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=varbvs).},

	abstract = {In this article, we study time-varying graphical models based on data measured over a temporal grid. Such models are motivated by the needs to describe and understand evolving interacting relationships among a set of random variables in many real applications, for instance, the study of how stock prices interact with each other and how such interactions change over time. We propose a new model, LOcal Group Graphical Lasso Estimation (loggle), under the assumption that the graph topology changes gradually over time. Specifically, loggle uses a novel local group-lasso type penalty to efficiently incorporate information from neighboring time points and to impose structural smoothness of the graphs. We implement an ADMM-based algorithm to fit the loggle model. This algorithm utilizes blockwise fast computation and pseudo-likelihood approximation to improve computational efficiency. An R package loggle has also been developed and is available at https://cran.r-project.org/. We evaluate the performance of loggle by simulation experiments. We also apply loggle to S\&P 500 stock price data and demonstrate that loggle is able to reveal the interacting relationships among stock prices and among industrial sectors in a time period that covers the recent global financial crisis. The supplemental materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many other complex diseases. This study has been partly motivated by the unsupervised heterogeneity analysis for complex diseases based on molecular and imaging data, for which, network-based analysis, by accommodating the interconnections among variables, can be more informative than that limited to mean, variance, and other simple distributional properties. In the literature, there has been very limited research on network-based heterogeneity analysis, and a common limitation shared by the existing techniques is that the number of subgroups needs to be specified a priori or in an ad hoc manner. In this article, we develop a penalized fusion approach for heterogeneity analysis based on the Gaussian graphical model. It applies penalization to the mean and precision matrix parameters to generate regularized and interpretable estimates. More importantly, a fusion penalty is imposed to “automatedly” determine the number of subgroups and generate more concise, reliable, and interpretable estimation. Consistency properties are rigorously established, and an effective computational algorithm is developed. The heterogeneity analysis of non-small-cell lung cancer based on single-cell gene expression data of the Wnt pathway and that of lung adenocarcinoma based on histopathological imaging data not only demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach but also lead to interesting new findings.},

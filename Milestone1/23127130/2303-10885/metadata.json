    "abstract": "Lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) devices play critical roles in quantum information processing. However, for special applications like quantum key distribution (QKD), the characteristics of materials and devices and their impact on practical systems must be intensively inquired. For the first time, we reveal that the photorefractive effect in LN can be utilized as a potential loophole to carry out malicious attacks by the eavesdroppers. We take a commercial LN-based variable optical attenuator as an example to demonstrate the method we named Induced-photorefractive attack (IPA) and propose two techniques to enable controllable attacks. Our results show that eavesdroppers can fulfill an efficient source-side attack by injecting an optimized irradiation beam with only several nanowatts, which is realistic when accessing commercial fiber channels. These measure and techniques can be employed for all individual and on-chip LN devices and initially explored a new security branch for system design and standardization of real-life QKD.",

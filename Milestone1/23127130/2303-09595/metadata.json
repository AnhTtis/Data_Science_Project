    "abstract": "Experimental isomeric ratios of light (A$\\le$4) particle-induced nuclear reactions were compiled for the product nuclides having metastable states with half-lives longer than 0.1 sec. The experimental isomeric ratio data were taken from the EXFOR library and reviewed. When an experiment reports isomer production cross sections instead of isomeric ratios, the cross sections taken from the EXFOR library were converted to the isomeric ratios by us. During compilation, questionable data (e.g.,preliminary data compiled in EXFOR in parallel with their final data, sum of isomer production cross sections larger than the total production cross sections) were excluded. As an application of the new compilation, goodness-of-fit was studied for the isomeric ratios predicted by the reaction model code TALYS-1.96.",

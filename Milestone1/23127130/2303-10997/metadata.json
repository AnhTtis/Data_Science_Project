    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the following invariance equation involving two $2$-variable generalized Bajraktarević means, i.e., we aim to solve the functional equation $$\n  f^{-1}\\bigg(\\frac{p_1(x)f(x)+p_2(y)f(y)}{p_1(x)+p_2(y)}\\bigg)+g^{-1}\\bigg(\\frac{q_1(x)g(x)+q_2(y)g(y)}{q_1(x)+q_2(y)}\\bigg)=x+y \\qquad(x,y\\in I), $$ where $I$ is a nonempty open real interval and $f,g:I\\to\\mathbb{R}$ are continuous, strictly monotone and $p_1,p_2,q_1,q_2:I\\to\\mathbb{R}_+$ are unknown functions. The main result of the paper shows that, assuming four times continuous differentiability of $f$, $g$, twice continuous differentiability of $p_1$ and $p_2$ and assuming that $p_1$ differs from $p_2$ on a dense subset of $I$, a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality above is that the unknown functions are of the form $$\n  f=\\frac{u}{v},\\qquad g=\\frac{w}{z},\\qquad \\mbox{and}\\qquad\n  p_1q_1=p_2q_2=vz, $$ where $u,v,w,z:I\\to\\mathbb{R}$ are arbitrary solutions of the second-order linear differential equation $F''=γF$ ($γ\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is arbitrarily fixed) such that $v>0$ and $z>0$ holds on $I$ and $\\{u,v\\}$ and $\\{w,z\\}$ are linearly independent.",

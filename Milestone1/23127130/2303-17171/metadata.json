    "abstract": "We determine $|V_{cb}|$ from the inclusive semileptonic decay width of the $B$ meson with the known N$^3$LO perturbative coefficients for the first time in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ mass scheme. We make use of a recently developed method, dual-space-renormalon-subtraction (DSRS) method, to separate and subtract the order $Λ_{\\rm QCD}^2/m_b$ infrared renormalon. This allows us to perform the analysis accurately in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ mass scheme, in which otherwise the perturbative series does not converge well up to the currently calculated perturbation order. Our result reads $|V_{cb}|=0.0415\\,(^{+10}_{-12})$, which is consistent with the previous results based on other mass schemes and showing an independent cross check of the current theoretical evaluation of the inclusive decay width.",

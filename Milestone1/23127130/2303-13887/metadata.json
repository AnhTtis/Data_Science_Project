    "abstract": "We propose a new, simple framework for crafting adversarial examples for black box attacks. The idea is to simulate the substitution model with a non-trainable model compounded of just one layer of handcrafted convolutional kernels and then train the generator neural network to maximize the distance of the outputs for the original and generated adversarial image. We show that fooling the prediction of the first layer causes the whole network to be fooled and decreases its accuracy on adversarial inputs. Moreover, we do not train the neural network to obtain the first convolutional layer kernels, but we create them using the technique of F-transform. Therefore, our method is very time and resource effective.",

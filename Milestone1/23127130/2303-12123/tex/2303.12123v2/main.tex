\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
3D reconstruction of medical imaging from 2D images has become an increasingly interesting topic with the development of deep learning models in recent years. Previous studies in 3D reconstruction from limited X-ray images mainly rely on learning from paired 2D and 3D images, where the reconstruction quality relies on the scale and variation of collected data. This has brought significant challenges in the collection of training data, as only a tiny fraction of patients take two types of radiation examinations in the same period. Although simulation from higher-dimension images could solve this problem, the variance between real and simulated data could bring great uncertainty at the same time. In oral reconstruction, the situation becomes more challenging as only a single panoramic X-ray image is available, where models need to infer the curved shape by prior individual knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Oral-3Dv2 to solve this cross-dimension translation problem in dental healthcare by learning solely on projection information, i.e., the projection image and trajectory of the X-ray tube. Our model learns to represent the 3D oral structure in an implicit way by mapping 2D coordinates into density values of voxels in the 3D space. To improve efficiency and effectiveness, we utilize a multi-head model that predicts a bunch of voxel values in 3D space simultaneously from a 2D coordinate in the axial plane and the dynamic sampling strategy to refine details of the density distribution in the reconstruction result. Extensive experiments in simulated and real data show that our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models without learning from paired images or prior individual knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of a non-adversarial-learning-based model in 3D radiology reconstruction from a single panoramic X-ray image.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a new method for reconstructing the 3D oral structure from projection information in panoramic X-ray imaging. We utilize an implicit representation model with multi-head architecture to accommodate the imaging process of PX and a dynamic sampling strategy to refine the reconstruction results. Unlike existing deep learning models like Oral-3D, our method does not require extensive patient data or dense annotations to reconstruct the complicated structure of oral cavity. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models both qualitatively and quantitatively with clear density details of teeth and the mandible in the reconstructed oral structure. Furthermore, the complexity analysis show that our method has great potential in clinical applications with the low radiation and comparable reconstruction speed.

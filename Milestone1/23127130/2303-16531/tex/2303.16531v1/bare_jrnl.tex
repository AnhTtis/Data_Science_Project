% \usepackage{caption}
% \usepackage{subcaption}
% \usepackage[russian]{babel}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



\usepackage[final]{graphicx}
%\usepackage{subfig}
\graphicspath{{images/}}


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


\usepackage{multicol}

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
% \usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


\captionsetup{width=0.39\textwidth}


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter

\IEEEPARstart{I}{nformation} surrounds people everywhere in modern life. 
Text is a very efficient type of information that people have used for communication for centuries. 
AI-based technologies help us to automate data processing. 
Data science community developed models that reach super-human accuracy on the variety of tasks. 
However, automated text-in-the-wild recognition remains a challenging problem. 

% \hfill mds
% \hfill August 26, 2015

The complications originate from the complex nature of the real-world scenes. 
Text be hard to see besides other dominant objects on an image. 
The background can have too high color variation. 
Text itself can be curved, bent and assume different forms. 
It can be visually noisy due to imperfect lighting conditions, overlappings, etc.

The major limitation for a DL system is the lack of training data. 
For the competitive performance, training set must contain many samples that replicate the real-world cases.
While there are many high-quality datasets for English text recognition, there are no available datasets for Russian language. 
In this paper, we present a large-scale human-labeled dataset for Russian text recognition in-the-wild. 
We also publish a synthetic dataset and code to reproduce the generation process. 

There are many applications for text recognition in images~\cite{long2021scene} and in video~\cite{yin2016text}.
They include: water meter number reading~\cite{8606091}, content-based image retrieval~\cite{schroth2011exploiting}, robot navigation~\cite{schulz2015robot}, transportation~\cite{chowdhury2013extracting}, interactive translation~\cite{hsueh2011interactive}, vision-impaired people assistance~\cite{khan2020ai}.
The code can be easily adjusted for a specific problem. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:related_work} we overview the existing text datasets.
In Section~\ref{sec:titw_dataset} we describe human-annotated Russian text recognition dataset.
In Section~\ref{sec:synth_dataset} we describe a tool for synthetic Russian text dataset generation, and describe the created dataset.
% In Section~\ref{sec:experiments} we conduct experiments with both datasets.



\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\subsubsection{ Natural Scene Text Datasets }

Datasets form the basis of AI development.
It is essential to have a relevant dataset to train an accurate model.
There are publicly available datasets for text recognition.

Street View House Numbers~(SVHN) dataset~\cite{netzer2011reading} is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
It has 10 digits classes and 100K annotated digits in total.
Char dataset~\cite{deCampos09} has over 7K characters obtained from natural images.

SCUT-CTW1500 dataset~\cite{yuliang2017detecting} consists of 1.5K manually picked text images from the Internet.
Total-Text dataset~\cite{ch2017total} contains over 1.5K images with text.
The samples in this dataset can be curved and cover various text orientations.

DOST dataset~\cite{he2018end} contains 30K frames for text recognition in video sequences.

COCO-Text~\cite{gomez2017icdar2017} is based on MS~COCO dataset and contains 173,589 labeled text regions in over 63K images.
TextOCR dataset~\cite{singh2021textocr} 900K annotated words over 28K images. 
OpenTextImages~\cite{krylov2021open} is a large text recognition dataset with multiple tasks.
It consists of more than 207K images and 2.5M instances.
Uber-Text dataset~\cite{zhang2017uber} has 110K street view images with text.

HierText~\cite{long2022towards} is the dataset featuring hierarchical annotations of text in natural images.
The goal of the dataset is to detect text as masks and further group them into clusters.

% Street View Text (SVT)

There are datasets that cover not only English texts.
ICDAR~\cite{karatzas2013icdar} is a Robust Reading Competition launched in 2003.
It started with 509 natural scene images with text, and significantly progressed over the years.
Now it is a multi-lingual benchmark for text recognition~(MLT-19)~\cite{nayef2019icdar2019}.
It has more that 20K images with annotations for 4 text-related tasks.
Chinese Street View Text~\cite{sun2019chinese} is a large-scale dataset with partial supervision. 
It contains 430K images.
30K images are fully annotated.
However, these datasets do not have Russian text or any other language with Cyrillic script.



\subsubsection{ Synthetic Text Datasets }

When there are no relevant training datasets, one can either collect a new dataset~\cite{XtremeAugment} or generate a synthetic one~\cite{dandekar2018comparative}.
Dataset collection and annotation is very time-consuming and expensive.
For some problems it is easier to generate a dataset that is suitable for model training.
There are many synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks. 
They cover both indoor~\cite{roberts2021hypersim} and outdoor environment~\cite{ros2016synthia}. 


One can also find synthetic datasets for the text recognition task.
UnrealText dataset~\cite{long2020unrealtext} has 600K synthetic images with text embedded into modelled scene surfaces.
There are more than 12M cropped text instances in this dataset.

Synth90k~\cite{jaderberg2014synthetic} is a synthetic word dataset. 
It has 9M word-level crops. 
They apply basic image augmentations such as projective distortion, simple blending and noise.

SynthText dataset~\cite{synthtext} has over 800K images, and the total of 6M words.
This is the largest text dataset and a popular tool for dataset generation.
However, it requires either pre-computed depth and segmentation maps or switching between multiple programming languages, namely Python and Matlab, which is proprietary.

The described synthetic datasets do not support Russian language.
To the best of our knowledge, there are only several Russian-language datasets, any they are for handwritten text only.
The dataset of Peter the Great’s manuscripts contains 9694 images~\cite{potanin2021digital}. 
Russian and Kazakh handwritten text dataset HKR has 63K short strings by 200 writers~\cite{nurseitov2021handwritten}.

\section{ Russian Text in the Wild Dataset }
\label{sec:titw_dataset}


In this work, we share both a real-world text in-the-wild dataset with human annotations and a synthetic dataset.
The real-world dataset contains over 13K images accompanied with paragraph-level annotations.
Each paragraph annotation has a bounding box and single text string in~Fig.{\ref{fig:titw_examples}}.
Bounding boxes are not tight to include text background. 
Text annotations include digits and common punctuation (.,?!:;-). 
% Letter "ё"  is distinguished from letter "е".
Other special characters are ignored. 
Text is case-sensitive. 
We annotate both Cyrillic and Latin letters. 
Vertical text has separate bounding box for each column. 
Very small and unclear text is ignored.

% \section{ Method }
\section{ Synthetic Russian Text Dataset }
\label{sec:synth_dataset}



% {\color{red} Generation pipeline }
\subsection{ Generation pipeline }


Our pipeline is based on the SynthText dataset generation pipeline~\cite{synthtext}.
We modified it for higher flexibility and better visual realism.


To exclude missing annotations, we must consider that original images can already contain text.
To detect such cases, we use the CRAFT model~\cite{craft}. It is a character-level text detection model.
With text bounding boxes we can either filter an image out or blur the detected text parts before adding new text.


To find an appropriate place for text insertion, we assume that usually text is located in uniform regions.
We estimate uniform regions using boundary detection with the~(COB) model~\cite{cob}.
It produces hierarchical boundaries, which allows us to choose a scale of the selected regions. 


Text looks more realistic when it follows the shape of the objects in the original scene.
For scene geometry estimation, we use the monocular depth estimation model~(MiDaS)~\cite{midas}.
It is robust for various datasets, and gives a relative depth for every pixel. 


As in the original pipeline in~\cite{synthtext}, for each image we use the semantic segmentation map to determine the most suitable regions.
We obtain them with model in~\cite{cob}.
After the candidate regions are determined, text is sampled from the text dataset, details of which we present in the next subsection.
During sampling, text size and font are randomized. The candidate text render is generated at this stage.
After that, for each region the size text image is compared to the size of the region.
If the text image fits in the region, the reverse homography transformation is applied.
During calculation of homography, depth map is taken into account.
As a result, it allows text to blend more naturally into the image perspective-wise.
After that, text image is blended into the original image.
As in~\cite{synthtext}, we also use Poisson blending during this stage. Because of it, text repeats the texture and color features of original image region.
As a result, the text on the output image looks smoother.


\subsection{ Dataset Diversity }
The source of background images in our dataset is LAION dataset~\cite{laion}.
We severely filter it, and blur people's faces and existing text. 
One can find the statistics of the synthetic dataset in Table~\ref{tab:titw_dataset_stats}.
We use 96 Russian text fonts across 40 font families. 
Our text dataset is the dictionary of most frequent Russian words, which we filter from obscenities. We generate random number sequences of various size, add synthetic phone numbers and most frequent Russian surnames. 

Our framework allows to regulate sampling probabilities of each word.
However, in a final pipeline, we assigned the same probability for each word to obtain uniform sampling. The final statistics in our synthetic dataset is shown in~Table~\ref{tab:synth_dataset_stats}.

\subsection{ Generated Samples }
Segmentation maps add spatial information to the algorithm~(Fig.~\ref{fig:info1}), which allows for a more meaningful text synthesis on the images. On~Fig.~\ref{fig:pics1} one can see how on the synthetic text on the top occupies spatially motivated regions.


On~Fig.~\ref{fig:pics2} there is a lot of text on the original image, which normally would conflict with the synthetic data.
Naturally, such image would just be discarded. However, original text on such images already occupies very convenient regions. Such regions, by definition, are good areas for synthetic text.
By blurring out the original text, we generate synthetic one on an already suitable surface.
In addition to this, this image is the example of how the depth features (Fig.~\ref{fig:info2}) of the region are taken into account.

\end{figure}

During generation we added extra trigonometric transformations (Fig.~\ref{fig:label1}) to the text, making the text fit to a randomized section of sine curve, additionally varying the resulting data.

\end{figure}

Because of the synthetic approach, we are able to provide various range of labels for the text.
They can be used for out-of-the-box training for wide range of models, which rely on different labels.
As in the original pipeline by~\cite{synthtext}, we also provide paragraph-wise and character-wise bounding boxes, albeit we adapt them to conform with the aforementioned trigonometrical transformations.
In addition to this, we provide segmentation maps which highlight the text on the image~(Fig.~\ref{fig:label1}).

\section{Conclusion}
We created the first large-scale Russian language dataset of text in-the-wild, using both 14k of real and more than 900k synthetically generated images.
This dataset can be used to finetune and improve the existing models and be a benchmark for future research. We also release the code, which can be used to reproduce our results and generate new datasets for all kinds of computer vision tasks requiring scene-text samples.



% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study quasi-homomorphisms of quantum cluster algebras, which are quantum analogy of quasi-homomorphisms of cluster algebras introduced by Fraser. Quasi-homomorphisms of quantum cluster algebras appeared in a work by Kimura, Qin, and Wei in 2022 which they called ``variation maps''.\n  For a quantum Grassmannian cluster algebra $\\CC_q[\\Gr(k,n)]$, we show that there is an associated braid group and each generator $σ_i$ of the braid group preserves the quasi-commutative relations of quantum Plücker coordinates and exchange relations of the quantum Grassmannian cluster algebra. We conjecture that $σ_i$ also preserves $r$-term ($r \\ge 4$) quantum Plücker relations of $\\CC_q[\\Gr(k,n)]$. Up to this conjecture, we show that $σ_i$ is a quasi-automorphism of $\\CC_q[\\Gr(k,n)]$ and the braid group acts on $\\CC_q[\\Gr(k,n)]$.",

    "abstract": "The graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $H$ is not a subgraph of $G$ and $H$ is a subgraph of $G+e$ for any edge $e$ not in $G$. The saturation number for a graph $H$ is the minimum number of edges in any $H$-saturated graph of order $n$. In this paper, the saturation number for $K_p\\cup (t-1)K_q$ ($2\\leqslant p<q$) is determined, and when $t=3$ the extremal graph is determined. Moreover, the saturation number and the extremal graph for $K_p\\cup K_q\\cup K_r$ ($2\\leqslant p\\leqslant q\\leqslant r-2$) are completely determined.",

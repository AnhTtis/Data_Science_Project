In this paper, we propose Prior-RadGraphFormer, a novel detection-free method that generates radiology graphs directly from CXR images. The model incorporates prior knowledge in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs that capture the statistical relationship between anatomies and observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Prior-RadGraphFormer in the CXR-image-to-radiology-graph task. Moreover, we show that generated radiology graphs are useful for downstream tasks such as free-text reports generation and multi-label classification of pathologies. Our findings offer a promising direction for automatically generating radiology graphs from CXR images. We pave the way to automate the classification of fine-grained clinical findings structured in a radiology graph that can be applied to generate reports while allowing for the assessment of clinical correctness.

    "abstract": "This work discusses a few theories including the interaction of dark matter, cosmic strings, and locally coupled dark energy. The paper also examines mathematical models used to describe the pressure and density within a star, including the polytropic relationship and the Lane-Emden equation. Simulation results from the IllustrisTNG datasets are also presented, providing insights into the interacting dark matter solutions. With the derived solutions this paper, it explores the possible causes for the sudden disappearance of the star PHL293B-LBV",

    "abstract": "We introduce four supersymmetric (SUSY) axion models in which the strong CP problem and the $μ$ problem are solved with the help of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism and the Kim-Nilles mechanism, respectively. The axion physics enriches the SUSY model by introducing axion as a dark matter candidate and, therefore, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) could just be a part of the total dark matter. For this reason, axion relieves the tensions between SUSY models and numerous experimental measurements, such as the dark matter direct detection experiments and the precise measurements of anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_μ$. In the present paper, we investigate the constraints imposed by the latest $a_μ$ measurements and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment on the relic density of the Higgsino-like LSP. Additionally, we consider the constraints arising from the cosmology of saxions and axinos, and their impacts on the parameter space of our models are carefully examined. For the axion constituting the remaining portion of dark matter, we find that the conventional misalignment mechanism can successfully account for the correct dark matter relic density observed by the Planck satellite.",

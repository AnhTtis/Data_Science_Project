    "abstract": "Radio Access Network faces challenges from privacy and flexible wide area and local area network access. RAN is limited from providing local service directly due to centralized design of cellular network and concerns of user privacy and data security. DecentRAN or Decentralized Radio Access Network offers an alternative perspective to cope with the emerging demands of 5G Non-public Network and the hybrid deployment of 5GS and Wi-Fi in the campus network. Starting from Public key as an Identity, independent mutual authentication between UE and RAN are made possible in a privacy-preserving manner. With the introduction of decentralized architecture and network functions using blockchain and smart contracts, DecentRAN has ability to provide users with locally managed, end-to-end encrypted 5G NPN and the potential connectivity to Local Area Network via campus routers. Furthermore, the performance regarding throughput and latency are discussed, offering the deployment guidance for DecentRAN.",

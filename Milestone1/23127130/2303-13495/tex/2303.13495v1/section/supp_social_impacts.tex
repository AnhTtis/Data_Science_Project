\label{sec:impact}


Although \textit{ReVersion} can generate diverse entity combinations through inverted relations, this capability can also be exploited to synthesize real human figures interacting in ways they never did. As a result, we strongly advise users to only use \textit{ReVersion} for proper recreational purposes.

The rapid advancement of generative models has unlocked new levels of creativity but has also introduced various societal concerns. First, it is easier to create false imagery or manipulate data maliciously, leading to the spread of misinformation. Second, data used to train these models might be revealed during the sampling process without explicit consent from the data owner~\cite{tinsley2021face}. Third, generative models can suffer from the biases present in the training data~\cite{esser2020note}. We used the pre-trained Stable Diffusion~\cite{rombach2022ldm} for \textit{ReVersion}, which has been shown to suffer from data bias in certain scenarios. For example, when prompted with the phrase \textit{``a professor''}, Stable Diffusion tends to generate human figures that are white-passing and male-passing. We hope that more research will be conducted to address the risks and biases associated with generative models, and we advise everyone to use these models with discretion.

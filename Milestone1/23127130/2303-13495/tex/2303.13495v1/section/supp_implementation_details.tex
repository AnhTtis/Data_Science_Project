\label{sec:implementation_details}


All experiments are conducted on $512{\times}512$ image resolution. 
To ensure that the numerical values $\lambda_\mathrm{denoise}L_\mathrm{denoise}$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{steer}L_\mathrm{steer}$ are in comparable order of magnitude, we set $\lambda_\mathrm{denoise}=1.0$ and  $\lambda_\mathrm{steer}=0.01$. The temperature parameter $\gamma$ in the steering loss $L_\mathrm{steer}$ is set as 0.07, following~\cite{he2020momentum}. During the optimization process, we first initialize our relation prompt \R using the word \textit{``and''}, then optimize the prompt using the AdamW~\cite{loshchilov2017adamw} optimizer for 3,000 steps, with learning rate $2.5{\times}10^{-4}$ and batch size 2. In each iteration, 8 positive samples are randomly selected from the basis preposition set. During the inference process, we use classifier-free guidance for all experiments including the baselines and ablation variants, with a constant guidance weight 7.5.

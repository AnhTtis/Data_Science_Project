\subsection{Limitations and Potential Societal Impacts}

\noindent \textbf{Limitations}.
Our performance is dependent on the generative capabilities of Stable Diffusion. For instance, it might produce sub-optimal synthesis results for entities that Stable Diffusion struggles at, such as human body and human face. We discuss limitations of ``human synthesis'' and ``concept blending'' in detail in the Supplementary File with qualitative examples.


\noindent\textbf{Potential Negative Societal Impacts}.
The entity relational composition capabilities of \textit{ReVersion} could be applied maliciously on real human figures. Additional potential impacts are discussed in the Supplmentary File in depth.

\section{The ReVersion Benchmark}

To facilitate fair comparison for \textit{Relation Inversion}, we present the \textbf{ReVersion Benchmark}. It consists of diverse \textit{relations} and \textit{entities}, along with a set of well-defined text \textit{descriptions}. This benchmark can be used for conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additional details are in Supplementary File.


\noindent\textbf{Relations and Entities.} We define ten representative object relations with different abstraction levels, ranging from basic spatial relations (\eg,~\textit{``on top of''}), entity interactions (\eg, \textit{``shakes hands with''}), to abstract concepts (\eg,~\textit{``is carved by''}). A wide range of entities, such as animals, human, household items, are involved to further increase the diversity of the benchmark.

\noindent\textbf{Exemplar Images and Text Descriptions.} For each relation, we collect four to ten exemplar images containing different entities. We further annotate several text templates for each exemplar image to describe them with different levels of details\footnote{For example, a photo of a cat sitting on a box could be annotated as \textbf{1)} \textit{``cat \R{} box"}, \textbf{2)} \textit{``an orange cat \R{} a black box"} and \textbf{3)} \textit{``an orange cat \R{} a black box, with trees in the background"}. Detailed examples will be in the Supplementary File.}. These training templates can be used for the optimization of the relation prompt.

\noindent\textbf{Benchmark Scenarios.} To validate the robustness of the \RI{} methods, we design 100 inference templates composing of different object entities for each of the ten relations. This provides a total of 1,000 inference templates for performance evaluation.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we take the first step forward and propose the \textbf{\RI{}} task, which aims to learn a relation prompt to capture the relation that co-exists in multiple exemplar images. In our \textbf{\textit{ReVersion Framework}}, we use \textit{relation-steering contrastive learning} scheme to effectively guide the relation prompt towards relation-dense regions in the text embedding space, and our \textit{relation-focal importance sampling} scheme shift the focus from visual details to high-level relations. We also contribute the \textbf{\textit{ReVersion Benchmark}} for performance evaluation. Our proposed \textbf{\RI{}} task would be a good inspiration for future works in various domains such as generative model inversion, representation learning, few-shot learning, visual relation detection, and scene graph generation.

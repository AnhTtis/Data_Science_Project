\label{sec:prepositions}


As stated in the manuscript, we devise a set of basis prepositions to steer the learning process of the relation prompt. Specifically, we collect a comprehensive list of $\sim$100 prepositions from~\cite{stevenson2010oxford}, and drop the prepositions that describes non-visual relations (\ie, temporal relations, causal relations, \textit{etc}.), while keep the ones that are related to visual relations. For example, the prepositional word \textit{``until"} is discarded as a temporal preposition, while words like \textit{``above"}, \textit{``beneath"}, \textit{``toward"} will be kept as plausible basis prepositions.

The basis preposition set contains a total of 56 words, listed in Table~\ref{tab:preposition_words}.

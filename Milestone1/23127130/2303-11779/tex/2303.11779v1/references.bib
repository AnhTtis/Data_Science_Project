abstract="In this paper, we consider the online version of the minimum hitting set problem, where geometric objects arrive one by one. The online algorithm must maintain a hitting set for the arrived objects by making irrevocable decisions. Here the centers of objects and hitting points are in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^d{\$}{\$}Rdand {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}Z{\}}^d{\$}{\$}Zd, respectively. First, we show that for hitting unit intervals using points from {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}Z{\}}{\$}{\$}Z, one can achieve a tight bound of 2. Then, we consider the case of d-dimensional unit hypercubes. At first, we prove that every deterministic online algorithm for hitting unit hypercubes has a competitive ratio of at least {\$}{\$}d+1{\$}{\$}d+1when {\$}{\$}d{\backslash}in {\backslash}mathbb {\{}N{\}}{\$}{\$}d∈N. Later, for {\$}{\$}d=2{\$}{\$}d=2, we propose a deterministic online algorithm with a competitive ratio of at most 4 and for {\$}{\$}d>2{\$}{\$}d>2, we propose a randomized algorithm having a competitive ratio of {\$}{\$}O(d^2){\$}{\$}O(d2). Next, we consider the case of unit balls in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^d{\$}{\$}Rd. We show that every deterministic online algorithm for hitting balls has a competitive ratio of at least {\$}{\$}d+1{\$}{\$}d+1when {\$}{\$}d<4{\$}{\$}d<4. Then, we propose a deterministic algorithm having a competitive ratio of at most {\$}{\$}O(d^4){\$}{\$}O(d4)and O(1), for {\$}{\$}d{\backslash}ge 4{\$}{\$}d≥4and {\$}{\$}d=3{\$}{\$}d=3, respectively. At last, for unit disks in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^2{\$}{\$}R2, we propose a simple deterministic algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of at most 4.",

abstract="A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

    "abstract": "The Universe is currently in a phase of accelerated expansion, a fact that was experimentally proven in the late 1990s. Cosmological models involving scalar fields allow the description of this accelerated expansion regime in the Cosmos and present themselves as a promising alternative in the study of the inflationary eras, specially the actual one which is driven by the dark energy. In this work we use the $f(R,T) - Λ(φ)$ gravity to find complete cosmological scenarios for our Universe. We show that the analytic cosmological parameters are compatible with a good description of several eras that the Universe passes through. We also introduce a new path to find analytic cosmological models which may have a non-trivial mapping between $f$ and $T$.",

In this work, we have demonstrated an extension to IRIS to allow it to generate convex collision-free regions in configuration space when the mapping to task space is nonlinear.
These regions can be generated efficiently and the algorithm, IRIS-NP, scales to high-degree-of-freedom manipulators.
The regions generated by IRIS-NP are incredibly valuable for planning motions \cite{marcucci2022motion} and can be made probabilistically certified.
We've also shown how this process can handle additional nonlinear constraints on the configuration and how regions can be refined to handle changes to the environment.

While the ability to refine these regions does enable adapting regions to changes in the collision geometry, the current refinement process only works well for changes that add collision geometry or shrink existing regions of C-free. Handling the cases where objects move significantly or even leave the scene, without having to regenerate the regions from scratch is a focus of future work.  In addition, \citet{marcucci2022motion} demonstrated that the amount of overlap between regions created trade offs between coverage of C-free and planning time. Understanding this trade off, and how to generate regions optimally for the downstream pipeline is something we continue to explore.

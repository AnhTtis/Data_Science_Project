	abstract = {The thermally coupled incompressible inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem models the flow of an electrically charged fluid under the influence of an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling. This system of partial differential equations is strongly coupled and highly nonlinear for real cases of interest. Therefore, fully implicit time integration schemes are very desirable in order to capture the different physical scales of the problem at hand. However, solving the multiphysics linear systems of equations resulting from such algorithms is a very challenging task which requires efficient and scalable preconditioners. In this work, a new family of recursive block LU preconditioners is designed and tested for solving the thermally coupled inductionless MHD equations. These preconditioners are obtained after splitting the fully coupled matrix into one-physics problems for every variable (velocity, pressure, current density, electric potential and temperature) that can be optimally solved, e.g., using preconditioned domain decomposition algorithms. The main idea is to arrange the original matrix into an (arbitrary) 2×2 block matrix, and consider an LU preconditioner obtained by approximating the corresponding Schur complement. For every one of the diagonal blocks in the LU preconditioner, if it involves more than one type of unknowns, we proceed the same way in a recursive fashion. This approach is stated in an abstract way, and can be straightforwardly applied to other multiphysics problems. Further, we precisely explain a flexible and general software design for the code implementation of this type of preconditioners.},

	abstract = {In the development of spatial difference schemes for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the preservation of continuum properties such as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, as well as required electromagnetic constraints (∇⋅B→=∇⋅j→=0, where j→=∇×B→ is the electrical current), is desirable to preserve numerical accuracy. Moreover, simplicity of the scheme is also a desirable feature, particularly when an implicit implementation is considered (the focus of this paper). We propose here a finite-volume, cell-centered (non-staggered) scheme for the extended MHD formulation that: (1) is suitable for implicit implementations in arbitrary curvilinear geometries, (2) is conservative, (3) preserves both the magnetic field and the electrical current solenoidal to machine precision, and (4) is linearly and nonlinearly stable in the absence of numerical and physical dissipation. Crucial to the viability of the scheme is the use of a clever interpolation scheme (ZIP [Hirt, J. Comput. Phys. 2 (1968) 339--355]), the proper treatment of boundary conditions in curvilinear geometry, and a novel treatment of geometric source terms in the momentum equation that ensures their exact cancellation in the absence of pressure forces.},

@article{SOVINEC2004355,
	abstract = {A conforming representation composed of 2D finite elements and finite Fourier series is applied to 3D nonlinear non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics using a semi-implicit time-advance. The self-adjoint semi-implicit operator and variational approach to spatial discretization are synergistic and enable simulation in the extremely stiff conditions found in high temperature plasmas without sacrificing the geometric flexibility needed for modeling laboratory experiments. Growth rates for resistive tearing modes with experimentally relevant Lundquist number are computed accurately with time-steps that are large with respect to the global Alfv{\'e}n time and moderate spatial resolution when the finite elements have basis functions of polynomial degree (p) two or larger. An error diffusion method controls the generation of magnetic divergence error. Convergence studies show that this approach is effective for continuous basis functions with p⩾2, where the number of test functions for the divergence control terms is less than the number of degrees of freedom in the expansion for vector fields. Anisotropic thermal conduction at realistic ratios of parallel to perpendicular conductivity (χ∥/χ⊥) is computed accurately with p⩾3 without mesh alignment. A simulation of tearing-mode evolution for a shaped toroidal tokamak equilibrium demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in nonlinear conditions, and its results are used to verify the accuracy of the numerical anisotropic thermal conduction in 3D magnetic topologies.},

@article{SHADID20161,
	abstract = {The computational solution of the governing balance equations for mass, momentum, heat transfer and magnetic induction for resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) systems can be extremely challenging. These difficulties arise from both the strong nonlinear, nonsymmetric coupling of fluid and electromagnetic phenomena, as well as the significant range of time- and length-scales that the interactions of these physical mechanisms produce. This paper explores the development of a scalable, fully-implicit stabilized unstructured finite element (FE) capability for 3D incompressible resistive MHD. The discussion considers the development of a stabilized FE formulation in context of the variational multiscale (VMS) method, and describes the scalable implicit time integration and direct-to-steady-state solution capability. The nonlinear solver strategy employs Newton--Krylov methods, which are preconditioned using fully-coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioners. These preconditioners are shown to enable a robust, scalable and efficient solution approach for the large-scale sparse linear systems generated by the Newton linearization. Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, that include MHD duct flows, an unstable hydromagnetic Kelvin--Helmholtz shear layer, and a 3D island coalescence problem used to model magnetic reconnection. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are also presented on up to 128K processors for problems with up to 1.8B unknowns on a CrayXK7.},

@article{JIANG1996104,
	abstract = {It is commonly believed that the divergence equations in the Maxwell equations are ``redundant'' for transient and timeharmonic problems, therefore most of the numerical methods in computational electromagnetics solve only two first-order curl equations or the second-order curl--curl equations. This misconception is the true origin of spurious modes and inaccurate solutions in computational electromagnetics. By studying the div--curl system this paper clarifies that the first-order Maxwell equations are not ``overdetermined,'' and the divergence equations must always be included to maintain the ellipticity of the system in the space domain, to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution and the accuracy of the numerical methods, and to eliminate the infinitely degenerate eigenvalue. This paper shows that the common derivation and usage of the second-order curl--curl equations are incorrect and that the solution of Helmholtz equations needs the divergence condition to be enforced on an associated part of the boundary. The div--curl method and the least-squares method introduced in this paper provide rigorous derivation of the equivalent second-order Maxwell equations and their boundary conditions. The node-based least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) is recommended for solving the first-order full Maxwell equations directly. Examples of the numerical solutions by LSFEM are given to demonstrate that the LSFEM is free of spurious solutions.},

The distinctive feature of the method is the use of approximate solutions that are exactly divergence-free inside each element. As a consequence, this method has a smaller computational cost than that of the discontinuous Galerkin method with standard piecewise polynomial spaces. We show that, in spite of this fact, it produces approximations of the same accuracy. We also show that this method is more efficient than the discontinuous Galerkin method using globally divergence-free piecewise polynomial bases. Finally, a post-processing technique is used to recover (2k+1)th order of accuracy when piecewise polynomials of degree k are used.},

	abstract = {In a pair of earlier papers the author showed the importance of divergence-free reconstruction in adaptive mesh refinement problems for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the importance of the same for designing robust second order schemes for MHD. Second order accurate divergence-free schemes for MHD have shown themselves to be very useful in several areas of science and engineering. However, certain computational MHD problems would be much benefited if the schemes had third and higher orders of accuracy. In this paper we show that the reconstruction of divergence-free vector fields can be carried out with better than second order accuracy. As a result, we design divergence-free weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for MHD that have order of accuracy better than second. A multi-stage Runge--Kutta time integration is used to ensure that the temporal accuracy matches the spatial accuracy. While this is achieved quite simply up to third order in time, going beyond third order is most simply achieved by using the ADER-WENO schemes that are detailed in a companion paper. (ADER stands for Arbitrary Derivative Riemann Problem.) Accuracy analysis is carried out and it is shown that the schemes meet their design accuracy for smooth problems. Stringent tests are also presented showing that the schemes perform well on those tests.},

This article is the first comprehensive review of the 50-year long history of the mimetic methodology and describes in a systematic way the major mimetic ideas and their relevance to academic and real-life problems. The supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes. Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point systems.},

@article{LipnikovMoultonSvyatskiy2008,
	abstract = {We describe a multilevel multiscale mimetic (M3) method for solving two-phase flow (water and oil) in a heterogeneous reservoir. The governing equations are the elliptic equation for the reservoir pressure and the hyperbolic equation for the water saturation. On each time step, we first solve the pressure equation and then use the computed flux in an explicit upwind finite volume method to update the saturation. To reduce the computational cost, the pressure equation is solved on a much coarser grid than the saturation equation. The coarse-grid pressure discretization captures the influence of multiple scales via the subgrid modeling technique for single-phase flow recently proposed in [Yu. A. Kuznetsov. Mixed finite element method for diffusion equations on polygonal meshes with mixed cells. J. Numer. Math., 14 (4) (2006) 305--315; V. Gvozdev. discretization of the diffusion and Maxwell equations on polyhedral meshes. Technical Report Ph.D. Thesis, University of Houston, 2007; Yu. Kuznetsov. Mixed finite element methods on polyhedral meshes for diffusion equations, in: Computational Modeling with PDEs in Science and Engineering, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, in press]. We extend significantly the applicability of this technique by developing a new robust and efficient method for estimating the flux coarsening parameters. Specifically, with this advance the M3 method can handle full permeability tensors and general coarsening strategies, which may generate polygonal meshes on the coarse grid. These problem dependent coarsening parameters also play a critical role in the interpolation of the flux, and hence, in the advection of saturation for two-phase flow. Numerical experiments for two-phase flow in highly heterogeneous permeability fields, including layer 68 of the SPE Tenth Comparative Solution Project, demonstrate that the M3 method retains good accuracy for high coarsening factors in both directions, up to 64 for the considered models. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a simple and efficient temporal updating strategy for the coarsening parameters, we achieve accuracy comparable to the fine-scale solution, but at a fraction of the cost.},

	abstract = {Various approaches to extend finite element methods to non-traditional elements (general polygons, pyramids, polyhedra, etc.) have been developed over the last decade. The construction of basis functions for such elements is a challenging task and may require extensive geometrical analysis. The mimetic finite difference (MFD) method works on general polygonal meshes and has many similarities with low-order finite element methods. Both schemes try to preserve the fundamental properties of the underlying physical and mathematical models. The essential difference between the two schemes is that the MFD method uses only the surface representation of discrete unknowns to build the stiffness and mass matrices. Since no extension of basis functions inside the mesh elements is required, practical implementation of the MFD method is simple for polygonal meshes that may include degenerate and non-convex elements. In this article, we present a new MFD method for the Stokes problem on arbitrary polygonal meshes and analyze its stability. The method is developed for the general case of tensor coefficients, which allows us to apply it to a linear elasticity problem, as well. Numerical experiments show, for the velocity variable, second-order convergence in a discrete L2 norm and first-order convergence in a discrete H1 norm. For the pressure variable, first-order convergence is shown in the L2 norm.},

Finally, we compare the performance of these schemes on a set of test cases selected from the literature in order to document the accuracy of the numerical approximation in both diffusion- and convection-dominated regimes. Moreover, we numerically investigate the behaviour of these methods in the approximation of solutions with boundary layers or internal regions with strong gradients.}},

	abstract = {The structure and dynamics of the solar corona is dominated by the magnetic field. In most areas in the corona magnetic forces are so dominant that all non-magnetic forces like plasma pressure gradient and gravity can be neglected in the lowest order. This model assumption is called the force-free field assumption, as the Lorentz force vanishes. This can be obtained by either vanishing electric currents (leading to potential fields) or the currents are co-aligned with the magnetic field lines. First we discuss a mathematically simpler approach that the magnetic field and currents are proportional with one global constant, the so-called linear force-free field approximation. In the generic case, however, the relation between magnetic fields and electric currents is nonlinear and analytic solutions have been only found for special cases, like 1D or 2D configurations. For constructing realistic nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field models in 3D, sophisticated numerical computations are required and boundary conditions must be obtained from measurements of the magnetic field vector in the solar photosphere. This approach is currently of large interests, as accurate measurements of the photospheric field become available from ground-based (for example SOLIS) and space-born (for example Hinode and SDO) instruments. If we can obtain accurate force-free coronal magnetic field models we can calculate the free magnetic energy in the corona, a quantity which is important for the prediction of flares and coronal mass ejections. Knowledge of the 3D structure of magnetic field lines also help us to interpret other coronal observations, e.g., EUV images of the radiating coronal plasma.},

	abstract = {A code is described which transfers an arbitrary initial plasma and field configuration under the constraints of mass and flux conservation into an equilibrium state by minimizing the energy of the system so that, in principle, the equilibrium attained is stable. As minimizing algorithms we used the gradient and conjugate gradient methods which are modified such that their convergence rate was greatly improved. A third method (MHF) introduces an artificial time and derives additional information on the lowest eigenvalue of the asymptotic linear problem from time history. Time integration of this method is explicit with time steps of varying length which admits a mean step two orders of magnitude larger than the usual stability limit. The computation grid is Eulerian corresponding to space-fixed cylindrical coordinates whose boundary is a torus surface with rectangular cross section. By this choice numerical flux conservation is not automatically guaranteed but it is possible to handle complicated field topologies. The code is checked against known analytical results and the dependence on the mesh size is studied. It is applied to calculate non-axisymmetric, toroidal equilibria with one or more magnetic axes and to determine the instabilities of helical l = 2 and 3 configurations.},

@article{McClymont-etal-SolarPhysics-1997,
	abstract = {An overview of the whole process of reconstructing the coronal magnetic field from boundary data measured at the photosphere is presented. We discuss the errors and uncertainties in the data and in the data reduction process. The problems include noise in the magnetograph measurements, uncertainties in the interpretation of polarization signals, the 180{\textdegree} ambiguity in the transverse field, and the fact that the photosphere is not force-free. Methods for computing the three-dimensional structure of coronal active region magnetic fields, under the force-free assumption, from these boundary data, are then discussed. The methods fall into three classes: the `extrapolation' technique, which seeks to integrate upwards from the photosphere using only local values at the boundary; the `current-field iteration' technique, which propagates currents measured at the boundary along field lines, then iteratively recomputes the magnetic field due to this current distribution; and the `evolutionary' technique, which simulates the evolution of the coronal field, under quasi-physical resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations, as currents injected at the boundary are driven towards the observed values. The extrapolation method is mathematically ill-posed, and must be heavily smoothed to avoid exponential divergence. It may be useful for tracing low-lying field lines, but appears incapable of reconstructing the magnetic field higher in the corona. The original formulation of the current-field iteration method had problems achieving convergence, but a recent reformulation appears promising. Evolutionary methods have been applied to several real datasets, with apparent success.},

	abstract = {We describe a promising new technique---the ``stress-and-relax'' method---for reconstructing the coronal magnetic field from vector magnetograph observations of the underlying photosphere. The computation uses the vector potential representation of the coronal field. The starting point for the computation is the potential magnetic field whose normal component at the lower boundary of the computational volume matches the observed normal component. The stress-and-relax method consists of alternately stressing and relaxing the computed coronal field. In the stressing phase, the vector potential in the interior of the computational volume is held fixed, while the vector potential at the lower boundary is adjusted so as to bring the computed transverse field at that boundary into closer agreement with the observed transverse field. This adjustment process distorts the magnetic field lines near the base of the coronal field. In the relaxation phase, the vector potential at the lower boundary is held fixed, while the vector potential in the interior of the computational volume is evolved in such a way that the coronal field relaxes to a nearby force-free configuration. The process of alternately stressing and relaxing the computed coronal magnetic field is continued until the transverse field at the lower boundary is as close as possible to the observed transverse field. The stress-and-relax method is numerically robust, comparatively easy to implement, and it provides a systematic framework for utilizing estimates of the measurement errors in the vector magnetograph data.},

	abstract = {We study the flux emergence process in NOAA active region 11024, between 29 June and 7 July 2009, by means of multi-wavelength observations and nonlinear force-free extrapolation. The main aim is to extend previous investigations by combining, as much as possible, high spatial resolution observations to test our present understanding of small-scale (undulatory) flux emergence, whilst putting these small-scale events in the context of the global evolution of the active region. The combination of these techniques allows us to follow the whole process, from the first appearance of the bipolar axial field on the east limb, until the buoyancy instability could set in and raise the main body of the twisted flux tube through the photosphere, forming magnetic tongues and signatures of serpentine field, until the simplification of the magnetic structure into a main bipole by the time the active region reaches the west limb. At the crucial time of the main emergence phase high spatial resolution spectropolarimetric measurements of the photospheric field are employed to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the nonlinear force-free coronal field, which is then used to test the current understanding of flux emergence processes. In particular, knowledge of the coronal connectivity confirms the identity of the magnetic tongues as seen in their photospheric signatures, and it exemplifies how the twisted flux, which is emerging on small scales in the form of a sea-serpent, is subsequently rearranged by reconnection into the large-scale field of the active region. In this way, the multi-wavelength observations combined with a nonlinear force-free extrapolation provide a coherent picture of the emergence process of small-scale magnetic bipoles, which subsequently reconnect to form a large-scale structure in the corona.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models are thought to be viable tools for investigating the structure, dynamics, and evolution of the coronae of solar active regions. In a series of NLFFF modeling studies, we have found that NLFFF models are successful in application to analytic test cases, and relatively successful when applied to numerically constructed Sun-like test cases, but they are less successful in application to real solar data. Different NLFFF models have been found to have markedly different field line configurations and to provide widely varying estimates of the magnetic free energy in the coronal volume, when applied to solar data. NLFFF models require consistent, force-free vector magnetic boundary data. However, vector magnetogram observations sampling the photosphere, which is dynamic and contains significant Lorentz and buoyancy forces, do not satisfy this requirement, thus creating several major problems for force-free coronal modeling efforts. In this paper, we discuss NLFFF modeling of NOAA Active Region 10953 using Hinode/SOT--SP, Hinode/XRT, STEREO/SECCHI--EUVI, and SOHO/MDI observations, and in the process illustrate three such issues we judge to be critical to the success of NLFFF modeling: (1) vector magnetic field data covering larger areas are needed so that more electric currents associated with the full active regions of interest are measured, (2) the modeling algorithms need a way to accommodate the various uncertainties in the boundary data, and (3) a more realistic physical model is needed to approximate the photosphere-to-corona interface in order to better transform the forced photospheric magnetograms into adequate approximations of nearly force-free fields at the base of the corona. We make recommendations for future modeling efforts to overcome these as yet unsolved problems.},

@article{osti_21120358,
	abstractnote = {The conceptual development and implementation of a scalable nonlinear solver for the time-dependent three-dimensional (3D) compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics model (MHD) is discussed. The approach is based on Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov technology, preconditioned with multigrid methods for algorithmic scalability. The key to the approach is the reformulation of the hyperbolic MHD system into a parabolic one, which is amenable to multigrid techniques. Such reformulation (parabolization) aims to render the modified system block diagonally dominant (unlike the original MHD system, which is diagonally submissive for implicit time steps {delta}t larger than the explicit Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy time step). The algorithm has been tested on a variety of 2D and 3D configurations which demonstrate its excellent algorithmic scalability properties. In particular, it is shown that, serially, the CPU time for a given simulation scales linearly with the number of unknowns, and that large CPU gains ({approx}30) are attainable with respect to an explicit approach even for moderate grids (256x256). In parallel, the algorithm features excellent scalability properties up to thousands of processors (4096) and millions of unknowns ({approx}1.3x10{sup 8})},

	abstract = { A parallel cut-cell algorithm is described to solve the free-boundary problem of the Grad--Shafranov equation. The algorithm reformulates the free-boundary problem in an irregular bounded domain and its important aspects include a searching algorithm for the magnetic axis and separatrix, a surface integral along the irregular boundary to determine the boundary values, an approach to optimize the coil current based on a targeting plasma shape, Picard iterations with Aitken's acceleration for the resulting nonlinear problem, and a Cartesian grid embedded boundary method to handle the complex geometry. The algorithm is implemented in parallel using a standard domain-decomposition approach and a good parallel scaling is observed. Numerical results verify the accuracy and efficiency of the free-boundary Grad--Shafranov solver. },

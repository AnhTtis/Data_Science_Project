\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
In this article, we presented a mimetic finite difference discretization of a regularized quasi-static perpendicular plasma dynamics model that is designed to preserve the divergence of the magnetic field. We also proposed a four-level block preconditioner where the factorization and solver strategy is exact for 2 blocks and the overall solver shows good performance. In addition, the properties of the mimetic operators help eliminate sub-blocks in the Schur complement in the third level of this preconditioner. 
The numerical results show that the fluctuations in the divergence remain within the machine precision range and that the performance of the nonlinear solver and the preconditioner allows  large time steps for a range of Lundquist numbers.
Lastly, the full VDE simulation over the actual plasma current diffusion time was shown for ITER configuration.

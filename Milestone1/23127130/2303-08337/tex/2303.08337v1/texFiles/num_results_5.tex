\subsection{Solver performance}  
\label{sec:performance}

In this section, we vary the resistivity value inside the plasma chamber and check the performance of the solver. More specifically, for each resistivity value, we examine the average numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations. The time step is fixed in each simulation, primarily depending on the plasma resistivity, such that it is always equal to 1\% of the resistive diffusion time, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
\Delta t = 0.01 \, \tau_\eta = 0.01 \, \frac{a^2 \mu_0}{\eta},
\end{equation*}
where $\mu_0$ denotes the permeability of free space and $a$ is the minor radius which is considered to be equal to 2 for the ITER.
We are interested in verifying that the performance of the solver is independent of $\eta$.

We perform the simulations for 70 time steps and report the average numbers of linear and nonlinear iterations over the entire simulations in Table~\ref{tab:iterations_varyplasmares}.
It is found that the number of nonlinear iterations seems to be stable (around 4 iterations per solve) for the different plasma resistivity values tested, whereas the simulations with lower resistivities seem to be more computationally demanding on the algebraic level as the linear solver seems to require slightly more iterations. The increase remains at a reasonable level for the resistivity range tested though. The default restart value of GMRES in PETSc is 30, which is much larger than this iteration number. 
The algorithm performance confirms our preconditioning strategy is efficient. In the future work, we will further improve the inner sub-block solver by replacing the direct solver for the $\{\V, \B\}$ block with a more scalable option.

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during training that can generalize well to test samples, even under distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from a performance drop due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm highlights the significant benefits of utilizing unlabeled data for training self-adapted models prior to inference. In this survey, we divide TTA into several distinct categories, namely, test-time (source-free) domain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, online test-time adaptation, and test-time prior adaptation. For each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms, followed by a discussion of different learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant applications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future research. A comprehensive list of TTA methods can be found at \\url{https://github.com/tim-learn/awesome-test-time-adaptation}.",

    "abstract": "Correlation functions of components of second-order tensor fields in isotropic systems can be reduced to an isotropic forth-order tensor field characterized by a few invariant correlation functions (ICFs). It is emphasized that components of this field depend in general on the coordinates of the field vector variable and thus on the orientation of the coordinate system. These angular dependencies are distinct from those of ordinary anisotropic systems. As a simple example of the procedure to obtain the ICFs we discuss correlations of time-averaged stresses in isotropic glasses where only one ICF in reciprocal space is a finite constant for large sampling times and small wavevectors. In turn this explains the observed long-range stress correlations in real space.",

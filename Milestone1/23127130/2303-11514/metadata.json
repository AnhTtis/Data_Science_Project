    "abstract": "We present a demonstration of service-based trajectory planning for a drone delivery system in a multi-drone skyway network. We conduct several experiments using Crazyflie drones to collect the drone's position data, wind speed and direction, and wind effects on voltage consumption rates. The experiments are run for a varying number of recharging stations, wind speed, and wind direction in a multi-drone skyway network. Demo: https://youtu.be/zEwqdtEmmiw",

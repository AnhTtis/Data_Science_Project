    "abstract": "Several studies have exploited the integrable structure of central spin models to deepen understanding of these fundamental systems. In recent years, an underlying supersymmetry for systems with XX interactions has been uncovered. Here we report that a class of central spin models with XY interactions is also supersymmetric and integrable. The associated Bethe Ansatz solution is presented for the case where all particles are spin-1/2.",

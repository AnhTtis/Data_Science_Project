abstract = {Citations are central to the production and sharing of knowledge, and how, why, and where citations are used has been an intense subject of study across disciplines. We discuss citational practices and the politics of knowledge production within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), drawing on parallels from related fields, and reflecting on our own experiences of being cited and not cited, citing and not citing. We also present recommendations for making concrete changes across the individual and the structural in HCI, related to how citations are viewed, and how the field might advance in solidarity towards greater citational justice.},

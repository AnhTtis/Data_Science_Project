    "abstract": "We present a self-contained treatment of the fundamental role that quasi-convex functions play in general (nonlinear second order) potential theories, which concerns the study of generalized subharmonics associated to a suitable closed subset (subequations) of the space of 2-jets. Quasi-convex functions build a bridge between classical and viscosity notions of solutions of the natural Dirichlet problem in any potential theory. Moreover, following a program initiated by Harvey and Lawson in [arXiv:0710.3991], a potential-theoretic approach is widely being applied for treating nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This viewpoint revisits the conventional viscosity approach to nonlinear PDEs [arXiv:math/9207212] under a more geometric prospective inspired by Krylov (1995) and takes much insight from classical pluripotential theory. The possibility of a symbiotic and productive relationship between general potential theories and nonlinear PDEs relies heavily on the class of quasi-convex functions, which are themselves the generalized subharmonics of a pure second order constant coefficient potential theory.",

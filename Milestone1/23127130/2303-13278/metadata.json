    "abstract": "Elongated anisotropic Gaussian filters are used for the orientation estimation of fibers. In cases where computed tomography images are noisy, roughly resolved, and of low contrast, they are the method of choice even if being efficient only in virtual 2D slices. However, minor inaccuracies in the anisotropic Gaussian filters can carry over to the orientation estimation. Therefore, we propose a modified algorithm for 2D anisotropic Gaussian filters and show that this improves their precision. Applied to synthetic images of fiber bundles, it is more accurate and robust to noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to real-world images of sheet molding compounds.",

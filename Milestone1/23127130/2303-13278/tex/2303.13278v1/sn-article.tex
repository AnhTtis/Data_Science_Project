\section{Introduction}
\label{sec1}

Gaussian filters have a wide variety of applications in image processing. Whereas isotropic Gaussian filters, being the foundation of scale space theory \cite{lindeberg96}, can be implemented easily, their anisotropic counterparts are more demanding while being just as interesting \cite{lampert06}. They give a handle on orientation as well as scale, which makes them the cornerstones of orientation space theory \cite{faas03}.

Anisotropic Gaussian filters have been employed for denoising images \cite{yang96, treece20} as they can be adapted to image structures and, hence, preserve edges. Another application is the estimation of orientations using a filter bank of anisotropic Gaussian filters. For example, local fiber directions can be estimated by the direction of the maximal response of anisotropic Gaussian filters that are aligned along a given set of directions \cite{robb07, wirjadi09a}. Unlike other established methods for fiber direction estimation \cite{eberly94, frangi98, ohser-schladitz09book, weickert99, krause10, altendorf09}, this approach does not require any differentiation.

Wirjadi et~al.~\cite{wirjadi16} and Pinter et~al.~\cite{pinter18} both identified the Maximal Response (\textit{MR}) method as robust to noise but suffering from the trade-off between runtime and accuracy in 3D. 
However, there are cases where the image quality does not allow to apply methods based on local gray-value derivatives on the one hand and where due to the production process the fibers are known to be oriented in a 2D subspace anyway. This holds for instance true for sheet molding compounds, where the reinforcing glass or carbon fibers lie within a plane. Then, only 2D images have to be analyzed. In this case, the MR method is less restricted regarding runtime and even outperforms other methods due to its robustness with respect to low image contrast \cite{schladitz16}. 

The accuracy of the direction estimation clearly depends on the accuracy of the filter responses for the considered directions. Under otherwise perfect conditions, this method's results barely depend on contrast as the filter responses scale with the contrast. Although the response differences are smaller, this does not influence which response is maximal. However, computed tomography images are often affected by noise and other artifacts. For low-contrast images, these effects have a much stronger impact on the detected direction of maximal response due to the small differences in responses for varying angles. In this case, small inaccuracies in the anisotropic Gaussian filter can impair the direction estimation further. In this paper, we will consider the case of low contrast between the foreground, i.e., fibers, and noise, while using a low resolution for the fibers.

Anisotropic Gaussian filters in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be implemented naïvely by filtering in the directions of the major and the minor axis of the  Gaussian's contour ellipses, subsequently. However, Geusebroek et~al.~\cite{geusebroek03} derived a more accurate decomposition, where at least one of two filter directions is aligned with an axis of the image grid. Whereas the naïve implementation may need interpolation for filtering in both directions, Geusebroek et~al.'s method requires interpolation for at most one filter direction. Lampert \& Wirjadi \cite{lampert06} generalized these results to $\mathbb{R}^d$ and provided explicit formulas for $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Besides implementational inaccuracies of the 1D filters, interpolation introduces spatial inhomogeneity into the filter kernels, as Lam \& Shi \cite{lam2007recursive} have shown. Therefore, they propose a modification of Geusebroek et~al.'s method which avoids interpolation altogether at the cost of an additional 1D Gaussian filtering step. However, Lam \& Shi's modification limits possible half-axis ratios 
$\omega = \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}$, %where $\sigma_1$ indicates the standard deviation of the major, and $\sigma_2$ of the minor axis, 
to $\omega \geq 0.4142$. The ratio can be lowered to $\omega \geq 0.1622$ at the cost of aliasing effects. In our setting, far smaller ratios are needed to accurately mimic the fiber shape, e.g., $\omega = 0.025$ in Section~\ref{sec:Application}.

In this paper, we therefore suggest another modification not suffering from this restriction. In Section~\ref{sec:MaxResponse}, we propose modifications to Geusebroek's decomposition that halves the number of interpolation steps. In Section~\ref{sec:Experiments}, we show that this modification improves performance. Moreover, we consider cubic instead of linear interpolation, which improves accuracy at the cost of speed. Based on synthetic fiber images, we show that the adapted method results in higher accuracy of the maximal response method. Finally, we apply our method to a real-world image of a glass fiber sheet molding compound in Section~\ref{sec:Application} and close with a conclusion.

\section{Method: Anisotropic Gaussian Filters}
\label{sec:MaxResponse}

A natural approach to calculating the anisotropic Gaussian filter in $\mathbb{R}^ d$ is to decompose it into a sequence of multiple Gaussian filters in $\mathbb{R}$, which poses a simpler problem \cite{lampert06}. The recursive scheme with infinite impulse response by Young et~al.~\cite{young95, vanVliet98, young02} has proven efficient and accurate.
For the case of $\mathbb{R}^2$, Geusebroek et~al.~\cite{geusebroek03} propose a decomposition into filters along the $x_1$-axis of the image grid and a filter along another direction that generally does not align with the grid.

Initially, consider an axis-aligned Gaussian kernel with standard deviations $\sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > 0$ centered in the origin, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aniGauss}
    \begin{split}
        g_{\sigma_1, \sigma_2}(x_1, x_2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_1} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{x_1^2}{\sigma_1^2}\right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_2} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{x_2^2}{\sigma_2^2}\right), \\~~~~~~~ x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{R}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Its contour lines are axis-aligned ellipses with half-axis ratio $\omega= \sigma_2/\sigma_1$. We now rotate the kernel to get
$g_{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \theta}$, whose major half axis points in direction $\bf{\nu}=(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))^T$ for $\theta \in [0, \pi)$. Formally,
\begin{equation*}
        g_{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \theta}(x_1, x_2)
        = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_1} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(\pmb{x}^T \pmb{\nu})^2}{\sigma_1^2}\right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_2} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(\pmb{x}^T\pmb{\nu^{\bot}})^2}{\sigma_2^2}\right),
\end{equation*}
where $\pmb{x}=(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\pmb{\nu^{\bot}}=(-\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta))^T.$

A decomposition of the corresponding filter into one-dimensional filters along the coordinate axes is generally not possible. However, Geusebroek et~al.~\cite{geusebroek03} proved that a decomposition into filters along the $x_1$-direction and the direction 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \nu_\ast &=& \nu_\ast(x_1, x_2, \theta, \sigma_1, \sigma_2) = x_1 \cos (\varphi) + x_2 \sin (\varphi) \quad\text{~ with ~}\\
    \tan \varphi &=& \frac{\sigma_2^2\cos^2 \theta + \sigma_1^2\sin^2 \theta}{\left(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2 \right) \cos \theta \sin \theta}.
\end{eqnarray*}
is indeed possible, namely with the kernel
\begin{equation*}
        g_{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \theta}(x_1, x_2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_x} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{x_1^2}{\sigma_x^2}\right) 
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_{\nu_\ast}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\nu_\ast^2}{\sigma_{\nu_\ast}^2}\right),
         ~~~ x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation*}
The standard deviations $\sigma_x, \sigma_{\nu_\ast}$ can be computed in terms of the rotation angle $\theta$ and the standard deviations $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ via 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \sigma_x &= \sigma_x(\theta, \sigma_1, \sigma_2) &= \frac{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2\cos^2 \theta + \sigma_2^2\sin^2 \theta}}\\
    \sigma_{\nu_\ast} &= \sigma_{\nu_\ast}(\theta, \sigma_1, \sigma_2) &= \frac{1}{\sin \varphi} \sqrt{\sigma_2^2\cos^2 \theta + \sigma_1^2\sin^2 \theta} 
\end{eqnarray*}

Fig.~\ref{fig:geusebroekShearing} illustrates this decomposition, see~\cite{geusebroek03} for the detailed derivation.

\subsection{Algorithms for Anisotropic Gaussian Filtering}

Gaussian filters can be implemented naïvely by rotating the image with the same matrix that rotates the filter such that its major and minor axes are aligned with the coordinate axes. Then, the image can be filtered along the coordinate axes using Young et~al.'s~\cite{young02} recursive Gaussian filter. This way, more memory is consumed as the image does not fit its previous rectangular structure anymore. Moreover, interpolation steps are necessary for both filter directions \cite{lampert06}.

Lampert \& Wirjadi's~\cite{lampert06} \textit{geometric algorithm} circumvents the interpolation along one axis by considering the filter decomposition as a shear of the coordinate axes with a shear matrix $V$. Hence, the image is sheared with $V$ before filtering along the coordinate axes. Afterwards, the resulting image is transformed back with $V^{-1}$.

In Geusebroek et~al.'s~\cite{geusebroek03} \textit{line buffer algorithm}~\cite{lampert06} the image is processed in-place as it filters along the $x_1$-axis and the $\nu_\ast$-line, see above. The transformation step necessary for filtering along the $\nu_\ast$-line is the inverse shear used in the geometric algorithm. This transformation using interpolation is necessary every time data is read or written. This can be kept minimal by using image line buffers for the filter history. However, as the recursive Gaussian filter consists of a forward and a backward filter, this yields 2 forward and 2 backward transformation steps, yielding 4 interpolation steps per pixel. 


In comparison, the geometric algorithm uses only 2 transformations and, thus, interpolations per pixel, which makes it less error-prone compared to the line buffer algorithm. However, the geometric algorithm needs more memory because the transformed image no longer fits the original rectangular shape.

\subsection{The Hybrid Algorithm}
\label{sec:hybrid}

Our improved scheme combines the advantages of both the geometric and the line buffer algorithm:
%We combined these two implementation techniques into a third one that has the advantages of both the geometric and the line buffer implementation:
It filters in $x_1$-direction with Young's recursive Gaussian filter \cite{young02} as in the line buffer algorithm. The filter in $\nu_\ast$-direction is modified such that the intermediate transformation steps are omitted: As the forward and backward filter move along the same line, the intermediate transformation steps taken together are the identity. Therefore, the result of the forward filter does not need to be transformed but can be stored in-place. This approach requires 2 interpolation steps per pixel, as in the geometric algorithm, while using as little memory as the line buffer algorithm. The difference to the established algorithms is  "smarter bookkeeping".
Hereafter, we will call this the \textit{hybrid algorithm}.

An axis-aligned filter is generally more accurate than a filter that is not axis-aligned since the latter requires interpolation. Therefore, we first filter along the axis and, subsequently, in $\nu_\ast$-direction.

So far, we only discussed a decomposition into filters where one filter direction is aligned with the $x_1$-axis. Analogously, a decomposition such that one filter direction is aligned with the $x_2$-axis is possible \cite{lampert06}. This may even be advantageous for $45^\circ \leq \theta \leq 135^\circ$: The standard deviation $\sigma_x$ of the filter along the $x_1$-axis varies over the rotation angles $\theta$, being largest for $\theta = 0^\circ$ and smallest for $\theta = 90^\circ$. For the line buffer and the hybrid algorithm, filtering along the $x_1$-axis smoothes the image in the same direction, in which the interpolation takes place. This may be less error-prone for stronger smoothing. Hence, we propose to decompose the anisotropic filter with an $x_2$-aligned axis for $45^\circ \leq \theta \leq 135^\circ$.

This modification is possible for each of the approaches mentioned above. In the following, we call this the \textit{major-axis modification}.

\subsection{Theoretical Performance Analysis}

The runtime of the anisotropic Gaussian filter is constant for each pixel and depends only on the rotation angle and not on the variance.
The filtering steps require $12$ additions and $13$ multiplications. 
Linear interpolation can be implemented with $1$ addition and $2$ multiplications per pixel.

We further propose to apply cubic interpolation with natural boundary conditions. In our implementation, each cubic interpolation step takes $8$ additions and $14$ multiplications per pixel. Therefore, we only combine it with the hybrid algorithm. The total complexities per pixel are listed in Table~\ref{tab:complexity}.
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Complexity per pixel for different algorithms with interpolation \label{tab:complexity}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
   & Line buffer & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Hybrid}\\
    &Linear&Linear&Cubic\\
  \midrule
    Multiplications & 21 & 17 & 27\\
    Additions & 16 & 14 & 20 \\
    \botrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The runtime of the MR method in total depends on the complexity of the employed anisotropic filter algorithm the discretization of the direction space, i.e., the number of angles considered, and the image size. The dependency on the latter three is linear, thus we discuss the speed of Gaussian filters, only.

\subsection{Maximal Response of Anisotropic Gaussian Filters}

To filter an image of fibers for directions, imitate the elongated shape of a fiber
with the $d$-dimensional \emph{anisotropic Gaussian (function)} $g_{\theta}$, see Eq.\,\ref{eq:aniGauss}.
Its parameters give a handle on the orientation, length, and diameter for the fiber model \citep{lampert06}.

The filter response $(\pmb{g}_{\theta} \ast \pmb{f})(\pmb{x} )$ to the image $\pmb{f}$ is maximal when $\theta$ matches the local fiber direction in the point $\pmb{x}  \in \Xi$, where $\Xi$ is the fiber system. Therefore, one can find the direction $\nu$ that maximizes the filter response for all $\pmb{x} \in \Xi$ \cite{wirjadi16}:
\begin{equation*}
    \nu(\pmb{x} ) = \underset{\theta \in S^{2}_+}{\operatorname{argmax}}(\pmb{g}_{\theta} \ast \pmb{f})(\pmb{x} )
\end{equation*}

$\nu(\pmb{x} )$ is estimated by calculating the convolution$(\pmb{g}_{\theta} \ast \pmb{f})(\pmb{x} )$ for a finite set of directions that covers the space as evenly as possible \cite{schladitz16}.
Hereafter, we will call this the \textit{MR method}.

\section{Experimental Validation}
\label{sec:Experiments}

In this section, we support the theoretical analysis with experimental results. More precisely, we show that the hybrid algorithm is more accurate than the line buffer algorithm. Employing linear interpolation, the hybrid algorithm is indeed faster than the line buffer algorithm. In the first subsection, we test the performance of anisotropic Gaussian filters as such. In the second subsection, we test performance on synthetic fiber bundles with varying noise contrast to the background.

The following experiments were carried out on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @2.70\,GHz with 16\,GiB of RAM, using the GNU compiler GCC\,9.0 on a 64-bit GNU/Linux operating system.

\subsection{Performance of Anisotropic Gaussian Filters}

In this section, we test the performance of the anisotropic Gaussian filters for the line buffer algorithm using linear interpolation, and for the hybrid algorithm using linear interpolation as well as cubic interpolation with natural boundary conditions.


\subsubsection{Accuracy}
We reconstruct the anisotropic Gaussian filter kernel by calculating the unit impulse response, i.e.,~applying the anisotropic Gaussian filter to an image of size $N\,\times\,N$ with $N = 512$, in which all pixel values are $0$ except one pixel in the image center with pixel value $1$.
%As a measure of accuracy, we use the $l_2$-norm of the reconstructed filter kernel w.r.t. the true Gaussian function.
For each algorithm and variance combination considered here, we compute the $l^2$-deviation between the reconstructed kernel $\pmb{\hat{g}}_\theta$ and the actual kernel $\pmb{g}_\theta$ as a measure of accuracy, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
    \|\pmb{\hat{g}}_\theta - \pmb{g}_\theta \|_{l^2} = \left(\sum_{i, j=1}^N (\hat{g_\theta }_{ij} - {g_\theta }_{ij})^2 \right)^\frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation*}
The mean and maximum deviation for the rotation angles $\theta  = 0^\circ, 1^\circ, ..., 179^\circ$ are reported in  Table~\ref{tab:errorGaussianKernel}.

The hybrid algorithm with linear interpolation yields more accurate results than the line buffer algorithm.
Cubic interpolation is even more accurate, except for $\sigma_1 = 7.0, \sigma_2 = 4.0$. This is most likely due to ringing artifacts, i.e., oscillations of the interpolation kernel, which is a known problem of cubic interpolation \cite{lehmann99} also known as the Runge phenomenon \cite{gautschi11}, or, more generally, Gibb's phenomenon \cite{hou78}. However, cubic interpolation improves the approximations substantially for variance combinations that otherwise yield comparably large errors for linear interpolation. Note that smaller variances go along with larger errors because the Gaussian approximation is less precise there, see \cite{young95}.

The major-axis modification achieves even higher precision compared to its counterpart without modification. Notably, the hybrid algorithm with linear interpolation and major-axis modification often outperforms the hybrid non-modified algorithm with cubic interpolation.

For elongated Gaussian kernels, the $l^2$-error changes considerably over all rotations: It is lowest for small angular deviations from the $x$-axis, that is, $\theta=0^\circ$. Between $50^\circ$ to $130^\circ$ it is considerably larger, peaking around $90^\circ$. This conforms with our motivation for the major-axis modification in Section~\ref{sec:hybrid}. Employing the hybrid algorithm, the deviations shrink significantly, see Fig.~\ref{fig:kernelError}.

\end{figure*}



\subsubsection{Throughput}

We test the algorithms' data throughput by applying the filter $30$ times to Gaussian noise images of sizes $N \times N$ with $N = 100, 130, ..., 4\,990$ and calculate the trimmed mean excluding top and bottom $10\%$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:throughput} shows that the hybrid algorithm with linear interpolation is slightly faster than the line buffer algorithm, at least for larger image sizes.
Cubic interpolation, however, takes considerably more time. This conforms to the theoretical results in Section~\ref{sec:MaxResponse}.

The major-axis modification further slows down the algorithms. For $45^\circ \leq \theta \leq 135^\circ$, the filter in $\nu_\ast$-direction iterates over all image columns, while the image pixels are saved adjacently within a line. Therefore, memory access is more expensive than it is without modification, the more so, the larger the image. This can be circumvented at the cost of memory by saving the image adjacently within a column for $45^\circ \leq \theta \leq 135^\circ$.


For all three algorithms without modification, there are two different speed plateaus in the throughput, see Fig.~\ref{fig:throughput}. As Lampert \& Wirjadi \cite{lampert06} argue, the throughput is dependent on the image size: In our implementations --- for the hybrid as well as the line buffer algorithm --- we use 4 buffers for the filter history while reading from and writing into the same image. For small image dimensions, these buffers fit into the CPU's L1 data cache. For larger image sizes, the buffer sizes exceed the cache size slowing down the computations. In our test setup the drop at $N = 1\,690$ corresponds with the system's size of the L1 data cache, namely 64 KiB, see Fig.~\ref{fig:throughput}.

\subsection{Maximal Response Method}
\label{subsec:ExperimentalValidation:maxResponse}

The experiments in the previous subsection have shown that anisotropic Gaussian filters are generally more accurately calculated with the hybrid than with the line buffer algorithm, especially with the major-axis modification. This section will show that these results translate to the accuracy of the MR method.



\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{subsubsec:SetupMaxResponse}

We evaluate the MR method on synthetic images with known constant fiber orientation. The design of the images is inspired by our application example. There, bundles of nearly parallel thin fibers form the main building block of the microstructure. The synthetic images shall mimic the fiber system within one such bundle.

Given an image of size $512\,\times\,512$ pixels, a width parameter $w$, and an angle $\theta$, we define an image $F_{\theta, w}$ by setting
\begin{equation*}
    F_{\theta, w}(x, y) = \frac{\sin(x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta))}{2w} + \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation*}
For each $\theta = 0^{\circ}, 1^{\circ}, 2^{\circ}, ..., 179^{\circ}$ and $w = 1, 2$, we generate such an image. These gray-value images represent idealized fiber bundles with known fiber direction and a radius of $r = \frac{\pi w}{2}$\,pixels.

As background noise, we generate images $B$ of size $512\,\times\,512$ with pixels sampled from the uniform distribution in $[0, 1]$. 

To model images of varying contrast between background and fiber, we consider images of the form $(1 - c) B + c F_{\theta, w}$ for $c \in [0,1]$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:contrastViz}. 
The MR method is applied as described below, which yields a mean absolute angular error \emph{MAE} w.r.t.~the known fiber direction. For comparison, we additionally apply the algorithm to images preprocessed by a median filter of size $3\,\times\,3$. This is motivated by the fact that smoothing with median filters is a typical preprocessing step for real image data.

The MAE is determined as follows. The synthetic fiber image $F_{\theta, w}$ is binarized with a threshold of $0.75$. The resulting image serves as a mask to include only pixels within fiber cores.

Further, we want to make sure that we only estimate the estimating bias and do not confound it with a sampling bias, i.e.,~lower or higher sampling probability for certain directions. For example, in an image, one can place more fibers and longer fibers in diagonal directions than in the horizontal and vertical direction. Therefore, we only evaluate pixels within a circle around the image's center. In order to avoid boundary effects, the circle radius is set to $206$~pixels.

For each realization $B$, we are interested in the maximum of the MAE over all $\theta$.

    \caption{Visualization of the experimental data set for varying contrast $c$}\label{fig:contrastViz}
\end{figure*}

We run the MR method with $\sigma_1 = 20.0, \sigma_2 = 0.75w$. This is motivated by the $2 \sigma$ rule for the normal distribution, which says that approximately $95\%$ of the data points are within two standard deviations of the mean \cite{Georgii2012}. Hence, a correctly aligned filter kernel $g_\theta$ that is centered within the fiber covers the fiber's thickness with $95\%$ of its weight when $\sigma_2 = \frac{r}{2}$, where $r$ is the fiber's radius. Pixels that are further away than $2\sigma_2$ are barely taken into account. This ensures that the filter response is maximal when the 2-dimensional Gaussian filter kernel is aligned with the fiber:
a much larger variance might take too many pixels outside of the fiber into account, while a much smaller variance results in filter kernels whose main mass is concentrated in an elliptical region that is thinner than the fibers. In this case, the ellipse might fit inside the fiber for several angles $\theta$ which makes it harder to accurately detect the point of maximum.



\subsubsection{Results}

Fig.~\ref{fig:contrastError} shows the mean error for unfiltered images as described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:SetupMaxResponse} and the standard deviations for 50 noise realizations. The hybrid algorithm outperforms the line buffer algorithm, especially for low-contrast cases. The cubic interpolation is more accurate than the linear interpolation, especially for the high contrast, but also for the low-contrast setup. The hybrid algorithm with linear interpolation and major-axis modification performs nearly as well as it does with cubic interpolation. For cubic interpolation, however, it performs just as well with the major-axis modification as it does without it.

For each noise image contrast combination, the MAE's maximum over fiber directions was calculated. The mean and standard deviations over 50 noise images are depicted as point symbol with bars for each contrast and algorithm. Note, however, that the standard deviations are small and therefore the bars delimiting the interval are in most cases covered by the symbol for the mean value}
    \label{fig:contrastError}
\end{figure*}

Applying a median filter to noisy images is a common preprocessing step to get rid of noise while preserving edges. However, the errors are considerably larger than for unfiltered images as direction information is lost by the undirected median filter.

The effect of low contrast is reduced for the larger fiber diameter of $w = 2$ in comparison to $w = 1$.

\section{Application}
\label{sec:Application}
In this section, we apply the MR method to low-contrast image data of sheet molding compound materials. Sheet molding compounds (\textit{SMC}) are a type of material consisting of stacked layers of fibers. In the automotive industry, SMC are of high interest due to their versatile behavior such as light weight, high stiffness, and strength, which is determined by their fiber direction distribution \cite{orgeas2011sheet}. Computed tomography imaging of SMC is challenging due to the high fiber volume fraction and the low difference in X-ray absorption of fiber and matrix material.

\subsection{Sheet Molding Compound with Glass Fibers}
\label{sec:ALMA}
First, we consider an SMC material with glass fibers, see Fig.~\ref{fig:applicationImageALMA}.
The image was taken using the \textmu CT device at the Fraunhofer ITWM, Kaiserslautern, Germany, with a voltage of $120$\,kV, an integration time of $999$\,ms, and 1\,200\,projections/angular steps. The device uses a Feinfocus FXE-225 X-ray tube and a PerkinElmer detector with $2\,048\,\times\,2\,048$\,pixels \cite{uCT2022}. As specified by the manufacturer, the fibers' diameter is $10$\,\textmu m. The material was scanned with a pixel spacing of $5$\,\textmu m, deliberately undersampling the fibers for the sake of imaging representative sample volumes.

We applied the line buffer and the hybrid algorithm with both linear and cubic interpolation to the sample. Based on the maximal filter response, we segmented the fiber system based on Frangi~et~al.'s enhancement filtering \cite{frangi98} and a postprocessing step based on Sliseris~et~al.'s work \cite{sliseris15}.
%For further details see \cite{}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:applicationImageALMA} shows the resulting image for the hybrid algorithm with linear interpolation. The results for the other algorithm techniques are visually not distinguishable from this result. The fiber orientation tensor as defined by Advani \& Tucker \cite{advani87}, however, indicates that the y-direction is preferred stronger when using cubic rather than linear interpolation. As the error for cubic interpolation is lower for synthetic data, we consider the result of the cubic interpolation to be the most accurate.

\subsection{Sheet Molding Compound with Carbon Fibers}
\label{sec:IVW}

As a second application, we consider images of the material SMCarbon\textregistered~24 CF50-3K by POLYNT Composites Germany GmbH. It consists of carbon fibers with a length of $25$\,mm within a vinyl ester resin. The fiber diameter is not known directly as it also changes under pressure.

The sample was scanned with the X-ray microscope Xradia~520 by Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH \cite{XRadia520} with a pixel spacing of $24.93$\,\textmu m, a voltage of $60$\,keV, a power of $5$\,W, and 3\,201 projections. The exposure time was $2$\,s, where 20 single images were taken with an exposure time of $0.1$\,s and then averaged. For the field-of-view, they used $76$\,mm\,$\times\,48$\,mm.

We applied the hybrid algorithm with linear interpolation and no modification and with $\sigma_1 = 25.0, \sigma_2 = 2.0$. Following \cite{schladitz16}, we binarized the maximal filter response using Niblack's local thresholding \cite{niblack86} with a window size of $w = 4 \sigma_2$, and the threshold $0.6$. Further, we excluded components that have a pixel size lower $100$ after eroding the mask with a square of size $2\,\times\,2$.

Despite there barely being any contrast within the fiber bundles, the MR algorithm provides a fairly accurate estimation of fiber directions.

\section{Conclusion}

We proposed an alternative algorithm for elongated anisotropic Gaussian filters in 2D, which improves throughput and accuracy. Employed in a numerical scheme for estimating fiber directions, namely the maximal response of anisotropic Gaussian filters, it improves accuracy, especially for noisy images with low contrast. We successfully applied this algorithm to real-world data sets of  sheet molding compounds.

The experiments on straight and parallel fiber bundles show that our modifications yield improved precision in this case. It was inspired by the application of SMC data such as glass fibers, see Section~\ref{sec:ALMA}. Note that the method still performs well on visibly bent carbon fibers, see Section~\ref{sec:IVW}.

Further improvement may be achieved with more accurate 1D Gaussian filters.

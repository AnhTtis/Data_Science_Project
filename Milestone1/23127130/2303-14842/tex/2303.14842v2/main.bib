	abstract = {We present a comparative study of the optical properties - reflectance, transmission and optical conductivity - and Raman spectra of two layered bismuth-tellurohalides BiTeBr and BiTeCl at 300 K and 5 K, for light polarized in the a-b planes. Despite different space groups, the optical properties of the two compounds are very similar. Both materials are doped semiconductors, with the absorption edge above the optical gap which is lower in BiTeBr (0.62 eV) than in BiTeCl (0.77 eV). The same Rashba splitting is observed in the two materials. A non-Drude free carrier contribution in the optical conductivity, as well as three Raman and two infrared phonon modes, are observed in each compound. There is a dramatic difference in the highest infrared phonon intensity for the two compounds, and a difference in the doping levels. Aspects of the strong electron-phonon interaction are identified. Several interband transitions are assigned, among them the low-lying absorption \${\textbackslash}beta\$ which has the same value 0.25 eV in both compounds, and is caused by the Rashba spin splitting of the conduction band. An additional weak transition is found in BiTeCl, caused by the lower crystal symmetry.},

This effective Zeeman field, which is originated from intrinsic spin orbit coupling induced by breaking in-plane inversion symmetry, can reach nearly a hundred Tesla in magnitude. It strongly pins the spin orientation of the electrons to the out-of-plane directions and protects the superconductivity from being destroyed by an in-plane external magnetic field. In magnetotransport experiments of ionic-gate MoS\$\_\{2\}\$ transistors, where gating prepares individual superconducting state with different carrier doping, we indeed observe a spin- protected superconductivity by measuring an in-plane critical field \${\textbackslash}textit\{B\}\$\$\_\{c2\}\$ far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The gating-enhanced \${\textbackslash}textit\{B\}\$\$\_\{c2\}\$ is more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the bulk superconducting phases where the effective Zeeman field is weakened by interlayer coupling. Our study gives the first experimental evidence of an Ising superconductor, in which spins of the pairing electrons are strongly pinned by an effective Zeeman field.},

In this work, we report the reversible electrical switching of ferromagnetic (FM) states in platinum (Pt) thin films by introducing paramagnetic ionic liquid (PIL) as the gating media. The paramagnetic ionic gating controls the movement of ions with magnetic moments, which induces itinerant ferromagnetism on the surface of Pt films with large coercivity and perpendicular anisotropy mimicking the ideal two-dimensional Ising-type FM state. The electrical transport of the induced FM state shows Kondo effect at low temperature suggesting spatially separated coexistence of Kondo scattering beneath the FM interface. The tunable FM state indicates that paramagnetic ionic gating could serve as a versatile method to induce rich transport phenomena combining field effect and magnetism at PIL-gated interfaces.},

	abstract = {Electrolyte choice is an important decision on the quest for higher-energy batteries. Besides general guidelines on the required properties of an electrolyte suitable for use in lithium–sulfur batteries, the inﬂuence of more speciﬁc physicochemical properties on its characteristics is not well understood. For this purpose, binary mixtures based on the [DEME][TFSI] and dioxolane electrolyte system for lithium–sulfur batteries was investigated in this work. Selected physicochemical properties were determined for different mixtures of solvents and lithium salt concentrations. All the electrolytes prepared were also tested in the lithium–sulfur battery system. The capacity, Coulombic efﬁciency, overpotentials and impedance spectra were analyzed and a connection between them and the determined electrolyte properties elucidated. We show that the electrolyte's conductivity does not have a direct connection to any of the battery system properties measured. The highest speciﬁc capacities were obtained with batteries compromising 1.0 M LiTFSI and the highest ratio of dioxolane in the binary solvent mixture. On the other hand, the best Coulombic efﬁciencies were obtained with batteries having high ratios of ionic liquid. Resistance and overpotential are connected parameters and are a function of the ionic liquid content. None of the monitored parameters prevail, since the best electrochemical performance in terms of speciﬁc capacity and stability was obtained with the 1.0 M LiTFSI in X[DEME][TFSI] = 0.199 electrolyte. © 2017 The Authors.

A major goal is the identification of measurable properties that directly expose the topological nature of such transitions. Here we focus on the giant-Rashba material bismuth tellurium iodine (BiTeI) which exhibits a pressure-driven phase transition between topological and trivial insulators in three-dimensions. We demonstrate that this transition, which proceeds through an intermediate Weyl semi-metallic state, is accompanied by a giant enhancement of the Berry curvature dipole which can be probed in transport and optoelectronic experiments. From first-principles calculations, we show that the Berrry-dipole --a vector along the polar axis of this material-- has opposite orientations in the trivial and topological insulating phases and peaks at the insulator-to-Weyl critical points. Consequently, near the topological phase transitions, in a low electronic density regime the nonlinear Hall conductivity increases by two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {The quantum crystal of electrons, predicted more than eighty years ago by Eugene Wigner, is still one of the most elusive states of matter. Here, we present experiments that observe the one-dimensional Wigner crystal directly, by imaging its charge density in real-space. To measure this fragile state without perturbing it, we developed a new scanning probe platform that utilizes a pristine carbon nanotube as a scanning charge perturbation to image, with minimal invasiveness, the many-body electronic density within another nanotube. The obtained images, of few electrons confined in one-dimension, match those of strongly interacting crystals, with electrons ordered like pearls on a necklace. Comparison to theoretical modeling demonstrates the dominance of Coulomb interactions over kinetic energy and the weakness of exchange interactions. Our experiments provide direct evidence for this long-sought electronic state, and open the way for studying other fragile interacting states by imaging their many-body density in real-space.},

	abstract = {One of the defining properties of electrons is their mutual Coulombic repulsion. In solids, however, this basic property may change. A famous example is that of superconductors, where coupling to lattice vibrations make electrons attract each other and leads to the formation of bound pairs. But what if all degrees of freedom are electronic? Is it still possible to make electrons attractive via their repulsion from other electrons? Such a mechanism, termed 'excitonic', was proposed fifty years ago by W. A. Little, aiming to achieve stronger and more exotic superconductivity, yet despite many experimental efforts, direct evidence for such 'excitonic' attraction is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate this unique attraction by constructing, from the bottom up, the fundamental building block of this mechanism. Our experiments are based on quantum devices made from pristine carbon nanotubes, combined with cryogenic precision manipulation. Using this platform we demonstrate that two electrons can be made to attract using an independent electronic system as the binding glue. Owing to its large tunability, our system offers crucial insights into the underlying physics, such as the dependence of the emergent attraction on the underlying repulsion and the origin of the pairing energy. We also demonstrate transport signatures of 'excitonic' pairing. This experimental demonstration of 'excitonic' pairing paves the way for the design of exotic states of matter.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03536},
	abstract = {It is believed that nanostructuring is an effective way to achieve excellent thermoelectric performance. In the work, by combining the first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer BiTeBr including both the electron and phonon transports. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for the electron part, and GGA for the phonon part. It is found that SOC has important effects on electronic transport coefficients because of SOC-induced obvious influences on energy band structures. In p-type doping, monolayer has larger Seebeck coefficient than bulk in wide doping range, which is beneficial to excellent thermoelectric performance. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity of bulk is 1.71 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{W m{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} K{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ at room temperature, which is close to experimental value 1.3 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{W m{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} K{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. Calculated results show that monolayer has better \$ZT\_e\$ and lower lattice thermal conductivity than bulk, which suggests that monolayer has better thermoelectric performance than bulk. The lower lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer than bulk is due to shorter phonon lifetimes. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of bulk with calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 3.3 \${\textbackslash}times\$ \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-14\}\$ s. Based on electron and phonon transport coefficients, the thermoelectric figure of merit \$ZT\$ of bulk and monolayer are calculated. It is found that monolayer has higher peak \$ZT\$ than bulk, and the peak \$ZT\$ of monolayer can be as high as 0.55 in n-type doping and 0.75 in p-type doping at room temperature. These results imply that monolayer BiTeBr may be a potential two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric material, which can stimulate further experimental works to synthesize monolayer BiTeBr.},

The P3m1 structure remains stable up to pressures of 5 GPa; the ratio of lattice constants, c/a, has a minimum at pressures of 2.5 - 3 GPa. In the same range, the temperature dependence of resistivity changes from metallic to semiconducting at 3 GPa and has a plateau region between 50 and 150 K in the semiconducting state. Meanwhile, the pressure variation of band structure shows that the bulk band-gap energy closes at 2.9 GPa and re-opens at higher pressures. Furthermore, according to the Wilson loop analysis, the topological nature of electronic states in noncentrosymmetric BiTeBr at 0 and 5 GPa are explicitly revealed to be trivial and non-trivial, respectively. These results strongly suggest that pressure-induced topological phase transition in BiTeBr occurs at the pressures of 2.9 GPa.},

	abstract = {The small gap semiconductor α-RuCl3 has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid materials. Thus far, Raman spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and magnetization measurements have provided valuable hints for collective spin behavior in α-RuCl3 bulk crystals. However, the goal of implementing α-RuCl3 into spintronic devices would strongly benefit from the possibility of electrically probing these phenomena. To address this, we first investigated nanoflakes of α-RuCl3 by Raman spectroscopy and observed similar behavior as in the case of the bulk material, including the signatures of possible fractionalized excitations. In complementary experiments, we investigated the electrical charge transport properties of individual α-RuCl3 nanoflakes in the temperature range between 120 and 290 K. The observed temperature-dependent electrical resistivity is consistent with variable range hopping behavior and exhibits a transition at about 180 K, close to the onset temperature observed in our Raman measurements. In conjunction with the established relation between structure and magnetism in the bulk, we interpret this transition to coincide with the emergence of fractionalized excitations due to the Kitaev interactions in the nanoflakes. Compared to the bulk samples, the transition temperature of the underlying structural change is larger in the nanoflakes. This difference is tentatively attributed to the dimensionality of the nanoflakes as well as the formation of stacking faults during mechanical exfoliation. The demonstrated devices open up novel perspectives toward manipulating the Kitaev-phase in α-RuCl3 via electrical means.},

A simple structure to realize this concept in a 2D crystal contains three atomic layers, a middle one built up from heavy elements generating strong atomic spin-orbit interaction and two neighboring atomic layers with diﬀerent electron negativity. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal, since it contains heavy Bi layer between Te and I layers. Recently the bulk form of BiTeI attracted considerable attention due to its giant Rashba interaction, however, 2D form of this crystal was not yet created. In this work we report the ﬁrst exfoliation of single layer BiTeI using a recently developed exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our combined scanning probe studies and ﬁrst principles calculations show that SL BiTeI ﬂakes with sizes of 100 µm were achieved which are stable at ambient conditions. The giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new member of 2D crystals open the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.},

	abstract = {The electronic structures were calculated for BiTeBr and BiTeI using the density-functional theory approach and accounting for the strong spin–orbital interaction. Qualitatively, the band structures for two compounds are similar, showing strong mixing of the p states of all elements in vicinity of the Fermi level, with the band gaps of 0.595 and 0.478 eV for BiTeBr and BiTeI, respectively. The optimized crystal structures show a tendency for the Bi–X (X ¼ Br, I) bond elongation compared to the Bi–Te one. Both compounds are intrinsic n-type semiconductors but display a metallic-like conductivity coupled to rather large thermopower, which is rationalized within the frames of the acoustic phonons scattering model. Because of larger thermopower BiTeBr exhibits a twice higher thermoelectric ﬁgure-of-merit near room temperature, ZT ¼ 0.17, compared to BiTeI. The addition of 1 mass\% of BiI3 or CuI to BiTeI decreases the mobility of electrons by two orders of magnitude, leading to signiﬁcantly lower electrical conductivity, but at the same time effectively reduces the thermal conductivity. The prospects of further enhancing the thermoelectric efﬁciency are brieﬂy discussed.},

For each type of interaction, the magnitude and the length scale are discussed, as well as the scaling with particle size and interparticle distance. In all cases, the discussion emphasizes characteristics unique to the nanoscale. These theoretical considerations are accompanied by examples of recent experimental systems, in which specific interaction types were used to drive nanoscopic self-assembly. Overall, this Review aims to provide a comprehensive yet easily accessible resource of nanoscale-specific interparticle forces that can be implemented in models or simulations of self-assembly processes at this scale.},

In each set the wavefunction is at the same time the eigenfunction of one of the three spin operators, which do not commute with each other, but do commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian. This means that the eigenfunctions of Dirac equation describe three independent spin states. The energy spectrum is calculated for each of these sets for the case of quasi-two-dimensional electrons in a quantum well. It is shown that the standard Rashba spin-orbit interaction takes place in one of such states only. In another one this interaction is not formed at all, and for the third one it leads to the band spectrum which is anisotropic in the plane domain of the propagation of a free electron and is diﬀerent from the isotropic spectrum of Rashba type.},

The three compounds show completely different growth and residual stress behaviors. The room temperature optical band gaps of these films were determined by optical absorption measurements. Only ZnI2 exhibits excitonic absorption at room temperature. The optical band gaps of ZnI2 and HgI2 correlate linearly with residual stress while CdI2 shows nonlinear behavior. The magnitude of band gap variation with residual stress can be interpreted as due to the affected cation-cation, cation-anion and anion-anion bond lengths. The ionicity of these three compounds decreases linearly with their cation-anion radii ratio and the band gap increases with ionicity.},

	abstract = {It is believed that nanostructuring is an effective way to achieve excellent thermoelectric performance. In the work, by combining the first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer BiTeBr including both the electron and phonon transports. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for the electron part, and GGA for the phonon part. It is found that SOC has important effects on electronic transport coefficients because of SOC-induced obvious influences on energy band structures. In p-type doping, monolayer has larger Seebeck coefficient than bulk in wide doping range, which is beneficial to excellent thermoelectric performance. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity of bulk is 1.71Wm-1K-1 at room temperature, which is close to experimental value 1.3Wm-1K-1. Calculated results show that monolayer has better ZTe and lower lattice thermal conductivity than bulk, which suggests that monolayer has better thermoelectric performance than bulk. The lower lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer than bulk is due to shorter phonon lifetimes. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of bulk with calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 3.3×10-14s. Based on electron and phonon transport coefficients, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of bulk and monolayer are calculated. It is found that monolayer has higher peak ZT than bulk, and the peak ZT of monolayer can be as high as 0.55 in n-type doping and 0.75 in p-type doping at room temperature. These results imply that monolayer BiTeBr may be a potential two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric material, which can stimulate further experimental works to synthesize monolayer BiTeBr.},

There are a number of reasons for this: seizures can directly affect the brain in ways that disturb memory; epilepsy often results from trouble in brain regions closely linked to memory; the treatment of epilepsy can affect memory; epilepsy can cause psychological problems, like depression, which interfere with memory. The study of epilepsy and the and the study of human memory are interwoven. Epilepsy and Memory comprehensively reviews all aspects of the relationship between this common and potentially serious neurological disorder and memory, one of the core functions of the human mind. The authors, acknowledged experts in their fields, review the history of the subject, the clinical features of memory disorder in epilepsy, neuropsychological, neuroradiological, neuropathological and electrophysiological findings, the roles of anticonvulsant side effects and psychiatric disorder, and the scope for memory support and rehabilitation. The study of patients with epilepsy has revealed much about the workings of memory, yet there has been no recent review of this fertile field of research. This book fills this gap and is a valuable new addition to the brain sciences literature. It will be of wide interest to clinicians and basic researchers in the brain sciences.},

A larger \$T\_1\$ is generally favored, setting the fundamental upper limit to the qubit coherence and spin readout fidelity. In GaAs quantum dots at low temperatures and high in-plane magnetic fields \$B\$, the spin relaxation relies on phonon emission and spin-orbit coupling. The characteristic dependence \$T\_1 {\textbackslash}propto B{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ and pronounced \$B\$-field anisotropy were already confirmed experimentally. However, it has also been predicted 15 years ago that at low enough fields, the spin-orbit interaction is replaced by the coupling to the nuclear spins, where the relaxation becomes isotropic, and the scaling changes to \$T\_1 {\textbackslash}propto B{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. We establish these predictions experimentally, by measuring \$T\_1\$ over an unprecedented range of magnetic fields -- made possible by lower temperature -- and report a maximum \$T\_1 = 57{\textbackslash}pm15\$ s at the lowest fields, setting a new record for the electron spin lifetime in a nanostructure.},

First, we demonstrate a back-gate-controlled transition between a single quantum dot and a double quantum dot in parallel that allows tuning the device in to corner dot formation. We find a linear dependence of the valley splitting on back-gate voltage, from \$880{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV\}\$ to \$610{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV\}\$ with a slope of \$-45{\textbackslash}pm 3{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV/V\}\$ (or equivalently a slope of \$-48{\textbackslash}pm 3{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV/(MV/m)\}\$ with respect to the effective field). The experimental results are backed up by tight-binding simulations that include the effect of surface roughness, remote charges in the gate stack and discrete dopants in the channel.

As quantum processors become more complex, they require efficient interfaces to deliver signals for control and readout while keeping the number of inputs manageable. Digital electronics offers solutions to the scaling challenge by leveraging established industrial infrastructure and applying it to integrate silicon-based quantum devices with conventional CMOS circuits. Here, we combine both technologies at milikelvin temperatures and demonstrate the building blocks of a dynamic random access architecture for efficient readout of complex quantum circuits. Our circuit is divided into cells, each containing a CMOS quantum dot (QD) and a field-effect transistor that enables selective readout of the QD, as well as charge storage on the QD gate similar to 1T-1C DRAM technology. We show dynamic readout of two cells by interfacing them with a single radio-frequency resonator. Our results demonstrate a path to reducing the number of input lines per qubit and enable addressing of large-scale device arrays.},

	abstract = {Electron spins in silicon quantum dots provide a promising route towards realising the large number of coupled qubits required for a useful quantum processor. At present, the requisite single-shot spin qubit measurements are performed using on-chip charge sensors, capacitively coupled to the quantum dots. However, as the number of qubits is increased, this approach becomes impractical due to the footprint and complexity of the charge sensors, combined with the required proximity to the quantum dots. Alternatively, the spin state can be measured directly by detecting the complex impedance of spin-dependent electron tunnelling between quantum dots. This can be achieved using radio-frequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum dot itself, significantly reducing gate count and architectural complexity, but thus far it has not been possible to achieve single-shot spin readout using this technique. Here, we detect single electron tunnelling in a double quantum dot and demonstrate that gate-based sensing can be used to read out the electron spin state in a single shot, with an average readout fidelity of 73\%. The result demonstrates a key step towards the readout of many spin qubits in parallel, using a compact gate design that will be needed for a large-scale semiconductor quantum processor.},

Near room temperature, an obvious ambipolar transistor operation with an ON-OFF ratio close to 103 was observed in the transfer characteristics of liquid-gated EDLTs and further confirmed by a sign change of the Hall coefficients. Modulation of the electronic states and a phase transition from a semiconducting conduction (dRxx/dT {\textless} 0) to a metallic transport (dRxx/dT {\textgreater} 0) were observed in the temperature-dependent resistance of the ultrathin Bi2Te3 channel, demonstrating that the liquid gating is an effective way to modulate the electronic states of TIs.},

Much effort has recently been devoted to the fundamental understanding and practical applications of such highly charged EDL interfaces. However, the intrinsic nature of the EDL charging, whether it is electrostatics or electrochemistry, and how to distinguish them are far from clear. Here, by combining electrical transport measurements with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we studied the charging mechanisms of highly charged EDL interfaces between an ionic liquid and oxide semiconductor, ZnO. The direct measure for mobile carriers from the Hall effect agreed well with that from the capacitance-voltage integration at 1 Hz, implying that the pseudocapacitance does not contribute to carrier transport at EDL interfaces. The temperature-frequency mapping of EIS was further demonstrated as a “phase diagram” to distinguish the electrostatic or electrochemical nature of such highly charged EDL interfaces with densities of up to 8 × 1014 cm-2, providing a guideline for electric-field-induced electronic phenomena and a simple method for distinguishing electrostatic and electrochemical charging in EDLTs not only based on a specific oxide semiconductor, ZnO, but also commonly applicable to all types of EDL interfaces with extremely high-density carrier accumulation.},

Beyond the simple enhancement of conductivity, high charge carrier accumulation can realize various phenomena, such as chemical reaction, phase transition, magnetic ordering, and superconductivity. Electric double layers (EDLs), formed at solid–electrolyte interfaces, induce extremely large electric fields. This results in a high charge carrier accumulation in the solid, much more effectively than solid dielectric materials. In the present review, we describe recent developments in the field-effect transistors (FETs) with gate dielectrics of ionic liquids, which have attracted much attention due to their wide electrochemical windows, low vapor pressures, and high chemical and physical stability. We explain the capacitance effects of ionic liquids, and describe the various combinations of ionic liquids and organic and inorganic semiconductors that are used to achieve such effects as high transistor performance, insulator–metal transitions, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism, in addition to the applications of the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs in logic devices. We discuss the factors controlling the mobility and threshold voltage in these types of FETs, and show the ionic liquid dependence of the transistor performance.},

However, BiTeBr, which belongs to this class of materials, is rarely investigated in terms of the thermoelectric transport properties. In the study, polycrystalline bulk BiTeBr with intensive texture was synthesized via spark plasma sintering (SPS). Additionally, its thermoelectric properties above room temperature were investigated along both the in-plane and out-plane directions, and they exhibit strong anisotropy. Low sound velocity along two directions is found and contributes to its low lattice thermal conductivity. Polycrystalline BiTeBr exhibits relatively good thermoelectric performance along the in-plane direction, with a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of 0.35 at 560 K. Further enhancements of ZT are expected by utilizing systematic optimization strategies.},

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal charge transport phenomena are studied theoretically for two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors under an external magnetic field \$B\$. Rashba superconductors, surface superconductivity on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are representative systems, and the current-voltage \$I\$-\$V\$ characteristics, i.e., \$V=V(I)\$, for each of them is analyzed. \$V(I)\$ can be expanded with respect to the current \$I\$ as \$V(I)= {\textbackslash}sum\_\{j=1,{\textbackslash}infty\} a\_j(B,T) I{\textasciicircum}j\$, and the \$(B,T)\$-dependence of \$a\_j\$ depends on the mechanism of the charge transport. Above the mean field transition temperature \$T\_0\$, the fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter gives the additional conductivity, i.e., paraconductivity. Extending the analysis to the nonlinear response, we obtain the nonreciprocal charge transport expressed by \$a\_2(B,T) = a\_1(T) {\textbackslash}gamma(T) B\$, where \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ converges to a finite value at \$T=T\_0\$. Below \$T\_0\$, the vortex motion is relevant to the voltage drop, and the dependence of \$a\_j\$ on \$B,T\$ is different depending on the system and mechanisms. For the superconductors under the in-plane magnetic field, the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition occurs at \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm KT\}\$. In this case \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ has the characteristic temperature dependences such as \${\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}sim (T-T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm KT\}){\textasciicircum}\{-3/2\}\$ near \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm KT\}\$. On the other hand, for TMD with out-plane magnetic field, the KT transition is gone, and there are two possible mechanisms for the nonreciprocal response. One is the anisotropy of the damping constant for the motion of the vortex. In this case, \$a\_1(B) {\textbackslash}sim B\$ and \$a\_2(B) {\textbackslash}sim B{\textasciicircum}2\$. The other one is the ratchet potential acting on the vortex motion, which gives \$a\_1(B) {\textbackslash}sim B\$ and \$a\_2(B) {\textbackslash}sim B\$. Based on these results, we propose the experiments to identify the mechanism of the nonreciprocal charge transport.},

First principles calculations reveal intrinsic topologically nontrivial bulk energy gaps as large as 70-80 meV, which can be further enhanced up to 120 meV by compression. The strong spin-orbit coupling in BiTeX has a significant influence on the graphene Dirac states, resulting in the topologically nontrivial band structure, which is confirmed by calculated nontrivial Z2 index and an explicit demonstration of metallic edge states. Such heterostructures offer an unique Dirac transport system that combines the 2D Dirac states from graphene and 1D Dirac edge states from the topological insulator, and it offers new ideas for innovative device designs.},

	abstract = {Field effect transistors (FETs) made of thin flake single crystals isolated from layered materials have attracted growing interest since the success of graphene. Here, we report the fabrication of an electric double layer transistor (EDLT, a FET gated by ionic liquids) using a thin flake of MoS2, a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides, an archetypal layered material. The EDLT of the thin flake MoS2 unambiguously displayed ambipolar operation, in contrast to its commonly known bulk property as an n-type semiconductor. High-performance transistor operation characterized by a large “ON” state conductivity in the order of ∼mS and a high on/off ratio {\textgreater}102 was realized for both hole and electron transport. Hall effect measurements revealed mobility of 44 and 86 cm2 V-1 s-1 for electron and hole, respectively. The hole mobility is twice the value of the electron mobility, and the density of accumulated carrier reached 1 × 1014 cm-2, which is 1 order of magnitude larger than conventional FETs with solid dielectrics. The high-density carriers of both holes and electrons can create metallic transport in the MoS2 channel. The present result is not only important for device applications with new functionalities, but the method itself would also act as a protocol to study this class of material for a broader scope of possibilities in accessing their unexplored properties.},

	abstract = {The basic theory and first experimental results (if a new microfabricated ionic liquid-channel field-effect transistor (ILCFET) are presented. The ILCFET resembles a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) except that the current flowing from the source to the drain is carried in thin channels by ions of a liquid electrolyte. In MOSFETs the gate-induced electric field changes the channel concentration of only one mobile carrier, the holes or the electrons. In ILCFETs the concentrations of both cations and anions are altered. The devices that we have built have channels 0.088 {\textasciitilde}tm thick and 300,600, and 900 {\textasciitilde}tmlong. The basic steady-state theory predicts that for a channel thickness of 8 Debye lengths and a gate voltage change from 0 to 25 V (representing a potential change of 150 mV at the solid/liquid interface) the steady-state anion/cation ratio increases by a factor of 17.8. For a glycerol solution of KC1, the channel conductance increases correspondingly by a factor of 5.2. The transient response to a gate voltage step is modeled as a gate capacitance charging current followed by slower ambipolar diffusion. Both processes are described by the diffusion equation. Measurements have been made of conductance vs. gate voltage, gate capacitance charging current, and slow conductance changes due to diffusion for different types of glycerol solutions. Whereas the gate current transient response data agree well with theory, the long-term transient response data indicate that phenonema other than arnbipolar diffusion are present. Finally, the slopes of the channel conductance vs. gate voltage curves are less than predicted by the basic theory.},

The vacuum Rabi frequency for the coupling of cavity photons to quantized excitations of an adjacent electrical circuit (qubit) can easily exceed the damping rates of both the cavity and the qubit. This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances. In addition it would allow production of microwave photon states of fundamental importance for quantum communication.},

Basic operations of the qubit have been realized in recent years: initialization, manipulation of single spins, two qubit entanglement operations, and readout. Now it becomes crucial to demonstrate scalability of this architecture by conducting spin operations on a scaled up system. Here, we demonstrate single-electron spin resonance in a quadruple quantum dot. A few-electron quadruple quantum dot is formed within a magnetic field gradient created by a micro-magnet. We oscillate the wave functions of the electrons in the quantum dots by applying microwave voltages and this induces electron spin resonance. The resonance energies of the four quantum dots are slightly different because of the stray field created by the micro-magnet and therefore frequency-resolved addressable control of each electron spin resonance is possible.},

The main difﬁculty of such computation arises from the very high dimensions of the model, making it necessary to use relatively coarse meshes and hence requiring the numerical solver to be stable and to have good resolution under coarse meshes. In this paper we consider the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which is a ﬁnite element method using discontinuous piecewise polynomials as basis functions and numerical ﬂuxes based on upwinding for stability, for solving the Boltzmann-Poisson system. In many situations, the deterministic DG solver can produce accurate solutions with equal or less CPU time than the traditional DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) solvers. Numerical simulation results on a diode and a 2D double-gate MOSFET are given.},

For temperatures above approximately 50 K, the conductance is dominated by electrons in the bulk of the crystal, whereas below that temperature, surface conductance becomes more important. As the crystals are annealed in ﬂowing N2 gas, the surface sheet carrier concentration increases, and concomitantly, the OH-bond peak in the XPS spectrum becomes a larger fraction of the total O peak. Conversely, either O2-plasma annealing or electron-beam irradiation produces a decrease in the surface conductance and the OH fraction. Thus, H-related donors are likely the cause of the surface conductance.},

	abstract = {Topological superconductors which support Majorana fermions are thought to be realized in one-dimensional semiconducting wires coupled to a superconductor. Such excitations are expected to exhibit non-Abelian statistics and can be used to realize quantum gates that are topologically protected from local sources of decoherence. Here we report the observation of the fractional a.c. Josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor/superconductor InSb/Nb nanowire junction, a hallmark of topological matter. When the junction is irradiated with a radio-frequency f in the absence of an external magnetic field, quantized voltage steps (Shapiro steps) with a height hf/2e are observed, as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is carried by charge-2e Cooper pairs. At high magnetic fields the height of the first Shapiro step is doubled to hf/e, suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge-e quasiparticles. This is a unique signature of Majorana fermions, elusive particles predicted ca. 80 years ago.},

A given material can be transformed through proximity effects whereby it acquires properties of its neighbors, for example, becoming superconducting, magnetic, topologically nontrivial, or with an enhanced spin–orbit coupling. Such proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials by doping or functionalization but also can overcome their various limitations. In proximitized materials, it is possible to realize properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. While the focus is on magnetic and spin–orbit proximity effects with their applications in spintronics, the outlined principles also provide a broader framework for employing other proximity effects to tailor materials and realize novel phenomena.},

While observation of exceptionally long spin relaxation lengths makes graphene an intriguing material for spintronics studies, electric field modulation of spin currents is almost impossible due to negligible intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of graphene. In this work, we create an artificial interface between monolayer graphene and few-layer semiconducting tungsten disulphide. In these devices, we observe that graphene acquires spin–orbit coupling up to 17 meV, three orders of magnitude higher than its intrinsic value, without modifying the structure of the graphene. The proximity spin–orbit coupling leads to the spin Hall effect even at room temperature, and opens the door to spin field effect transistors. We show that intrinsic defects in tungsten disulphide play an important role in this proximity effect and that graphene can act as a probe to detect defects in semiconducting surfaces.},

A simple structure to realize this concept in a 2D crystal contains three atomic layers, a middle one built up from heavy elements generating strong atomic spin-orbit interaction and two neighboring atomic layers with diﬀerent electron negativity. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal, since it contains heavy Bi layer between Te and I layers. Recently the bulk form of BiTeI attracted considerable attention due to its giant Rashba interaction, however, 2D form of this crystal was not yet created. In this work we report the ﬁrst exfoliation of single layer BiTeI using a recently developed exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our combined scanning probe studies and ﬁrst principles calculations show that SL BiTeI ﬂakes with sizes of 100 µm were achieved which are stable at ambient conditions. The giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new member of 2D crystals open the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.},

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal transport phenomena indicate that the forward and backward flows differ, and are attributed to broken inversion symmetry. In this paper, we study the nonreciprocity of a thermal and thermoelectric transport of electronic systems resulting from inversion-symmetry-broken crystal structures. The nonlinear electric, thermoelectric, and thermal conductivities are derived up to the second order in an electric field and a temperature gradient by using the Boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation. All the second-order conductivities appearing in this paper are described by two functions and their derivatives, and these are related to each other in the same way that linear conductivities are e.g. via the Wiedemann-Franz law. We found that non-vanishing thermal-transport coefficients in the zero-temperature limit appear in nonlinear conductivities, which dominate the thermal transport at a sufficiently low temperature. The nonlinear conductivities and possible observable quantities are estimated in a \$1H\$ monolayer of the transition metal dichalcogenides MoS\$\_2\$ and a polar semiconductor BiTeX(X=I,Br).},

	abstract = {Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity1, colossal magnetoresistance2 or multiferroicity 3. The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (ref. 4) represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices5. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility4,6, superconductivity7 and large magnetoresistance8, and can be patterned on the few-nanometre length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8×1013 cm-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.},

	abstract = {As silicon is the basis of conventional electronics, so strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is the foundation of the emerging field of oxide electronics1,2. SrTiO3 is the preferred template for the creation of exotic, two-dimensional (2D) phases of electron matter at oxide interfaces3,4,5 that have metal–insulator transitions6,7, superconductivity8,9 or large negative magnetoresistance10. However, the physical nature of the electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs), which is crucial to understanding their remarkable properties11,12, remains elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3 (including the non-doped insulating material) independently of bulk carrier densities over more than seven decades. This 2DEG is confined within a region of about five unit cells and has a sheet carrier density of ∼0.33 electrons per square lattice parameter. The electronic structure consists of multiple subbands of heavy and light electrons. The similarity of this 2DEG to those reported in SrTiO3-based heterostructures6,8,13 and field-effect transistors9,14 suggests that different forms of electron confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to essentially the same 2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study of the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices and a novel means of generating 2DEGs at the surfaces of transition-metal oxides.},

Topological insulators are one example in which the spin–orbit interaction leads the bulk bands to have a non-trivial topology, observable as gapless surface or edge states. Another example is the Rashba effect, which lifts the electron-spin degeneracy as a consequence of the spin–orbit interaction under broken inversion symmetry. It is of particular importance to know how these two effects, that is, the non-trivial topology of electronic states and the Rashba spin splitting, interplay with each other. Here we show through sophisticated first-principles calculations that BiTeI, a giant bulk Rashba semiconductor, turns into a topological insulator under a reasonable pressure. This material is shown to exhibit several unique features, such as a highly pressure-tunable giant Rashba spin splitting, an unusual pressure-induced quantum phase transition, and more importantly, the formation of strikingly different Dirac surface states at opposite sides of the material.},

Their ideal bulk-truncated surface hosts a single spin-helical surface state, which is the simplest possible surface electronic structure allowed by their non-trivial Z2 topology. However, real surfaces of such compounds, even if kept in ultra-high vacuum, rapidly develop a much more complex electronic structure whose origin and properties have proved controversial. Here we demonstrate that a conceptually simple model, implementing a semiconductor-like band bending in a parameter-free tight-binding supercell calculation, can quantitatively explain the entire measured hierarchy of electronic states. In combination with circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoemission experiments, we further uncover a rich three-dimensional spin texture of this surface electronic system, resulting from the non-trivial topology of the bulk band structure. Moreover, our study sheds new light on the surface-bulk connectivity in topological insulators, and reveals how this is modified by quantum confinement.},

A promising way to achieve this goal is to make use of the tunable Rashba effect that relies on the spin-orbit interaction in a two-dimensional electron system immersed in an inversion-asymmetric environment. The spin-orbit-induced spin splitting of the two-dimensional electron state provides a basis for many theoretically proposed spintronic devices. However, the lack of semiconductors with large Rashba effect hinders realization of these devices in actual practice. Here we report on a giant Rashba-type spin splitting in two-dimensional electron systems that reside at tellurium-terminated surfaces of bismuth tellurohalides. Among these semiconductors, BiTeCl stands out for its isotropic metallic surface-state band with the Γ̄-point energy lying deep inside the bulk band gap.

Interestingly, long spin lifetimes are observed despite the fact that both conductive scanning force microscopy and contact resistance measurements reveal the existence of conducting pinholes throughout the MgO spin injection/detection barriers. Compared to previous devices, we observe an enhancement of the spin lifetime in single layer graphene by a factor of 6.

Being very promising ingredients in themselves, interplaying Dirac and Rashba systems can provide a base for next generation of spintronics devices, to a considerable extent, by mixing their striking properties or by improving technically significant characteristics of each other. Here, we demonstrate that in BiTeI@PbSb2Te4 composed of a BiTeI trilayer on top of the topological insulator (TI) PbSb2Te4 weakly- and strongly-coupled Dirac-Rashba hybrid systems are realized. The coupling strength depends on both interface hexagonal stacking and trilayer-stacking order. The weakly-coupled system can serve as a prototype to examine, e.g., plasmonic excitations, frictional drag, spin-polarized transport, and charge-spin separation effect in multilayer helical metals. In the strongly-coupled regime, within {\textasciitilde}100 meV energy interval of the bulk TI projected bandgap a helical state substituting for the TI surface state appears. This new state is characterized by a larger momentum, similar velocity, and strong localization within BiTeI. We anticipate that our findings pave the way for designing a new type of spintronics devices based on Rashba-Dirac coupled systems.},

To comply with demands of nowaday spintronics, the studies of electron systems hosting giant spin-orbit-split electron states have become one of the most important problems providing us with a basis for desirable spintronics devices. In construction of such devices, it is also tempting to involve graphene, which has attracted great attention because of its unique and remarkable electronic properties and was recognized as a viable replacement for silicon in electronics. In this case, a challenging goal is to lift spin degeneracy of graphene Dirac states. Here, we propose a novel pathway to achieve this goal by means of coupling of graphene and polar-substrate surface states with giant Rashba-type spin-splitting. We theoretically demonstrate it by constructing the graphene@BiTeCl system, which appears to possess spin-helical graphene Dirac states caused by the strong interaction of Dirac and Rashba electrons. We anticipate that our findings will stimulate rapid growth in theoretical and experimental investigations of graphene Dirac states with real spin-momentum locking, which can revolutionize the graphene spintronics and become a reliable base for prospective spintronics applications.},

Unveiling the full spin texture in momentum space for such materials and its relation to the microscopic structure of the electronic wave functions is experimentally challenging and yet essential for exploiting spin–orbit effects for spin manipulation. Here we employ a state-of-the-art photoelectron momentum microscope with a multichannel spin filter to directly image the spin texture of the layered polar semiconductor BiTeI within the full two-dimensional momentum plane. Our experimental results, supported by relativistic ab initio calculations, demonstrate that the valence and conduction band electrons in BiTeI have spin textures of opposite chirality and of pronounced orbital dependence beyond the standard Rashba model, the latter giving rise to strong optical selection-rule effects on the photoelectron spin polarization. These observations open avenues for spin-texture manipulation by atomic-layer and charge carrier control in polar semiconductors.},

Despite different space groups, the optical properties of the two compounds are very similar. Both materials are doped semiconductors, with the absorption edge above the optical gap which is lower in BiTeBr (0.62 eV) than in BiTeCl (0.77 eV). The same Rashba splitting is observed in the two materials. A non-Drude free carrier contribution in the optical conductivity, as well as three Raman and two infrared phonon modes, are observed in each compound. There is a dramatic difference in the highest infrared phonon intensity for the two compounds, and a difference in the doping levels. Aspects of the strong electron-phonon interaction are identified. Several interband transitions are assigned, among them the low-lying absorption \${\textbackslash}beta\$ which has the same value 0.25 eV in both compounds, and is caused by the Rashba spin splitting of the conduction band. An additional weak transition is found in BiTeCl, caused by the lower crystal symmetry.},

This effective Zeeman field, which is originated from intrinsic spin orbit coupling induced by breaking in-plane inversion symmetry, can reach nearly a hundred Tesla in magnitude. It strongly pins the spin orientation of the electrons to the out-of-plane directions and protects the superconductivity from being destroyed by an in-plane external magnetic field. In magnetotransport experiments of ionic-gate MoS\$\_\{2\}\$ transistors, where gating prepares individual superconducting state with different carrier doping, we indeed observe a spin- protected superconductivity by measuring an in-plane critical field \${\textbackslash}textit\{B\}\$\$\_\{c2\}\$ far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The gating-enhanced \${\textbackslash}textit\{B\}\$\$\_\{c2\}\$ is more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the bulk superconducting phases where the effective Zeeman field is weakened by interlayer coupling.

The paramagnetic ionic gating controls the movement of ions with magnetic moments, which induces itinerant ferromagnetism on the surface of Pt films with large coercivity and perpendicular anisotropy mimicking the ideal two-dimensional Ising-type FM state. The electrical transport of the induced FM state shows Kondo effect at low temperature suggesting spatially separated coexistence of Kondo scattering beneath the FM interface.

Besides general guidelines on the required properties of an electrolyte suitable for use in lithium–sulfur batteries, the inﬂuence of more speciﬁc physicochemical properties on its characteristics is not well understood. For this purpose, binary mixtures based on the [DEME][TFSI] and dioxolane electrolyte system for lithium–sulfur batteries was investigated in this work. Selected physicochemical properties were determined for different mixtures of solvents and lithium salt concentrations. All the electrolytes prepared were also tested in the lithium–sulfur battery system. The capacity, Coulombic efﬁciency, overpotentials and impedance spectra were analyzed and a connection between them and the determined electrolyte properties elucidated. We show that the electrolyte's conductivity does not have a direct connection to any of the battery system properties measured. The highest speciﬁc capacities were obtained with batteries compromising 1.0 M LiTFSI and the highest ratio of dioxolane in the binary solvent mixture. On the other hand, the best Coulombic efﬁciencies were obtained with batteries having high ratios of ionic liquid. Resistance and overpotential are connected parameters and are a function of the ionic liquid content. None of the monitored parameters prevail, since the best electrochemical performance in terms of speciﬁc capacity and stability was obtained with the 1.0 M LiTFSI in X[DEME][TFSI] = 0.199 electrolyte. © 2017 The Authors.

A major goal is the identification of measurable properties that directly expose the topological nature of such transitions. Here we focus on the giant-Rashba material bismuth tellurium iodine (BiTeI) which exhibits a pressure-driven phase transition between topological and trivial insulators in three-dimensions. We demonstrate that this transition, which proceeds through an intermediate Weyl semi-metallic state, is accompanied by a giant enhancement of the Berry curvature dipole which can be probed in transport and optoelectronic experiments. From first-principles calculations, we show that the Berrry-dipole --a vector along the polar axis of this material-- has opposite orientations in the trivial and topological insulating phases and peaks at the insulator-to-Weyl critical points. Consequently, near the topological phase transitions, in a low electronic density regime the nonlinear Hall conductivity increases by two orders of magnitude.},

Here, we present experiments that observe the one-dimensional Wigner crystal directly, by imaging its charge density in real-space. To measure this fragile state without perturbing it, we developed a new scanning probe platform that utilizes a pristine carbon nanotube as a scanning charge perturbation to image, with minimal invasiveness, the many-body electronic density within another nanotube. The obtained images, of few electrons confined in one-dimension, match those of strongly interacting crystals, with electrons ordered like pearls on a necklace. Comparison to theoretical modeling demonstrates the dominance of Coulomb interactions over kinetic energy and the weakness of exchange interactions. Our experiments provide direct evidence for this long-sought electronic state, and open the way for studying other fragile interacting states by imaging their many-body density in real-space.},

	abstract = {One of the defining properties of electrons is their mutual Coulombic repulsion. In solids, however, this basic property may change. A famous example is that of superconductors, where coupling to lattice vibrations make electrons attract each other and leads to the formation of bound pairs. But what if all degrees of freedom are electronic? Is it still possible to make electrons attractive via their repulsion from other electrons? Such a mechanism, termed 'excitonic', was proposed fifty years ago by W. A. Little, aiming to achieve stronger and more exotic superconductivity, yet despite many experimental efforts, direct evidence for such 'excitonic' attraction is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate this unique attraction by constructing, from the bottom up, the fundamental building block of this mechanism. Our experiments are based on quantum devices made from pristine carbon nanotubes, combined with cryogenic precision manipulation. Using this platform we demonstrate that two electrons can be made to attract using an independent electronic system as the binding glue. Owing to its large tunability, our system offers crucial insights into the underlying physics, such as the dependence of the emergent attraction on the underlying repulsion and the origin of the pairing energy. We also demonstrate transport signatures of 'excitonic' pairing. This experimental demonstration of 'excitonic' pairing paves the way for the design of exotic states of matter.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03536},
	abstract = {It is believed that nanostructuring is an effective way to achieve excellent thermoelectric performance. In the work, by combining the first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer BiTeBr including both the electron and phonon transports. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for the electron part, and GGA for the phonon part. It is found that SOC has important effects on electronic transport coefficients because of SOC-induced obvious influences on energy band structures. In p-type doping, monolayer has larger Seebeck coefficient than bulk in wide doping range, which is beneficial to excellent thermoelectric performance. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity of bulk is 1.71 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{W m{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} K{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ at room temperature, which is close to experimental value 1.3 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{W m{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} K{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. Calculated results show that monolayer has better \$ZT\_e\$ and lower lattice thermal conductivity than bulk, which suggests that monolayer has better thermoelectric performance than bulk. The lower lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer than bulk is due to shorter phonon lifetimes. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of bulk with calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 3.3 \${\textbackslash}times\$ \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-14\}\$ s. Based on electron and phonon transport coefficients, the thermoelectric figure of merit \$ZT\$ of bulk and monolayer are calculated. It is found that monolayer has higher peak \$ZT\$ than bulk, and the peak \$ZT\$ of monolayer can be as high as 0.55 in n-type doping and 0.75 in p-type doping at room temperature. These results imply that monolayer BiTeBr may be a potential two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric material, which can stimulate further experimental works to synthesize monolayer BiTeBr.},

In the same range, the temperature dependence of resistivity changes from metallic to semiconducting at 3 GPa and has a plateau region between 50 and 150 K in the semiconducting state. Meanwhile, the pressure variation of band structure shows that the bulk band-gap energy closes at 2.9 GPa and re-opens at higher pressures. Furthermore, according to the Wilson loop analysis, the topological nature of electronic states in noncentrosymmetric BiTeBr at 0 and 5 GPa are explicitly revealed to be trivial and non-trivial, respectively.

	abstract = {The small gap semiconductor α-RuCl3 has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid materials. Thus far, Raman spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and magnetization measurements have provided valuable hints for collective spin behavior in α-RuCl3 bulk crystals. However, the goal of implementing α-RuCl3 into spintronic devices would strongly benefit from the possibility of electrically probing these phenomena. To address this, we first investigated nanoflakes of α-RuCl3 by Raman spectroscopy and observed similar behavior as in the case of the bulk material, including the signatures of possible fractionalized excitations. In complementary experiments, we investigated the electrical charge transport properties of individual α-RuCl3 nanoflakes in the temperature range between 120 and 290 K. The observed temperature-dependent electrical resistivity is consistent with variable range hopping behavior and exhibits a transition at about 180 K, close to the onset temperature observed in our Raman measurements. In conjunction with the established relation between structure and magnetism in the bulk, we interpret this transition to coincide with the emergence of fractionalized excitations due to the Kitaev interactions in the nanoflakes. Compared to the bulk samples, the transition temperature of the underlying structural change is larger in the nanoflakes. This difference is tentatively attributed to the dimensionality of the nanoflakes as well as the formation of stacking faults during mechanical exfoliation. The demonstrated devices open up novel perspectives toward manipulating the Kitaev-phase in α-RuCl3 via electrical means.},

	abstract = {Spin orbit interaction can be strongly boosted when a heavy element is embedded into an inversion asymmetric crystal ﬁeld. A simple structure to realize this concept in a 2D crystal contains three atomic layers, a middle one built up from heavy elements generating strong atomic spin-orbit interaction and two neighboring atomic layers with diﬀerent electron negativity. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal, since it contains heavy Bi layer between Te and I layers. Recently the bulk form of BiTeI attracted considerable attention due to its giant Rashba interaction, however, 2D form of this crystal was not yet created. In this work we report the ﬁrst exfoliation of single layer BiTeI using a recently developed exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our combined scanning probe studies and ﬁrst principles calculations show that SL BiTeI ﬂakes with sizes of 100 µm were achieved which are stable at ambient conditions. The giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new member of 2D crystals open the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.},

Qualitatively, the band structures for two compounds are similar, showing strong mixing of the p states of all elements in vicinity of the Fermi level, with the band gaps of 0.595 and 0.478 eV for BiTeBr and BiTeI, respectively. The optimized crystal structures show a tendency for the Bi–X (X ¼ Br, I) bond elongation compared to the Bi–Te one. Both compounds are intrinsic n-type semiconductors but display a metallic-like conductivity coupled to rather large thermopower, which is rationalized within the frames of the acoustic phonons scattering model. Because of larger thermopower BiTeBr exhibits a twice higher thermoelectric ﬁgure-of-merit near room temperature, ZT ¼ 0.17, compared to BiTeI. The addition of 1 mass\% of BiI3 or CuI to BiTeI decreases the mobility of electrons by two orders of magnitude, leading to signiﬁcantly lower electrical conductivity, but at the same time effectively reduces the thermal conductivity. The prospects of further enhancing the thermoelectric efﬁciency are brieﬂy discussed.},

This Review provides a critical examination of the various interparticle forces (van der Waals, electrostatic, magnetic, molecular, and entropic) that can be used in nanoscale self-assembly. For each type of interaction, the magnitude and the length scale are discussed, as well as the scaling with particle size and interparticle distance. In all cases, the discussion emphasizes characteristics unique to the nanoscale. These theoretical considerations are accompanied by examples of recent experimental systems, in which specific interaction types were used to drive nanoscopic self-assembly. Overall, this Review aims to provide a comprehensive yet easily accessible resource of nanoscale-specific interparticle forces that can be implemented in models or simulations of self-assembly processes at this scale.},

In each set the wavefunction is at the same time the eigenfunction of one of the three spin operators, which do not commute with each other, but do commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian. This means that the eigenfunctions of Dirac equation describe three independent spin states. The energy spectrum is calculated for each of these sets for the case of quasi-two-dimensional electrons in a quantum well. It is shown that the standard Rashba spin-orbit interaction takes place in one of such states only. In another one this interaction is not formed at all, and for the third one it leads to the band spectrum which is anisotropic in the plane domain of the propagation of a free electron and is diﬀerent from the isotropic spectrum of Rashba type.},

The three compounds show completely different growth and residual stress behaviors. The room temperature optical band gaps of these films were determined by optical absorption measurements. Only ZnI2 exhibits excitonic absorption at room temperature. The optical band gaps of ZnI2 and HgI2 correlate linearly with residual stress while CdI2 shows nonlinear behavior. The magnitude of band gap variation with residual stress can be interpreted as due to the affected cation-cation, cation-anion and anion-anion bond lengths.

	abstract = {It is believed that nanostructuring is an effective way to achieve excellent thermoelectric performance. In the work, by combining the first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer BiTeBr including both the electron and phonon transports. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for the electron part, and GGA for the phonon part. It is found that SOC has important effects on electronic transport coefficients because of SOC-induced obvious influences on energy band structures. In p-type doping, monolayer has larger Seebeck coefficient than bulk in wide doping range, which is beneficial to excellent thermoelectric performance. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity of bulk is 1.71Wm-1K-1 at room temperature, which is close to experimental value 1.3Wm-1K-1. Calculated results show that monolayer has better ZTe and lower lattice thermal conductivity than bulk, which suggests that monolayer has better thermoelectric performance than bulk. The lower lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer than bulk is due to shorter phonon lifetimes. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of bulk with calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 3.3×10-14s. Based on electron and phonon transport coefficients, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of bulk and monolayer are calculated. It is found that monolayer has higher peak ZT than bulk, and the peak ZT of monolayer can be as high as 0.55 in n-type doping and 0.75 in p-type doping at room temperature. These results imply that monolayer BiTeBr may be a potential two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric material, which can stimulate further experimental works to synthesize monolayer BiTeBr.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common disorders of the brain, and these patients often suffer from memory problems. There are a number of reasons for this: seizures can directly affect the brain in ways that disturb memory; epilepsy often results from trouble in brain regions closely linked to memory; the treatment of epilepsy can affect memory; epilepsy can cause psychological problems, like depression, which interfere with memory. The study of epilepsy and the and the study of human memory are interwoven. Epilepsy and Memory comprehensively reviews all aspects of the relationship between this common and potentially serious neurological disorder and memory, one of the core functions of the human mind. The authors, acknowledged experts in their fields, review the history of the subject, the clinical features of memory disorder in epilepsy, neuropsychological, neuroradiological, neuropathological and electrophysiological findings, the roles of anticonvulsant side effects and psychiatric disorder, and the scope for memory support and rehabilitation. The study of patients with epilepsy has revealed much about the workings of memory, yet there has been no recent review of this fertile field of research. This book fills this gap and is a valuable new addition to the brain sciences literature. It will be of wide interest to clinicians and basic researchers in the brain sciences.},

A larger \$T\_1\$ is generally favored, setting the fundamental upper limit to the qubit coherence and spin readout fidelity. In GaAs quantum dots at low temperatures and high in-plane magnetic fields \$B\$, the spin relaxation relies on phonon emission and spin-orbit coupling. The characteristic dependence \$T\_1 {\textbackslash}propto B{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ and pronounced \$B\$-field anisotropy were already confirmed experimentally. However, it has also been predicted 15 years ago that at low enough fields, the spin-orbit interaction is replaced by the coupling to the nuclear spins, where the relaxation becomes isotropic, and the scaling changes to \$T\_1 {\textbackslash}propto B{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. We establish these predictions experimentally, by measuring \$T\_1\$ over an unprecedented range of magnetic fields -- made possible by lower temperature -- and report a maximum \$T\_1 = 57{\textbackslash}pm15\$ s at the lowest fields, setting a new record for the electron spin lifetime in a nanostructure.},

We find a linear dependence of the valley splitting on back-gate voltage, from \$880{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV\}\$ to \$610{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV\}\$ with a slope of \$-45{\textbackslash}pm 3{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV/V\}\$ (or equivalently a slope of \$-48{\textbackslash}pm 3{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{eV/(MV/m)\}\$ with respect to the effective field).

As quantum processors become more complex, they require efficient interfaces to deliver signals for control and readout while keeping the number of inputs manageable. Digital electronics offers solutions to the scaling challenge by leveraging established industrial infrastructure and applying it to integrate silicon-based quantum devices with conventional CMOS circuits. Here, we combine both technologies at milikelvin temperatures and demonstrate the building blocks of a dynamic random access architecture for efficient readout of complex quantum circuits. Our circuit is divided into cells, each containing a CMOS quantum dot (QD) and a field-effect transistor that enables selective readout of the QD, as well as charge storage on the QD gate similar to 1T-1C DRAM technology. We show dynamic readout of two cells by interfacing them with a single radio-frequency resonator. Our results demonstrate a path to reducing the number of input lines per qubit and enable addressing of large-scale device arrays.},

	abstract = {Electron spins in silicon quantum dots provide a promising route towards realising the large number of coupled qubits required for a useful quantum processor. At present, the requisite single-shot spin qubit measurements are performed using on-chip charge sensors, capacitively coupled to the quantum dots. However, as the number of qubits is increased, this approach becomes impractical due to the footprint and complexity of the charge sensors, combined with the required proximity to the quantum dots. Alternatively, the spin state can be measured directly by detecting the complex impedance of spin-dependent electron tunnelling between quantum dots. This can be achieved using radio-frequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum dot itself, significantly reducing gate count and architectural complexity, but thus far it has not been possible to achieve single-shot spin readout using this technique. Here, we detect single electron tunnelling in a double quantum dot and demonstrate that gate-based sensing can be used to read out the electron spin state in a single shot, with an average readout fidelity of 73\%. The result demonstrates a key step towards the readout of many spin qubits in parallel, using a compact gate design that will be needed for a large-scale semiconductor quantum processor.},

Much effort has recently been devoted to the fundamental understanding and practical applications of such highly charged EDL interfaces. However, the intrinsic nature of the EDL charging, whether it is electrostatics or electrochemistry, and how to distinguish them are far from clear. Here, by combining electrical transport measurements with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we studied the charging mechanisms of highly charged EDL interfaces between an ionic liquid and oxide semiconductor, ZnO. The direct measure for mobile carriers from the Hall effect agreed well with that from the capacitance-voltage integration at 1 Hz, implying that the pseudocapacitance does not contribute to carrier transport at EDL interfaces. The temperature-frequency mapping of EIS was further demonstrated as a “phase diagram” to distinguish the electrostatic or electrochemical nature of such highly charged EDL interfaces with densities of up to 8 × 1014 cm-2, providing a guideline for electric-field-induced electronic phenomena and a simple method for distinguishing electrostatic and electrochemical charging in EDLTs not only based on a specific oxide semiconductor, ZnO, but also commonly applicable to all types of EDL interfaces with extremely high-density carrier accumulation.},

Beyond the simple enhancement of conductivity, high charge carrier accumulation can realize various phenomena, such as chemical reaction, phase transition, magnetic ordering, and superconductivity. Electric double layers (EDLs), formed at solid–electrolyte interfaces, induce extremely large electric fields. This results in a high charge carrier accumulation in the solid, much more effectively than solid dielectric materials. In the present review, we describe recent developments in the field-effect transistors (FETs) with gate dielectrics of ionic liquids, which have attracted much attention due to their wide electrochemical windows, low vapor pressures, and high chemical and physical stability. We explain the capacitance effects of ionic liquids, and describe the various combinations of ionic liquids and organic and inorganic semiconductors that are used to achieve such effects as high transistor performance, insulator–metal transitions, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism, in addition to the applications of the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs in logic devices. We discuss the factors controlling the mobility and threshold voltage in these types of FETs, and show the ionic liquid dependence of the transistor performance.},

Detailed comparisons are made with experimental current-voltage (I-V) data for samples with both n/sup +/ and p/sup +/ polysilicon gates and all of the features of the data are found to be understandable within the density-gradient framework. Besides providing new understanding of these experiments, these results show that the density-gradient approach can be of great value for engineering-oriented device analysis in quantum regimes.},

However, BiTeBr, which belongs to this class of materials, is rarely investigated in terms of the thermoelectric transport properties. In the study, polycrystalline bulk BiTeBr with intensive texture was synthesized via spark plasma sintering (SPS). Additionally, its thermoelectric properties above room temperature were investigated along both the in-plane and out-plane directions, and they exhibit strong anisotropy. Low sound velocity along two directions is found and contributes to its low lattice thermal conductivity. Polycrystalline BiTeBr exhibits relatively good thermoelectric performance along the in-plane direction, with a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of 0.35 at 560 K. Further enhancements of ZT are expected by utilizing systematic optimization strategies.},

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal charge transport phenomena are studied theoretically for two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors under an external magnetic field \$B\$. Rashba superconductors, surface superconductivity on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are representative systems, and the current-voltage \$I\$-\$V\$ characteristics, i.e., \$V=V(I)\$, for each of them is analyzed. \$V(I)\$ can be expanded with respect to the current \$I\$ as \$V(I)= {\textbackslash}sum\_\{j=1,{\textbackslash}infty\} a\_j(B,T) I{\textasciicircum}j\$, and the \$(B,T)\$-dependence of \$a\_j\$ depends on the mechanism of the charge transport. Above the mean field transition temperature \$T\_0\$, the fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter gives the additional conductivity, i.e., paraconductivity. Extending the analysis to the nonlinear response, we obtain the nonreciprocal charge transport expressed by \$a\_2(B,T) = a\_1(T) {\textbackslash}gamma(T) B\$, where \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ converges to a finite value at \$T=T\_0\$. Below \$T\_0\$, the vortex motion is relevant to the voltage drop, and the dependence of \$a\_j\$ on \$B,T\$ is different depending on the system and mechanisms. For the superconductors under the in-plane magnetic field, the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition occurs at \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm KT\}\$. In this case \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ has the characteristic temperature dependences such as \${\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}sim (T-T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm KT\}){\textasciicircum}\{-3/2\}\$ near \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm KT\}\$. On the other hand, for TMD with out-plane magnetic field, the KT transition is gone, and there are two possible mechanisms for the nonreciprocal response. One is the anisotropy of the damping constant for the motion of the vortex. In this case, \$a\_1(B) {\textbackslash}sim B\$ and \$a\_2(B) {\textbackslash}sim B{\textasciicircum}2\$. The other one is the ratchet potential acting on the vortex motion, which gives \$a\_1(B) {\textbackslash}sim B\$ and \$a\_2(B) {\textbackslash}sim B\$. Based on these results, we propose the experiments to identify the mechanism of the nonreciprocal charge transport.},

First principles calculations reveal intrinsic topologically nontrivial bulk energy gaps as large as 70-80 meV, which can be further enhanced up to 120 meV by compression. The strong spin-orbit coupling in BiTeX has a significant influence on the graphene Dirac states, resulting in the topologically nontrivial band structure, which is confirmed by calculated nontrivial Z2 index and an explicit demonstration of metallic edge states. Such heterostructures offer an unique Dirac transport system that combines the 2D Dirac states from graphene and 1D Dirac edge states from the topological insulator, and it offers new ideas for innovative device designs.},

From the magnetic field and temperature dependence, the UMR is identified to originate from the asymmetric scattering of electrons by magnons. In particular, the large magnitude of UMR is an outcome of spin-momentum locking and a small Fermi wavenumber at the surface of TI. In fact, the UMR is maximized around the Dirac point with the minimal Fermi wavenumber.},

	abstract = {Field effect transistors (FETs) made of thin flake single crystals isolated from layered materials have attracted growing interest since the success of graphene. Here, we report the fabrication of an electric double layer transistor (EDLT, a FET gated by ionic liquids) using a thin flake of MoS2, a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides, an archetypal layered material. The EDLT of the thin flake MoS2 unambiguously displayed ambipolar operation, in contrast to its commonly known bulk property as an n-type semiconductor. High-performance transistor operation characterized by a large “ON” state conductivity in the order of ∼mS and a high on/off ratio {\textgreater}102 was realized for both hole and electron transport. Hall effect measurements revealed mobility of 44 and 86 cm2 V-1 s-1 for electron and hole, respectively. The hole mobility is twice the value of the electron mobility, and the density of accumulated carrier reached 1 × 1014 cm-2, which is 1 order of magnitude larger than conventional FETs with solid dielectrics. The high-density carriers of both holes and electrons can create metallic transport in the MoS2 channel. The present result is not only important for device applications with new functionalities, but the method itself would also act as a protocol to study this class of material for a broader scope of possibilities in accessing their unexplored properties.},

	abstract = {The basic theory and first experimental results (if a new microfabricated ionic liquid-channel field-effect transistor (ILCFET) are presented. The ILCFET resembles a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) except that the current flowing from the source to the drain is carried in thin channels by ions of a liquid electrolyte. In MOSFETs the gate-induced electric field changes the channel concentration of only one mobile carrier, the holes or the electrons. In ILCFETs the concentrations of both cations and anions are altered. The devices that we have built have channels 0.088 {\textasciitilde}tm thick and 300,600, and 900 {\textasciitilde}tmlong. The basic steady-state theory predicts that for a channel thickness of 8 Debye lengths and a gate voltage change from 0 to 25 V (representing a potential change of 150 mV at the solid/liquid interface) the steady-state anion/cation ratio increases by a factor of 17.8. For a glycerol solution of KC1, the channel conductance increases correspondingly by a factor of 5.2. The transient response to a gate voltage step is modeled as a gate capacitance charging current followed by slower ambipolar diffusion. Both processes are described by the diffusion equation. Measurements have been made of conductance vs. gate voltage, gate capacitance charging current, and slow conductance changes due to diffusion for different types of glycerol solutions. Whereas the gate current transient response data agree well with theory, the long-term transient response data indicate that phenonema other than arnbipolar diffusion are present. Finally, the slopes of the channel conductance vs. gate voltage curves are less than predicted by the basic theory.},

The vacuum Rabi frequency for the coupling of cavity photons to quantized excitations of an adjacent electrical circuit (qubit) can easily exceed the damping rates of both the cavity and the qubit. This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances. In addition it would allow production of microwave photon states of fundamental importance for quantum communication.},

	abstract = {Electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are good candidates of quantum bits for quantum information processing. Basic operations of the qubit have been realized in recent years: initialization, manipulation of single spins, two qubit entanglement operations, and readout. Now it becomes crucial to demonstrate scalability of this architecture by conducting spin operations on a scaled up system. Here, we demonstrate single-electron spin resonance in a quadruple quantum dot. A few-electron quadruple quantum dot is formed within a magnetic field gradient created by a micro-magnet. We oscillate the wave functions of the electrons in the quantum dots by applying microwave voltages and this induces electron spin resonance. The resonance energies of the four quantum dots are slightly different because of the stray field created by the micro-magnet and therefore frequency-resolved addressable control of each electron spin resonance is possible.},

The main difﬁculty of such computation arises from the very high dimensions of the model, making it necessary to use relatively coarse meshes and hence requiring the numerical solver to be stable and to have good resolution under coarse meshes. In this paper we consider the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which is a ﬁnite element method using discontinuous piecewise polynomials as basis functions and numerical ﬂuxes based on upwinding for stability, for solving the Boltzmann-Poisson system. In many situations, the deterministic DG solver can produce accurate solutions with equal or less CPU time than the traditional DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) solvers. Numerical simulation results on a diode and a 2D double-gate MOSFET are given.},

For temperatures above approximately 50 K, the conductance is dominated by electrons in the bulk of the crystal, whereas below that temperature, surface conductance becomes more important. As the crystals are annealed in ﬂowing N2 gas, the surface sheet carrier concentration increases, and concomitantly, the OH-bond peak in the XPS spectrum becomes a larger fraction of the total O peak. Conversely, either O2-plasma annealing or electron-beam irradiation produces a decrease in the surface conductance and the OH fraction. Thus, H-related donors are likely the cause of the surface conductance.},

Here we report the observation of the fractional a.c. Josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor/superconductor InSb/Nb nanowire junction, a hallmark of topological matter. When the junction is irradiated with a radio-frequency f in the absence of an external magnetic field, quantized voltage steps (Shapiro steps) with a height hf/2e are observed, as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is carried by charge-2e Cooper pairs. At high magnetic fields the height of the first Shapiro step is doubled to hf/e, suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge-e quasiparticles. This is a unique signature of Majorana fermions, elusive particles predicted ca. 80 years ago.},

A given material can be transformed through proximity effects whereby it acquires properties of its neighbors, for example, becoming superconducting, magnetic, topologically nontrivial, or with an enhanced spin–orbit coupling. Such proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials by doping or functionalization but also can overcome their various limitations. In proximitized materials, it is possible to realize properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. While the focus is on magnetic and spin–orbit proximity effects with their applications in spintronics, the outlined principles also provide a broader framework for employing other proximity effects to tailor materials and realize novel phenomena.},

While observation of exceptionally long spin relaxation lengths makes graphene an intriguing material for spintronics studies, electric field modulation of spin currents is almost impossible due to negligible intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of graphene. In this work, we create an artificial interface between monolayer graphene and few-layer semiconducting tungsten disulphide. In these devices, we observe that graphene acquires spin–orbit coupling up to 17 meV, three orders of magnitude higher than its intrinsic value, without modifying the structure of the graphene. The proximity spin–orbit coupling leads to the spin Hall effect even at room temperature, and opens the door to spin field effect transistors. We show that intrinsic defects in tungsten disulphide play an important role in this proximity effect and that graphene can act as a probe to detect defects in semiconducting surfaces.},

A simple structure to realize this concept in a 2D crystal contains three atomic layers, a middle one built up from heavy elements generating strong atomic spin-orbit interaction and two neighboring atomic layers with diﬀerent electron negativity. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal, since it contains heavy Bi layer between Te and I layers. Recently the bulk form of BiTeI attracted considerable attention due to its giant Rashba interaction, however, 2D form of this crystal was not yet created. In this work we report the ﬁrst exfoliation of single layer BiTeI using a recently developed exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our combined scanning probe studies and ﬁrst principles calculations show that SL BiTeI ﬂakes with sizes of 100 µm were achieved which are stable at ambient conditions. The giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new member of 2D crystals open the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.},

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal transport phenomena indicate that the forward and backward flows differ, and are attributed to broken inversion symmetry. In this paper, we study the nonreciprocity of a thermal and thermoelectric transport of electronic systems resulting from inversion-symmetry-broken crystal structures. The nonlinear electric, thermoelectric, and thermal conductivities are derived up to the second order in an electric field and a temperature gradient by using the Boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation. All the second-order conductivities appearing in this paper are described by two functions and their derivatives, and these are related to each other in the same way that linear conductivities are e.g. via the Wiedemann-Franz law. We found that non-vanishing thermal-transport coefficients in the zero-temperature limit appear in nonlinear conductivities, which dominate the thermal transport at a sufficiently low temperature. The nonlinear conductivities and possible observable quantities are estimated in a \$1H\$ monolayer of the transition metal dichalcogenides MoS\$\_2\$ and a polar semiconductor BiTeX(X=I,Br).},

The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (ref. 4) represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices5. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility4,6, superconductivity7 and large magnetoresistance8, and can be patterned on the few-nanometre length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8×1013 cm-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.},

	abstract = {As silicon is the basis of conventional electronics, so strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is the foundation of the emerging field of oxide electronics1,2. SrTiO3 is the preferred template for the creation of exotic, two-dimensional (2D) phases of electron matter at oxide interfaces3,4,5 that have metal–insulator transitions6,7, superconductivity8,9 or large negative magnetoresistance10. However, the physical nature of the electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs), which is crucial to understanding their remarkable properties11,12, remains elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3 (including the non-doped insulating material) independently of bulk carrier densities over more than seven decades. This 2DEG is confined within a region of about five unit cells and has a sheet carrier density of ∼0.33 electrons per square lattice parameter. The electronic structure consists of multiple subbands of heavy and light electrons. The similarity of this 2DEG to those reported in SrTiO3-based heterostructures6,8,13 and field-effect transistors9,14 suggests that different forms of electron confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to essentially the same 2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study of the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices and a novel means of generating 2DEGs at the surfaces of transition-metal oxides.},

Topological insulators are one example in which the spin–orbit interaction leads the bulk bands to have a non-trivial topology, observable as gapless surface or edge states. Another example is the Rashba effect, which lifts the electron-spin degeneracy as a consequence of the spin–orbit interaction under broken inversion symmetry. It is of particular importance to know how these two effects, that is, the non-trivial topology of electronic states and the Rashba spin splitting, interplay with each other. Here we show through sophisticated first-principles calculations that BiTeI, a giant bulk Rashba semiconductor, turns into a topological insulator under a reasonable pressure. This material is shown to exhibit several unique features, such as a highly pressure-tunable giant Rashba spin splitting, an unusual pressure-induced quantum phase transition, and more importantly, the formation of strikingly different Dirac surface states at opposite sides of the material.},

Their ideal bulk-truncated surface hosts a single spin-helical surface state, which is the simplest possible surface electronic structure allowed by their non-trivial Z2 topology. However, real surfaces of such compounds, even if kept in ultra-high vacuum, rapidly develop a much more complex electronic structure whose origin and properties have proved controversial. Here we demonstrate that a conceptually simple model, implementing a semiconductor-like band bending in a parameter-free tight-binding supercell calculation, can quantitatively explain the entire measured hierarchy of electronic states. In combination with circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoemission experiments, we further uncover a rich three-dimensional spin texture of this surface electronic system, resulting from the non-trivial topology of the bulk band structure. Moreover, our study sheds new light on the surface-bulk connectivity in topological insulators, and reveals how this is modified by quantum confinement.},

A promising way to achieve this goal is to make use of the tunable Rashba effect that relies on the spin-orbit interaction in a two-dimensional electron system immersed in an inversion-asymmetric environment. The spin-orbit-induced spin splitting of the two-dimensional electron state provides a basis for many theoretically proposed spintronic devices. However, the lack of semiconductors with large Rashba effect hinders realization of these devices in actual practice. Here we report on a giant Rashba-type spin splitting in two-dimensional electron systems that reside at tellurium-terminated surfaces of bismuth tellurohalides. Among these semiconductors, BiTeCl stands out for its isotropic metallic surface-state band with the Γ̄-point energy lying deep inside the bulk band gap.

Interestingly, long spin lifetimes are observed despite the fact that both conductive scanning force microscopy and contact resistance measurements reveal the existence of conducting pinholes throughout the MgO spin injection/detection barriers. Compared to previous devices, we observe an enhancement of the spin lifetime in single layer graphene by a factor of 6.

Being very promising ingredients in themselves, interplaying Dirac and Rashba systems can provide a base for next generation of spintronics devices, to a considerable extent, by mixing their striking properties or by improving technically significant characteristics of each other. Here, we demonstrate that in BiTeI@PbSb2Te4 composed of a BiTeI trilayer on top of the topological insulator (TI) PbSb2Te4 weakly- and strongly-coupled Dirac-Rashba hybrid systems are realized. The coupling strength depends on both interface hexagonal stacking and trilayer-stacking order. The weakly-coupled system can serve as a prototype to examine, e.g., plasmonic excitations, frictional drag, spin-polarized transport, and charge-spin separation effect in multilayer helical metals. In the strongly-coupled regime, within {\textasciitilde}100 meV energy interval of the bulk TI projected bandgap a helical state substituting for the TI surface state appears. This new state is characterized by a larger momentum, similar velocity, and strong localization within BiTeI. We anticipate that our findings pave the way for designing a new type of spintronics devices based on Rashba-Dirac coupled systems.},

To comply with demands of nowaday spintronics, the studies of electron systems hosting giant spin-orbit-split electron states have become one of the most important problems providing us with a basis for desirable spintronics devices. In construction of such devices, it is also tempting to involve graphene, which has attracted great attention because of its unique and remarkable electronic properties and was recognized as a viable replacement for silicon in electronics. In this case, a challenging goal is to lift spin degeneracy of graphene Dirac states. Here, we propose a novel pathway to achieve this goal by means of coupling of graphene and polar-substrate surface states with giant Rashba-type spin-splitting. We theoretically demonstrate it by constructing the graphene@BiTeCl system, which appears to possess spin-helical graphene Dirac states caused by the strong interaction of Dirac and Rashba electrons. We anticipate that our findings will stimulate rapid growth in theoretical and experimental investigations of graphene Dirac states with real spin-momentum locking, which can revolutionize the graphene spintronics and become a reliable base for prospective spintronics applications.},

Unveiling the full spin texture in momentum space for such materials and its relation to the microscopic structure of the electronic wave functions is experimentally challenging and yet essential for exploiting spin–orbit effects for spin manipulation. Here we employ a state-of-the-art photoelectron momentum microscope with a multichannel spin filter to directly image the spin texture of the layered polar semiconductor BiTeI within the full two-dimensional momentum plane. Our experimental results, supported by relativistic ab initio calculations, demonstrate that the valence and conduction band electrons in BiTeI have spin textures of opposite chirality and of pronounced orbital dependence beyond the standard Rashba model, the latter giving rise to strong optical selection-rule effects on the photoelectron spin polarization. These observations open avenues for spin-texture manipulation by atomic-layer and charge carrier control in polar semiconductors.},

The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.},

If a large spin-orbit coupling could be created by a proximity effect, the material could also form active elements of a spintronic device such as the Das-Datta spin field-effect transistor, however, metal interfaces often compromise the band dispersion of massless Dirac fermions. Our measurements show that Au intercalation at the graphene-Ni interface creates a giant spin-orbit splitting ({\textasciitilde}100 meV) in the graphene Dirac cone up to the Fermi energy. Photoelectron spectroscopy reveals hybridization with Au-5d states as the source for the giant spin-orbit splitting. An ab initio model of the system shows a Rashba-split dispersion with the analytically predicted gapless band topology around the Dirac point of graphene and indicates that a sharp graphene-Au interface at equilibrium distance will account for only {\textasciitilde}10 meV spin-orbit splitting. The ab initio calculations suggest an enhancement due to Au atoms that get closer to the graphene and do not violate the sublattice symmetry.},

Nevertheless, besides being unstable in air, the weak tunability in these intrinsically metallic monolayers has limited the exploration of monolayer superconductivity, hindering their potential in electronic applications (e.g., superconductor–semiconductor hybrid devices). Here we show that using field effect gating, we can induce superconductivity in monolayer WS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition, a typical ambient-stable semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), and we are able to access a complete set of competing electronic phases over an unprecedented doping range from band insulator, superconductor, to a reentrant insulator at high doping. Throughout the superconducting dome, the Cooper pair spin is pinned by a strong internal spin–orbit interaction, making this material arguably the most resilient superconductor in the external magnetic field. The reentrant insulating state at positive high gating voltages is attributed to localization induced by the characteristically weak screening of the monolayer, providing insight into many dome-like superconducting phases observed in field-induced quasi-2D superconductors.},

Here, the realization of continuous field-effect switching between superconducting and non-superconducting states in a few-layer MoS2 transistor is reported. Ionic-liquid gating induces the superconducting state close to the quantum critical point on the top surface of the MoS2, and continuous switching between the super/non-superconducting states is achieved by HfO2 back gating. The superconducting transistor works effectively in the helium-4 temperature range and requires a gate bias as low as ≈10 V. The dual-gate device structure and strategy presented here can be easily generalized to other systems, opening new opportunities for designing high-performance 2D superconducting transistors.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are not intrinsically superconducting but they can carry a supercurrent when connected to superconducting electrodes1,2,3,4. This supercurrent is mainly transmitted by discrete entangled electron–hole states confined to the nanotube, called Andreev bound states (ABS). These states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of Josephson-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures (for example molecules, nanowires, magnetic or normal metallic layers) connected to superconducting leads5. We report here the first tunnelling spectroscopy of individually resolved ABS, in a nanotube–superconductor device. Analysing the evolution of the ABS spectrum with a gate voltage, we show that the ABS arise from the discrete electronic levels of the molecule and that they reveal detailed information about the energies of these levels, their relative spin orientation and the coupling to the leads. Such measurements hence constitute a powerful new spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating the electronic structure of CNT-based devices, including those with well-coupled leads. This is relevant for conventional applications (for example, superconducting or normal transistors, superconducting quantum interference devices3 (SQUIDs)) and quantum information processing (for example, entangled electron pair generation6,7, ABS-based qubits8). Finally, our device is a new type of d.c.-measurable SQUID.},

The drive for large scale detector microchips is demanding NbTiN ﬁlms with uniform properties over an increasingly larger area. This article provides an experimental comparison between two reactive d.c. sputter systems with different target sizes: a small target ( 100 mm) and a large target (127 mm × 444.5 mm). This article focuses on maximizing the Tc of the ﬁlms and the accompanying I-V characteristics of the sputter plasma, and we ﬁnd that both systems are capable of depositing ﬁlms with Tc {\textgreater} 15 K. The resulting ﬁlm uniformity is presented in a second manuscript in this volume. We ﬁnd that these ﬁlms are deposited within the transition from metallic to compound sputtering, at the point where target nitridation most strongly depends on nitrogen ﬂow. Key in the deposition optimization is to increase the system’s pumping speed and gas ﬂows to counteract the hysteretic effects induced by the target size. Using the I-V characteristics as a guide proves to be an effective way to optimize a reactive sputter system, for it can show whether the optimal deposition regime is hysteresis-free and accessible.},

MoRe, a chemically inert superconductor, allows for oxide free fabrication of high transparency vertical MoS2 devices. Single and bilayer MoS2 junctions display relatively large critical currents (up to 2.5 μA) and the appearance of sub-gap structure given by MAR. In three and four layer thick devices we observe orders of magnitude lower critical currents (sub-nA) and reduced quasiparticle gaps due to proximitized MoS2 layers in contact with MoRe. We anticipate that this device architecture could be easily extended to other 2D materials.},

	abstract = {Motivated by recent experiments revealing superconductivity in MoS2, we investigate the Josephson eﬀect in the monolayer MoS2 in the presence of an exchange splitting. We show that the supercurrent reversal known as 0-$\pi$ transition can occur by varying the doping via gate voltages. This is in contrast to common superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junctions in which successive 0-$\pi$ transitions take place with the variation of junction length or temperature. In fact for the case of MoS2 we ﬁnd that both the amplitude and the period of oscillations show a dependence on the doping which explains the predicted doping-induced supercurrent reversal. These eﬀects comes from the dependence of density and Fermi velocity on the doping strength beside the intrinsic spin-splitting in the valence band which originates from spin-orbit interaction.},

	abstract = {The proximity-induced spin-triplet f-wave symmetry pairing in a monolayer molybdenum disulﬁde-superconductor hybrid features an interesting electron-hole excitations and also effective superconducting subgap, giving rise to a distinct Andreev resonance state. Owing to the complicated Fermi surface and momentum dependency of f-wave pair potential, monolayer MoS2 with strong spin-orbit coupling can be considered an intriguing structure to reveal the superconducting state. Actually, this can be possible by calculating the peculiar spin-valley polarized transport of quasiparticles in a related normal metal/superconductor junction. We theoretically study the formation of effective gap at the interface and resulting normalized conductance on top of a MoS2 under induction of f-wave order parameter, using Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism. The superconducting excitations shows that the gap is renormalized by a bias limitation coefﬁcient including dynamical band parameters of monolayer MoS2, especially, ones related to the Schrodinger-type momentum of Hamiltonian. The effective gap is more sensitive to the n-doping regime of superconductor region. The signature of spin-orbit coupling, topological and asymmetry mass-related terms in the resulting subgap conductance and, in particular, maximum conductance is presented. In the absence of topological term, the effective gap reaches to its maximum value. The unconventional nature of superconducting order leads to the appearance of zero-bias conductance. In addition, the maximum value of conductance can be controlled by tuning the doping level of normal and superconductor regions.},

We use noninteracting lattice models of topological insulators, building gradually on these to arrive from the simplest one-dimensional case (the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene) to two-dimensional time-reversal invariant topological insulators (the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for HgTe). In each case the model is introduced first and then its properties are discussed and subsequently generalized. The only prerequisite for the reader is a working knowledge in quantum mechanics, the relevant solid state physics background is provided as part of this self-contained text, which is complemented by end-of-chapter problems.},

	abstract = {Circuit quantum electrodynamics, where photons are coherently coupled to artificial atoms built with superconducting circuits, has enabled the investigation and control of macroscopic quantum-mechanical phenomena in superconductors. Recently, hybrid circuits incorporating semiconducting nanowires and other electrostatically-gateable elements have provided new insights into mesoscopic superconductivity. Extending the capabilities of hybrid flux-based circuits to work in magnetic fields would be especially useful both as a probe of spin-polarized Andreev bound states and as a possible platform for topological qubits. The fluxonium is particularly suitable as a readout circuit for topological qubits due to its unique persistent-current based eigenstates. In this Letter, we present a magnetic-field compatible hybrid fluxonium with an electrostatically-tuned semiconducting nanowire as its non-linear element. We operate the fluxonium in magnetic fields up to 1T and use it to observe the \${\textbackslash}varphi\_0\$-Josephson effect. This combination of gate-tunability and field-compatibility opens avenues for the exploration and control of spin-polarized phenomena using superconducting circuits and enables the use of the fluxonium as a readout device for topological qubits.},

Using a circuit-quantum-electrodynamics architecture, we experimentally realize a superconducting \$0-{\textbackslash}pi\$ qubit, which hosts protected states suitable for quantum-information processing. Multi-tone spectroscopy measurements reveal the energy level structure of the system, which can be precisely described by a simple two-mode Hamiltonian. We find that the parity symmetry of the qubit results in charge-insensitive levels connecting the protected states, allowing for logical operations. The measured relaxation (1.6 ms) and dephasing times (25 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s) demonstrate that our implementation of the \$0-{\textbackslash}pi\$ circuit not only broadens the family of superconducting qubits, but also represents a promising candidate for the building block of a fault-tolerant quantum processor.},

	abstract = {Silicon spin qubits show great promise as a scalable qubit platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, fast high-fidelity readout of charge and spin states, which is required for quantum error correction, has remained elusive. Radio-frequency reflectometry enables rapid high-fidelity readout of GaAs spin qubits, but the relatively large resistances and capacitances of accumulation-mode Si quantum dot devices have made radio-frequency reflectometry challenging in these platforms. In this work, we implement radio-frequency reflectometry in a Si/SiGe quantum dot device with overlapping gates by making minor device-level changes that eliminate these challenges. We demonstrate charge state readout with a fidelity above 99.9\% in an integration time of 300 ns. We measure the singlet and triplet states of a double quantum dot via both conventional Pauli spin blockade and a charge latching mechanism, and we achieve maximum fidelities of 82.9\% and 99.0\% in 2.08 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s and 1.6 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s integration times, respectively. We also use radio-frequency reflectometry to perform single-shot readout of single-spin states via spin-selective tunneling in microsecond-scale integration times.},

The coupling between Josephson junctions in an Andreev molecule occurs through the overlap and hybridization of the junction’s “atomic” orbitals, Andreev Bound States. A striking consequence is that the supercurrent ﬂowing through one junction depends on the superconducting phase diﬀerence across the other junction. Using the Bogolubiov-de-Gennes formalism, we derive the energy spectrum and nonlocal current-phase relation for arbitrary separation. We demonstrate the possibility of creating a φ-junction and propose experiments to verify our predictions.

Here, we present the fabrication and characterization of SMR fabricated with a MoRe 60-40 alloy. At low drive powers, we observe internal quality-factors as high as 700,000. Temperature and power dependence of the internal quality-factors suggest the presence of the two level systems from the dielectric substrate dominating the internal loss at low temperatures. We further test the compatibility of these resonators with high temperature processes such as for carbon nanotube CVD growth, and their performance in the magnetic ﬁeld, an important characterization for hybrid systems.},

	abstract = {Investigation of strongly interacting, nonlinear quantum field theories (QFT-s) remains one of the outstanding challenges of modern physics. Here, we describe analog quantum simulators for nonlinear QFT-s using mesoscopic superconducting circuit lattices. Using the Josephson effect as the source of nonlinear interaction, we investigate generalizations of the quantum sine-Gordon model. In particular, we consider a two-field generalization, the double sine-Gordon model. In contrast to the sine-Gordon model, this model can be purely quantum integrable, when it does not admit a semi-classical description - a property that is generic to many multi-field QFT-s. The primary goal of this work is to investigate different thermodynamic properties of the double sine-Gordon model and propose experiments that can capture its subtle quantum integrability. First, we analytically compute the mass-spectrum and the ground state energy in the presence of an external `magnetic' field using Bethe ansatz and conformal perturbation theory. Second, we calculate the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations for the model and analyze its finite temperature properties. Third, we propose experiments to verify the theoretical predictions.},

We discuss two defining characteristics in the architecture of these amplifiers: the number of modes occupied by the signal, idler and pump waves and the number of independent ports through which these waves enter into the circuit. The scattering properties of these amplifiers is also reviewed.

	abstract = {Recent research in superconducting quantum circuits operating close to the quantum limit results in the need of a quantum mechanical treatment of losses. Of special interest is the dynamic behaviour of an open quantum system. As an example, a negative-resistance Josephson parametric amplifier is treated. The DC bias voltage is chosen such that a strong interaction between the Josephson junction and the two resonant circuits, the signal and the idler circuit, is achieved. Power exchange occurs between the two considered resonator modes and also between the resonator modes and the DC power supply. Losses in the resonators are modeled by the quantum Langevin method, which describes the losses by coupling the resonators to a heat bath representing a photon gas in thermal equilibrium. The derived dynamic behaviour does not provide signal energy saturation, like classically expected for parametric amplifiers. Introducing a phenomenological multi-photon coupling approach, saturation of the amplified signal is ensured. The time evolution of the signal and noise energy is calculated and numerically evaluated for a specific example in cases of both, the quantum Langevin method with and without the phenomenological multi-photon coupling approach.

	abstract = {In the spin energy excitation mode of normal metals and superconductors, spin up and down electrons (or quasiparticles) carry different heat currents. This mode occurs only when spin up and down energy distribution functions are non-identical, most simply when the two spins have different effective temperatures, and can be excited by spin-polarised current injection into the system. While evidence for spin-dependent heat transport has been observed in a normal metal, these measurements averaged over the distribution function of the electrons. By performing spectroscopy of quasiparticle populations in a mescoscopic superconductor, we reveal distribution functions which are strongly out-of-equilibrium, i.e. non-Fermi-Dirac. In addition, unlike in normal metals, the spin energy mode in superconductors is associated with a charge imbalance (different numbers of hole- and electron-like quasiparticles) at the superconducting gap edge, in finite Zeeman magnetic fields. Our spectroscopic technique allows us to observe this charge imbalance and thus unambiguously identify the spin energy mode. Our results agree well with theory and contribute to laying the foundation for spin caloritronics with superconductors.},

	abstract = {This thesis work explores unique features offered by the Josephson mixer in the upcoming field of microwave quantum optics. We have demonstrated three major roles the Josephson mixer could play in emerging quantum information architectures. First, we have designed and fabricated a state-of-the-art practical quantum limited amplifier with the best quantum efficiency achieved to date. This tool is crucial for probing mesoscopic systems with microwaves, and in particular superconducting circuits. Hence, it has enabled us to realize successfully the stabilization of quantum trajectories of a superconducting qubit by measurement-based feedback. Second, we have shown how this circuit can generate and distribute entangled microwave radiations on separated transmission lines at different frequencies. Using two Josephson mixers, we have provided the first demonstration of entanglement between spatially separated propagating fields in the microwave domain, the so-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states. Finally, we have used the Josephson mixer as a frequency converter. Acting as a switch, it is able to dynamically turn on and off the coupling to a low loss cavity. This feature allowed us to realize a quantum memory for microwaves. In combination with the ability to generate entanglement, we have measured the time-controlled generation, storage and on-demand release of an entangled state, which is a prerequisite for nodes of a quantum network.},

To facilitate the interpretation of the experimental results, we first present a discussion of the theory of microwave squeezing via Josephson parametric amplifiers. This is followed by a detailed description of the device fabricated for our experiment. Experimental results are then presented for the device used in both the doubly degenerate or four-photon mode and for the degenerate or three-photon mode. We have observed parametric deamplification of signals by more than 8 dB. We have demonstrated squeezing of 4.2-K thermal noise. When operated at 0.1 K, the amplifier exhibits an excess noise of 0.28 K when referred to the input. This is smaller than the vacuum fluctuation noise level ħω/2k=0.47 K. The amplifier is thus quieter than a linear phase-insensitive amplifier in principle can be.},

The photocurrent is spin polarized due to the spin-momentum locking of the electronic states, which is manifested by a sign reversal upon flipping either the photon helicity or the sign of the Rashba parameter, without any stray current. The action spectra revealed the photon energy range, where the photocurrent is carried by the Dirac electrons at the inner Fermi surface. This photogalvanic control is enabled by the sizable spin splittings both at the valence and conduction bands with the same helicity, and also by a number of optical transition pathways compared to those in the two-dimensional Rashba systems. An efficient coupling between the photon field and large spin-orbit interaction is accordingly proposed to allow the universal control of Dirac electrons.},

	abstract = {Atomically thin materials such as graphene and monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable physical properties resulting from
their reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetry. The family of semiconducting
transition metal dichalcogenides is an especially promising platform for
fundamental studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, with potential
applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics due to their direct band gap
in the monolayer limit and highly efficient light-matter coupling. A crystal
lattice with broken inversion symmetry combined with strong spin-orbit
interactions leads to a unique combination of the spin and valley degrees of
freedom. In addition, the 2D character of the monolayers and weak dielectric
screening from the environment yield a significant enhancement of the Coulomb
interaction. The resulting formation of bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons,
dominates the optical and spin properties of the material. Here we review
recent progress in our understanding of the excitonic properties in monolayer
TMDs and lay out future challenges. We focus on the consequences of the strong
direct and exchange Coulomb interaction, discuss exciton-light interaction and
effects of other carriers and excitons on electron-hole pairs in TMDs. Finally,
the impact on valley polarization is described and the tuning of the energies
and polarization observed in applied electric and magnetic fields is
summarized.},

	abstract = {The Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit (SO) interactions in 2D electron gases act as effective magnetic fields with momentum-dependent directions, which cause spin decay as the spins undergo arbitrary precessions about these randomly oriented SO fields due to momentum scattering. Theoretically and experimentally, it has been established that by fine-tuning the Rashba α and renormalized Dresselhaus β couplings to equal fixed strengths α=β, the total SO field becomes unidirectional, thus rendering the electron spins immune to decay due to momentum scattering. A robust persistent spin helix (PSH), i.e., a helical spin-density wave excitation with constant pitch P=2$\pi$/Q, Q=4mα/ℏ2, has already been experimentally realized at this singular point α=β, enhancing the spin lifetime by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Here, we employ the suppression of weak antilocalization as a sensitive detector for matched SO fields together with independent electrical control over the SO couplings via top gate voltage VT and back gate voltage VB to extract all SO couplings when combined with detailed numerical simulations. We demonstrate for the first time the gate control of the renormalized β and the continuous locking of the SO fields at α=β; i.e., we are able to vary both α and β controllably and continuously with VT and VB, while keeping them locked at equal strengths. This makes possible a new concept: “stretchable PSHs,” i.e., helical spin patterns with continuously variable pitches P over a wide parameter range. Stretching the PSH, i.e., gate controlling P while staying locked in the PSH regime, provides protection from spin decay at the symmetry point α=β, thus offering an important advantage over other methods. This protection is limited mainly by the cubic Dresselhaus term, which breaks the unidirectionality of the total SO field and causes spin decay at higher electron densities. We quantify the cubic term, and find it to be sufficiently weak so that the extracted spin-diffusion lengths and decay times show a significant enhancement near α=β. Since within the continuous-locking regime quantum transport is diffusive (2D) for charge while ballistic (1D) for spin and thus amenable to coherent spin control, stretchable PSHs could provide the platform for the much heralded long-distance communication ∼8–25 μm between solid-state spin qubits, where the spin diffusion length for α≠β is an order of magnitude smaller.},

Much effort has recently been devoted to the fundamental understanding and practical applications of such highly charged EDL interfaces. However, the intrinsic nature of the EDL charging, whether it is electrostatics or electrochemistry, and how to distinguish them are far from clear. Here, by combining electrical transport measurements with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we studied the charging mechanisms of highly charged EDL interfaces between an ionic liquid and oxide semiconductor, ZnO. The direct measure for mobile carriers from the Hall effect agreed well with that from the capacitance-voltage integration at 1 Hz, implying that the pseudocapacitance does not contribute to carrier transport at EDL interfaces. The temperature-frequency mapping of EIS was further demonstrated as a “phase diagram” to distinguish the electrostatic or electrochemical nature of such highly charged EDL interfaces with densities of up to 8 × 1014 cm-2, providing a guideline for electric-ﬁeld-induced electronic phenomena and a simple method for distinguishing electrostatic and electrochemical charging in EDLTs not only based on a speciﬁc oxide semiconductor, ZnO, but also commonly applicable to all types of EDL interfaces with extremely highdensity carrier accumulation.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical eﬀects manifest as nonlinear responses to an applied electric ﬁeld in electrochemical devices, and are linked intimately to the molecular orientation of ions in the electric double layer (EDL). Herein, we probe the origin of the electrochemical eﬀect using a double-gate graphene ﬁeld eﬀect transistor (GFET) of ionic liquid N,N-diethyl-N-(2methoxyethyl)-N-methylammonium bis(triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl)imide (DEME-TFSI) top-gate, paired with a ferroelectric Pb0.92La0.08Zr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PLZT) back-gate of compatible gating eﬃciency. The orientation of the interfacial molecular ions can be extracted by measuring the GFET Dirac point shift, and their dynamic response to ultraviolet-visible light and a gate electric ﬁeld was quantiﬁed. We have observed that the strong electrochemical eﬀect is due to the TFSI anions self-organizing on a treated GFET surface. Moreover, a reversible order-disorder transition of TFSI anions selforganized on the GFET surface can be triggered by illuminating the interface with ultraviolet-visible light, revealing that it is a useful method to control the surface ion conﬁguration and the overall performance of the device.},

Diﬀerent blend formulations were produced and characterized via spectroscopic techniques. The thermal properties of these materials were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite polymer electrolytes were analyzed within the temperature range from -20 °C to 100 °C. The maximum ionic conductivity values of the ﬁlm containing SPSU/ 0.1 IL and SPSU / \%5 hBN / 0.2 IL were measured as 2.5 × 10-4 and 1.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 100 °C, respectively. The produced membranes have promising dimensional stability, higher conductivity, and better thermal stability. A symmetrical cell of SPSU / \%5 hBN/ 0.2 IL sample yielded a maximum speciﬁc capacitance of 90.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The same electrolyte yielded a maximum energy density in supercapacitor as 43.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1100 W kg-1.},

It is typically assumed to manifest as a momentum-dependent splitting of a single initially spin-degenerate band into two branches with opposite spin polarization. Combining polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission measurements with density functional theory calculations, we show that the two “spin-split” branches of the model giant Rashba system BiTeI additionally develop disparate orbital textures, each of which is coupled to a distinct spin configuration. This necessitates a reinterpretation of spin splitting in Rashba-like systems and opens new possibilities for controlling spin polarization through the orbital sector.},

Then, we report and discuss the operation of InAs nanowire-based electrolyte-gated transistors implemented using ionic liquids. We show that the ionic liquid gating outperforms the conventional solid-state back gate, and we compare the current modulation achieved in the same InAs NW using the ionic liquid gate or the back-gate. Finally, we highlight the capability of the liquid electrolyte to drastically change the resistance dependence on temperature in the nanowire. Our results suggest promising strategies toward the advanced ﬁeld eﬀect control of innovative III-V semiconductor nanowire-based devices for information and communication technologies at large.},

	abstract = {Topological transition transforms common superconductivity into an exotic phase of matter, which holds promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. A hallmark of this topological transition is the emergence of Majorana states, quasiparticles that nonlocally store a single electron. While two-dimensional semiconductor/superconductor heterostructures are desirable platforms for topological superconductivity, direct phase-measurements as the fingerprint of the underlying topological transition are conspicuously missing. By embedding two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in a phase-sensitive loop geometry, we measure for the first time a \${\textbackslash}pi\$-jump in the superconducting phase across the junction, a signature of the topological transition. Furthermore, in epitaxial Al/InAs junctions we observe closing and reopening of the superconducting gap with increasing in-plane magnetic field, \$\{{\textbackslash}bf B\}\_{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$, coincident with the \${\textbackslash}pi\$-jump. Theoretical simulations confirm this transition is topological and compatible with the emergence of Majorana states. Remarkably, in each Josephson junction, this topological transition can be controlled by changing the gate voltage. These findings reveal versatile two-dimensional platforms for scalable topological quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Here we review recent progress in cooling micro/nanoelectronic devices significantly below 10 mK. A number of groups worldwide are working to produce sub-millikelvin on-chip electron temperatures, motivated by the possibility of observing new physical effects and improving the performance of quantum technologies, sensors and metrological standards. The challenge is a longstanding one, with the lowest reported on-chip electron temperature having remained around 4 mK for more than 15 years. This is despite the fact that microkelvin temperatures have been accessible in bulk materials since the mid 20th century. In this review we describe progress made in the last five years using new cooling techniques. Developments have been driven by improvements in the understanding of nanoscale physics, material properties and heat flow in electronic devices at ultralow temperatures, and have involved collaboration between universities and institutes, physicists and engineers. We hope that this review will serve as a summary of the current state-of-the-art, and provide a roadmap for future developments. We focus on techniques that have shown, in experiment, the potential to reach sub-millikelvin electron temperatures. In particular, we focus on on-chip demagnetisation refrigeration. Multiple groups have used this technique to reach temperatures around 1 mK, with a current lowest temperature below 0.5 mK.},

The charge cavity coupling rate is in good agreement with device simulations. Our coupling technique can be extended to enable simultaneous coupling of multiple DQDs to the same cavity mode, opening the door to long-range coupling of semiconductor qubits using microwave frequency photons.},

	abstract = {In the spin energy excitation mode of normal metals and superconductors, spin up and down electrons (or quasiparticles) carry different heat currents. This mode occurs only when spin up and down energy distribution functions are non-identical, most simply when the two spins have different effective temperatures, and can be excited by spin-polarised current injection into the system. While evidence for spin-dependent heat transport has been observed in a normal metal, these measurements averaged over the distribution function of the electrons. By performing spectroscopy of quasiparticle populations in a mescoscopic superconductor, we reveal distribution functions which are strongly out-of-equilibrium, i.e. non-Fermi-Dirac. In addition, unlike in normal metals, the spin energy mode in superconductors is associated with a charge imbalance (different numbers of hole- and electron-like quasiparticles) at the superconducting gap edge, in finite Zeeman magnetic fields. Our spectroscopic technique allows us to observe this charge imbalance and thus unambiguously identify the spin energy mode. Our results agree well with theory and contribute to laying the foundation for spin caloritronics with superconductors.},

	abstract = {This is a tutorial review of methods to braid the world lines of non-Abelian anyons (Majorana zero-modes) in topological superconductors. That "Holy Grail" of topological quantum information processing has not yet been reached in the laboratory, but there now exists a variety of platforms in which one can search for the Majorana braiding statistics. After an introduction to the basic concepts of braiding we discuss how one might be able to braid immobile Majorana zero-modes, bound to the end points of a nanowire, by performing the exchange in parameter space, rather than in real space. We explain how Coulomb interaction can be used to both control and read out the braiding operation, even though Majorana zero-modes are charge neutral. We ask whether the fusion rule might provide for an easier pathway towards the demonstration of non-Abelian statistics. In the final part we discuss an approach to braiding in real space, rather than parameter space, using vortices injected into a chiral Majorana edge mode as "flying qubits". Contents: I. Introduction II. Basic Concepts (The magic of braiding; Non-Abelian statistics; Fusion rules; Clifford gates; Topological protection) III.

High coherence can be attained by building circuits from fixed-frequency qubits, however, leading techniques cannot couple qubits that are far detuned. Here we introduce a method based on a tunable bus which allows for the coupling of two fixed-frequency qubits even at large detunings. By parametrically oscillating the bus at the qubit-qubit detuning we enable a resonant exchange (XX+YY) interaction. We use this interaction to implement a 183ns two-qubit iSWAP gate between qubits separated in frequency by 854MHz with a measured average fidelity of 0.9823(4) from interleaved randomized benchmarking. This gate may be an enabling technology for surface code circuits and for analog quantum simulation.},

The coupling modulation is achieved with a tunable coupler design, in which the qubit and the resonator are connected in parallel to a superconducting quantum interference device. This allows for quasi-static tuning of the qubit-cavity coupling strength from 12 MHz to more than 300 MHz. Additionally, the coupling can be dynamically modulated, allowing for single photon exchange in 6 ns. Qubit coherence times exceeding 20 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s are maintained over the majority of the range of tuning, limited primarily by the Purcell effect. The parametric stabilization technique realized using the tunable coupler involves engineering the qubit bath through a combination of photon non-conserving sideband interactions realized by flux modulation, and direct qubit Rabi driving. We demonstrate that the qubit can be stabilized to arbitrary states on the Bloch sphere with a worst-case fidelity exceeding 80 \%.},

	abstract = {Photons are fundamental excitations of the electromagnetic field and can be captured in cavities. For a given cavity with a certain size, the fundamental mode has a fixed frequency f which gives the photons a specific "colour". The cavity also has a typical lifetime tau, which results in a finite linewidth delta f\vphantom{\{}\}. If the size of the cavity is changed fast compared to tau, and so that the frequency change Delta f {\textgreater}{\textgreater} delta f, then it is possible to change the "colour" of the captured photons. Here we demonstrate superconducting microwave cavities, with tunable effective lengths. The tuning is obtained by varying a Josephson inductance at one end of the cavity. We show tuning by several hundred linewidths in a time Delta t {\textless}{\textless} tau. Working in the few photon limit, we show that photons stored in the cavity at one frequency will leak out from the cavity with the new frequency after the detuning. The characteristics of the measured devices make them suitable for dynamic coupling of qubits.},

We present full quantum state tomography of this complex cat state over a Hilbert space exceeding 100 dimensions via quantum non-demolition measurements of the joint photon number parity. The ability to manipulate such multi-cavity quantum states paves the way for logical operations between redundantly encoded qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication.},

Advanced quantum simulation experiments have been shown with up to nine qubits, while a demonstration of quantum supremacy with fifty qubits is anticipated in just a few years. Quantum supremacy means that the quantum system can no longer be simulated by the most powerful classical supercomputers. Integrated classical-quantum computing systems are already emerging that can be used for software development and experimentation, even via web interfaces. Therefore, the time is ripe for describing some of the recent development of superconducting devices, systems and applications. As such, the discussion of superconducting qubits and circuits is limited to devices that are proven useful for current or near future applications. Consequently, the centre of interest is the practical applications of QIP, such as computation and simulation in Physics and Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) employs superconducting microwave resonators as quantum buses. In circuit QED with semiconductor quantum-dot-based qubits, increasing the resonator impedance is desirable as it enhances the coupling to the typically small charge dipole moment of these qubits. However, the gate electrodes necessary to form quantum dots in the vicinity of a resonator inadvertently lead to a parasitic port through which microwave photons can leak, thereby reducing the quality factor of the resonator. This is particularly the case for high-impedance resonators, as the ratio of their total capacitance over the parasitic port capacitance is smaller, leading to larger microwave leakage than for 50 \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ resonators. Here, we introduce a novel implementation of on-chip filters to suppress the microwave leakage. The filters comprise a high-kinetic-inductance nanowire inductor and a thin film capacitor. The filter has a small footprint and can be placed close to the resonator, confining microwaves to a small area of the chip. The inductance and capacitance of the filter elements can be varied over a wider range of values than their typical spiral inductor and interdigitated capacitor counterparts. We demonstrate that the total linewidth of a 6.4 GHz and \${\textbackslash}sim 3 {\textbackslash}text\{ k\}{\textbackslash}Omega\$ resonator can be improved down to 540 kHz using these filters.},

This finding raises a serious question on the efficacy of using zero-bias tunneling conductance peaks, by themselves, as evidence supporting the existence of topological Majorana bound states in nanowires. In the current work, we provide specific experimental protocols for tunneling spectroscopy measure- ments to distinguish between Andreev and Majorana bound states without invoking more demand- ing nonlocal measurements which have not yet been successfully performed in nanowire systems. In particular, we discuss three distinct experimental schemes involving response of the zero-bias peak to local perturbations of the tunnel barrier, overlap of bound states from the wire ends, and most compellingly, introducing a sharp localized potential in the wire itself to perturb the zero-bias tun- neling peaks. We provide extensive numerical simulations clarifying and supporting our theoretical predictions.},

The sign of the topological gap, controlled by the CAR amplitude, depends periodically on the Fermi wavelength and strip width and can be externally tuned. An interface between two halves of a long strip with topological gaps of opposite sign implements a robust \${\textbackslash}pi\$-junction, hosting a pair of Majorana zero modes that do not split despite their overlap. We show that such a situation can be exploited to perform protected non-Abelian tunnel-braid operations without any fine tuning.},

	abstract = {Using ionic-liquid (IL) gating in electric-double-layer transistors (EDLTs), we investigate ﬁeld-eﬀect electrical transport properties of ultrathin epitaxial ﬁlms of a topological insulator (TI), Bi2Te3. Because of their extreme thinness, the Bi2Te3 ﬁlms show a band gap opening and resulting semiconducting transport properties. Near room temperature, an obvious ambipolar transistor operation with an ON-OFF ratio close to 103 was observed in the transfer characteristics of liquid-gated EDLTs and further conﬁrmed by a sign change of the Hall coeﬃcients. Modulation of the electronic states and a phase transition from a semiconducting conduction (dRxx/dT {\textless} 0) to a metallic transport (dRxx/dT {\textgreater} 0) were observed in the temperature-dependent resistance of the ultrathin Bi2Te3 channel, demonstrating that the liquid gating is an eﬀective way to modulate the electronic states of TIs.},

In the vicinity of the Dirac cone vertex, the effective model describing the states localized at the interface is well approximated by a model of Dirac electrons experiencing superconducting s-wave pairing. Away from the cone vertex, the induced pairing potential develops a p-wave component with a magnitude sensitive to the structure of the interface. Observing the induced s-wave superconductivity may require tuning the chemical potential close to the Dirac point. Furthermore, we find that the proximity of the superconductor leads to a significant renormalization of the original parameters of the effective model describing the surface states of a topological insulator.},

Our focus is on understanding specific intriguing features in the data, and our goal is to establish matters of principle controlling the physics of the best possible nanowires available in current experiments. We identify dissipation, finite temperature, multi-sub-band effects, and the finite tunnel barrier as the four most important physical mechanisms controlling the zero-bias conductance peak.

Following proposals for their detection in a semiconductor nanowire coupled to an s-wave superconductor, several tunneling experiments reported characteristic Majorana signatures. Reducing disorder has been a prime challenge for these experiments because disorder can mimic the zero-energy signatures of Majoranas, and renders the topological properties inaccessible. Here, we show characteristic Majorana signatures in InSb nanowire devices exhibiting clear ballistic transport properties. Application of a magnetic field and spatial control of carrier density using local gates generates a zero bias peak that is rigid over a large region in the parameter space of chemical potential, Zeeman energy, and tunnel barrier potential. The reduction of disorder allows us to resolve separate regions in the parameter space with and without a zero bias peak, indicating topologically distinct phases. These observations are consistent with the Majorana theory in a ballistic system, and exclude for the first time the known alternative explanations that invoke disorder or a nonuniform chemical potential.},

We report the reversible electrical switching of ferromagnetic (FM) states in platinum (Pt) thin films by introducing paramagnetic ionic liquid (PIL) as the gating media. The paramagnetic ionic gating controls the movement of ions with magnetic moments, which induces itinerant ferromagnetism on the surface of Pt films, with large coercivity and perpendicular anisotropy mimicking the ideal two-dimensional Ising-type FM state. The electrical transport of the induced FM state shows Kondo effect at low temperature, suggesting spatially separated coexistence of Kondo scattering beneath the FM interface. The tunable FM state indicates that paramagnetic ionic gating could serve as a versatile method to induce rich transport phenomena combining field effect and magnetism at PIL-gated interfaces.

	abstract = {Spin orbit interaction is strongly enhanced in structures where a heavy element is embedded in an inversion asymmetric crystal field. A simple way for realizing such a setup is to take a single atomic layer of a heavy element and encapsulate it between two atomic layers of different elemental composition. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal. In its bulk form BiTeI consists of loosely coupled three atom thick layers where a layer of high atomic number Bi are sandwiched between Te and I sheets. Despite considerable recent attention to bulk BiTeI due to its giant Rashba spin splitting, the isolation of a single layer remained elusive. In this work we report the first successful isolation and characterization of a single layer of BiTeI using a novel exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our scanning probe studies and first principles calculations show that the fabricated 100 μm sized BiTeI flakes are stable at ambient conditions. Giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new 2D crystal opens the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.},

Knowledge of the CPR is essential in order to understand the response of a JJ to various external parameters. Despite the rising interest in ultraclean encapsulated graphene JJs, the CPR of such junctions remains unknown. Here, we use a fully gate-tunable graphene superconducting quantum intereference device (SQUID) to determine the CPR of ballistic graphene JJs. Each of the two JJs in the SQUID is made with graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. By independently controlling the critical current of the JJs, we can operate the SQUID either in a symmetric or asymmetric configuration. The highly asymmetric SQUID allows us to phase-bias one of the JJs and thereby directly obtain its CPR. The CPR is found to be skewed, deviating significantly from a sinusoidal form. The skewness can be tuned with the gate voltage and oscillates in antiphase with Fabry-Pérot resistance oscillations of the ballistic graphene cavity. We compare our experiments with tight-binding calculations that include realistic graphene–superconductor interfaces and find a good qualitative agreement.},

	abstract = {Electronic excitations above the ground state must overcome an energy gap in superconductors with spatially-homogeneous pairing. In contrast, inhomogeneous superconductors such as those with magnetic impurities or weak links, or heterojunctions containing normal metals or quantum dots, can host subgap electronic excitations that are generically known as Andreev bound states (ABSs). With the advent of topological superconductivity, a new kind of ABS with exotic qualities, known as Majorana bound state (MBS), has been discovered. We review the main properties of ABSs and MBSs, and the state-of-the-art techniques for their detection. We focus on hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, possibly coupled to quantum dots, as one of the most flexible and promising experimental platforms. We discuss how the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in these wires triggers the transition from ABSs into MBSs. We show theoretical progress beyond minimal models in understanding experiments, including the possibility of different types of robust zero modes that may emerge without a band-topological transition. We examine the role of spatial non-locality, a special property of MBS wavefunctions that, together with non-Abelian braiding, is the key to realizing topological quantum computation.},

By applying feedback operations conditioned on the outcomes of individual parity measurements, we demonstrate the real-time stabilization of a Bell state with a fidelity of \$F{\textbackslash}approx 74{\textbackslash}\%\$ in up to 12 cycles of the feedback loop. We also perform the protocol using Pauli frame updating and, in contrast to the case of real-time stabilization, observe a steady decrease in fidelity from cycle to cycle.

However, with increasing demand for smaller and faster spintronic components utilization of spin–orbit phenomena provides promising alternatives. New materials with unique spin textures are highly desirable since all-electric creation and control of spin polarization is expected where the strength, as well as an arbitrary orientation of the polarization, can be defined without the use of a magnetic field. In this work, we use a novel spin–orbit crystal BiTeBr for this purpose. Because of its giant Rashba spin splitting, bulk spin polarization is created at room temperature by an electric current. Integrating BiTeBr crystal into graphene-based spin valve devices, we demonstrate for the first time that it acts as a current-controlled spin injector, opening new avenues for future spintronic applications in integrated circuits.},

	abstract = {We experimentally investigate superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators in external magnetic fields and present two strategies to reduce field-induced dissipation channels and resonance frequency shifts. One of our approaches is to significantly reduce the superconducting ground-plane areas, which leads to reduced magnetic field-focussing and thus to lower effective magnetic fields inside the waveguide cavity. By this measure, the field-induced losses can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude in mT out-of-plane magnetic fields. When these resonators are additionally coupled inductively instead of capacitively to the microwave feedlines, an intrinsic closed superconducting loop is effectively shielding the heart of the resonator from magnetic fields by means of flux conservation. In total, we achieve a reduction of the field-induced resonance frequency shift by up to two orders of magnitude. We combine systematic parameter variations on the experimental side with numerical magnetic field calculations to explain the effects of our approaches and to support our conclusions. The presented results are relevant for all areas, where high-performance superconducting resonators need to be operated in magnetic fields, e.g. for quantum hybrid devices with superconducting circuits or electron spin resonance detectors based on coplanar waveguide cavities.},

For modes with the vortex located at a current node, the presence of the vortex results in no detectable excess loss and, in fact, produces an increase in the quality factor.

We find these results to be valid for a broad range of frequencies and angles between the resonator plane and the magnetic field direction as well as for resonators with and without antidots near the edges of the center conductor and the ground planes. In a detailed analysis we show, that characteristic features of the experimental data can only be reproduced in calculations, if a highly inhomogeneous rf-current density and a flux density gradient with maxima at the edges of the superconductor is assumed. We furthermore demonstrate, that the hysteretic behaviour of the resonator properties can be used to considerably reduce the vortex induced losses and to fine-tune the resonance frequency by the proper way of cycling to a desired magnetic field.},

The family of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides is an especially promising platform for fundamental studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, with potential applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics due to their direct band gap in the monolayer limit and highly efficient light-matter coupling. A crystal lattice with broken inversion symmetry combined with strong spin-orbit interactions leads to a unique combination of the spin and valley degrees of freedom. In addition, the 2D character of the monolayers and weak dielectric screening from the environment yield a significant enhancement of the Coulomb interaction. The resulting formation of bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons, dominates the optical and spin properties of the material. Here recent progress in understanding of the excitonic properties in monolayer TMDs is reviewed and future challenges are laid out. Discussed are the consequences of the strong direct and exchange Coulomb interaction, exciton light-matter coupling, and influence of finite carrier and electron-hole pair densities on the exciton properties in TMDs. Finally, the impact on valley polarization is described and the tuning of the energies and polarization observed in applied electric and magnetic fields is summarized.},

We report the reversible electrical switching of ferromagnetic (FM) states in platinum (Pt) thin films by introducing paramagnetic ionic liquid (PIL) as the gating media. The paramagnetic ionic gating controls the movement of ions with magnetic moments, which induces itinerant ferromagnetism on the surface of Pt films, with large coercivity and perpendicular anisotropy mimicking the ideal two-dimensional Ising-type FM state. The electrical transport of the induced FM state shows Kondo effect at low temperature, suggesting spatially separated coexistence of Kondo scattering beneath the FM interface. The tunable FM state indicates that paramagnetic ionic gating could serve as a versatile method to induce rich transport phenomena combining field effect and magnetism at PIL-gated interfaces.

	abstract = {In noncentrosymmetric crystals with broken inversion symmetry \$\$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{ \{{\textbackslash}mathcal I\} \}\}\$\$ℐ, the I-V (I: current, V: voltage) characteristic is generally expected to depend on the direction of I, which is known as nonreciprocal response and, for example, found in p-n junction. However, it is a highly nontrivial issue in translationally invariant systems since the time-reversal symmetry T plays an essential role, where the two states at crystal momenta k and -k are connected in the band structure. Therefore, it has been considered that the external magnetic field (B) or the magnetic order which breaks the T-symmetry is necessary to realize the nonreciprocal I-V characteristics, i.e., magnetochiral anisotropy. Here we theoretically show that the electron correlation in T-broken multi-band systems can induce nonreciprocal I-V characteristics without T-breaking. An analog of Onsager’s relation shows that nonreciprocal current response without T -breaking generally requires two effects: dissipation and interactions. By using nonequilibrium Green’s functions, we derive general formula of the nonreciprocal response for two-band systems with onsite interaction. The formula is applied to Rice-Mele model, a representative 1D model with inversion breaking, and some candidate materials are discussed. This finding offers a coherent understanding of the origin of nonreciprocal I-V characteristics, and will pave a way to design it.},

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal transport phenomena indicate that the forward and backward flows differ and are attributed to broken inversion symmetry. In this paper, we study the nonreciprocity of the thermal and thermoelectric transport of electronic systems resulting from inversion-symmetry-broken crystal structures. The nonlinear electric, thermoelectric, and thermal conductivities are derived up to the second order in an electric field and a temperature gradient by using the Boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation. All the second-order conductivities appearing in this paper are described by two functions and their derivatives, and they are related to each other in the same way that linear conductivities are, e.g., via the Wiedemann-Franz law. We found that nonvanishing thermal-transport coefficients in the zero-temperature limit appear in nonlinear conductivities, which dominate the thermal transport at a sufficiently low temperature. The nonlinear conductivities and possible observable quantities are estimated in a 1H monolayer of the transition-metal dichalcogenide MoS2 and a polar semiconductor BiTeX (X=I,Br).},

	abstract = {Spin orbit interaction is strongly enhanced in structures where a heavy element is embedded in an inversion asymmetric crystal field. A simple way for realizing such a setup is to take a single atomic layer of a heavy element and encapsulate it between two atomic layers of different elemental composition. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal. In its bulk form BiTeI consists of loosely coupled three atom thick layers where a layer of high atomic number Bi are sandwiched between Te and I sheets. Despite considerable recent attention to bulk BiTeI due to its giant Rashba spin splitting, the isolation of a single layer remained elusive. In this work we report the first successful isolation and characterization of a single layer of BiTeI using a novel exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our scanning probe studies and first principles calculations show that the fabricated 100 μm sized BiTeI flakes are stable at ambient conditions. Giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new 2D crystal opens the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.},

	abstract = {The successful assembly of heterostructures consisting of several layers of different 2D materials in arbitrary order by exploiting van der Waals forces has truly been a game changer in the field of low-dimensional physics. For instance, the encapsulation of graphene or MoS2 between atomically flat hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers with strong affinity and graphitic gates that screen charge impurity disorder provided access to a plethora of interesting physical phenomena by drastically boosting the device quality. The encapsulation is accompanied by a self-cleansing effect at the interfaces. The otherwise predominant charged impurity disorder is minimized, and random strain fluctuations ultimately constitute the main source of residual disorder. Despite these advances, the fabricated heterostructures still vary notably in their performance. Although some achieve record mobilities, others only possess mediocre quality. Here, we report a reliable method to improve fully completed van der Waals heterostructure devices with a straightforward postprocessing surface treatment based on thermal annealing and contact mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The impact is demonstrated by comparing magnetotransport measurements before and after the AFM treatment on one and the same device as well as on a larger set of treated and untreated devices to collect device statistics. Both the low-temperature properties and the room temperature electrical characteristics, as relevant for applications, improve on average substantially. We surmise that the main beneficial effect arises from reducing nanometer scale corrugations at the interfaces, that is, the detrimental impact of random strain fluctuations.},

We have started to improve the noise filtering in our cryogenic dilution refrigerators, which can reach a base temperature of {\textasciitilde} 50 mK. The miniature low-pass filters were made from special RF sealing compound Eccosorb CR124, stainless steel powder of grain size 50 μm and a typical low-temperature epoxy (Stycast).

Both effects are manifest as a rotation in the polarization of transmitted light: the former is due to the intrinsic properties of media that lack mirror symmetry, whereas the latter (which occurs in all materials) is due to magnetic-field-induced changes in the optical properties. The apparent similarity of these two effects motivated Pasteur to search in vain for a link between the two phenomena1. Such a link—which can be regarded as arising either from a magnetically induced change of natural optical activity or from the difference in magnetic optical activity of the two enantiomers of a chiral medium—has been predicted to exist2,3,4,5,6,7, although it is expected to be very weak. Here we report the experimental observation of this ‘magneto-chiral’ optical effect and a demonstration of its enantioselectivity. The existence of this effect may be important in the context of fundamental interactions between light and matter, and in molecular spectroscopy.},

Three of these are well established: isotropic refraction and absorption, linear birefringence and dichroism, and circular birefringence and dichroism. The fourth effect, predicted by Jones, has remained unobserved so far. In this Letter, we report the first experimental observation of this missing fourth, so-called Jones effect, as an additional, tilted linear birefringence. In our experiments, this effect was induced in liquids by parallel external magnetic and electric fields perpendicular to the propagation direction.},

The nonreciprocity is clearly explained by the effect of the asymmetric magnon band originating from the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

This unique phenomenon, termed magnetochiral nonreciprocity, has previously been demonstrated for the propagating light and conduction electrons but seldom for other quasiparticles. In this study, we report the experimental observation of magnetochiral nonreciprocity of propagating magnons for a chiral-lattice ferromagnet Cu2OSeO3 by employing the spin wave spectroscopy. We found that the sign of nonreciprocity is reversed for the opposite chirality of crystal, and also directly identified the wave-number-linear term in the spin wave dispersion associated with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction as the origin of observed nonreciprocity. Our present results pave a route for the design of efficient spin wave diode based on the bulk crystallographic symmetry breaking and also offer a unique method to evaluate the magnitude of DM interaction in chiral-lattice bulk compounds.},

One of their inherent properties is the nonreciprocal transport, where the rightward and leftward currents become inequivalent, reflecting spatial inversion/time-reversal symmetry breaking. Such a rectification effect originating from the polar symmetry has been recently observed at interfaces or bulk Rashba semiconductors, while its mechanism in a polar superconductor remains elusive. Here, we report the nonreciprocal transport in gate-induced two-dimensional superconductor SrTiO
              3
              , which is a Rashba superconductor candidate. In addition to the gigantic enhancement of nonreciprocal signals in the superconducting fluctuation region, we found kink and sharp peak structures around critical temperatures, which reflect the crossover behavior from the paraconductivity origin to the vortex origin, based on a microscopic theory. The present result proves that the nonreciprocal transport is a powerful tool for investigating the interfacial/polar superconductors without inversion symmetry, where rich exotic features are theoretically prognosticated.},

To date, studies on these materials required mechanical exfoliation from bulk crystals which yielded thick sheets in nonscalable sizes. Here, we report epitaxial synthesis of Janus BiTeCl and BiTeBr sheets through a nanoconversion technique that can produce few triple layers of Rashba semiconductors ({\textless}10 nm) on sapphire substrates. The process starts with van der Waals epitaxy of Bi2Te3 sheets on sapphire and converts these sheets to BiTeCl or BiTeBr layers at high temperatures in the presence of chemically reactive BiCl3/BiBr3 inorganic vapor. Systematic Raman, XRD, SEM, EDX, and other studies show that highly crystalline BiTeCl and BiTeBr sheets can be produced on demand. Atomic level growth mechanism is also proposed and discussed to oﬀer further insights into growth process steps. Overall, this work marks the direct deposition of 2D Janus Rashba materials and oﬀers pathways to synthesize other Janus compounds belonging to MXY family members.},

Understanding microscopic dynamics under variable environmental conditions provides critical knowledge of the microscopic interactions in RTILs, which are closely linked to their functionality. Here, we investigate a response of a RTIL, EmimTFSI, to application of a high pressure, up to 1.0 GPa, using quasi-elastic neutron scattering, Raman and X-ray scattering. The ionic liquid transitions from a liquid to a solid state at above {\textasciitilde}0.5 GPa and returns to its liquid state following full decompression. However, following such pressure application, the resulting liquid no longer possesses either cations, or anions, as individual entities, as evident from quasi-elastic scattering and Raman scattering results, respectively. We suggest that a possible cause for this behavior could be dimerization of ions, which needs to be considered when designing RTILs for moderate high-pressure applications.},

Both materials are doped semiconductors, with the absorption edge above the optical gap which is lower in BiTeBr (0.62 eV) than in BiTeCl (0.77 eV). The same Rashba splitting is observed in the two materials. A non-Drude free carrier contribution in the optical conductivity, as well as three Raman and two infrared phonon modes, are observed in each compound. There is a dramatic difference in the highest infrared phonon intensity for the two compounds, and a difference in the doping levels. Aspects of the strong electron-phonon interaction are identified. Several interband transitions are assigned, among them the low-lying absorption β which has the same value 0.25 eV in both compounds, and is caused by the Rashba spin splitting of the conduction band. An additional weak transition is found in BiTeCl, caused by the lower crystal symmetry.},

We develop a perturbation theory for analytical treatment of hybridization. We address an interesting separate case of fully transparent junctions. We derive and exemplify a perturbation theory suitable for the competition regime demonstrating the interference of 1D and two 3D transmission amplitudes.},

	abstract = {Superconducting resonators interfaced with paramagnetic spin ensembles are used to increase the sensitivity of electron spin resonance experiments and are key elements of microwave quantum memories. Certain spin systems that are promising for such quantum memories possess “sweet spots” at particular combinations of magnetic fields and frequencies, where spin coherence times or linewidths become particularly favorable. In order to be able to couple high-Q superconducting resonators to such specific spin transitions, it is necessary to be able to tune the resonator frequency under a constant magnetic field amplitude. Here, we demonstrate a high-quality, magnetic field resilient superconducting resonator, using a 3D vector magnet to continuously tune its resonance frequency by adjusting the orientation of the magnetic field. The resonator maintains a quality factor of {\textgreater}105 up to magnetic fields of 2.6 T, applied predominantly in the plane of the superconductor. We achieve a continuous tuning of up to 30 MHz by rotating the magnetic field vector, introducing a component of 5 mT perpendicular to the superconductor.},

To validate the simulation, we fabricate quarter wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators on GaAs and measure Qi as function of frequency, power and temperature. We observe a linear increase of Qi with frequency, as predicted by the simulations for a constant electromechanical coupling. Additionally, Qi shows a weak power dependence and a negligible temperature dependence around 10 mK, excluding two level systems and non-equilibrium quasiparticles as the main source of losses at that temperature.},

	title = {Anisotropic {Three}-{Component} {Superconductors}},
	abstract = {Since ﬁrst discovery in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, superconductivity has always been an extremely active research ﬁeld. A conventional superconductor (SC) is described by a single complex order parameter, and its behavior can be easily classiﬁed by studying the ratio of two characteristic length scales: the magnetic penetration depth λ and the coherence length ξ. However, a single component model is not suﬃcient to describe all kinds of superconductors: iron pnictides, require a multiband models with two or more order parameters. Moreover, many superconducting materials present spatial anisotropies, which should be included in the theoretical framework to fully describe their behavior.As an example, the three band anisotropic superconductor Sr2RuO4 is a material of central interest today. The intention of this work is to describe how anisotropies change the behavior of a three-band SCs using a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau model with Josephson potential. This potential leads to a variety of situations exhibiting phase frustration, which we study for speciﬁc sets of Ginzburg-Landau coeﬃcients. Then we introduce anisotropies in the system and study how topological excitations change compared to the isotropic case. Our goal is to show that the additional couplings introduced by the anisotropy tensor structurally change the vortex structure, yielding non-Abrikosov vortices. Using a non-linear conjugate gradient method, we start with speciﬁc sets of parameters and initial guesses and study the convergence to equilibrium states.},

In some aspects, these two platforms are dual to one another: superconducting qubits are more easily coupled but are relatively large among quantum devices \$({\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mm\})\$, while electrostatically-confined electron spins are spatially compact (\${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$) but more complex to link. Here we combine beneficial aspects of both platforms in the Andreev spin qubit: the spin degree of freedom of an electronic quasiparticle trapped in the supercurrent-carrying Andreev levels of a Josephson semiconductor nanowire. We demonstrate coherent spin manipulation by combining single-shot circuit-QED readout and spin-flipping Raman transitions, finding a spin-flip time \$T\_S = 17{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu s\}\$ and a spin coherence time \$T\_\{2E\}=52{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ns\}\$. These results herald a new spin qubit with supercurrent-based circuit-QED integration and further our understanding and control of Andreev levels -- the parent states of Majorana zero modes -- in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures.},

BiTeBr is a non-centrosymmetric material, with a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling which presents this unusual effect when placed in an in-plane magnetic field. It has been shown that this effect depends strongly on the carrier density, however, in-situ tuning has not yet been demonstrated. We developed a method where thin BiTeBr flakes are gate tuned via ionic-liquid gating through a thin protective hBN layer. Tuning the carrier density allows a more than {\textbackslash}SI\{400\}\{{\textbackslash}percent\} variation of the non-reciprocal response. Our study serves as a milestone on how a few-atomic-layer-thin van der Waals protection layer allows ionic gating of chemically sensitive, exotic nanocrystals.},

The ﬁlters are compact, simple to construct, and operate in cryogenic environments. The dissipative dielectric consists of magnetically-loaded silicone or epoxy, which is commercially available under the trade name Eccosorb. For a stripline length of 32 mm, the ﬁlters have a passband that extends from dc to a 3 dB bandwidth between 0.3 and 0.8 GHz. The 3 dB bandwidth can be adjusted beyond this range by changing the ﬁlter length. An extremely broad stopband at higher frequencies, with attenuation exceeding 100 dB, is achieved along with a return loss greater than 10 dB measured up to 40 GHz. This combination of high attenuation and low reﬂected power across a broad stopband ensures that spurious or unwanted signals outside the passband do not reach or return to the device under test. This type of ﬁlter has applications in microwave frequency measurements of sensitive nonlinear devices such as superconducting heterodyne mixers, quantum tunneling devices and quantum computing elements.},

We have fabricated single-layer resonators with a high quality factor by patterning a superconducting aluminum ﬁlm on a sapphire substrate. Four resonator geometries were studied with resonant frequencies ranging from 5 to 7 GHz: a quasi-lumped element resonator, a coplanar strip waveguide resonator, and two hybrid designs that contain both a coplanar strip and a quasi-lumped element. Transmitted power measurements were taken at 30 mK as a function of frequency and probe power. We ﬁnd that the resonator loss, expressed as the inverse of the internal quality factor, decreases slowly over four decades of photon number in a manner not merely explained by loss from a conventional uniform spatial distribution of two-level systems in an oxide layer on the superconducting surfaces of the resonator.},

For low-loss materials, this method is stable over the whole frequency range: no divergence is observed at frequencies corresponding to integer multiples of one half wavelength in the sample. The accuracy on the dielectric permittivity is similar to that obtained with a more recently proposed iterative technique. A general equation for complex permittivity determination including the Stuchly, NRW, and new noniterative methods, is also proposed.},

Especially the integration of planar devices for very broadband applications at high frequencies often demands speciﬁc dielectric properties such as a low permittivity, dispersion and loss, assuring a predictable performance over a broad frequency range.

	abstract = {Electromagnetic filtering is essential for the coherent control, operation and readout of superconducting quantum circuits at milliKelvin temperatures. The suppression of spurious modes around transition frequencies of a few GHz is well understood and mainly achieved by on-chip and package considerations. Noise photons of higher frequencies – beyond the pair-breaking energies – cause decoherence and require spectral engineering before reaching the packaged quantum chip. The external wires that pass into the refrigerator and go down to the quantum circuit provide a direct path for these photons. This article contains quantitative analysis and experimental data for the noise photon flux through coaxial, filtered wiring. The attenuation of the coaxial cable at room temperature and the noise photon flux estimates for typical wiring configurations are provided. Compact cryogenic microwave low-pass filters with CR-110 and Esorb-230 absorptive dielectric fillings are presented along with experimental data at room and cryogenic temperatures up to 70 GHz. Filter cut-off frequencies between 1 to 10 GHz are set by the filter length, and the roll-off is material dependent. The relative dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability for the Esorb-230 material in the pair-breaking frequency range of 75 to 110 GHz are measured, and the filter properties in this frequency range are calculated. The estimated dramatic suppression of the noise photon flux due to the filter proves its usefulness for experiments with superconducting quantum systems.},

BiTeBr is a noncentrosymmetric material, with a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling which presents this unusual effect when placed in an in-plane magnetic field. It has been shown that this effect depends strongly on the carrier density; however, in situ tuning has not yet been demonstrated. We developed a method where thin BiTeBr flakes are gate tuned via ionic-liquid gating through a thin protective hexagonal boron nitride layer. Tuning the carrier density allows a more than 400\% variation of the nonreciprocal response in our sample. Our study demonstrates how a few-atomic-layer-thick van der Waals protection layer allows ionic gating of chemically sensitive, exotic nanocrystals.},

	abstract = {Andreev scattering and the Josephson current through a one-dimensional interacting electron liquid sandwiched between two superconductors are re-examined. We first present some apparently new results on the non-interacting case by studying an exactly solvable tight-binding model rather than the usual continuum model. We show that perfect Andreev scattering (i.e. zero normal scattering) at the Fermi energy can only be achieved by fine-tuning junction parameters. We also obtain exact results for the Josephson current, which is generally a smooth function of the superconducting phase difference except when the junction parameters are adjusted to give perfect Andreev scattering, in which case it becomes a sawtooth function. We then observe that, even when interactions are included, all low energy properties of a junction (E{\textless}{\textless}{\textbackslash}Delta, the superconducting gap) can be obtained by "integrating out" the superconducting electrons to obtain an effective Hamiltonian describing the metallic electrons only with a boundary pairing interaction. This boundary model provides a suitable starting point for bosonization/renormalization group/boundary conformal field theory analysis. We argue that total normal reflection and total Andreev reflection correspond to two fixed points of the boundary renormalization group. For repulsive bulk interactions the Andreev fixed point is unstable and the normal one stable. However, the reverse is true for attractive interactions. This implies that a generic junction Hamiltonian (without fine-tuned junction parameters) will renormalize to the normal fixed point for repulsive interactions but to the Andreev one for attractive interactions. An exact mapping of our tight-binding model to the Hubbard model with a transverse magnetic field is used to help understand this behavior.},

The supercurrent stability diagram adopts a honeycomb pattern with electron-hole and left-right reflection symmetry. We observe sharp discontinuities in the magnitude of the critical current, \$I\_c\$, as a function of dot occupation, related to doublet to singlet ground state transitions. Detuning of the energy levels offers a tuning knob for \$I\_c\$, which attains a maximum at zero detuning. The consistency between experiment and theory indicates that our device is a faithful realization of the two-impurity Anderson model.},

The tuning algorithm that we develop involves controlling the gate voltages and the superconducting phases. Resonant Andreev spectroscopy allows us to make the tuning adaptive, so that each pair of dots may be tuned independently of the other. The calculated quantized zero bias conductance serves then as a natural proof of the topological nature of the tuned phase.},

SDE refers to the nonreciprocity of the critical current for the metal-superconductor transition. Among various mechanisms for the critical current, the depairing current is known to be intrinsic to each material and has recently been observed in several superconducting systems. We clarify the temperature scaling of the nonreciprocal depairing current near the critical temperature and point out its significant enhancement at low temperatures. It is also found that the nonreciprocal critical current shows sign reversals upon increasing the magnetic field. These behaviors are understood by the nonreciprocity of the Landau critical momentum and the change in the nature of the helical superconductivity. The intrinsic SDE unveils the rich phase diagram and functionalities of noncentrosymmetric superconductors.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of non-reciprocal critical current in a Josephson device, termed Josephson diode eﬀect, has garnered much recent interest. It is typically attributed to spin-orbit interaction and time reversal symmetry breaking in these systems. Here we report observation of the Josephson diode eﬀect in a three-terminal Josephson device based upon InAs quantum well two-dimensional electron gas proximitized by epitaxial aluminum. We demonstrate that the diode eﬃciency can be tuned by a small out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld and electrostatic gating. We show that the diode eﬀect in this device is a consequence of artiﬁcial realization of a current-phase relation that is non-2$\pi$-periodic. These Josephson devices may serve as gate tunable building blocks in designing topologically protected qubits. Furthermore, we show that the diode eﬀect is an inherent property of multiterminal Josephson devices. This establishes an immediately scalable approach by which potential applications of the Josephson diode eﬀect can be realized, which is agnostic to the underlying material platform.},

A requirement for the success of such experiments is to understand the various tunneling-induced non-local interaction mechanisms, namely, crossed Andreev reflection, elastic cotunneling, and direct interdot tunneling, that are present in the device. Here, we provide a theoretical study of a simple device which consists of two quantum dots and a superconductor tunnel-coupled to the dots, often called a Cooper-pair splitter. We study the three special cases where one of the three non-local mechanisms dominates, and calculate measurable ground-state properties, as well as the zero-bias and finite-bias differential conductance characterizing electron transport through this device. We describe how each non-local mechanism controls the measurable quantities, and thereby find experimental fingerprints that allow one to identify and quantify the dominant non-local mechanism using experimental data. Finally, we study the triplet blockade effect and the associated negative differential conductance in the Cooper-pair splitter, and show that they can arise regardless of the nature of the dominant non-local coupling mechanism. Our results should facilitate the characterization of hybrid devices, and their optimization for various quantum-information-related experiments and applications.},

Microwave experiments using superconducting circuits with InAs/Al nanowire Josephson junctions have recently enabled probing and coherent manipulation of Andreev states but have remained limited to zero or small fields. Here we use a flux-tunable superconducting circuit in external magnetic fields up to 1T to perform spectroscopy of spin-polarized Andreev states up to {\textasciitilde}250 mT, beyond which the spectrum becomes gapless. We identify singlet and triplet states of two quasiparticles occupying different Andreev states through their dispersion in magnetic field. These states are split by exchange interaction and couple via spin-orbit coupling, analogously to two-electron states in quantum dots. We also show that the magnetic field allows to drive a direct spin-flip transition of a single quasiparticle trapped in the junction. Finally, we measure a gate- and field-dependent anomalous phase shift of the Andreev spectrum, of magnitude up to approximately \$0.7{\textbackslash}pi\$.

	abstract = {Spin qubits in semiconductors are currently one of the most promising architectures for quantum computing. However, they face challenges in realizing multi-qubit interactions over extended distances. Superconducting spin qubits provide a promising alternative by encoding a qubit in the spin degree of freedom of an Andreev level. Such an Andreev spin qubit could leverage the advantages of circuit quantum electrodynamic, enabled by an intrinsic spin-supercurrent coupling. The first realization of an Andreev spin qubit encoded the qubit in the excited states of a semiconducting weak-link, leading to frequent decay out of the computational subspace. Additionally, rapid qubit manipulation was hindered by the need for indirect Raman transitions. Here, we exploit a different qubit subspace, using the spin-split doublet ground state of an electrostatically-defined quantum dot Josephson junction with large charging energy. Additionally, we use a magnetic field to enable direct spin manipulation over a frequency range of 10 GHz. Using an all-electric microwave drive we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 200 MHz. We furthermore embed the Andreev spin qubit in a superconducting transmon qubit, demonstrating strong coherent qubit-qubit coupling. These results are a crucial step towards a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial aspects of both superconducting and semiconductor qubits.},

In the absence of an applied voltage, the Andreev bound states on each quantum dot hybridize forming an `Andreev molecule'. However, understanding of this system in a non-equilibrium setup is lacking. Applying a dc voltage on the bijunction makes the system time-periodic, and the equilibrium Andreev bound states evolve into a ladder of resonances with a finite lifetime due to multiple Andreev reflections (MAR). Starting from the time-periodic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations we map the problem to a tight-binding chain in the (infinite) Floquet space. The resolvent of this non-Hermitian block matrix is obtained via a continued fraction method. We numerically calculate the Floquet-Andreev spectra which could be probed by local tunneling spectroscopy on the dots. We also consider the subgap current, and show that the Floquet resonances determine the position of the MAR steps. Proximity of the two dots causes splitting of the steps, while at large distances we observe interference effects which cause oscillations in the I-V curves. The latter effect should persist at very long distances.},

A chain of atoms could lead to more exotic states if the tunneling takes place via the superconducting vacuum and can induce topologically protected excitations like Majorana or parafermions. Toward the realization of such artificial chains, coupling a single atom to the superconducting vacuum is well studied, but the hybridization of two sites via the superconductor was not yet reported. The peculiar vacuum of the BCS condensate opens the way to annihilate or generate two electrons from the bulk resulting in a so-called Andreev molecular state. By employing parallel nanowires with an Al superconductor shell, two artificial atoms were created at a minimal distance with an epitaxial superconducting link between. Hybridization via the BCS vacuum was observed between the two artificial atoms for the first time, as a demonstration of an Andreev molecular state.},

We call them "poor man's Majorana bound states" since they are not topologically protected, but otherwise share the properties of MBS formed in topological superconductors. We describe the conditions for the existence of the two spatially separated MBS, which include breaking of spin degeneracy in the two dots, with the spins polarized in different directions. Therefore, we propose to use a magnetic field configuration where the field directions on the two dot form an angle. By control of this angle the cross Andreev reflection and the tunnel amplitudes can be tuned to be approximately equal, which is a requirement for the formation of the MBS. We show that the fermionic state encoded in the two Majoranas constitutes a parity qubit, which is non-local and can only be measured by probing both dots simultaneously. Using a many-particle basis for the MBS, we discuss the role of interactions and show that inter-dot interactions always lift the degeneracy. We also show how the MBS can be probed by transport measurements and discuss how the combination of several such double dot systems allows for entanglement of parity qubits and measurement of their dephasing times.},

We quantify the quality of these MBSs and show how it depends on the Zeeman energy and interaction strength.

Most proposals for topologically protected quantum gates are based on many-body systems, e.g., fractional quantum Hall states, exotic superconductors, or ensembles of interacting spins, bearing an inherent conceptual complexity. Here, we propose and study a topologically protected quantum gate, based on a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, known as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain. The proposed \$Y\$ gate acts in the two-dimensional zero-energy subspace of a Y junction assembled from three chains, and is based on the spatial exchange of the defects supporting the zero-energy modes. With numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the gate is robust against hopping disorder but is corrupted by disorder in the on-site energy. Then we show that this robustness is topological protection, and that it arises as a joint consequence of chiral symmetry, time-reversal symmetry and the spatial separation of the zero-energy modes bound to the defects. This setup will most likely not lead to a practical quantum computer, nevertheless it does provide valuable insight to aspects of topological quantum computing as an elementary minimal model. Since this model is non-interacting and non-superconducting, its dynamics can be studied experimentally, e.g., using coupled optical waveguides.},

	abstract = {Majorana bound states constitute one of the simplest examples of emergent non-Abelian excitations in condensed matter physics. A toy model proposed by Kitaev shows that such states can arise on the ends of a spinless p-wave superconducting chain [1]. Practical proposals for its realization [2, 3] require coupling neighboring quantum dots in a chain via both electron tunneling and crossed Andreev reﬂection [4]. While both processes have been observed in semiconducting nanowires and carbon nanotubes [5–8], crossed-Andreev interaction was neither easily tunable nor strong enough to induce coherent hybridization of dot states. Here we demonstrate the simultaneous presence of all necessary ingredients for an artiﬁcial Kitaev chain: two spin-polarized quantum dots in an InSb nanowire strongly coupled by both elastic co-tunneling and crossed Andreev reﬂection. We ﬁne-tune this system to a sweet spot where a pair of Majorana bound states is predicted to appear. At this sweet spot, the transport characteristics satisfy the theoretical predictions for such a system, including pairwise correlation, zero charge and stability against local perturbations of the Majorana state. While the simple system presented here can be scaled to simulate a full Kitaev chain with an emergent topological order, it can also be used imminently to explore relevant physics related to non-Abelian anyons.},

Our approach for topological superconductivity employs a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed by an InAs quantum well, cleanly interfaced with an epitaxial superconductor (epi-Al). This epi-Al/InAs quantum well heterostructure is advantageous for fabricating large-scale nanostructures consisting of multiple Majorana zero modes. Here, we demonstrate transport studies of building-blocks using a high-quality epi-Al/InAs 2DEG heterostructure, which could be put together to realize various proposed 1D nanowire-based nanostructures and 2DEG-based networks that could host multiple Majorana zero modes. The studies include (1) gate-defined quasi-1D channels in the InAs 2DEG and (2) quantum point contacts for tunneling spectroscopy, as well as induced superconductivity in (3) a ballistic Al-InAs 2DEG-Al Josephson junction. From 1D transport, systematic evolution of conductance plateaus in half-integer conductance quanta is observed with Landé g-factor of 17, indicating the strong spin–orbit coupling and high quality of the InAs 2DEG. The improved 2DEG quality leads to ballistic Josephson junctions with enhanced characteristic parameters such as IcRn and IexcRn, the product of superconducting critical current Ic (and excess current Iexc) and normal resistance Rn. Our results of electronic transport studies based on the 2D approach suggest that the epitaxial superconductor/2D semiconductor system with improved 2DEG quality is suitable for realizing large-scale nanostructures for quantum computing applications.},

The corresponding inductive admittance is analyzed and compared to results of a zero-bandwidth, as well as an infinite-gap approximation to the superconducting Anderson model.

	abstract = {In this work, we study the spin texture of a class of higher-order topological superconductors (HOTSC) and show how it can be used to detect and braid Majorana corner modes (MCMs). This class of HOTSC is composed of two-dimensional topological insulators with s-wave superconductivity and in-plane magnetic fields, which offers advantages in experimental implementation. The spin polarization of the MCMs in this class is perpendicular with the applied magnetic field direction and is opposite on intrinsic orbitals, resulting in an overall ferrimagnetic spin texture. As a result, we find that the spin-selective Andreev reflection can be observed in a transverse instead of parallel direction to the applied magnetic field. Meanwhile, this spin texture leads to the gate-tunable \$4{\textbackslash}pi\$ periodic \${\textbackslash}phi\_0\$ Josephson current that performs qualitatively different behavior from the topologically trivial \${\textbackslash}phi\_0\$-junction under rotating the in-plane magnetic field. Meanwhile, the existence of the MCMs in this class does not depend on the in-plane magnetic field direction. This gives rise to great advantage in constructing all electronically controlled Majorana network for braiding, which is confirmed through our numerical simulation. We thus provide a comprehensive scheme for probing non-Abelian statistics in this class of HOTSCs.},

It requires simultaneously broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries, for example, by an interplay of spin–orbit coupling and magnetic field. Hitherto, observation of nonreciprocity was tied to resistivity, and dissipationless non-reciprocal circuit elements were elusive. Here we engineer fully superconducting non-reciprocal devices based on highly transparent Josephson junctions fabricated on InAs quantum wells. We demonstrate supercurrent rectification far below the transition temperature. By measuring Josephson inductance, we can link the non-reciprocal supercurrent to an asymmetry of the current–phase relation, and directly derive the supercurrent magnetochiral anisotropy coefficient. A semiquantitative model explains well the main features of our experimental data. Non-reciprocal Josephson junctions have the potential to become for superconducting circuits what pn junctions are for traditional electronics, enabling new non-dissipative circuit elements.},

	abstract = {Certain one-dimensional Fermi systems have an energy gap in the bulk spectrum while boundary states are described by one Majorana operator per boundary point. A finite system of length L possesses two ground states with an energy difference proportional to exp(-L/l0) and different fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap induced by proximity of a three-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each spin component counts separately).},

	abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the ν=5∕2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the ν=5∕2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of a quantum computer remains an ongoing challenge in modern physics. Whereas decoherence stymies most approaches, topological quantum computation schemes evade decoherence at the hardware level by storing quantum information non-locally. Here we establish that a key operation—braiding of non-Abelian anyons—can be implemented using one-dimensional semiconducting wires. Such wires can be driven into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can encode topological qubits. We show that in wire networks, Majorana fermions can be meaningfully braided by simply adjusting gate voltages, and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+i p superconductor. We propose experimental set-ups that enable probing of the Majorana fusion rules and the efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions. This work should open a new direction in topological quantum computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental feasibility.},

Similarly, a phase battery is a quantum device that provides a persistent phase bias to the wave function of a quantum circuit. It represents a key element for quantum technologies based on phase coherence. Here we demonstrate a phase battery in a hybrid superconducting circuit. It consists of an n-doped InAs nanowire with unpaired-spin surface states, that is proximitized by Al superconducting leads. We find that the ferromagnetic polarization of the unpaired-spin states is efficiently converted into a persistent phase bias φ0 across the wire, leading to the anomalous Josephson effect1,2. We apply an external in-plane magnetic field and, thereby, achieve continuous tuning of φ0. Hence, we can charge and discharge the quantum phase battery. The observed symmetries of the anomalous Josephson effect in the vectorial magnetic field are in agreement with our theoretical model. Our results demonstrate how the combined action of spin–orbit coupling and exchange interaction induces a strong coupling between charge, spin and superconducting phase, able to break the phase rigidity of the system.},

The central ingredient for Josephson diodes is the asymmetric proximity process inside the tunneling barrier. From the symmetry breaking point of view, there are two types of Josephson diodes: inversion breaking and time-reversal breaking. For the inversion breaking case, applying voltage bias could effectively tune the proximity process like the voltage-dependent Rashba coupling or electric polarization giving rise to Ic(V)≠Ic(-V) and Ir+≠Ir-. For the time-reversal breaking case, the current flow could adjust the internal time-reversal breaking field like magnetism or time-reversal breaking electron-electron pairing, which leads to Ic+≠Ic-. All these results provide a complete understanding and the general principles of realizing Josephson diodes, especially the recently found NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2 Josephson diodes.},

	abstract = {In a standard Josephson junction the current is zero when the phase difference between superconducting leads is zero. This condition is protected by parity and time-reversal symmetries. However, the combined presence of spin–orbit coupling and magnetic field breaks these symmetries and can lead to a finite supercurrent even when the phase difference is zero. This is the so called anomalous Josephson effect—the hallmark effect of superconducting spintronics—which can be characterized by the corresponding anomalous phase shift. Here we report the observation of a tunable anomalous Josephson effect in InAs/Al Josephson junctions measured via a superconducting quantum interference device. By gate controlling the density of InAs, we are able to tune the spin–orbit coupling in the Josephson junction. This gives us the ability to tune the anomalous phase, and opens new opportunities for superconducting spintronics, and new possibilities for realizing and characterizing topological superconductivity.},

              This review is devoted to one of the most relevant areas of modern condensed matter physics, the anomalous Josephson effect (AJE), which consists of the appearance of a phase shift in a hybrid structure, leading to a finite superconducting current at zero phase difference. AJE reflects the joint manifestation of superconductivity, spin-orbit interaction, and magnetism, and the study of such structures allows progress in understanding their mutual influence, while also opening up promising applications in superconducting spintronics. This review describes the physics of the
              φ
              0
              junction, the control of the magnetic properties of the barrier by means of a superconducting current, and, in turn, the effect of the magnetic moment of the barrier on the Josephson current. A discussion of new effective methods of magnetic moment reversal in the
              φ
              0
              junction, in particular, by a superconducting current pulse, as well as studies of the quantum properties of Josephson nanostructures with magnetic and topologically nontrivial barriers for the creation of new superconducting spintronic devices, is presented. The experimental realization of the
              φ
              0
              junction, which has recently been demonstrated in a number of studies by direct measurement of the current-phase relation, allows the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling to be measured and opens up new possibilities for the phase control of Josephson devices. This research helps in understanding fundamental spin-dependent phenomena and developing applications for computer technology. In particular, control of the magnetic state by superconductivity opens up new possibilities for the development of ultrafast cryogenic memory. This review presents the results of studying the magnetic dynamics along the current–voltage characteristic of the
              φ
              0
              junction and analysis of the spin dynamics in this junction. The question of the possibility of controlling the magnetic precession by the appearance of higher harmonics in the current–phase relation, as well as the DC component of the current, which significantly increase near ferromagnetic resonance, is considered. Interesting phenomena in the
              φ
              0
              junction occur under the influence of external electromagnetic radiation. Thus, the review presents an analysis of the main theoretical and experimental work devoted to AJE, gives examples of the manifestation of AJE in various systems, indicates the prospects for research in this area, and discusses unsolved problems.},

	abstract = {Superconducting diodes are a recently-discovered quantum analogueue of classical diodes. The superconducting diode effect relies on the breaking of both time-reversal and inversion symmetry. As a result, the critical current of a superconductor can become dependent on the direction of the applied current. The combination of these ingredients naturally occurs in proximitized semiconductors under a magnetic field, which is also predicted to give rise to exotic physics such as topological superconductivity. In this work, we use InSb nanowires proximitized by Al to investigate the superconducting diode effect. Through shadow-wall lithography, we create short Josephson junctions with gate control of both the semiconducting weak link as well as the proximitized leads. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the nanowire axis, the superconducting diode effect depends on the out-of-plane angle. In particular, it is strongest along a specific angle, which we interpret as the direction of the spin-orbit field in the proximitized leads. Moreover, the electrostatic gates can be used to drastically alter this effect and even completely suppress it. Finally, we also observe a significant gate-tunable diode effect when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the nanowire axis. Due to the considerable degree of control via electrostatic gating, the semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson diode emerges as a promising element for innovative superconducting circuits and computation devices.},

Lukas Hofstetter and colleagues now demonstrate that this is possible in a Y-shaped electron entangler consisting of a superconductor at its stem, coupled via tunnelling barriers to two separate quantum dots along the fork-like branches of the device. The entangled pairs of electrons are naturally formed in the superconductor, which in its ground state consists of Cooper pairs of electrons, and split by Coulomb interactions and careful tuning of the energy levels of the quantum dots. The study paves the way for the study of electronic entanglement and experimental tests of Bell inequalities in the solid state.},

            Chains of quantum dots coupled to superconductors are promising for the realization of the Kitaev model of a topological superconductor. While individual superconducting quantum dots have been explored, control of longer chains requires understanding of interdot coupling. Here, double quantum dots are defined by gate voltages in indium antimonide nanowires. High transparency superconducting niobium titanium nitride contacts are made to each of the dots in order to induce superconductivity, as well as probe electron transport. Andreev bound states induced on each of dots hybridize to define Andreev molecular states. The evolution of these states is studied as a function of charge parity on the dots, and in magnetic field. The experiments are found in agreement with a numerical model.},

Experimental verifications of such concepts have been conducted successfully using entangled pairs of photons to test so-called Bell inequalities, but similar demonstrations using electrons have remained elusive owing to the inherent difficulty of creating and splitting pairs of entangled electrons. Lukas Hofstetter and colleagues now demonstrate that this is possible in a Y-shaped electron entangler consisting of a superconductor at its stem, coupled via tunnelling barriers to two separate quantum dots along the fork-like branches of the device. The entangled pairs of electrons are naturally formed in the superconductor, which in its ground state consists of Cooper pairs of electrons, and split by Coulomb interactions and careful tuning of the energy levels of the quantum dots. The study paves the way for the study of electronic entanglement and experimental tests of Bell inequalities in the solid state.},

Cooper pairs in superconductors can be split adiabatically, thus forming entangled electrons. Here, we fabricate such an electron splitter by contacting an aluminium superconductor strip at the centre of a suspended InAs nanowire. The nanowire is terminated at both ends with two normal metallic drains. Dividing each half of the nanowire by a gate-induced Coulomb blockaded quantum dot strongly impeds the flow of Cooper pairs due to the large charging energy, while still permitting passage of single electrons. We provide conclusive evidence of extremely high efficiency Cooper pair splitting via observing positive two-particle correlations of the conductance and the shot noise of the split electrons in the two opposite drains of the nanowire. Moreover, the actual charge of the injected quasiparticles is verified by shot noise measurements.},

Competing transport processes, however, limit the efficiency of this process. Here we demonstrate efficiencies up to 90\%, significantly larger than required to demonstrate interaction-dominated CPS, and on the right order to test Bell’s inequality with electrons. We compare the CPS currents through both quantum dots, for which large apparent discrepancies are possible. The latter we explain intuitively and in a semiclassical master equation model. Large efficiencies are required to detect electron entanglement and for prospective electronics-based quantum information technologies.},

Here we report tunnelling spectroscopy measurements of three-terminal Josephson junctions (3TJJs) realised in a gate-tunable InAs/Al heterostructure. The three terminals are connected to form two loops where phase differences are independently controlled. Our results provide a demonstration of phase control over a novel Andreev band structure. Signatures of hybridisation between ABSs, consistent with their overlap in the 3TJJ region, are observed in the form of avoided crossings in the spectrum and are well explained by a numerical model.

The short-range coherent coupling of two adjacent JJs forms the Andreev molecule states (AMSs), which will provide a new ingredient to engineer the SC transport in JJs and control the Andreev qubits. However, no experimental evidence of the AMSs in the coupled JJs has been reported. Here we provide the tunnel spectroscopic results of electrically controllable two planar JJs sharing one SC electrode. We discover that the coupled JJ results are highly modulated from the single JJ results, due to formation of the phase-dependent AMSs, meaning that the two JJs are coherently coupled. In addition, the superconducting gap closing due to the AMS formation is observed. Our results would help in understanding the microscopic mechanism of the coherent coupling and promoting the AMS physics to apply for research of the topological superconductivity and quantum information technology.},

	abstract = {The strong coupling of a superconductor to a spinful quantum dot results in Yu–Shiba–Rusinov discrete subgap excitations. In isolation and at zero temperature, the excitations are sharp resonances. In transport experiments, however, they show as broad differential conductance peaks. Here we obtain the lineshape of the peaks and their temperature dependence in superconductor–quantum dot–metal nanowire-based devices. Unexpectedly, we find that the peaks shift in energy with temperature, with the shift magnitude and sign depending on ground state parity and bias voltage. Additionally, we empirically find a power-law trend of the peak area versus temperature. These observations are not explained by current models.},

As opposed to their metallic counterparts, the electron density in semiconductor nanosystems is tunable by external electrostatic gates, providing a highly scalable and in situ variation of the device properties. In addition, semiconductors with large g-factor and spin–orbit coupling have been shown to give rise to exotic phenomena in superconductivity, such as φ0 Josephson junctions and the emergence of Majorana bound states. Here, we report microwave spectroscopy measurements that directly reveal the presence of Andreev bound states (ABS) in ballistic semiconductor channels. We show that the measured ABS spectra are the result of transport channels with gate-tunable, high transmission probabilities up to 0.9, which is required for gate-tunable Andreev qubits and beneficial for braiding schemes of Majorana states. For the first time, we detect excitations of a spin-split pair of ABS and observe symmetry-broken ABS, a direct consequence of the spin–orbit coupling in the semiconductor.},

Thus far, experimental studies of MZMs chiefly relied on single electron tunneling measurements, which lead to the decoherence of the quantum information stored in the MZM. As a next step towards topological quantum computation, charge parity conserving experiments based on the Josephson effect are required, which can also help exclude suggested non-topological origins of the zero bias conductance anomaly. Here we report the direct measurement of the Josephson radiation frequency in indium arsenide nanowires with epitaxial aluminium shells. We observe the 4$\pi$-periodic Josephson effect above a magnetic field of ≈200 mT, consistent with the estimated and measured topological phase transition of similar devices.},

Recently, Josephson junctions constructed using semiconducting nanowires have led to the realization of superconducting qubits with gate-tunable Josephson energies. We have used a microwave circuit QED architecture to detect Andreev bound states in such a gate-tunable junction based on an aluminum-proximitized InAs nanowire. We demonstrate coherent manipulation of these bound states, and track the bound-state fermion parity in real time. Individual parity-switching events due to non-equilibrium quasiparticles are observed with a characteristic timescale \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{parity\} = 160{\textbackslash}pm 10{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu s\}\$. The \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{parity\}\$ of a topological nanowire junction sets a lower bound on the bandwidth required for control of Majorana bound states.},

In the AB effect the phase of electron is affected by magnetic flux, while in the AC effect the phase of the electron in solid state can be modified due to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In the low-transmission regime the AB and AC effects can be related to only local or nonlocal Cooper pair transport, respectively. We demonstrate that by the addition of the quantum dots the Cooper pair splitting can be made perfectly efficient and that the AC phase is different for non-spin-flip and spin-flip transport processes.},

We show that this arises from both the Doppler shift of the Andreev bound state energies and the phase-independent asymmetric current from the continuum. Last, we propose a simple scheme for achieving finite-momentum pairing, which does not rely on spin-orbit coupling and thus greatly expands existing platforms for the observation of supercurrent diode effects.},

	abstract = {The superconducting analogue to the semiconducting diode, the Josephson diode, has long been sought with multiple avenues to realization being proposed by theorists1–3. Showing magnetic-field-free, single-directional superconductivity with Josephson coupling, it would serve as the building block for next-generation superconducting circuit technology. Here we realized the Josephson diode by fabricating an inversion symmetry breaking van der Waals heterostructure of NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2. We demonstrate that even without a magnetic field, the junction can be superconducting with a positive current while being resistive with a negative current. The ΔIc behaviour (the difference between positive and negative critical currents) with magnetic field is symmetric and Josephson coupling is proved through the Fraunhofer pattern. Also, stable half-wave rectification of a square-wave excitation was achieved with a very low switching current density, high rectification ratio and high robustness. This non-reciprocal behaviour strongly violates the known Josephson relations and opens the door to discover new mechanisms and physical phenomena through integration of quantum materials with Josephson junctions, and provides new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.},

We observe an anomalous phase shift in the current–phase relation of a JJ as a function of gate voltage or phase difference in the second JJ. This demonstrates a nonlocal Josephson effect, and the implementation of a φ0-junction which is tunable both electrostatically and magnetically. The anomalous phase shift was larger for shorter distances between the JJs and vanished for distances much longer than the superconducting coherence length. Results are consistent with the hybridization of ABSs, leading to the formation of an Andreev molecule. Our devices constitute a realization of a tunable superconducting phase source, and could enable new coupling schemes for hybrid quantum devices.},

A serious challenge in the experimental realization of the Majorana fermions is the suppression of topological superconductivity by disorder together with the tunability of carrier density for semiconductors in close proximity to superconductors. Here we show that Majorana fermions that are protected by a disorder robust topological gap can occur at the ends of a chain of gate-tunable quantum dots connected by s-wave superconductors. Such an array of quantum dots provides the simplest realization of Majorana fermions in systems as simple as a few quantum dot array. The proposed system provides a very practical and easily realizable experimental platform for the observation of non-Abelian Majorana modes.},

It attempts to realize qubits that store quantum information in a topologically protected manner. The quantum information is protected by non-local storage in localized and well-separated Majorana zero modes, and manipulated by exploiting their non-abelian quantum statistics. Realizing these topological qubits is experimentally challenging, requiring superconductivity, helical electrons (created by spin–orbit coupling) and breaking of time-reversal symmetry to all cooperate in an uncomfortable alliance. Over the past decade, several candidate materials systems for realizing Majorana-based topological qubits have been explored, and there is accumulating, though still debated, evidence that zero modes are indeed being realized. This Review surveys the basic physical principles on which these approaches are based, the materials systems that are being developed and the current state of the field. We highlight both the progress that has been made and the challenges that still need to be overcome.},

To exemplify this enhancement, we study the magnetotransport properties of the two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconducting state induced by gating of MoS2. These results indicate that electrons feel the noncentrosymmetric crystal potential much coherently and sensitively over the correlation length when they form Cooper pairs, and show open a new route to enhance the nonreciprocal response toward novel functionalities, including superconducting diodes.},

	abstract = {Many of the properties of superconductors related to quantum coherence are revealed when the superconducting state is forced to vary in space in response to an external magnetic field, a proximity contact, an interface to a ferromagnet or to impurities embedded in the superconductor. Among the earliest examples is Andreev reflection of an electron into a retro-reflected hole at a normal-superconducting interface. In regions of strong inhomogeneity, multiple Andreev reflection leads to the formation of sub-gap states, Andreev bound states, with excitation energies below the superconducting gap. These states play a central role in our understanding of inhomogeneous superconductors. The discoveries of unconventional superconductivity in many classes of materials, advances in fabrication of superconducting/ferromagnetic hybrids and nanostructures for confining superfluid 3 He, combined with theoretical developments in topological quantum matter have dramatically expanded the significance of branch conversion scattering and Andreev bound state formation. This collection of articles highlights developments in inhomogeneous superconductivity, unconventional superconductivity and topological phases of superfluid 3 He, in which Andreev scattering and bound states underpin much of the physics of these systems. This article provides an introduction to the basic physics of Andreev scattering, bound-state formation and their signatures. The goal is both an introduction for interested readers who are not already experts in the field, and to highlight examples in which branch conversion scattering and Andreev bound states provide unique signatures in the transport properties of superconductors.

We focus on hybrid superconductor–semiconductor nanowires as a flexible and promising experimental platform to realize one-dimensional topological superconductivity and MBSs. We review the main properties of ABSs and MBSs, state-of-the-art techniques for their detection and theoretical progress beyond minimal models, including different types of robust zero modes that may emerge without a band-topological transition.},

Nonetheless, a pronounced even-odd effect appears at finite bias in the dI/dV subgap structure caused by Andreev reflection. The first-order Andreev peak appearing around V=Δ/e is markedly enhanced in gate-voltage regions, in which the charge state of the quantum dot is odd. This enhancement is explained by a “hidden” Kondo resonance, pinned to one contact only. A comparison with a single-impurity Anderson model, which is solved numerically in a slave-boson mean-field approach, yields good agreement with the experiment.},

Here we report a direct measurement of the Zeeman effect on the Andreev levels of a semiconductor quantum dot with large electron g-factor, strongly coupled to a conventional superconductor with a large critical magnetic field. This material combination allows spin degeneracy to be lifted without destroying superconductivity. We show that a spin-split Andreev level crossing the Fermi energy results in a quantum phase transition to a spin-polarized state, which implies a change in the fermionic parity of the system. This crossing manifests itself as a zero-bias conductance anomaly at finite magnetic field with properties that resemble those expected for Majorana modes in a topological superconductor. Although this resemblance is understood without evoking topological superconductivity, the observed parity transitions could be regarded as precursors of Majorana modes in the long-wire limit.},

These quasi-particle excitations obey non-Abelian statistics that can be used to encode and manipulate quantum information in a topologically protected manner6,7. Although signatures of Majorana bound states have been observed in one-dimensional systems, there is an ongoing effort to find alternative platforms that do not require fine-tuning of parameters and can be easily scaled to large numbers of states8–21. Here we present an experimental approach towards a two-dimensional architecture of Majorana bound states. Using a Josephson junction made of a HgTe quantum well coupled to thin-film aluminium, we are able to tune the transition between a trivial and a topological superconducting state by controlling the phase difference across the junction and applying an in-plane magnetic field22. We determine the topological state of the resulting superconductor by measuring the tunnelling conductance at the edge of the junction. At low magnetic fields, we observe a minimum in the tunnelling spectra near zero bias, consistent with a trivial superconductor. However, as the magnetic field increases, the tunnelling conductance develops a zero-bias peak, which persists over a range of phase differences that expands systematically with increasing magnetic field. Our observations are consistent with theoretical predictions for this system and with full quantum mechanical numerical simulations performed on model systems with similar dimensions and parameters. Our work establishes this system as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and for creating and manipulating Majorana modes and probing topological superconducting phases in two-dimensional systems.},

In this paper, we study the ABS in a device consisting of a semiconducting nanowire covered with three superconducting leads. The ABS are formed at two junctions where the wire is not covered. They overlap in the wire where the electron propagation is 1D and in one of the leads where the propagation is 3D. We identify a number of regimes where these two overlaps either dominate or compete, depending on the junction separation L as compared to the correlation lengths ξw,ξs in the wire and in the lead, respectively. We utilize a simple model of 1D electron spectrum in the nanowire and take into account the quality of the contact between the nanowire and the superconducting lead. We present the spectra for different L, detailing the transition from a single ABS in the regime of strong 1D hybridization to two almost independent ABS hybridized at the degeneracy points, in the regime of weak 1D hybridization. We present the details of merging the upper ABS with the continuous spectrum upon decreasing L. We study in detail the effect of quantum interference due to the phase accumulated during the electron passage between the junctions. We develop a perturbation theory for analytical treatment of hybridization. We address an interesting separate case of fully transparent junctions. We derive and exemplify a perturbation theory suitable for the competition regime demonstrating the interference of 1D and two 3D transmission amplitudes.},

Here we provide the tunnel spectroscopic results of electrically controllable two planar JJs sharing one SC electrode. We discover that the coupled JJ results are highly modulated from the single JJ results, due to formation of the phase-dependent AMSs, meaning that the two JJs are coherently coupled. In addition, the superconducting gap closing due to the AMS formation is observed. Our results would help in understanding the microscopic mechanism of the coherent coupling and promoting the AMS physics to apply for research of the topological superconductivity and quantum information technology.},

	abstract = {We perform switching current measurements of planar Josephson junctions (JJs) coupled by a common superconducting electrode, with independent control over the two superconducting phase differences. We observe an anomalous phase shift in the current--phase relation of a JJ as a function of gate voltage or phase difference in the second JJ. This demonstrates a nonlocal Josephson effect, and the implementation of a \${\textbackslash}varphi\_0\$-junction which is tunable both electrostatically and magnetically. The anomalous phase shift was larger for shorter distances between the JJs and vanished for distances much longer than the superconducting coherence length. Results are consistent with the hybridization of ABSs, leading to the formation of an Andreev molecule. Our devices constitute a realization of a tunable superconducting phase source, and could enable new coupling schemes for hybrid quantum devices.},

	abstract = {A Josephson junction (JJ) is a key device in the development of superconducting circuits, wherein a supercurrent in the JJ is controlled by the phase difference between the two superconducting electrodes. Recently, it has been shown that the JJ current is nonlocally controlled by the phase difference of another nearby JJ via coherent coupling. Here, we use the nonlocal control to engineer the anomalous Josephson effect. We observe that a supercurrent is produced by the nonlocal phase control even without any local phase difference, using a quantum interference device. The nonlocal phase control simultaneously generates an offset of a local phase difference giving the JJ ground state. These results provide novel concepts for engineering superconducting devices such as phase batteries and dissipationless rectifiers.},

	abstract = {Superconducting devices with broken time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries can exhibit novel superconducting phenomena. The observation of superconducting diode effects, which is applicable for dissipationless rectification, provides information on the breaking of such symmetries. We experimentally study a Josephson junction (JJ) coupled to another adjacent JJ as a new system exhibiting the superconducting diode effect. We demonstrate that the observed superconducting diode effect can be controlled non-locally based on the phase difference with the adjacent JJ. These results indicate that the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a JJ are broken by the coherent coupling to an adjacent JJ, and this enables the engineering of novel superconducting phenomena mediated by coherent coupling among JJs and development of their applications for superconducting diode devices.},

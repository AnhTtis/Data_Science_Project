    "abstract": "This note focuses on a simple approach to the unified analysis of SGD-type methods from (Gorbunov et al., 2020) for strongly convex smooth optimization problems. The similarities in the analyses of different stochastic first-order methods are discussed along with the existing extensions of the framework. The limitations of the analysis and several alternative approaches are mentioned as well.",

    "abstract": "If the inflaton field is coupled to the hypercharge Chern-Simons density $F\\tilde F$, an explosive production of helical gauge fields when inflation ends can trigger baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition. Besides, Higgs inflation identifies the inflaton with the Higgs field $\\mathcal H$, thus relating cosmological observables to properties of electroweak physics. In this paper we merge both approaches: the helical gauge fields are produced at the end of Higgs inflation from the coupling $|\\mathcal H|^2 F\\tilde F$. In the metric formulation of gravity we found a window in the parameter space for electroweak baryogenesis consistent with all experimental observations. Conversely, for the Palatini formalism the non-gaussianity bounds strongly constrain the helicity produced at the end of inflation, forbidding an efficient baryogenesis.",

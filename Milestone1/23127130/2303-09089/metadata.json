    "abstract": "In this article we define a generalization of the domino shuffling algorithm for tilings of the Aztec diamond to the interacting $k$-tilings recently introduced by S. Corteel, A. Gitlin, and the first author. We describe the algorithm both in terms of dynamics on a system of colored particles and as operations on the dominos themselves.",

\section{Conclusion}
We present \Ours, the first 3DHMR method that focuses on human reconstruction from perspective distorted images. Our proposed camera model and focal length solution accurately reconstruct the human body, especially in close-view photographs. We introduce a new dataset, PDHuman, and extend two datasets containing perspective-distorted images. Our results show significant value for human mesh reconstruction in perspective-distorted images and can empower many downstream tasks, such as monocular clothing human reconstruction~\cite{selfpose, neuralbody, icon} and human trajectory sequences reconstruction in live shows, vlogs, and selfie videos. Further improvements and broader applications could be explored in the future.

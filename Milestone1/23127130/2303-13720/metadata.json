    "abstract": "Multiple application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) are required for the detectors if their readout channels are larger than that of ASIC channels. For a system with such a readout scheme, there is a need to configure channels among ASICs to achieve the lowest electronics noise and highest count rate. In this work, experiments were performed to investigate the performance of two different readout configurations between two ASICs in a cross-strip cadmium zinc telluride detector. A lower electronic noise level, better FWHM energy resolution performance, and higher count rate was found for the anode electrode strips with each ASIC allocating half of the detector area when compared to allocating each ASIC channel to alternate anode channels.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a class of modified new modulus-based iterative methods to process the large and sparse implicit complementarity problem (ICP). By using two positive diagonal matrices, we formulate a fixed-point equation which is equivalent to an ICP and based on a fixed-point equation, an iterative method is presented to solve the ICP. We provide some convergence conditions for the proposed methods when the system matrix is a $P$-matrix or an $H_+$-matrix.",

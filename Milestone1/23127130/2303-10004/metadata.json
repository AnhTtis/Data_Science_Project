    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the special values of spectral zeta functions of Sturm-Liouville differential operators. Using Mercer's Theorem, we find these values are represented by multiple integrals of Green functions. The calculation of the integrals involves an interesting combinatorial problem on counting permutations with fixed peak and valley sets. As an application, we give a new explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers.",

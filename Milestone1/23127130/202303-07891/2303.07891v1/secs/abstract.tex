	% Introduce surrogate safety metrics
	\acp{ssm} are used to express road safety in terms of the safety risk in traffic conflicts.
	% What is lacking?
	Typically, \acp{ssm} rely on assumptions regarding the future evolution of traffic participant trajectories to generate a measure of risk.
	As a result, they are only applicable in scenarios where those assumptions hold.
	% Our approach
	To address this issue, we present a novel data-driven \ac{ourmethod} method. 
	The \ac{ourmethod} method is used to derive \acp{ssm} that can be used to calculate in real time the probability of a specific event (e.g., a crash). 
	Because we adopt a data-driven approach to predict the possible future evolutions of traffic participant trajectories, less assumptions on these trajectories are needed.
	Since the \ac{ourmethod} is not bound to specific assumptions, multiple \acp{ssm} for different types of scenarios can be derived. 
	To calculate the probability of the specific event, the \ac{ourmethod} method uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence probability of the specified event.
	We further introduce a statistical method that requires fewer simulations to estimate this probability. 
	Combined with a regression model, this enables our derived \acp{ssm} to make real-time risk estimations.
	
	% Results
	%Results show that the \ac{ourmethod} method is a generalization of existing probabilistic \acp{ssm}.
	To illustrate the \ac{ourmethod} method, \iac{ssm} is derived for risk evaluation during longitudinal traffic interactions. 
	Since there is no known method to objectively estimate risk from first principles, i.e., there is no known risk ground truth, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to objectively compare the relative merits of two \acp{ssm}.
	Instead, we provide a method for benchmarking our derived \ac{ssm} with respect to expected risk trends.
	The application of the benchmarking illustrates that the \ac{ssm} matches the expected risk trends.
	
	% Conclusions
	Whereas the derived \ac{ssm} shows the potential of the \ac{ourmethod} method, future work involves applying the approach for other types of traffic conflicts, such as lateral traffic conflicts or interactions with vulnerable road users.

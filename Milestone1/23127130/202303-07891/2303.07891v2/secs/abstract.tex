	% Introduce surrogate safety metrics
	\acp{ssm} are used to express road safety in terms of the safety risk in traffic conflicts.
	% What is lacking?
	Typically, \acp{ssm} rely on assumptions regarding the future evolution of traffic participant trajectories to generate a measure of risk, \cstart restricting their applicability to scenarios where these assumptions are valid. \cend
	% Our approach
	\cstart In response to this limitation, we present the novel \cend\ac{ourmethod} method.
	\cstart The objective of \cend the \ac{ourmethod} method is to derive \acp{ssm} that can be used to calculate in real time the probability of a specific event (e.g., a crash). 
	\cstart The \ac{ourmethod} method adopts \cend a data-driven approach to predict the possible future traffic participant trajectories, \cstart thereby reducing the reliance on specific assumptions regarding these trajectories. 
	Since the \ac{ourmethod} is not bound to specific assumptions, \cstart the \ac{ourmethod} method offers the ability to derive \cend multiple \acp{ssm} for \cstart various \cend scenarios. 
	%To calculate the probability of the specific event, the \ac{ourmethod} method uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence probability of the specified event.
	%We further introduce a statistical method that requires fewer simulations to estimate this probability. 
	\cstart The occurrence probability of the specified event is based on simulations and combined \cend with a regression model, this enables our derived \acp{ssm} to make real-time risk estimations.
	
	% Results
	%Results show that the \ac{ourmethod} method is a generalization of existing probabilistic \acp{ssm}.
	To illustrate the \ac{ourmethod} method, \iac{ssm} is derived for risk evaluation during longitudinal traffic interactions. 
	Since there is no known method to objectively estimate risk from first principles, i.e., there is no known risk ground truth, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to objectively compare the relative merits of two \acp{ssm}.
	Instead, we provide a method for benchmarking our derived \ac{ssm} with respect to expected risk trends.
	The application of the benchmarking illustrates that the \ac{ssm} matches the expected risk trends.
	
	% Conclusions
	Whereas the derived \ac{ssm} shows the potential of the \ac{ourmethod} method, future work involves applying the approach for other types of traffic conflicts, such as lateral traffic conflicts or interactions with vulnerable road users.

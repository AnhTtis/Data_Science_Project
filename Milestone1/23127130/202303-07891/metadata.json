    "abstract": "Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) are used to express road safety in terms of\nthe safety risk in traffic conflicts. Typically, SSMs rely on assumptions\nregarding the future evolution of traffic participant trajectories to generate\na measure of risk. As a result, they are only applicable in scenarios where\nthose assumptions hold. To address this issue, we present a novel data-driven\nProbabilistic RISk Measure derivAtion (PRISMA) method. The PRISMA method is\nused to derive SSMs that can be used to calculate in real time the probability\nof a specific event (e.g., a crash). Because we adopt a data-driven approach to\npredict the possible future evolutions of traffic participant trajectories,\nless assumptions on these trajectories are needed. Since the PRISMA is not\nbound to specific assumptions, multiple SSMs for different types of scenarios\ncan be derived. To calculate the probability of the specific event, the PRISMA\nmethod uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence probability of\nthe specified event. We further introduce a statistical method that requires\nfewer simulations to estimate this probability. Combined with a regression\nmodel, this enables our derived SSMs to make real-time risk estimations.\n  To illustrate the PRISMA method, an SSM is derived for risk evaluation during\nlongitudinal traffic interactions. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to\nobjectively compare the relative merits of two SSMs. Instead, we provide a\nmethod for benchmarking our derived SSM with respect to expected risk trends.\nThe application of the benchmarking illustrates that the SSM matches the\nexpected risk trends.\n  Whereas the derived SSM shows the potential of the PRISMA method, future work\ninvolves applying the approach for other types of traffic conflicts, such as\nlateral traffic conflicts or interactions with vulnerable road users.",

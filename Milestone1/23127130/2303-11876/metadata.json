    "abstract": "In the context of the stream calculus, we present an Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) for polynomial systems, and discuss its relations with the classical IFT from calculus. In particular, we demonstrate the advantages of the stream IFT from a computational point of view, and provide a few example applications where its use turns out to be valuable.",

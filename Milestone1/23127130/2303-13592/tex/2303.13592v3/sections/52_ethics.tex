\section{Ethical Considerations}
Code-mixing reflects the linguistic, social, and cultural identity of a multilingual community. Researchers and practitioners should approach synthetic code-mixing with sensitivity and respect, and be cognizant of the potential risks of cultural appropriation or misrepresentation when generating code-mixed data using LLMs. Since LLMs are trained on web data, they may encode biases perpetuating stereotypes, discrimination, or marginalization of specific languages or communities. Prior work has also documented how synthetic data may play a role in feedback loops that amplify the presence of biased language generation \citep{taori2022data}.  Therefore, collaboration with linguists, language experts, and community representatives is necessary to avoid the unintentional perpetuation of stereotypes and cultural insensitivity.

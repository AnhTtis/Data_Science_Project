Two bilingual speakers talking & Imagine there are two \textcolor{blue}{English}-\textcolor{blue}{Indonesian} bilingual speakers talking to each other, can you imagine a conversation between them talking about \textcolor{orange}{food}? & Speaker 1: Hey, have you tried the Indonesian dish, Nasi Goreng?

Speaker 2: Yes, I have. It's one of my favorites. Have you had it before?

Speaker 1: Yes, I have. I really like the combination of flavors. Have you tried Sate Ayam?

Speaker 2: Oh yes, I love Sate Ayam! The peanut sauce is just delicious. But have you tried Rendang?\\ \midrule


Explicitly define CM & Code-mixing refers to a phenomenon of combining two or more languages in a single sentence. Can you generate a code-mixed \textcolor{blue}{English}-\textcolor{blue}{Chinese} sentence about \textcolor{orange}{food}? &I love eating 炸鸡 ~(zhá jī) fried chicken for lunch. \\\midrule

Assume as bilingual speaker & Assuming that you are an \textcolor{blue}{English}-\textcolor{blue}{Malay} bilingual speaker, how would you write a natural \textcolor{blue}{English}-\textcolor{blue}{Malay} code-mixed sentence about \textcolor{orange}{traffic}? & Saya rasa jalan-jalan ni sangat jam sebab ada banyak cars yang block semua lanes. (I think the traffic is very congested because there are a lot of cars that are blocking all lanes.)

In this sentence, I have mixed English and Malay words together to form a code-mixed sentence. The sentence starts in Malay, with "Saya rasa jalan-jalan ni sangat jam" meaning "I think the traffic is very congested." Then, I switch to English for the next part, saying "sebab ada banyak cars" instead of "kerana terdapat banyak kereta," and ending with "yang block semua lanes" which means "that are blocking all lanes" in English. \\\midrule

Imitate speaking style & Imitate the speaking style of a person who can speak \textcolor{blue}{Singlish} in one sentence about \textcolor{orange}{family}. & Eh, you know lah, family very important one leh, must always stick together like sotong and chilli sauce, can or not? \\\midrule

Nationality & Imagine that you are a \textcolor{sky}{\ul{Vietnamese}} speaker. How would you talk about \textcolor{orange}{weather} using both \textcolor{blue}{English} and \textcolor{blue}{Vietnamese} in a single sentence? & "Ngày hôm nay thời tiết khá nắng nóng, so I think I'll wear my shorts and t-shirt đi chơi."\\

    "abstract": "We present a signal reconstruction method for zero-knowledge one-way communication channels in which a receiver aims to interpret a message sent by an unknown source about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our reconstruction method is agnostic vis-à-vis the arbitrarily chosen encoding-decoding scheme and other observer-dependent characteristics, such as the arbitrarily chosen computation model or underlying mathematical theory. We investigate how non-random messages may encode information about the physical properties, such as dimension and length scales of the space in which a signal or message may have been originally encoded, embedded, or generated. We argue that our results have applications to life and technosignature detection and to coding theory in general.",

abstract = {An expression for a general Slater determinant is written in the notation of second quantization. This expression has just the right number of arbitrary coefficients, so no subsidiary conditions are required, and the expression for a particular determinant is unique. This notation is used to study two problems. Firstly, a condition for a particular solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is derived. This condition is equivalent to the condition for stability of collective modes in the random phase approximation. Secondly, the determinant which minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian while giving a particular value to the expectation value of a component of angular momentum is found. In this way, an expression for the moment of inertia of an axially symmetric system is derived within the framework of the Hartree-Fock theory. The expression for a determinant is generalized to include the type of wave functions used in the theory of superconductivity.}

Using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, we introduce an orthogonalization constraint with virtual orbitals to prevent collapse of the stochastic Slater determinants in the imaginary-time propagation. Trial wave functions from density-functional calculations are used for the constraints. Detailed band structures can be calculated. Results for standard semiconductors are in good agreement with experiments; comparisons are also made with GW calculations and the connections and differences are discussed. For the challenging ZnO wurtzite structure, we obtain a fundamental band gap of 3.26(16) eV, consistent with experiments.}

abstract = {The auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method provides a computational framework for solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation in atoms, molecules, solids, and a variety of model systems. AFQMC has recently witnessed remarkable growth, especially as a tool for electronic structure computations in real materials. The method has demonstrated excellent accuracy across a variety of correlated electron systems. Taking the form of stochastic evolution in a manifold of nonorthogonal Slater determinants, the method resembles an ensemble of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations in the presence of fluctuating external potentials. Its computational cost scales as a low-power of system size, similar to the corresponding independent-electron calculations. Highly efficient and intrinsically parallel, AFQMC is able to take full advantage of contemporary high-performance computing platforms and numerical libraries. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to the exact and constrained variants of AFQMC, with emphasis on its applications to the electronic structure of molecular systems. Representative results are presented, and theoretical foundations and implementation details of the method are discussed.

abstract = {We describe the treatment of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in interacting many-fermion systems within the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo framework, and present a set of illustrative results. These include numerically exact calculations on the ground-state properties of the spin-balanced, attractive two-dimensional Fermi gas, as well as a study of a tight-binding Hamiltonian with repulsive interaction. These systems are formally connected via the Hubbard Hamiltonian plus SOC, but cover different physics ranging from superfluidity and triplet pairing to SOC in real materials in the presence of strong interactions in localized orbitals. We carry out detailed benchmark studies of the method in the latter case when an approximation is needed to control the sign problem for repulsive Coulomb interactions. The methods presented here provide an approach for predictive computations in materials to study the interplay of SOC and strong correlation.}

abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.}

abstract = {An extension of the multiconfigurational second-order perturbation approach CASPT2 is suggested, where several electronic states are coupled at second order via an effective-Hamiltonian approach. The method has been implemented into the MOLCAS-4 program system, where it will replace the single-state CASPT2 program. The accuracy of the method is illustrated through calculations of the ionic-neutral avoided crossing in the potential curves for LiF and of the valence-Rydberg mixing in the V-state of the ethylene molecule.}

In the framework of the density functional formalism, we present here an ab initio calculation of the Bismuth band structure, using non-local pseudo-potentials, and including the spin–orbit interaction.

The absence of this contribution leads to unrealistic overlaps between the bands close to the Fermi level, while correctly accounting for spin–orbit allows to reproduce quite well the experimental Bismuth Fermi surface.

First-principles calculation of several lattice parameters and elastics constants are also reported.}

abstract={The hallmark of a topologically insulating state of matter in two dimensions protected by time-reversal symmetry is the existence of chiral edge modes propagating along the perimeter of the sample. Among the first systems predicted to be a two-dimensional topological insulator are bilayers of bismuth. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on bulk Bi crystals that show that a subset of the predicted Bi-bilayers' edge states are decoupled from the states of the substrate and provide direct spectroscopic evidence of their one-dimensional nature. Moreover, by visualizing the quantum interference of edge-mode quasi-particles in confined geometries, we demonstrate their remarkable coherent propagation along the edge with scattering properties consistent with strong suppression of backscattering as predicted for the propagating topological edge states.},

abstract={The mathematical field of topology has become a framework in which to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. Typical of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk--boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk--boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principles calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunnelling spectroscopy, we probe the signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at the step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.},

abstract = {Python-based simulations of chemistry framework (PySCF) is a general-purpose electronic structure platform designed from the ground up to emphasize code simplicity, so as to facilitate new method development and enable flexible computational workflows. The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper, we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package.

abstract = {An efficient integral library Libcint was designed to automatically implement general integrals for Gaussian-type scalar and spinor basis functions. The library is able to evaluate arbitrary integral expressions on top of p, r and σ operators with one-electron overlap and nuclear attraction, two-electron Coulomb and Gaunt operators for segmented contracted and/or generated contracted basis in Cartesian, spherical or spinor form. Using a symbolic algebra tool, new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular properties. To demonstrate the capability of the integral library, we computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both nonrelativistic and 4-component relativistic Hartree–Fock level in this work. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives. The generality of the integral library is achieved without losing efficiency. On the modern multi-CPU platform, Libcint can easily reach the overall throughput being many times of the I/O bandwidth. On a 20-core node, we are able to achieve an average output 8.3 GB/s for C60 molecule with cc-pVTZ basis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Starting from the full microscopic Breit-Pauli or no-pair spin-orbit Hamiltonians, we have devised an effective one-electron spin-orbit Hamiltonian in a well defined series of approximations by averaging the two-electron contributions to the spin-orbit matrix element over the valence shell. In addition the two-electron integrals were restricted to comprise only one-centre terms. The validity of these approximations has been tested on several palladium containing compounds. Excellent agreement of the matrix elements of the mean-field operator with corresponding full results is observed; deviations amount to a few cm−1 in absolute value or at most 0.2% on a relative scale. The newly defined mean-field operator can thus safely be employed to evaluate spin-orbit effects in transition metal containing compounds.}

 @article{Almoukhalalati2016,
 abstract = {This paper addresses the definition of correlation energy within 4-component relativistic atomic and molecular calculations. In the nonrelativistic domain the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact eigenvalue of the electronic Hamiltonian and the Hartree-Fock energy. In practice, what is reported is the basis set correlation energy, where the "exact" value is provided by a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation with some specified one-particle basis. The extension of this definition to the relativistic domain is not straightforward since the corresponding electronic Hamiltonian, the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian, has no bound solutions. Present-day relativistic calculations are carried out within the no-pair approximation, where the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is embedded by projectors eliminating the troublesome negative-energy solutions. Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the implicit use of such projectors and only positive-energy orbitals are retained at the correlated level, meaning that the Hartree-Fock projectors are frozen at the correlated level. We argue that the projection operators should be optimized also at the correlated level and that this is possible by full Multiconfigurational Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) calculations, that is, MCSCF calculations using a no-pair full CI expansion, but including orbital relaxation from the negative-energy orbitals. We show by variational perturbation theory that the MCSCF correlation energy is a pure MP2-like correlation expression, whereas the corresponding CI correlation energy contains an additional relaxation term. We explore numerically our theoretical analysis by carrying out variational and perturbative calculations on the two-electron rare gas atoms with specially tailored basis sets. In particular, we show that the correlation energy obtained by the suggested MCSCF procedure is smaller than the no-pair full CI correlation energy, in accordance with the underlying minmax principle and our theoretical analysis. We also show that the relativistic correlation energy, obtained from no-pair full MCSCF calculations, scales at worst as X-2 with respect to the cardinal number X of our correlation-consistent basis sets optimized for the two-electron atoms. This is better than the X-1 scaling suggested by previous studies, but worse than the X-3 scaling observed in the nonrelativistic domain. The well-known 1/Z- expansion in nonrelativistic atomic theory follows from coordinate scaling. We point out that coordinate scaling for consistency should be accompanied by velocity scaling. In the nonrelativistic domain this comes about automatically, whereas in the relativistic domain an explicit scaling of the speed of light is required. This in turn explains why the relativistic correlation energy to the lowest order is not independent of nuclear charge, in contrast to nonrelativistic theory.},

Such materials also allow one to study the transition from molecular to bulk-like magnetic behaviour. One approach for preparing mesoscopic magnetic materials is to fragment bulk ferromagnets; a more controllable method is to take a 'bottom-up' approach, using chemistry to grow well defined clusters of metal ions5,6. Lis7 has described a twelve-ion manganese cluster in which eight of the Mn ions are in the +3 oxidation state (spin S=2) and four are in the +4 state (S=3/2). These ions are magnetically coupled to give an S=10 ground state8, giving rise to unusual magnetic relaxation properties8,9. Here we report that the magnetization of the Mn12 cluster is highly anisotropic and that the magnetization relaxation time becomes very long below a temperature of 4 K, giving rise to pronounced hysteresis. This behaviour is not, however, strictly analogous to that of a bulk ferromagnet, in which magnetization hysteresis results from the motion of domain walls. In principle, a bistable magnetic unit of this sort could act as a data storage device.},

abstract = {Single-molecule magnets could prove useful in miniaturizing a wide variety of devices. However, their application has been severely hindered by the need to cool them to extremely low temperature using liquid helium. Guo et al. now report a dysprosium compound that manifests magnetic hysteresis at temperatures up to 80 kelvin. The principles applied to tuning the ligands in this complex could point the way toward future architectures with even higher temperature performance. Science, this issue p. 1400 Ligand tuning raises the upper temperature for hysteresis in a single-molecule magnet just above nitrogen’s boiling point. Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) containing only one metal center may represent the lower size limit for molecule-based magnetic information storage materials. Their current drawback is that all SMMs require liquid-helium cooling to show magnetic memory effects. We now report a chemical strategy to access the dysprosium metallocene cation [(CpiPr5)Dy(Cp*)]+ (CpiPr5, penta-iso-propylcyclopentadienyl; Cp*, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), which displays magnetic hysteresis above liquid-nitrogen temperatures. An effective energy barrier to reversal of the magnetization of Ueff = 1541 wave number is also measured. The magnetic blocking temperature of TB = 80 kelvin for this cation overcomes an essential barrier toward the development of nanomagnet devices that function at practical temperatures.}}

Given their large spin–orbit coupling and the radial extension of the 5f orbitals{,} the actinides are well-suited for the design of both mononuclear and exchange-coupled molecules{,} and indeed at least one new system has emerged every year. By some measures{,} the actinides are already demonstrating promise for one day exceeding the performance characteristics of transition metal and lanthanide complexes. However{,} much further work is needed to understand the nature of the slow relaxation in mononuclear actinide complexes{,} as well as the influence of magnetic exchange on slow relaxation in multinuclear species. This perspective seeks to summarize the successes in the field and to address some of the many open questions in this up and coming area of research."}

must involve ever higher total spin values has so far driven synthetic efforts towards molecular clusters 
of increasing nuclearity. In the present paper it is suggested that it might be worthwhile to reconsider 
this approach. There is evidence from theory and experiment to suggest that the race for multinuclear complexes
 with higher total spin might not necessarily be fruitful as a strategy for maximizing the magnetic relaxation
barrier. Instead{,} we propose that more effort should be directed in understanding the parameters involved in
maximizing the anisotropy of small{,} perhaps even mononuclear{,} molecules. Using multi-reference ab initio 
calculations we demonstrate the theory that can be applied and the principles of the computational approach for 
representative mononuclear complexes.
 Such small units may subsequently be employed as building blocks for the controlled assembly of larger and maximally
anisotropic single molecule magnets."}

abstract  ="One of the determining factors in whether single-molecule magnets (SMMs) may be used as the smallest component of data storage{,} is the size of the barrier to reversal of the magnetisation{,} Ueff. This physical quantity depends on the magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy of a complex and the size of its spin ground state. In recent years{,} there has been a growing focus on maximising the anisotropy generated for a single 3d transition metal (TM) ion{,} by an appropriate ligand field{,} as a means of achieving higher barriers. Because the magnetic properties of these compounds arise from a single ion in a ligand field{,} they are often referred to as single-ion magnets (SIMs). Here{,} the synthetic chemist has a significant role to play{,} both in the design of ligands to enforce propitious splitting of the 3d orbitals and in the judicious choice of TM ion. Since the publication of the first 3d-based SIM{,} which was based on Fe(ii){,} many other contributions have been made to this field{,} using different first row TM ions{,} and exploring varied coordination environments for the paramagnetic ions."}

abstract = {A study of the magnetic response of cobalt atoms adsorbed on oxide surfaces may lead to much denser storage of data. In hard drives, data are stored as magnetic bits; the magnetic field pointing up or down corresponds to storing a zero or a one. The smallest bit possible would be a single atom, but the magnetism of a single atom —its spin—has to be stabilized by interactions with heavy elements or surfaces through an effect called spin-orbit coupling. Rau et al. (see the Perspective by Khajetoorians and Wiebe) built a model system in pursuit of single-atom bits—cobalt atoms adsorbed on magnesium oxide. At temperatures approaching absolute zero, the stabilization of the spin's magnetic direction reached the maximum that is theoretically possible. Science, this issue p. 988; see also p. 976 A cobalt atom bound to a single oxygen site on magnesia has the maximum magnetic anisotropy allowed for a transition metal [Also see Perspective by Khajetoorians and Wiebe] Designing systems with large magnetic anisotropy is critical to realize nanoscopic magnets. Thus far, the magnetic anisotropy energy per atom in single-molecule magnets and ferromagnetic films remains typically one to two orders of magnitude below the theoretical limit imposed by the atomic spin-orbit interaction. We realized the maximum magnetic anisotropy for a 3d transition metal atom by coordinating a single Co atom to the O site of an MgO(100) surface. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a record-high zero-field splitting of 58 millielectron volts as well as slow relaxation of the Co atom’s magnetization. This striking behavior originates from the dominating axial ligand field at the O adsorption site, which leads to out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy while preserving the gas-phase orbital moment of Co, as observed with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism.}}

abstract = {Applied magnetic fields induce a field in any compound with unpaired electrons. However, for the induced field to persist once the applied field is gone, the electrons must be configured to manifest orbital angular momentum. Generally, the influence of ligands severely restricts that property in transition metal complexes. Bunting et al. now show that a cobalt ion is just barely affected by two linearly coordinated carbon ligands and, as such, exhibits maximal orbital angular momentum. Although its magnetic properties mainly pertain at very low temperature, its structure offers a more general design principle. Science, this issue p. eaat7319 Magnetic properties arise in a cobalt ion because the influence of two linearly coordinated carbon ligands is unusually weak. Orbital angular momentum is a prerequisite for magnetic anisotropy, although in transition metal complexes it is typically quenched by the ligand field. By reducing the basicity of the carbon donor atoms in a pair of alkyl ligands, we synthesized a cobalt(II) dialkyl complex, Co(C(SiMe2ONaph)3)2 (where Me is methyl and Naph is a naphthyl group), wherein the ligand field is sufficiently weak that interelectron repulsion and spin-orbit coupling play a dominant role in determining the electronic ground state. Assignment of a non-Aufbau (dx2–y2, dxy)3(dxz, dyz)3(dz2)1 electron configuration is supported by dc magnetic susceptibility data, experimental charge density maps, and ab initio calculations. Variable-field far-infrared spectroscopy and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements further reveal slow magnetic relaxation via a 450–wave number magnetic excited state.}}

abstract = {Quantum bits of information (qubits) that are based on spins of atomic nuclei are an attractive option for quantum information processing. It can sometimes be tricky to manipulate these qubits using magnetic fields directly. Thiele et al. developed a technique for electrically controlling a nuclear spin qubit in the single-molecule magnet TbPc2. When they hit the qubit with a microwave pulse, the microwave's electric field generated effective magnetic fields much larger than those available previously. Science, this issue p. 1135 The hyperfine interaction in a terbium bisphthalocyanine complex is modulated using electric fields to manipulate nuclear spin. Recent advances in addressing isolated nuclear spins have opened up a path toward using nuclear-spin–based quantum bits. Local magnetic fields are normally used to coherently manipulate the state of the nuclear spin; however, electrical manipulation would allow for fast switching and spatially confined spin control. Here, we propose and demonstrate coherent single nuclear spin manipulation using electric fields only. Because there is no direct coupling between the spin and the electric field, we make use of the hyperfine Stark effect as a magnetic field transducer at the atomic level. This quantum-mechanical process is present in all nuclear spin systems, such as phosphorus or bismuth atoms in silicon, and offers a general route toward the electrical control of nuclear-spin–based devices.}}

abstract = {Spins in solid-state systems such as quantum dots and defect centers in diamond can easily be controlled by light for use in quantum information processing. More challenging is tuning their properties and making large arrays, something that can be done more easily with spins in molecules. Bayliss et al. combined the advantages of the two approaches by designing and characterizing three related molecular species that are optically addressable. The molecules consist of a central chromium ion surrounded by organic ligands, and their spin and optical properties can be tailored by simply changing the positions of methyl groups on the ligands. Science, this issue p. 1309 Three organometallic molecules that can be controlled by light are designed and characterized. Spin-bearing molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies as they can be chemically tuned, assembled into scalable arrays, and readily incorporated into diverse device architectures. In molecular systems, optically addressing ground-state spins would enable a wide range of applications in quantum information science, as has been demonstrated for solid-state defects. However, this important functionality has remained elusive for molecules. Here, we demonstrate such optical addressability in a series of synthesized organometallic, chromium(IV) molecules. These compounds display a ground-state spin that can be initialized and read out using light and coherently manipulated with microwaves. In addition, through atomistic modification of the molecular structure, we vary the spin and optical properties of these compounds, indicating promise for designer quantum systems synthesized from the bottom-up.}}

abstract={Spins in solids or in molecules possess discrete energy levels, and the associated quantum states can be tuned and coherently manipulated by means of external electromagnetic fields. Spins therefore provide one of the simplest platforms to encode a quantum bit (qubit), the elementary unit of future quantum computers. Performing any useful computation demands much more than realizing a robust qubit---one also needs a large number of qubits and a reliable manner with which to integrate them into a complex circuitry that can store and process information and implement quantum algorithms. This `scalability' is arguably one of the challenges for which a chemistry-based bottom-up approach is best-suited. Molecules, being much more versatile than atoms, and yet microscopic, are the quantum objects with the highest capacity to form non-trivial ordered states at the nanoscale and to be replicated in large numbers using chemical tools.},

The crystal structures of 1{,} 3{,} 4 and 5 have been determined by X-ray diffraction on single crystals. Each cobalt(ii) ion is four-coordinate in a distorted tetrahedral environment built by two chloride anions and two benzimidazole ligands. The neutral molecules are well separated from each other{,} shortest intermolecular cobalt⋯cobalt distances being greater than 9.0 Å. Static (dc) magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range 2.0–300 K of 1–5 reveal the occurrence of a Curie law behaviour of magnetically non-interacting spin quadruplets in the high-temperature domain with a downturn at low temperatures due to magnetic anisotropy. The values of the D and E/D parameters for these compounds vary in the ranges −8.75 to +8.96 cm−1 and 0.00140 to 0.23{,} respectively. Dynamic (ac) magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1–5 show slow magnetic relaxation in the lack (1) or under the presence (1–5) of applied dc magnetic fields{,} a feature which is typical of single-molecule magnet behaviour (SMM). The analysis of the ac data shows that a thermally activated Orbach relaxation mechanism dominates this behaviour. Complexes 1–5 also act as efficient and highly selective eco-friendly catalysts in the coupling reaction between CO2 and epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates under solvent-free conditions. Under optimized reaction conditions{,} different epoxides were converted to the respective cyclic carbonate{,} with excellent conversions{,} using catalyst 4."}

abstract={Single-molecule magnets that contain one spin centre may represent the smallest possible unit for spin-based computational devices. Such applications, however, require the realization of molecules with a substantial energy barrier for spin inversion, achieved through a large axial magnetic anisotropy. Recently, significant progress has been made in this regard by using lanthanide centres such as terbium(III) and dysprosium(III), whose anisotropy can lead to extremely high relaxation barriers. We contend that similar effects should be achievable with transition metals by maintaining a low coordination number to restrict the magnitude of the d-orbital ligand-field splitting energy (which tends to hinder the development of large anisotropies). Herein we report the first two-coordinate complex of iron(I), [Fe(C(SiMe3)3)2]−, for which alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal slow magnetic relaxation below 29 K in a zero applied direct-current field. This S = complex exhibits an effective spin-reversal barrier of Ueff = 226(4) cm−1, the largest yet observed for a single-molecule magnet based on a transition metal, and displays magnetic blocking below 4.5 K.},

Ac magnetic susceptibility data for all compounds revealed slow magnetic relaxation under an applied dc field{,} with the magnetic relaxation times following a general trend of 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 ≫ 6. Arrhenius plots created for the linear complexes were fit by employing a sum of tunneling{,} direct{,} Raman{,} and Orbach relaxation processes{,} resulting in spin reversal barriers of Ueff = 181{,} 146{,} 109{,} 104{,} and 43 cm−1 for 1–5{,} respectively. CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations on the crystal structures were performed to explore the influence of deviations from rigorous D∞h geometry on the d-orbital splittings and the electronic state energies. Asymmetry in the ligand fields quenches the orbital angular momentum of 1–6{,} but ultimately spin–orbit coupling is strong enough to compensate and regenerate the orbital moment. The lack of simple Arrhenius behavior in 1–5 can be attributed to a combination of the asymmetric ligand field and the influence of vibronic coupling{,} with the latter possibility being suggested by thermal ellipsoid models to the diffraction data."}

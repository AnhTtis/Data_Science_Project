abstract = {Learning visual representations of medical images (e.g., X-rays) is core to medical image understanding but its progress has been held back by the scarcity of human annotations. Existing work commonly relies on fine-tuning weights transferred from ImageNet pretraining, which is suboptimal due to drastically different image characteristics, or rule-based label extraction from the textual report data paired with medical images, which is inaccurate and hard to generalize. Meanwhile, several recent studies show exciting results from unsupervised contrastive learning from natural images, but we find these methods help little on medical images because of their high inter-class similarity. We propose ConVIRT, an alternative unsupervised strategy to learn medical visual representations by exploiting naturally occurring paired descriptive text. Our new method of pretraining medical image encoders with the paired text data via a bidirectional contrastive objective between the two modalities is domain-agnostic, and requires no additional expert input. We test ConVIRT by transferring our pretrained weights to 4 medical image classification tasks and 2 zero-shot retrieval tasks, and show that it leads to image representations that considerably outperform strong baselines in most settings. Notably, in all 4 classification tasks, our method requires only 10\% as much labeled training data as an ImageNet initialized counterpart to achieve better or comparable performance, demonstrating superior data efficiency.},

abstract = {Recently a number of studies demonstrated impressive performance on diverse vision-language mul-timodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering by extending the self-attention based Transformer architecture with multimodal pre-training objectives. Despite its huge potential, vision-language multimodal pre-training in the medical domain has only recently received attention, and only demonstrated improved diagnosis accuracy of vision-language pre-trained models. In this work we explore a broad set of multimodal representation learning tasks in the medical domain, specifically using radiology images and the unstructured report. We propose a new model which adopts a Transformer based architecture combined with a novel multimodal attention masking scheme to maximize generalization performance for both vision-language understanding task (e.g., diagnosis classification) and vision-language generation task (e.g., radiology report generation). By rigorously evaluating the proposed model on four downstream tasks with three radiographic image-text datasets (MIMIC-CXR, Open-I, and VQA-RAD), we empirically demonstrate the superior downstream task performance and generality of our model against various baselines including task specific architectures. In addition, we qualitatively analyze our model by showing the results of retrieved image-report pairs, the attention map visualiza-tion, and generated reports. Our proposed multimodal pre-training model could flexibly adapt to multiple downstream tasks of vision-language understanding and generation with a novel self-attention scheme. We believe that our approach can provide the basis for a wide range of interpretations of vision-language multimodal in the medical domain. Code:github.com/SuperSupermoon/MedViLL},

abstract = {Chest radiography is an extremely powerful imaging modality, allowing for a detailed inspection of a patient's chest, but requires specialized training for proper interpretation. With the advent of high performance general purpose computer vision algorithms, the accurate automated analysis of chest radiographs is becoming increasingly of interest to researchers. Here we describe MIMIC-CXR, a large dataset of 227,835 imaging studies for 65,379 patients presenting to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Emergency Department between 2011–2016. Each imaging study can contain one or more images, usually a frontal view and a lateral view. A total of 377,110 images are available in the dataset. Studies are made available with a semi-structured free-text radiology report that describes the radiological findings of the images, written by a practicing radiologist contemporaneously during routine clinical care. All images and reports have been de-identified to protect patient privacy. The dataset is made freely available to facilitate and encourage a wide range of research in computer vision, natural language processing, and clinical data mining.},

@article{Huang,
abstract = {In recent years, the growing utilization of medical imaging is placing an increasing burden on radiologists. Deep learning provides a promising solution for automatic medical image analysis and clinical decision support. However, large-scale manually labeled datasets required for training deep neural networks are difficult and expensive to obtain for medical images. The purpose of this work is to develop label-efficient multimodal medical imaging representations by leveraging radiology reports. We propose an attention-based framework for learning global and local representations by contrasting image sub-regions and words in the paired report. In addition, we propose methods to leverage the learned representations for various downstream medical image recognition tasks with limited labels. Our results demonstrate high-performance and label-efficiency for image-text retrieval, classification (finetuning and zeros-shot settings), and segmentation on different datasets.},

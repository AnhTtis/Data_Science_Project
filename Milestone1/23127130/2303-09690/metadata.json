    "abstract": "The looming electromagnetic spectrum crisis -- due to the fact of the explosive growth in the increasing user data demand -- has encouraged the emergence of new wireless technologies. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art leading and rapid developments in the current Light Fidelity (LiFi) technology. First, an overview is shown to help readers understand the potential of this technology. A comprehensive comparison with legacy wireless technologies is analyzed. We devise a taxonomy based on the main characteristics such as modulation techniques, applications, scenarios, network topologies, and architecture requirements, which enables a foundation for the research community. We highlight the powerful opportunities, the ongoing works, and results, identifying the challenges for future research.",

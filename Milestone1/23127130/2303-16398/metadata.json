    "abstract": "We give an explicit formula to count the number of geometric branches of a curve in positive characteristic using the theory of tight closure. This formula readily shows that the property of having a single geometric branch characterizes $F$-nilpotent curves. Further, we show that a reduced, local $F$-nilpotent ring has a single geometric branch; in particular, it is a domain. Finally, we study inequalities of Frobenius test exponents along purely inseparable ring extensions with applications to $F$-nilpotent affine semigroup rings.",

    "abstract": "Following the Kolokoltsov's work [14], we will present an extension of mean-field control theory in quantum framework. In particular such an extension is done naturally by considering the Belavkin quantum filtering and control theory in a mean-field setting. The state dynamics is described by a controlled Belavkin equation of McKean-Vlasov type, and we prove the well-posedness of the equation under imperfect measurements records and also the propagation of chaos for perfect measurements. Also, we apply particle methods to simulate the mean-field equation and we suggest its application in a stabilizing feedback control.",

    "abstract": "The well-rounded retract for $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$ is defined as the set of flat tori of unit volume and dimension $n$ whose systoles generate a finite-index subgroup in homology. This set forms an equivariant spine of minimal dimension for the space of flat tori.\n  For both the Outer space $X_n$ of metric graphs of rank $n$ and the Teichmüller space $\\mathcal{T}_g$ of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$, we show that the literal analogue of the well-rounded retract does not contain an equivariant spine. We also prove that the set of graphs whose systoles fill (the analogue of a set proposed as a spine for $\\mathcal{T}_g$ by Thurston) is a spine for $X_n$ but that its dimension is larger than the virtual cohomological dimension of $\\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ in general.",

    "abstract": "Biochars are black carbonaceous solids produced through biomass pyrolysis under conditions of little or no oxygen. Whilst their properties are well studied, and their applications numerous, the underlying molecular structures within biochars still need to be defined. This raises a substantial barrier to the molecular modelling of biochars and has limited computational study of these materials, despite the advantages of such techniques. In this work, we critically assess the analytical techniques used to characterise biochars and use this information to gain molecular-level insights into biochars' molecular compositions and nanostructures. We focus on properties present at the nanoscale and which provide atomic-resolution insights into the molecular structures within these materials. Our goal is to create a holistic understanding of biochars' chemical, physical and molecular properties and to lay the foundation for future work focused on developing realistic molecular models of these materials.",

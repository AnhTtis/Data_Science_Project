We review the construction of the Fourier transform on an Abelian group and the principles underlying the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. We describe the implementation of the FFT algorithm for the group of integers modulo 2<sup>n</sup> in the quantum context, showing how the group-theoretic formalism leads to the standard quantum network, and identify the property of entanglement that gives rise to the exponential speed-up (compared to the classical FFT). Finally, we outline the use of the Fourier transform in extracting periodicities, which underlies its utility in the known quantum algorithms.},

Many proposals and experiments designed to test hidden variable theories and the violation of Bell's inequalities have been reported3,4,5,6,7; usually, these involve correlated photons, although recently an experiment was performed with 9Be+ ions8. Nevertheless, it is of considerable interest to show that such correlations (arising from quantum mechanical entanglement) are not simply a peculiarity of photons. Here we measure correlations between two degrees of freedom (comprising spatial and spin components) of single neutrons; this removes the need for a source of entangled neutron pairs, which would present a considerable technical challenge. A Bell-like inequality is introduced to clarify the correlations that can arise between observables of otherwise independent degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the violation of this Bell-like inequality: our measured value is 2.051 $\pm$0.019, clearly above the value of 2 predicted by classical hidden variable theories9,10,11,12.},

	Abstract = {This is a review of pseudorandom number generators (RNG's) of the highest quality, suitable for use in the most demanding Monte Carlo calculations. All the RNG's we recommend here are based on the Kolmogorov--Anosov theory of mixing in classical mechanical systems, which guarantees under certain conditions and in certain asymptotic limits, that points on the trajectories of these systems can be used to produce random number sequences of exceptional quality. We outline this theory of mixing and establish criteria for deciding which RNG's are sufficiently good approximations to the ideal mathematical systems that guarantee highest quality. The well-known RANLUX (at highest luxury level) and its recent variant RANLUX++ are seen to meet our criteria, and some of the proposed versions of MIXMAX can be modified easily to meet the same criteria.},

The resulting sequences are bias free, pass the applicable tests in the NIST battery of statistical randomness tests, and are shown to be Borel normal, without the need for experimental calibration stages or postprocessing of the output. Because the photon counts are produced in the course of a measurement of the violation of the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality, we are able to concurrently verify the nonclassical nature of the photon statistics and estimate a lower bound on the min-entropy of the bit-generating source. The rate of bit production in our experiment is around 13 bits/s.},

@article{Ma2016,
	Abstract = {Quantum physics can be exploited to generate true random numbers, which have important roles in many applications, especially in cryptography. Genuine randomness from the measurement of a quantum system reveals the inherent nature of quantumness---coherence, an important feature that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. The generation of genuine randomness is generally considered impossible with only classical means. On the basis of the degree of trustworthiness on devices, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can be grouped into three categories. The first category, practical QRNG, is built on fully trusted and calibrated devices and typically can generate randomness at a high speed by properly modelling the devices. The second category is self-testing QRNG, in which verifiable randomness can be generated without trusting the actual implementation. The third category, semi-self-testing QRNG, is an intermediate category that provides a tradeoff between the trustworthiness on the device and the random number generation speed.},

	Abstract = {Random numbers are commonly used in many different fields, ranging from simulations in fundamental science to security applications. In some critical cases, as Bell's tests and cryptography, the random numbers are required to be both private and to be provided at an ultra-fast rate. However, practical generators are usually considered trusted, but their security can be compromised in case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work we introduce an efficient protocol which guarantees security and speed in the generation. We propose a source-device-independent protocol based on generic Positive Operator Valued Measurements and then we specialize the result to heterodyne measurements. Furthermore, we experimentally implemented the protocol, reaching a secure generation rate of 17.42 Gbit/s, without the need of an initial source of randomness. The security of the protocol has been proven for general attacks in the finite key scenario.},

	abstract = {Quantum steering allows two parties to verify shared entanglement even if one measurement device is untrusted. A conclusive demonstration of steering through the violation of a steering inequality is of considerable fundamental interest and opens up applications in quantum communication. To date, all experimental tests with single-photon states have relied on post selection, allowing untrusted devices to cheat by hiding unfavourable events in losses. Here we close this 'detection loophole' by combining a highly efficient source of entangled photon pairs with superconducting transition-edge sensors. We achieve an unprecedented ∼62{\%} conditional detection efficiency of entangled photons and violate a steering inequality with the minimal number of measurement settings by 48 s.d.s. Our results provide a clear path to practical applications of steering and to a photonic loophole-free Bell test.},

@article{Bierhorst2018,
	abstract = {From dice to modern electronic circuits, there have been many attempts to build better devices to generate random numbers. Randomness is fundamental to security and cryptographic systems and to safeguarding privacy. A key challenge with random-number generators is that it is hard to ensure that their outputs are unpredictable1--3. For a random-number generator based on a physical process, such as a noisy classical system or an elementary quantum measurement, a detailed model that describes the underlying physics is necessary to assert unpredictability. Imperfections in the model compromise the integrity of the device. However, it is possible to exploit the phenomenon of quantum non-locality with a loophole-free Bell test to build a random-number generator that can produce output that is unpredictable to any adversary that is limited only by general physical principles, such as special relativity1--11. With recent technological developments, it is now possible to carry out such a loophole-free Bell test12--14,22. Here we present certified randomness obtained from a photonic Bell experiment and extract 1,024 random bits that are uniformly distributed to within 10−12. These random bits could not have been predicted according to any physical theory that prohibits faster-than-light (superluminal) signalling and that allows independent measurement choices. To certify and quantify the randomness, we describe a protocol that is optimized for devices that are characterized by a low per-trial violation of Bell inequalities. Future random-number generators based on loophole-free Bell tests may have a role in increasing the security and trust of our cryptographic systems and infrastructure.},

@article{Liu2021,
	abstract = {The ability to produce random numbers that are unknown to any outside party is crucial for many applications. Device-independent randomness generation1--4 does not require trusted devices and therefore provides strong guarantees of the security of the output, but it comes at the price of requiring the violation of a Bell inequality for implementation. A further challenge is to make the bounds in the security proofs tight enough to allow randomness expansion with contemporary technology. Although randomness has been generated in recent experiments5--9, the amount of randomness consumed in doing so has been too high to certify expansion based on existing theory. Here we present an experiment that demonstrates device-independent randomness expansion1--3,10--15. By developing a Bell test setup with a single-photon detection efficiency of around 84{\%} and by using a spot-checking protocol, we achieve a net gain of 2.57 ×108 certified bits with a soundness error of 3.09 ×10−12. The experiment ran for 19.2 h, which corresponds to an average rate of randomness generation of 13,527 bits per second. By developing the entropy accumulation theorem4,16,17, we establish security against quantum adversaries. We anticipate that this work will lead to further improvements that push device-independence towards commercial viability.},

@article{Shalm2021,
	abstract = {With the growing availability of experimental loophole-free Bell tests1--5, it has become possible to implement a new class of device-independent random number generators whose output can be certified6,7 to be uniformly random without requiring a detailed model of the quantum devices used8--10. However, all these experiments require many input bits to certify a small number of output bits, and it is an outstanding challenge to develop a system that generates more randomness than is consumed. Here we devise a device-independent spot-checking protocol that consumes only uniform bits without requiring any additional bits with a specific bias. Implemented with a photonic loophole-free Bell test, we can produce 24{\%} more certified output bits (1,181,264,237) than consumed input bits (953,301,640). The experiment ran for 91.0 h, creating randomness at an average rate of 3,606 bits s--1 with a soundness error bounded by 5.7 ×10−7 in the presence of classical side information. Our system allows for greater trust in public sources of randomness, such as randomness beacons11, and may one day enable high-quality private sources of randomness as the device footprint shrinks.},

Here we present a low-loss material platform based on high-refractive index silicon oxynitride (SiON), which offers significant characteristics for linear and non-linear optics applications in a wide range of red/near-infrared wavelengths. The demonstrated propagation loss \&lt;1.5 dB/cm for visible wavelengths enables the realization of long and intricate circuitry for photon manipulations, as well as the realization of high quality factor resonators. In addition, the proposed SiON shows a high nonlinear index of 10\&\#x2212;19 m2/W, improving the strength of nonlinear effects exploitable for on-chip photon generation schemes.},

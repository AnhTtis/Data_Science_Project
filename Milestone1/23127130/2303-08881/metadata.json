    "abstract": "This paper presents a parallel preconditioning approach based on incomplete LU (ILU) factorizations in the framework of Domain Decomposition (DD) for general sparse linear systems. We focus on distributed memory parallel architectures, specifically, those that are equipped with graphic processing units (GPUs). In addition to block Jacobi, we present general purpose two-level ILU Schur complement-based approaches, where different strategies are presented to solve the coarse-level reduced system. These strategies are combined with modified ILU methods in the construction of the coarse-level operator, in order to effectively remove smooth errors. We leverage available GPU-based sparse matrix kernels to accelerate the setup and the solve phases of the proposed ILU preconditioner. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods as a smoother for algebraic multigrid (AMG) and as a preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods, on challenging anisotropic diffusion problems and a collection of general sparse matrices.",

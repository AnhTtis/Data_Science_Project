    "abstract": "Propagation characteristics of the chirped dissipative solitary waves are investigated within the framework of higher order complex cubic quintic Ginzburg Landau equation. Potentially rich set of exact chirped dissipative pulses, such as, bright, dark, grey, antidark, kink, antikink are derived in the presence of the self steepening, self frequency shift and nonlinear gain/loss. The linear stability results are corroborated by the direct numerical simulations. The effect of the variation of model parameters on physical quantities like the speed, amplitude and chirping are explored.",

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) allows for infinitely large environments. However, the physical traversable space is always limited by real-world boundaries. This discrepancy between physical and virtual dimensions renders traditional locomotion methods used in real world unfeasible. To alleviate these limitations, research proposed various artificial locomotion concepts such as teleportation, treadmills, and redirected walking. However, these concepts occupy the user's hands, require complex hardware or large physical spaces. In this paper, we contribute nine VR locomotion concepts for foot-based locomotion, relying on the 3D position of the user's feet and the pressure applied to the sole as input modalities. We evaluate our concepts and compare them to state-of-the-art point {\&} teleport technique in a controlled experiment with 20 participants. The results confirm the viability of our approaches for foot-based and engaging locomotion. Further, based on the findings, we contribute a wireless hardware prototype implementation.},

Therminator concepts and example VR applications showing (a) a user during our experiment with a snow visual stimulus, (b) a cold game environment with a user throwing snowballs, (c) a warm tropical islands, and (d) a firefighting simulation with a user extinguishing flames. ABSTRACT Recent advances have made Virtual Reality (VR) more realistic than ever before. This improved realism is attributed to to-day's ability to increasingly appeal to human sensations, such as visual, auditory or tactile. While research also examines temperature sensation as an important aspect, the interdepen-dency of visual and thermal perception in VR is still underex-plored. In this paper, we propose Therminator, a thermal display concept that provides warm and cold on-body feedback in VR through heat conduction of flowing liquids with different temperatures. Further, we systematically evaluate the interdependency of different visual and thermal stimuli on the temperature perception of arm and abdomen with 25 participants. As part of the results, we found varying temperature perception depending on the stimuli, as well as increasing involvement of users during conditions with matching stimuli.},

While research proposes the usage of various tactile sensations, such as vibration or ultrasound approaches, the potential applicability of pressure feedback on the head is still under-explored. In this paper, we contribute concepts and design considerations for pressure-based feedback on the head through pneumatic actuation. As a proof-of-concept implementing our pressure-based haptics, we further present PneumoVolley: a VR experience similar to the classic Volleyball game but played with the head. In an exploratory user study with 9 participants, we evaluated our concepts and identified a significantly increased involvement compared to a no-haptics baseline along with high realism and enjoyment ratings using pressure-based feedback on the head in VR.

	abstract = {Figure 1: A user is teleporting herself in a Virtual Environment using the Curved Teleport. It allows her to teleport around an obstacle and graphically choose the orientation, which she wants to face after teleportation only by using the curved trajectory visualization with orientation indication, and without having to turn her body in the physical world. ABSTRACT Room-scale Virtual Reality (VR) systems have arrived in users' homes where tracked environments are set up in limited physical spaces. As most Virtual Environments (VEs) are larger than the tracked physical space, locomotion techniques are used to navigate in VEs. Currently, in recent VR games, point {\&} teleport is the most popular locomotion technique. However, it only allows users to select the position of the teleportation and not the orientation that the user is facing after the teleport. This results in users having to manually correct their orientation after teleporting and possibly getting entangled by the cable of the headset. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate three diferent point {\&} teleport techniques that enable users to specify the target orientation while teleporting. The results show that, although the three teleportation techniques with orientation indication increase the average teleportation time, they lead to a decreased need for correcting the orientation after teleportation.},

While being a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks: it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms like 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors, such as Microsoft's Kinect, aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known to be e.g. tiring. In this paper, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we explore the conceptual design space in an exploratory study. (2) Based upon these results, we investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of such an interface in a controlled experiment. And (3), we contribute PalmRC: an eyes-free, palm-surface-based TV remote control, which in turn is evaluated in an early user feedback session. Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less and eyes-free TV remote interaction without any third-party mediator device.},

	abstract = {Sharing and manipulating information are essential for collaborative work in meeting scenarios. Nowadays, people tend to bring their own devices as a result of increasing mobility possibilities. However, transferring data from one device to another can be cumbersome and tedious if restrictions like different platforms, form factors or environmental limitations apply. In this paper, we present two concepts to enrich interaction on and between devices through 3D printed customized tangibles: 1) Bring your own information, and 2) bring your own tools. For this, we enable interactivity for low-cost and passive tangible 3D printed objects by adding conductive material and make use of touch-enabled surfaces. Our system allows users to easily share digital contents across various devices and to manipulate them with individually designed tools without additional hardware required.

They are often sensed with accelerometers. In this paper, we propose to embed liquids into 3D printed objects while printing to sense various tilting and motion interactions via capacitive sensing. This method reduces the assembly effort after printing and is a low-cost and easy-to-apply way of extending the input capabilities of 3D printed objects. We contribute two liquid sensing patterns and a practical printing process using a standard dual-extrusion 3D printer and commercially available materials. We validate the method by a series of evaluations and provide a set of interactive example applications. {\textcopyright} 2016 Authors.},

With the recent advent of interactive tabletops, physical documents can now coexist with digital documents on the same surface. As a result, systems were developed and studied which allow piling of both types of documents with the physical documents being placed on top of the digital ones. In this paper, we study the concept of true hybrid stacking, allowing users to stack both types of documents in an arbitrary order using a hybrid tabletop system called StackTop. We discuss the results and derive implications for future hybrid tabletop systems with stacking support.},

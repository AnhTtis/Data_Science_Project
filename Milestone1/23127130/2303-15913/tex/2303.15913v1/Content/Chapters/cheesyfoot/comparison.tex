\section{Comparison of Interaction Techniques}
\label{sec:cheesyfoot:comparison}

This section compares the two techniques using two-way RM ANOVA with the interaction method as a between-subjects factor.


\subsection{Accuracy}

\textfig{cheesyfoot/tables/accuracy_compared}{Comparison of the \acp{EMM} of the accuracy rates for direct and indirect interfaces.}

As expected, the analysis found a significant effect of the interaction method on the accuracy with a large effect size (\anova{1}{32}{133.00}{<.001}{.386}). Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher accuracy rates for \direct{} (\emmSiCI{98.9}{1.4}{96.1}{100}{\%}) compared to \indirect{} (\emmSiCI{78.0}{1.4}{75.1}{80.8}{\%}) ($p<.001$). Figure \ref{fig:cheesyfoot/tables/accuracy_compared} depicts the \acp{EMM} for the individual factors.

\subsection{Task Completion Time}

\textfig{cheesyfoot/tables/tct_compared}{Comparison of the \acp{EMM} of the \acp{TCT} of direct and indirect interfaces.}

The analysis unveiled a significant effect of the interaction method on the \ac{TCT} with a large effect size (\anova{1}{32}{17.8}{<.001}{.220}). Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly lower \acp{TCT} for \direct{} (\emmSiCI{1.277}{.042}{.119}{.136}{s}) compared to \indirect{} (\emmSiCI{1.529}{.042}{1.44}{1.61}{s}) ($p<.001$). Figure \ref{fig:cheesyfoot/tables/tct_compared} depicts the \acp{EMM} for the individual factors.

\subsection{Size of Target Areas}

The analysis found a significant effect of the interaction method on the size of the target areas with a small effect size (\anova{1}{33}{19.7}{<.001}{.042}). Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly smaller areas for \direct{} (\emmSiCI{.019}{.006}{.007}{.031}{m^2}) compared to \indirect{} (\emmSiCI{.055}{.006}{.045}{.076}{m^2}) interactions ($p<.001$).

\subsection{TLX and Questionaire}

The analysis did not show significant effect of the interaction method on the raw TLX (\anova{1}{34}{.002}{>.05}{.00}). The analysis found a significant influence of the interaction method on the confidence (\anovaWithoutEffect{1}{34}{14.05}{<.001}). Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher ratings for \direct{} compared to \indirect{} ($p<.001$). The analysis could not find significant effects of the interaction method on the convenience (\anovaWithoutEffect{1}{34}{1.83}{>.05}) or on the willingness to use (\anovaWithoutEffect{1}{34}{1.53}{>.05}).

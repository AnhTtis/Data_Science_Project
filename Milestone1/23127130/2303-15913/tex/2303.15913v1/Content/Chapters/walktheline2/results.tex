\label{sec:walktheline:results}


The following section reports the results of the controlled experiment investigating the research questions RQ1 - RQ3. The analysis of the data was performed as described in section \ref{sec:rw:methodology}.

\subsection{Accuracy}

\colfig{walktheline/accuracy_small}{The measured accuracy rates in the controlled experiment. All error bars depict the standard error.}



The accuracy of participants was analyzed as the rate of successful trials. The analysis revealed that the \emph{number of lanes} had a significant (\anova{2}{34}{27.05}{<.001}{.134}) influence on the participants' accuracy with a medium effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significant differences between the \lane{8} (\emmP{85.8}{2.2}) and \lane{16} (\emmP{70.1}{2.2}) conditions as well as between the \lane{12} (\ac{EMM} \emmP{80.4}{2.2}) and \lane{16} conditions (both $p<.001$).

Further, the analysis showed a significant (\anovaCor{1.44}{24.45}{37.57}{<.001}{.719}{.307}) effect for the \emph{selection time} on the participants' accuracy with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significant differences between the \seltime{1} (\emmP{65.2}{2.4}) and both, the \seltime{2} (\emmP{88.5}{2.4}) and the \seltime{3} (\emmP{82.6}{2.4}) conditions (both $p<.001$).


Additionally, the analysis showed significant (\anovaCor{2.57}{43.74}{4.28}{<.05}{.643}{.033}) interaction effects between both factors with a small effect size.

In the experiment, the measurements showed accuracy rates ranging from \emmP{93.6}{3.1} (\lane{8}, \seltime{3}) to \emmP{58.9}{3.1} (\lane{16}, \seltime{1}). Table \ref{tab:walktheline/accuracy_table} lists the measured accuracy rates for the tested conditions, figure \ref{fig:walktheline/accuracy_small} depicts the mean values.

\subsection{Stabilizing Error}

\colfigH{walktheline/overshoot_small}{The measured stabilizing error rates in the controlled experiment. All error bars depict the standard error.}


The stabilizing error rate was calculated by counting the number of trials when participants left the target lane after initially reaching it. The analysis showed a significant (\anova{2}{34}{127.3}{<.001}{.45}) influence of the \emph{number of lanes} on the stabilizing error rate with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher stabilizing error rates for higher \emph{numbers of lanes} (and thus smaller lanes) between all levels (\lane{8}: \emmP{16.2}{3.5}, \lane{12}: \emmP{36.8}{3.5}, \lane{16}: \emmP{61.7}{3.5}, all $p<.001$). 

Further, the \emph{selection time} also proved to have an significant (\anova{2}{34}{67.07}{<.001}{.164}) influence on the stabilizing error rate in the experiment with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher stabilizing error rates for longer selection times between all levels (\seltime{1}: \emmP{24.3}{3.3}, \seltime{2}: \emmP{38.7}{3.3}, \seltime{3}: \emmP{51.8}{3.3}, all $p<.001$).

Lastly, the analysis also showed significant (\anova{4}{68}{6.73}{<.001}{.023}) interaction effects between both factors with a small effect size. 

The analysis found stabilizing error rates ranging from \emmP{7.8}{4.1} (\lane{8}, \seltime{1}) to \emmP{79.8}{4.1} (\lane{16}, \seltime{3}). Table \ref{tab:walktheline/overshoot_table} lists the measured accuracy rates for the tested conditions, figure \ref{fig:walktheline/overshoot_small} depicts the mean values.

\subsection{Task Completion Time}
\label{sec:walktheline:results:tct}

\colfig{walktheline/tct_small}{The measured task-completion times (in seconds) in the controlled experiment. All error bars depict the standard error.}


The \ac{TCT} was measured as the time to successful activation of a lane after subtracting the respective selection time to keep the \acp{TCT} comparable. The time was measured from the moment the target was displayed to the participant. The analysis only considered the \acp{TCT} of the successful trails, as the different accuracy rates would otherwise influence the results. 

The analysis showed a significant (\anova{2}{34}{117.8}{<.001}{.262}) influence of the \emph{number of lanes} on the \ac{TCT} with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed rising \acp{TCT} for higher numbers of lanes between all levels (\lane{8}: \emmSi{1.81}{.07}{s}, \lane{12}: \emmSi{2.11}{.07}{s}, \lane{16}: \emmSi{2.79}{.07}{s} all $p<.001$). 

Interestingly, despite subtracting of the selection time from the \ac{TCT}, the analysis also showed a significant (\anova{2}{34}{123.3}{<.001}{.413}) effect of the \emph{selection time} on the \ac{TCT} with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher \acp{TCT} for higher selection times between all levels (\seltime{1}: \emmSi{1.57}{.08}{s}, \seltime{2}: \emmSi{2.30}{.08}{s}, \seltime{3}: \emmSi{2.83}{.08}{s}, all $p<.001$). As depicted in figure \ref{fig:walktheline/tct_small}, the \acp{TCT} for the different selection times are close together for the \lane{8} conditions. For higher numbers of lanes, the \acp{TCT} grow faster for longer selection times.

Further, the analysis again showed significant (\anovaCor{2.71}{46.06}{25.3}{<.001}{.677}{.073}) interaction effects between the factors with a medium effect size.%

The graphical analysis of the \acp{TCT} showed strong visual correlations with the stabilizing error rates as presented above (see Figure \ref{fig:walktheline/overshoot_small} and \ref{fig:walktheline/tct_small}). Calculating Pearson's $r$ supported the visual impression by confirming a very strong~\ncite{Evans1996} correlation between \emph{stabilizing error rate} and \emph{\ac{TCT}} (\pearson{.925}{<.001}).

The analysis found \acp{TCT} ranging from \emmSi{1.41}{.10}{s} (\lane{8}, \seltime{1}) to \emmSi{3.71}{.08}{s} (\lane{16}, \seltime{3}). Table \ref{tab:walktheline/tct_table} and figure \ref{fig:walktheline/tct_small} depict the measured \acp{TCT} for all conditions.

\subsection{Walked Distance}


\colfig{walktheline/distance_small}{The measured distances to selection in the controlled experiment. All error bars depict the standard error.}

To take into account different walking speeds of the participants, the analysis assessed the walking distance necessary to activate a target. Similar to the \ac{TCT}, the analysis only considered the distance that was necessary to select a lane without the distance walked during the \factorTime~of the respective condition. Therefore, the system measured the distance the participants walked from the beginning of the task within the \ac{TCT} as defined above. %

The analysis showed a significant (\anovaCor{1.45}{24.65}{84.0}{<.001}{.725}{.159}) influence of the \emph{number of lanes} on the distance with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher distances for higher \emph{numbers of layers} between all levels (\lane{8}: \emmSi{2.06}{.18}{m}, \lane{12}: \emmSi{2.43}{.18}{m}, \lane{16}: \emmSi{3.11}{.18}{m} , all $p<.001$).

As for the \ac{TCT}, the analysis also showed a significant (\anovaCor{1.41}{23.89}{102.5}{<.001}{.703}{.263}) effect for the \emph{selection time} on the distance with a large effect size. Again, post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher distances for higher selection times between all levels (\seltime{1}: \emmSi{1.80}{.18}{m}, \seltime{2}: \emmSi{2.63}{.18}{m}, \seltime{3}: \emmSi{3.17}{.18}{m}, all $p<.001$).

Further, the analysis showed significant (\anovaCor{2.96}{50.32}{21.9}{<.001}{.74}{.042}) interaction effects between both factors with a small effect size. 

As for the \ac{TCT}, the visual analysis of the measured distances showed correlations with the stabilizing error rates (see Figure \ref{fig:walktheline/overshoot_small} and \ref{fig:walktheline/distance_small}). Again, calculating Pearson's $r$ supported the visual impression, confirming a strong correlation between the \emph{stabilizing error rate} and the needed \emph{distance} to walk (\pearson{.924}{<.001}).

The analysis found distances ranging from \emmSi{1.62}{.19}{m} (\lane{8}, \seltime{1}) to \emmSi{4.07}{.19}{m} (\lane{16}, \seltime{3}). Table \ref{tab:walktheline/distances_table} and figure \ref{fig:walktheline/distance_small} depicts the measured walking distances for all conditions in the experiment.

The results presented in this section can only provide an approximation to a potential lower limit of interaction distances. In an urban environment, environmental influences such as obstacles or road conditions can influence these results.

\subsection{TLX}

\colfig{walktheline/tlx_small}{The \acl{RTLX} measured in the controlled experiment. All error bars depict the standard error.}


To assess the differences in the mental load induced by the two factors, the analysis considered the influence of the factors on the \acf{RTLX}. The analysis showed a significant (\anovaCor{1.43}{24.36}{18.96}{<.001}{.716}{.104}) influence of the \emph{number of lanes} with a medium effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher values for the \lane{16} (\emm{43.9}{2.99}) conditions compared to both, the \lane{8} (\emm{29.4}{2.99}) and \lane{12} (\emm{33.7}{2.99}) conditions (both $p<.001$).

Further, the analysis showed a significant (\anovaCor{1.18}{20.01}{21.7}{<.001}{.588}{.182}) effect for the \emph{selection time} on the \ac{RTLX} with a large effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher values for the \seltime{1} (\emm{47.0}{3.16}) conditions compared to the \seltime{2} (\emm{29.1}{3.16}) and \seltime{3} (\emm{30.9}{3.16}) conditions (both $p<.001$).

Lastly, the analysis showed significant (\anova{4}{68}{3.12}{<.05}{.022}) interaction effects between the factors with a small effect size. 

The analysis found \ac{RTLX} values ranging from \emm{20.7}{3.8} (\lane{8}, \seltime{3}) to \emm{51.9}{3.8} (\lane{16}, \seltime{1}). Table \ref{tab:walktheline/tlx_table} and figure \ref{fig:walktheline/tlx_small} show the mean raw TLX values for the tested conditions.

\input{walktheline/tables/tlx}

\subsection{Height}

To assess the influence of the participants height and, thus, differences in step sizes, the analysis assessed the between subject effects of the \emph{height} on the independent variables. However, the analysis did not show any influence on the \emph{accuracy} (\anova{1}{16}{1.78}{>.05}{.031}), the stabilizing error (\anova{1}{16}{1.31}{>.05}{.041}), the \ac{TCT} (\anova{1}{16}{.09}{>.05}{.002}) nor on the distance (\anova{1}{16}{1.15}{>.05}{.053}).

\subsection{Location of the Target Lane}


The analysis assessed the effect of the location of the target lane by comparing the measurements grouped by \emph{outer} (i.e., lanes on the far left and right as well as the lanes next to the central \emph{zero-lane}) and \emph{inner} (i.e., all other lanes) target lanes.

The analysis showed a significant influence of the target location on the accuracy (\anova{1}{17}{35.95}{<.001}{.058}) with a small effect size. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher accuracy rates for outer (\emmP{85.0}{2.01}) compared to inner (\emmP{75.4}{2.01}) target lanes ($p<.001$).

Besides the accuracy, the analysis did not show any significant effects for the stabilizing error rate (\anova{1}{17}{3.49}{>.05}{.003}), the \ac{TCT} (\anova{1}{17}{2.43}{>.05}{.001}) nor the walked distance (\anova{1}{17}{1.92}{>.001}{.001}).

\subsection{Questionnaire}


After each condition, the participants filled a questionnaire asking questions regarding their experiences on a 5-point Likert-scale (1: strongly disagree, 5: strongly agree). The following section analyses the participants' answers.

\subsubsection{Confidence}

\textfigH{walktheline/likert_q1_diss}{The answers of the participants the \emph{Confidence} question in the questionnaire.}

The Likert questionnaire asked the participants about their \emph{confidence} to have successfully hit the target lanes in the condition. The analysis showed a significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{2}{34}{61.92}{<.001}) effect of the \emph{number of lanes} on the participants' confidence. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly lower approval for the \lane{16} conditions compared to the \lane{8} and \lane{12} conditions (both $p<.001$).

Additionally, the analysis showed a significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{2}{34}{16.67}{<.001}) effect for the \emph{selection time} on the participants' confidence. Post-hoc tests revealed significantly lower approval rates for the \seltime{1} conditions compared to the \seltime{2} and \seltime{3} conditions (both $p<.001$).

The analysis found significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{4}{68}{6.11}{<.01}) interaction effects. Figure \ref{fig:walktheline/likert_q1_diss} depicts all the answers of the participants.

\subsubsection{Convenience}

\textfigH{walktheline/likert_q2_diss}{The answers of the participants the \emph{convenience} question in the questionnaire.}

Further, the Likert questionnaire asked the participants if the combination of \emph{number of lanes} and \emph{selection time} was convenient to use. The analysis showed a significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{2}{34}{48.53}{<.001}) effect for the \emph{number of lanes} on the participants' ratings of the convenience. Post-hoc tests revealed significantly higher convenience ratings for \lane{8} and \lane{12} conditions compared to \lane{16} conditions (both $p<.001$).

Further, the analysis found a significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{2}{34}{11.47}{<.001}) influence of the \emph{selection time} on the ratings. Post-hoc tests confirmed significantly higher approval ratings for \seltime{2} ($p<.001$) and \seltime{3} ($p<01$) compared to \seltime{1} conditions.

The analysis found no interaction effects (\anovaWithoutEffect{4}{68}{0.16}{>.05}). Figure \ref{fig:walktheline/likert_q2_diss} depicts all the answers of the participants.

\subsubsection{Willingness to Use}

\textfigH{walktheline/likert_q3_diss}{The answers of the participants the \emph{Willingness to Use} question in the questionnaire.}

As a last question, the questionnaire asked the participants if they would like to use this combination of the \emph{number of lanes} and the \emph{selection time} for interacting with \acp{HMD}. The analysis showed a significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{2}{34}{28.13}{<.001}) influence of the \emph{number of lanes} on the participants' ratings. Post-hoc tests revealed significantly rising approval ratings for lower numbers of lanes between all levels ($p<.01$ comparing \lane{8} and \lane{12}, otherwise $p<.001$).

Further, the analysis unveiled a significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{2}{34}{17.86}{<.001}) influence of the \emph{selection time} on the ratings. Post-hoc tests showed significantly lower approval rates for \seltime{1} conditions compared to \seltime{2} and \seltime{3} conditions (both $p<.001$).

The analysis did not indicate any significant (\anovaWithoutEffect{4}{68}{1.59}{>.05}) interaction effects between the two factors. Figure \ref{fig:walktheline/likert_q2_diss} depicts all the answers of the participants.

\subsection{Qualitative Results}

In general, all participants showed strong approval for the idea of hands-free interaction with \acp{HMD} through walking. Asked for the reasons, participants told that it felt \pquote{fun}{8}, \pquote{novel}{15}, \pquote{fast}{12} and \pquote{convenient}{1,8}, and would be especially \pquote{helpful [...] while doing other things}{8}.

The participants noted that the \factorLanes{} had a strong influence on their experience. P14 summarized: \enquote{With many lanes it is frustrating. I have to concentrate a lot to accomplish that.} P8 added: \enquote{With the small lanes, it almost feels like I have to walk on a balance beam.} 

Concerning the \factorTime{}, the opinions of the participants diverged. While almost all participants agreed that \seltime{1} is \mpquote{too short}{P1, P2, P8, P13, P17}, both other selection times were equally popular. P7 explained the problem of identifying the \enquote{best} selection time: \enquote{It's complicated. With the thin lanes, I'm annoyed [...] by too much [selection] time because balancing is difficult. With the wide lanes, on the other hand, I find longer [selection] times easier.}

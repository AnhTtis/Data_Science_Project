\caption{Three example applications to illustrate the presented concepts. \emph{Assistant} (a) allows users to explore nearby services (e.g., coffee shops, hotels, restaurants) after walking on the assistant lane. \emph{\prototypeCamera} (b) allows users to take pictures, apply filters and share the results to social media platforms. \emph{Music Walker} (c) allows users to walk through the playlist and select songs by leaving the lane. Further, users can continuously change the volume by walking on the respective lane.}

	abstract = {A head-mounted display (HMD) immerses users in a virtual world, but separates them from outsiders in the real world. We present FrontFace, which is a novel HMD that combines an eye-tracker with a front-facing screen, to lower the communication barrier between HMD users and outsiders. The front-facing screen reveals user attention (e.g., the users eye motions) and user presence in the virtual or real world by displaying the scene in the virtual world or a skin background respectively, enabling eye-contact interactions between the HMD user and the outsiders. FrontFace has the following benefits. Firstly, it communicates the presence of the HMD user to outsiders; secondly, it reveals the player's visual attention by introducing the HMD users originally occluded eye motions, enabling outsiders to make sense of the HMD user's reaction in the virtual world or the real world. Three interactive techniques for the outsiders to initiate communication to HMD users are proposed: they are tap-trigger, hand-gesture trigger, and voice-trigger interactions. A small focus group provided feedback.},

Regarding the attention to these aspects, many studies have reported positive impact of Augmented Reality (AR) applications in primary, secondary and higher education in terms of student's motivation, learning gains, collaboration, interaction, learning attitudes and enjoyment, among others. However, very little has been done in terms of AR applications in VET as well as their impact on wide variety of student's special educational needs such as learning difficulties. This paper introduces a marker-based mobile AR application named Paint-cAR for supporting the learning process of repairing paint on a car in the context of a vocational education programme of car's maintenance. The application was developed using a methodology for developing mobile AR applications for educational purposes from a collaborative creation process (Co-Creation) and based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL). A cross-sectional evaluation study was conducted to validate the Paint-cAR application in a real scenario.},

Current VR systems focus mainly on increasing the immersion and enjoyment for the user wearing the HMD (HMD user), resulting in all the bystanders (Non-HMD users) being excluded from the experience. We propose ShareVR, a proof-of-concept prototype using floor projection and mobile displays in combination with positional tracking to visualize the virtual world for the Non-HMD user, enabling them to interact with the HMD user and become part of the VR experience. We designed and implemented ShareVR based on the insights of an initial online survey (n=48) with early adopters of VR HMDs. We ran a user study (n=16) comparing ShareVR to a baseline condition showing how the interaction using ShareVR led to an increase of enjoyment, presence and social interaction. In a last step we implemented several experiences for ShareVR, exploring its design space and giving insights for designers of co-located asymmetric VR experiences.},

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) appears a natural medium for three-dimensional computer supported collaborative work (CSCW). However the current trend in CSCW is to adapt the computer interface to work with the user's traditional tools, rather than separating the user from the real world as does immersive VR. One solution is through Augmented Reality, the overlaying of virtual objects on the real world. In this paper we describe the Shared Space concept -the application of Augmented Reality for three-dimensional CSCW. This combines the advantages of Virtual Reality with current CSCW approaches. We describe a collaborative experiment based on this concept and present preliminary results which show that this approach may be better for some applications. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Ltd.},

Co-located collaboration researchers exploring alternatives to traditional "desktop" computers are beginning to exploit the benefits that this familiar environment appears to have for facilitating social interactions. Studies of tabletop collaboration involving traditional media (e.g., paper and pens) show collaborators often partition the tabletop workspace into various areas (e.g., personal and group). Just as partitioning of our physical spaces helps to maintain social order, such territorial behaviour on a tabletop workspace appears to be an important mechanism for organizing collaborative activities. This research further investigates tabletop territoriality, through new observational studies, as well as development of territory-based interaction techniques for tabletop collaboration. Initial results from these observational studies are presented, along with a proposed test-bed environment for exploring territory-based interaction techniques.},

Our hypothesis is that given continuous feedback, users can learn to control pupil size via physical and psychological self-regulation. We test it by measuring the magnitude of self evoked pupil size changes following seven different instructions, while providing real time graphical feedback on pupil size. Results show that some types of voluntary effort affect pupil size on a statistically significant level. A second controlled experiment confirms that subjects can produce pupil dilation and construction on demand during paced tasks.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Healthcare institutions worldwide are moving to electronic health records (EHRs). These transitions are particularly numerous in the US where healthcare systems are purchasing and implementing commercial EHRs to fulfill federal requirements. Despite the central role of EHRs to workflow, the cognitive impact of these transitions on the workforce has not been widely studied. This study assesses the changes in cognitive workload among pediatric nurses during data entry and retrieval tasks during transition from a hybrid electronic and paper information system to a commercial EHR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Baseline demographics and computer attitude and skills scores were obtained from 74 pediatric nurses in two wards. They also completed an established and validated instrument, the NASA-TLX, that is designed to measure cognitive workload; this instrument was used to evaluate cognitive workload of data entry and retrieval. The NASA-TLX was administered at baseline (pre-implementation), 1, 5 and 10 shifts and 4 months post-implementation of the new EHR. RESULTS Most nurse participants experienced significant increases of cognitive workload at 1 and 5 shifts after "go-live". These increases abated at differing rates predicted by participants' computer attitudes scores (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS There is substantially increased cognitive workload for nurses during the early phases (1-5 shifts) of EHR transitions. Health systems should anticipate variability across workers adapting to "meaningful use" EHRs. "One-size-fits-all" training strategies may not be suitable and longer periods of technical support may be necessary for some workers.},

	abstract = {Second edition. Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction is a comprehensive guide to performing research and is essential reading for both quantitative and qualitative methods. Since the first edition was published in 2009, the book has been adopted for use at leading universities around the world, including Harvard University, Carnegie-Mellon University, the University of Washington, the University of Toronto, HiOA (Norway), KTH (Sweden), Tel Aviv University (Israel), and many others. Chapters cover a broad range of topics relevant to the collection and analysis of HCI data, going beyond experimental design and surveys, to cover ethnography, diaries, physiological measurements, case studies, crowdsourcing, and other essential elements in the well-informed HCI researcher's toolkit. Continual technological evolution has led to an explosion of new techniques and a need for this updated 2nd edition, to reflect the most recent research in the field and newer trends in research methodology. This revision contains updates throughout, including more detail on statistical tests, coding qualitative data, and data collection via mobile devices and sensors. Other new material covers performing research with children, older adults, and people with cognitive impairments.

	abstract = {The advent of inexpensive consumer virtual reality equipment enables many more researchers to study perception with naturally moving observers. One such system, the HTC Vive, offers a large field-of-view, high-resolution head mounted display together with a room-scale tracking system for less than a thousand U.S. dollars. If the position and orientation tracking of this system is of sufficient accuracy and precision, it could be suitable for much research that is currently done with far more expensive systems. Here we present a quantitative test of the HTC Vive's position and orientation tracking as well as its end-to-end system latency. We report that while the precision of the Vive's tracking measurements is high and its system latency (22 ms) is low, its position and orientation measurements are provided in a coordinate system that is tilted with respect to the physical ground plane. Because large changes in offset were found whenever tracking was briefly lost, it cannot be corrected for with a one-time calibration procedure. We conclude that the varying offset between the virtual and the physical tracking space makes the HTC Vive at present unsuitable for scientific experiments that require accurate visual stimulation of self-motion through a virtual world. It may however be suited for other experiments that do not have this requirement.},

Six muscles in the right thumb and forearm were targeted in this study, namely adductor pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor pollicis longus, first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and extensor digitorum. The performance measures showed that the thumb developed fatigue rapidly when tapping on smaller buttons (diameter: 9 mm compared with 3 mm), and moved more slowly in flexion–extension than in adduction–abduction orientation. Meanwhile, the electromyography and perceived exertion values of FDI significantly increased in small button and flexion–extension tasks, while those of APB were greater in the adduction–abduction task. This study reveals that muscle effort among thumb muscles on a touch screen smartphone varies according to the task, and suggests that the use of small touch buttons should be minimised for better thumb pe...},

Rather than contributing a specific set of gestures, we contribute a set of gesture types, which together make a set of the core actions needed to complete any of our six chosen tasks in the domain of human-to-human gestural communication without the speech channel. We observed 12 participants, cooperating to accomplish different tasks only using hand gestures to communicate. We analyzed 5,500 gestures in terms of hand usage and gesture type, using a novel classification scheme which combines three existing taxonomies in order to better capture this interaction space. Our findings indicate that, depending on the meaning of the gesture, there is preference in the usage of gesture types, such as pointing, pantomimic acting, direct manipulation, semaphoric, or iconic gestures. These results can be used as guidelines to design purely gesture driven interfaces for interactive environments and surfaces.},

	abstract = {The use of 3D computer graphics is important in a very wide range of applications. However, user interaction with 3D applications is still challenging and often does not lend itself to established techniques that have been developed primarily for 2D desktop interaction. Meanwhile, 3D user interfaces that rely on tracking hand-held devices or fiducial markers attached to the user are cumbersome or entirely inappropriate in some situations. These challenges may be addressed by refining and building on the increasing use of freehand gestural input, i.e. without markers or hand-held devices, to extend the fluidity and immediacy of today's 2D touch-based interactions. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of freehand gestural 3D interaction, and report a set of 3 related evaluation studies focused on the fundamental user interface task of object selection. We found that interaction design requiring a high accuracy single action are not appropriate for freehand gestural selection, while separating it into several connected low demand operations could be a potential solution; that our Reach technique is accurate and potentially useful for option selection tasks with freehand gesture; and that strong directional effects influence performance and usability of both 2D and 3D option selection. We propose guidelines for designers of 3D freehand gestural interaction based on our evaluation results.},

	abstract = {Although familiar to each of us, the sensation of inhabiting a body is ineffable. Traditional senses like vision and hearing monitor the external environment, allowing humans to have shared sensory experiences. But proprioception, the sensation of body position and movement, is fundamentally personal and typically absent from conscious perception. Nonetheless, this ‘sixth sense' remains critical to human experience, a fact that is most apparent when one considers those who have lost it. Take, for example, the case of Ian Waterman who, at the age of 19, suffered a rare autoimmune response to a flu infection that attacked the sensory neurons from his neck down. This infection deprived him of the sense of position, movement and touch in his body. With this loss of feedback came a complete inability to coordinate his movements. While he could compel his muscles to contract, he lost the ability to orchestrate these actions into purposeful behaviors, in essence leaving him immobile, unable to stand, walk, or use his body to interact with the world. Only after years of dedicated training was he able to re-learn to move his body entirely under visual control.},

@article{Lu2012,
	abstract = {All life forms on earth, including humans, are constantly subjected to the universal force of gravitation, and thus to forces from within and surrounding the body. Through the study of the interaction of these forces and their effects, the form, function and motion of our bodies can be examined and the resulting knowledge applied to promote quality of life. Under gravity and other loads, and controlled by the nervous system, human movement is achieved through a complex and highly coordinated mechanical interaction between bones, muscles, ligaments and joints within the musculoskeletal system. Any injury to, or lesion in, any of the individual elements of the musculoskeletal system will change the mechanical interaction and cause degradation, instability or disability of movement. On the other hand, proper modification, manipulation and control of the mechanical environment can help prevent injury, correct abnormality, and speed healing and rehabilitation. Therefore, understanding the biomechanics and loading of each element during movement using motion analysis is helpful for studying disease etiology, making decisions about treatment, and evaluating treatment effects. In this article, the history and methodology of human movement biomechanics, and the theoretical and experimental methods developed for the study of human movement, are reviewed. Examples of motion analysis of various patient groups, prostheses and orthoses, and sports and exercises, are used to demonstrate the use of biomechanical and stereophotogrammetry-based human motion analysis studies to address clinical issues. It is suggested that further study of the biomechanics of human movement and its clinical applications will benefit from the integration of existing engineering techniques and the continuing development of new technology.},

@article{Heo2017,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Canadian Information Processing Society. All rights reserved. Smartwatches have the potential to enable quick micro-interactions throughout daily life. However, because they require both hands to operate, their full potential is constrained, particularly in situations where the user is actively performing a task with their hands. We investigate the space of no-handed interaction with smartwatches in scenarios where one or both hands are not free. Specifically, we present a taxonomy of scenarios in which standard touchscreen interaction with smartwatches is not possible, and discuss the key constraints that limit such interaction. We then implement a set of interaction techniques and evaluate them via two user studies: one where participants viewed video clips of the techniques and another where participants used the techniques in simulated handconstrained scenarios. Our results found a preference for foot-based interaction and reveal novel design considerations to be mindful of when designing for no-handed smartwatch interaction scenarios.},

@article{Frohlich1993,
	abstract = {Abstract The earliest interactive computer systems were based on a conversational mode of interaction in which user and computer communicated through the exchange of linguistic utterances. Since the advent of ‘direct manipulation' technology there has been a tendency to develop and promote an alternative mode of interaction, based on the user's manipulation of computer-displayed objects. This paper reviews recent developments in the implementation and understanding of direct manipulation interfaces. These point to various limitations in manipulative interaction which might be overcome through the selective reintroduction of conversational interaction. A new philosophy of graceful interaction is suggested to accommodate these developments in which directness is said to be a property of both action and language based systems. A number of practical guidelines are offered to reduce the incidence of clumsy manipulation.},

To inform design decisions of how to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the users' point of view, an online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone VAPA such as Apple's Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private vs. public) and type of information (private vs. nonprivate). Responses from participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than nonprivate information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and th...},

E2E models, however, present numerous challenges: In order to be truly useful, such models must decode speech utterances in a streaming fashion, in real time; they must be robust to the long tail of use cases; they must be able to leverage user-specific context (e.g., contact lists); and above all, they must be extremely accurate. In this work, we describe our efforts at building an E2E speech recognizer using a recurrent neural network transducer. In experimental evaluations, we find that the proposed approach can outperform a conventional CTC-based model in terms of both latency and accuracy in a number of evaluation categories.},

Only a few AR-systems currently exist which are using stereo-vision techniques to estimate the viewing pose. The presented system uses binocular images and retroreflective markers in order to speed up the tracking process and make it more precise and robust. The camera calibration as well as the pose estimation technique is presented. This new optical tracking system, which is based on standard PC hardware, is even suitable to make it portable. In addition, the system is evaluated with regard to its pixel accuracy and depth measurements. This paper shows that the computer vision techniques, which will be presented, are a good choice in order to create a flexible, accurate and easy to use tracking system.},

This paper presents a top-down classification of tracking technologies aimed more specifically at head tracking, organized in accordance with their physical principles of operation. Six main principles were identified: time of flight (TOF), spatial scan, inertial sensing, mechanical linkages, phase-difference sensing, and direct-field sensing. We briefly describe each physical principle and present implementations of that principle. Advantages and limitations of these implementations are discussed and summarized in tabular form. A few hybrid technologies are then presented and general considerations of tracking technology are discussed. 1},

The aim of this thorough, accessible exploration is to help you take advantage of this moment, equipping you with the understanding needed to identify and prepare for ways VR can be used in your field, whatever your field may be. By approaching VR as a communications medium, the authors have created a resource that will remain relevant even as the underlying technologies evolve. You get a history of VR, along with a good look at systems currently in use. However, the focus remains squarely on the application of VR and the many issues that arise in the application design and implementation, including hardware requirements, system integration, interaction techniques, and usability. This book also counters both exaggerated claims for VR and the view that would reduce it to entertainment, citing dozens of real-world examples from many different fields and presenting (in a series of appendices) four in-depth application case studies. * Substantive, illuminating coverage designed for technical and business readers and well-suited to the classroom. * Examines VR's constituent technologies, drawn from visualization, representation, graphics, human-computer interaction, and other fields, and explains how they are being united in cohesive VR systems. * Via a companion Web site, provides additional case studies, tutorials, instructional materials, and a link to an open-source VR programming system.},

The aim of this approach is to exploit human sensorimotor ability to learn how to operate a humanoid robot in real time to perform tasks involving interaction with the environment. The human skill is then used to design a controller to autonomously control the robot. To provide the demonstrator with the robot's state suitable for the full-body motion control, we developed a novel method that transforms robot's sensory readings into feedback appropriate for the human. This method was implemented through a haptic interface that was designed to exert forces on the demonstrator's centre of mass corresponding to the state of the robot's centre of mass. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we performed an experiment where the human demonstrator taught the robot how to compliantly interact with another human.

	abstract = {Real-time video acquisition is becoming a reality with the most recent camera technology. Three-dimensional models can be reconstructed from multiple views using visual hull carving techniques. However the combination of these approaches to obtain a moving 3D model from simultaneous video captures remains a technological challenge. In this paper we demonstrate a complete system architecture allowing the real-time (≥ 30 fps) acquisition and full-body reconstruction of one or several actors, which can then be integrated in a virtual environment. A volume of approximately 2m3 is observed with (at least) four video cameras and the video fluxes are processed to obtain a volumetric model of the moving actors. The reconstruction process uses a mixture of pipelined and parallel processing, using N individual PCs for N cameras and a central computer for integration, reconstruction and display. A surface description is obtained using a marching cubes algorithm. We discuss the overall architecture choices, with particular emphasis on the real-time constraint and latency issues, and demonstrate that a software synchronization of the video fluxes is both sufficient and efficient. The ability to reconstruct a full-body model of the actors and any additional props or elements opens the way for very natural interaction techniques using the entire body and real elements manipulated by the user, whose avatar is immersed in a virtual world.},

The virtual human co-exercises along with the user, leading as well as following in tempo, to motivate the user and to influence the speed with which the user performs the exercises. In a series of three experiments (20 participants in total) we attempted to influence the users' performance by manipulating the (timing of the) exercise behavior of the virtual trainer. The results show that it is possible to do this implicitly, using only micro adjustments to its bodily behavior. As such, the system is a rst step in the direction of mutually coordinated bodily interaction for virtual humans.},

	abstract = {Human motion recognition is one of the most important branches of human-centered research activities. In recent years, motion recognition based on RGB-D data has attracted much attention. Along with the development in artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have gained remarkable success in computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success for image-based tasks, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are renowned for sequence-based problems. Specifically, deep learning methods based on the CNN and RNN architectures have been adopted for motion recognition using RGB-D data. In this paper, a detailed overview of recent advances in RGB-D-based motion recognition is presented. The reviewed methods are broadly categorized into four groups, depending on the modality adopted for recognition: RGB-based, depth-based, skeleton-based and RGB+D-based. As a survey focused on the application of deep learning to RGB-D-based motion recognition, we explicitly discuss the advantages and limitations of existing techniques. Particularly, we highlighted the methods of encoding spatial-temporal-structural information inherent in video sequence, and discuss potential directions for future research.},

@article{Corazza2006,
	abstract = {Human motion capture is frequently used to study musculoskeletal biomechanics and clinical problems, as well as to provide realistic animation for the entertainment industry. The most popular technique for human motion capture uses markers placed on the skin, despite some important drawbacks including the impediment to the motion by the presence of skin markers and relative movement between the skin where the markers are placed and the underlying bone. The latter makes it difficult to estimate the motion of the underlying bone, which is the variable of interest for biomechanical and clinical applications. A model-based markerless motion capture system is presented in this study, which does not require the placement of any markers on the subject's body. The described method is based on visual hull reconstruction and an a priori model of the subject. A custom version of adapted fast simulated annealing has been developed to match the model to the visual hull. The tracking capability and a quantitative validation of the method were evaluated in a virtual environment for a complete gait cycle. The obtained mean errors, for an entire gait cycle, for knee and hip flexion are respectively 1.5 degrees (+/-3.9 degrees ) and 2.0 degrees (+/-3.0 degrees ), while for knee and hip adduction they are respectively 2.0 degrees (+/-2.3 degrees ) and 1.1 degrees (+/-1.7 degrees ). Results for the ankle and shoulder joints are also presented. Experimental results captured in a gait laboratory with a real subject are also shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the presented method in a clinical environment.},

	abstract = {As we move towards the close of the millennium, it is perhaps not surprising that we take the "long view" and attempt to find, in the history of HCI, clues to its future. In that vein, this article focuses on the theoretical and foundational underpinnings of interactive system design and development. Drawing upon recent trends in interactive systems research, it proposes "embodiment" as the basis for a new foundational approach to HCI. Embodiment reflects both a physical presence in the world and a social embedding in a web of practices and purposes. After a review of the role that embodiment has played in philosophies of presence and action through the twentieth century, the outline of a new foundation for the design and analysis of interactive systems is presented. 1 INTRODUCTION Millennial fever is upon us. Against a background of debates over when the new millennium actually starts, discussions are held in the media and over dinner about how the progress of the last thousand years can be projected into the next. Lists are drawn up of the most important human contributions of the last thousand years. What was the most powerful idea? The most noteworthy invention? The most significant discovery? What does the future hold, and how will we chart a course through it? On reflection, it is perhaps not surprising that academic circles should host the same sorts of discussions. On the other hand, this poses a serious problem for HCI. Computer Science, as a discipline, is scarcely sixty years old; HCI, perhaps, thirty. It is hard to hold up the mouse as the most significant invention of the millennium when its competition includes the longbow, anaesthesia, the telescope and the scientific method. We have similar problems when trying to predict the future course of events. It doesn't take a statistician to see that thirty years of data does not support extrap-olation to one thousand. However, all is not lost; it rarely is. This issue contains a variety of assessments of the state of HCI as we approach the new millennium, and predictions of how we might make the transition. This article is such an exploration: an attempt to synthesise some recent developments in the HCI research and to project them into future directions. Since the tone of this issue is more reflective, however,},

@article{Maqueda2015,
	abstract = {A more natural, intuitive, user-friendly, and less intrusive Human–Computer interface for controlling an application by executing hand gestures is presented. For this purpose, a robust vision-based hand-gesture recognition system has been developed, and a new database has been created to test it. The system is divided into three stages: detection, tracking, and recognition. The detection stage searches in every frame of a video sequence potential hand poses using a binary Support Vector Machine classifier and Local Binary Patterns as feature vectors. These detections are employed as input of a tracker to generate a spatio-temporal trajectory of hand poses. Finally, the recognition stage segments a spatio-temporal volume of data using the obtained trajectories, and compute a video descriptor called Volumetric Spatiograms of Local Binary Patterns (VS-LBP), which is delivered to a bank of SVM classifiers to perform the gesture recognition. The VS-LBP is a novel video descriptor that constitutes one of the most important contributions of the paper, which is able to provide much richer spatio-temporal information than other existing approaches in the state of the art with a manageable computational cost. Excellent results have been obtained outperforming other approaches of the state of the art.},

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction"an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationalityreflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a sidewalk pavement width design method for making more pedestrian friendly and walk-inspiring sidewalk pavements in the urban area. Instead of using the current sidewalk pavement width design standard that usually leads to having minimum values, this research investigated pedestrians' preferences on the levels of service, surveyed actual foot path trajectories in the sidewalk pavements, and observed pedestrian movement characteristics in the streets. Further, these investigation results were summarized to propose a new urban sidewalk pavement width determination procedure. The proposed procedure was applied in a case study site in Seoul, and its application resulted in a much higher pedestrian level of service. It is anticipated that the proposed method should be of service in both planning and retrofitting urban streets to make more pedestrian sensitive street designs.

@article{Sedighi2018,
	abstract = {The need to complete multiple tasks concurrently is a common occurrence both daily life and in occupational activities, which can often include simultaneous cognitive and physical demands. As one example, there is increasing availability of head-worn display technologies that can be employed when a user is mobile (e.g., while walking). This new method of information presentation may, however, introduce risks of adverse outcomes such as a decrement to gait performance. The goal of this study was thus to quantify the effects of a head-worn display (i.e., smart glasses) on motor variability during gait and to compare these effects with those of other common information displays (i.e., smartphone and paper-based system). Twenty participants completed four walking conditions, as a single task and in three dual-task conditions (three information displays). In the dual-task conditions, the information display was used to present several cognitive tasks. Three different measures were used to quantify variability in gait parameters for each walking condition (using the cycle-to-cycle standard deviation, sample entropy, and the “goal-equivalent manifold” approach). Our results indicated that participants used less adaptable gait strategies in dual-task walking using the paper-based system and smartphone conditions compared with single-task walking. Gait performance, however, was less affected during dual-task walking with the smart glasses. We conclude that the risk of an adverse gait event (e.g., a fall) in head-down walking conditions (i.e., the paper-based system and smartphone conditions) were higher than in single-task walking, and that head-worn displays might help reduce the risk of such events during dual-task gait conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper contributes results from an empirical study of on-skin input, an emerging technique for controlling mobile devices. Skin is fundamentally different from off-body touch surfaces, opening up a new and largely unexplored interaction space. We investigate characteristics of the various skin-specific input modalities, analyze what kinds of gestures are performed on skin, and study what are preferred input locations. Our main findings show that (1) users intuitively leverage the properties of skin for a wide range of more expressive commands than on conventional touch surfaces; (2) established multi-touch gestures can be transferred to on-skin input; (3) physically uncomfortable modalities are deliberately used for irreversible commands and expressing negative emotions; and (4) the forearm and the hand are the most preferred locations on the upper limb for on-skin input. We detail on users' mental models and contribute a first consolidated set of on-skin gestures. Our findings provide guidance for developers of future sensors as well as for designers of future applications of on-skin input.},

	abstract = {In everyday life, people use their mobile phones on-the-go with different walking speeds and with different touch input techniques. Unfortunately, much of the published research in mobile interaction does not quantify the influence of these variables. In this article, we analyze the influence of walking speed, gait pattern, and input techniques on commonly used performance parameters like error rate, accuracy, and tapping speed, and we compare the results to the static condition. We examine the influence of these factors on the machine learned offset model used to correct user input, and we make design recommendations. The results show that all performance parameters degraded when the subject started to move, for all input techniques. Index finger pointing techniques demonstrated overall better performance compared to thumb-pointing techniques. The influence of gait phase on tap event likelihood and accuracy was demonstrated for all input techniques and all walking speeds. Finally, it was shown that the o...},

	abstract = {Computer graphics applications controlled through natural gestures are gaining increasing popularity these days due to recent developments in low-cost tracking systems and gesture recognition technologies. Although interaction techniques through natural gestures have already demonstrated their benefits in manipulation, navigation and avatar-control tasks, effective selection with pointing gestures remains an open problem. In this paper we survey the state-of-the-art in 3D object selection techniques. We review important findings in human control models, analyze major factors influencing selection performance, and classify existing techniques according to a number of criteria. Unlike other components of the application's user interface, pointing techniques need a close coupling with the rendering pipeline, introducing new elements to be drawn, and potentially modifying the object layout and the way the scene is rendered. Conversely, selection performance is affected by rendering issues such as visual feedback, depth perception, and occlusion management. We thus review existing literature paying special attention to those aspects in the boundary between computer graphics and human–computer interaction.},

	abstract = {There are concerns about the safety of texting while walking. Although evidence of negative effects of mobile phone use on gait is scarce, cognitive distraction, altered mechanical demands, and the reduced visual field associated with texting are likely to have an impact. In 26 healthy individuals we examined the effect of mobile phone use on gait. Individuals walked at a comfortable pace in a straight line over a distance of ∼8.5 m while; 1) walking without the use of a phone, 2) reading text on a mobile phone, or 3) typing text on a mobile phone. Gait performance was evaluated using a three-dimensional movement analysis system. In comparison with normal waking, when participants read or wrote text messages they walked with: greater absolute lateral foot position from one stride to the next; slower speed; greater rotation range of motion (ROM) of the head with respect to global space; the head held in a flexed position; more in-phase motion of the thorax and head in all planes, less motion between thorax and head (neck ROM); and more tightly organized coordination in lateral flexion and rotation directions. While writing text, participants walked slower, deviated more from a straight line and used less neck ROM than reading text. Although the arms and head moved with the thorax to reduce relative motion of the phone and facilitate reading and texting, movement of the head in global space increased and this could negatively impact the balance system. Texting, and to a lesser extent reading, modify gait performance. Texting or reading on a mobile phone may pose an additional risk to safety for pedestrians navigating obstacles or crossing the road.},

@article{Lin2017a,
	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that using a cell phone to talk or text while walking changes gait kinematics and encourages risky street-crossing behaviors. However, less is known about how the motor-cognitive interference imposed by smartphone tasks affects pedestrians' situational awareness to environmental targets relevant to pedestrian safety. This study systematically investigated the influence of smartphone use on detection of and responses to a variety of roadside events in a semi-virtual walking environment. Twenty-four healthy participants completed six treadmill walking sessions while engaged in a concurrent picture-dragging, texting, or news-reading task. During distracted walking, they were required to simultaneously monitor the occurrence of road events for two different levels of event frequency. Performance measures for smartphone tasks and event responses, eye movements, and perceived workload and situational awareness were compared across different dual-task conditions. The results revealed that during dual-task walking, the reading app was associated with a significantly higher level of perceived workload, and impaired awareness of the surrounding environment to a greater extent compared with the texting or picture-dragging apps. Pedestrians took longer to visually detect the roadside events in the reading and texting conditions than in the dragging condition. Differences in event response performances were mainly dependent on their salient features but were also affected by the type of smartphone task. Texting was found to make participants more reliant on their central vision to detect road events. Moreover, different gaze-scanning patterns were adopted by participants to better protect dual-task performance in response to the changes in road-event frequency. The findings of relationships between workload, dual-task performances, and allocation strategies for visual attention further our understanding of pedestrian behavior and safety. By knowing how attentional and motor demands involved in different smartphone tasks affect pedestrians' awareness to critical roadside events, effective awareness campaigns might be devised to discourage smartphone use while walking.},

@article{Thompson2013,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES The objective of the present work was to study the impact of technological and social distraction on cautionary behaviours and crossing times in pedestrians. METHODS Pedestrians were observed at 20 high-risk intersections during 1 of 3 randomly assigned time windows in 2012. Observers recorded demographic and behavioural information, including use of a mobile device (talking on the phone, text messaging, or listening to music). We examined the association between distraction and crossing behaviours, adjusting for age and gender. All multivariate analyses were conducted with random effect logistic regression (binary outcomes) and random effect linear regression (continuous outcomes), accounting for clustering by site. RESULTS Observers recorded crossing behaviours for 1102 pedestrians. Nearly one-third (29.8{\%}) of all pedestrians performed a distracting activity while crossing. Distractions included listening to music (11.2{\%}), text messaging (7.3{\%}) and using a handheld phone (6.2{\%}). Text messaging, mobile phone use and talking with a companion increased crossing time. Texting pedestrians took 1.87 additional seconds (18.0{\%}) to cross the average intersection (3.4 lanes), compared to undistracted pedestrians. Texting pedestrians were 3.9 times more likely than undistracted pedestrians to display at least 1 unsafe crossing behaviour (disobeying the lights, crossing mid-intersection, or failing to look both ways). Pedestrians listening to music walked more than half a second (0.54) faster across the average intersection than undistracted pedestrians. CONCLUSIONS Distracting activity is common among pedestrians, even while crossing intersections. Technological and social distractions increase crossing times, with text messaging associated with the highest risk. Our findings suggest the need for intervention studies to reduce risk of pedestrian injury.},

	abstract = {There is an annually increasing trend in the number of people who must be taken to a hospital by ambulance following an accident related to smartphone use while walking, making this practice a significant social issue. In recent years, location information games using augmented reality have grown in popularity around the world, and so the risk of collisions or accidents arising from smartphone use while walking is increasing. For the present study, we focused on changes in the behavior of those who walk while using a smartphone to quantitatively verify the increased risk of collision, and conducted walking experiments using an eye mark recorder and an accelerometer. We first looked at the movement of the walkers' point of visual focus, and found that those who walk while web browsing or texting visually confirm the path ahead only about 30{\%} of their total walking time, and that for the visual field, their lateral range in particular was greatly decreased. Further, this tendency did not change with increases or decreases in pedestrian traffic, which revealed that those who walk while using a smartphone do not adjust their level of forward visual confirmation regardless of changes in pedestrian traffic density. Next, analyses were conducted of walkers' avoidance and speed reducing behaviors. It was found that, as pedestrian traffic density increased, a greater acceleration was seen in the lateral and forward directions. It was clarified that, particularly when walking while texting, accelerations in the lateral direction and forward direction at 0.2 persons/m 2 were 1.6 times and roughly twice as high respectively than acceleration at 0.0 persons/m 2 .},

	abstract = {The Head Mounted Projection Display (HMPD) is a growing interest area in HCI. Although various aspects of HMPDs have been investigated, there is not enough information regarding the effect of HMPDs (i.e., head referenced static and dynamic displays while a user is in motion and standing) on visual attentional performance. For this purpose, we conducted a user study (N=18) with three experimental conditions (control, standing, walking) and two visual perceptual tasks (with dynamic and static displays). Significant differences between conditions were only found for the task with dynamic display; accuracy was lower in walking condition compared to the other two conditions. Our work contributes an empirical investigation of the effect of HMPDs on visual attentional performance by providing data-driven benchmarks for developing graphical user interface design guidelines for HMPDs.},

@article{Lim2015,
	abstract = {Dual-task interference caused by mobile phone use while walking increases safety risks by increasing attentional and cognitive demands. Situational awareness, important for control of walking and safety, has been examined previously but measured only by the awareness of visually noteworthy objects in the environment or the number of times the person looked up from the phone. This study systematically investigated the effects of texting on situational awareness to different environments and its consequent impact on gait kinematics. Twenty healthy volunteers walked on a treadmill while texting and attending to visual tasks simultaneously. Gait parameters and situational awareness examined under dual-task conditions (walk and text or walk, text, and visual task) were compared with those of single-task conditions (text, walk or visual task only). The size of the visual field, display duration of the visual cue, and visual acuity demand were varied across the visual task conditions. About half of the visual cues provided during walking and texting were not perceived (48.3{\%}) as compared to the visual task only condition. The magnitude of this loss of situational awareness was dependent upon the nature of visual information provided. While gait parameters were not different among visual task conditions, greater total medial–lateral excursion of the pelvis was observed in the walk and text condition compared to the walk only condition, showing the dual-task effects of texting on gait kinematics. The study provides further evidence of dual-task effects of texting on situational awareness as well as gait kinematics.},

	abstract = {Research shows that pedestrians, similar to drivers, experience reduced situation awareness, distracted attention and unsafe behavior when talking or texting on their mobile phones. The present study centered on injuries related to mobile phone use among pedestrians. It used data from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission on injuries in hospital emergency rooms from 2004 through 2010. It found that mobile-phone related injuries among pedestrians increased relative to total pedestrian injuries, and paralleled the increase in injuries for drivers, and in 2010 exceeded those for drivers. Pedestrian injuries related to mobile-phone use were higher for males and for people under 31 years old. Using a mobile phone while walking puts pedestrians at risk of accident, injury or death.},

@article{Agostini2015,
	abstract = {Texting on a smartphone while walking has become a customary task among young adults. In recent literature many safety concerns on distracted walking have been raised. It is often hypothesized that the allocation of attentional resources toward a secondary task can influence dynamic stability. In the double task of walking and texting it was found that gait speed is reduced, but there is scarce evidence of a modified motor control strategy compromising stability. The aim of this study is twofold: 1) to comprehensively examine the gait modifications occurring when texting while walking, including the study of the lower limb muscle activation patterns, 2) to specifically assess the co-contraction of ankle antagonist muscles. We hypothesized that texting while walking increases co-contractions of ankle antagonist muscles when the body weight is transferred from one lower limb to the other, to improve the distal motor control and joint stabilization. From the gait data collected during an instrumented walk lasting 3 min, we calculated the spatio-temporal parameters, the ankle and knee kinematics, the muscle activation patterns of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius lateralis, peroneus longus, rectus femoris, and lateral hamstrings, and the co-contraction (occurrence and duration) of the ankle antagonist muscles (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis), bilaterally. Young adults showed, overall, small gait modifications that could be mainly ascribable to gait speed reduction and a modified body posture due to phone handling. We found no significant alterations of ankle and knee kinematics and a slightly delayed activation onset of the left gastrocnemius lateralis. However, we found an increased co-contraction of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis, especially during mid-stance. Conversely, we found a reduced co-contraction during terminal stance. Our results suggest that, in young adults, there is an adjustment of the motor control strategy aimed at increasing ankle joint stability in a specific and “critical” phase of the gait cycle, when the body weight is transferred from one leg to the other.},

	abstract = {Since Weiser introduced his vision of ubiquitous computing, computing$\backslash$ndevices have become$\backslash$n$\backslash$nlighter, smaller, cheaper, and more powerful. At the same time, pervasive$\backslash$ncomputing and the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nconcept of context have attracted significant attention, with the$\backslash$ngoal of supporting the use of$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncomputing devices anywhere, anytime, as computers fade into the environment.$\backslash$nWhile there has$\backslash$n$\backslash$nbeen some success inferring the users� intensions, reliably understanding$\backslash$nusers� general goal$\backslash$n$\backslash$nremains a significant challenge. Using limited context information,$\backslash$nsuch as location, can be useful,$\backslash$n$\backslash$nbut the benefits are limited. Context is more than location. As computers$\backslash$nare embedded into$\backslash$n$\backslash$neveryday things, the situations users encounter become more variable.$\backslash$nAs a result, situationally induced$\backslash$n$\backslash$nimpairment and disabilities (SIID) will become more common and user$\backslash$ninterfaces will$\backslash$n$\backslash$nplay an even more important role. Recent understandings on context$\backslash$nsuggested the importance of$\backslash$n$\backslash$napplications themselves as parts of the whole context space. This$\backslash$narticle will explain and discuss$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe characteristics of SIID under a three-dimension (human, environment,$\backslash$nand applications)$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncontext model. We suggest integrating information from all dimensions$\backslash$nto have a whole picture of$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncontext. More studies are needed to understand the relationship among$\backslash$ndifferent dimensions, and$\backslash$n$\backslash$nto help design effective context-aware applications overcoming SIID.},

	abstract = {This sweeping introduction to the science of virtual environment technology masterfully integrates research and practical applications culled from a range of disciplines, including psychology, engineering, and computer science. With contributions from the field's foremost researchers and theorists, the book focuses in particular on how virtual technology and interface design can better accommodate human cognitive, motor, and perceptual capabilities. Throughout, it brings the reader up-to-date with the latest design strategies and cutting-edge virtual environments, and points to promising avenues for future development. The book is divided into three parts. The first part introduces the reader to the subject by defining basic terms, identifying key components of the virtual environment, and reviewing the origins and elements of virtual environments. The second part focuses of current technologies used to present visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic information. The book concludes with an in-depth analysis of how environments and human perception are integrated to create effective virtual systems. Comprehensive and splendidly written, Virtual Environments and Advanced Interface Design will be the "bible" on the subject for years to come. Students and researchers in computer science, psychology, and cognitive science will all want to have a copy on their shelves.},

@article{Heo2010,
	abstract = {This study is to propose a realistic game system using a multi-modal interface, including gaze tracking, hand gesture recognition and bio-signal analysis. Our research is novel in the following four ways, compared to previous game systems. First, a highly immersive and realistic game is implemented on a head mounted display (HMD), with a gaze tracker, a gesture recognizer and a bio-signal analyzer. Second, since the camera module for eye tracking is attached below the HMD, a user's gaze position onto the HMD display can be calculated without wearing any additional eye tracking devices. Third, an aiming cursor in the game system is controlled by the gaze tracking. The grabbing and throwing behaviors toward a target are performed by the user's hand gestures using a data glove. Finally, the level of difficulty in the game system is adaptively controlled according to the measurement and analysis of a user's bio-signals. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more effect on experience of immersion and interest than conventional device such as a keyboard and or a mouse.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel technology called "CheekInput" with a head-mounted display (HMD) that senses touch gestures by detecting skin deformation. We attached multiple photo-reflective sensors onto the bottom front frame of the HMD. Since these sensors measure the distance between the frame and cheeks, our system is able to detect the deformation of a cheek when the skin surface is touched by fingers. Our system uses a Support Vector Machine to determine the gestures: pushing face up and down, left and right. We combined these 4 directional gestures for each cheek to extend 16 possible gestures. To evaluate the accuracy of the gesture detection, we conducted a user study. The results revealed that CheekInput achieved 80.45 {\%} recognition accuracy when gestures were made by touching both cheeks with both hands, and 74.58 {\%} when by touching both cheeks with one hand.},

This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users.

	abstract = {The literature pertaining to foot operation of controls is reviewed and a new experiment reported. Published experimental results clarify only some isolated aspects of leg and foot motions. Even the relatively often investigated speed of operating pedals and forces that can be applied to them, were studied under such different experimental conditions that no general statements are possible concerning what pedal can be operated most quickly or forcibly. Opinions about the advantages and dis advantages of hand versus foot operation seem not generally based on experimental findings. In an experiment, 20 seated young adult male subjects moved their right foot as rapidly as possible over distances of 15 cm to circular targets. The direction of these discrote movements had no appreciable effect on the accuracy of motion. Forward motions of the vertical or almost vertical lower leg were slightly faster than backward or lateral motions of the elevated lower leg. All motions could be performed in about 0-1 seconds.},

We compare a foot tapping technique for menu interaction with two more traditional situations: one where the user has the phone in hand, and one where the user must remove it from an inside pocket before interacting. Results show that over the course of the full study, all conditions allowed a high level of accuracy in selections. The visual and in pocket conditions were overall faster and more accurate. However, for short selections requiring four or less foot taps or button presses the foot tap condition was faster than the in pocket condition.},

This paper reports the development of a reliable (alpha = 0.89) 11-item behavioral inventory of foot preference. Since footedness and handedness are only partially related, both must be measured reliably to identify individuals who have a consistent right or left side preference. It has yet to be determined whether footedness or handedness has the stronger relationship to other aspects of cerebral lateralization and whether both measures together predict lateralization better than one of them alone.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus has been proposed to support a cognitive map, a mental representation of the spatial layout of an environment as well as the nonspatial items encountered in that environment. In the present study, we recorded simultaneously from 43 to 61 hippocampal pyramidal cells as rats performed an object recognition memory task in which novel and repeated objects were encountered in different locations on a circular track. Multivariate analyses of the neural data indicated that information about object identity was represented secondarily to the primary information dimension of object location. In addition, the neural data related to performance on the recognition memory task. The results suggested that objects were represented as points of interest on the hippocampal cognitive map and that this map was useful in remembering encounters with particular objects in specific locations.},

@article{Lewis2016,
	abstract = {In five experiments, we evaluated how secondary information presented on a heads-up display (HUD) impacts performance of a concurrent visual attention task. To do so, we had participants complete a primary visual search task under a variety of secondary load conditions (a single word presented on Google Glass during each search trial). Processing of secondary information was measured through a recognition memory task. Other manipulations included relevance (Experiments 1–4) and temporal onset of secondary information relative to the primary task (Experiment 3). Secondary information was always disruptive to the visual search, regardless of temporal onset and even when participants were instructed to ignore it. These patterns were evident in search tasks reflective of both selective (Experiments 1–3) and preattentive (Experiment 4) attentional mechanisms, and were not a result of onset-offset attentional capture (Experiment 5). Recognition memory for secondary information was always above chance. Our findings suggest that HUD-based visual information is profoundly disruptive to attentional processes and largely immune to user-centric prioritization.},

Supporters of Glass claim the head-mounted wearable computer is designed to deliver information without concurrent distraction. Existing literature supports the supposition that design decisions incorporated in Glass might facilitate messaging for drivers.Method:We asked drivers in a simulator to drive and use either Glass or a smartphone-based messaging interface, then interrupted them with an emergency brake event. Both the response event and subsequent recovery were analyzed.Results:Glass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting cognitive demands. A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired drivin...},

Both devices allow users$\backslash$nto interact with wearable or nearby computers by using gesture-based$\backslash$ncommands. Both are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so they$\backslash$ncan be used under various social contexts. The first device, called$\backslash$nGestureWrist, is a wristband-type input device that recognizes hand$\backslash$ngestures and forearm movements. Unlike DataGloves or other hand$\backslash$ngesture-input devices, all sensing elements are embedded in a normal$\backslash$nwristband. The second device, called GesturePad, is a sensing module$\backslash$nthat can be attached on the inside of clothes, and users can interact$\backslash$nwith this module from the outside. It transforms conventional clothes$\backslash$ninto an interactive device without changing their appearance},

	abstract = {In today's industry, intuitive gesture recognition, as manifested in numerous consumer electronics devices, becomes a main issue of HMI device research. Although finger-tip touch based user interface has paved a main stream in mobile electronics, we envision touch-less HMI as a promising technology in futuristic applications with higher potential in areas where sanity or outdoor operation become of importance. In this paper, we introduce a novel HMI device for non-contact gesture input for intuitive HMI experiences. The enabling technology of the proposed device is the IPA (infrared Proximity Array) sensor by which realtime 3 dimensional depth information can be captured and realized for machine control. For the usability study, two different operating modes are adopted for hand motion inputs: one is a finger tip control mode and the other is a palm control mode. Throughput of the proposed device has been studied and compared to a traditional mouse device for usability evaluation. During the human subject test, the proposed device is found to be useful for PC mouse pointer control. The experimental results are shared in the paper as well.},

Our method uses no environmentally tethered tracking devices and localizes a pair of near-range and far-range RGB-D cameras mounted on a head-worn display and a moving bare hand in 3D space by exploiting depth input data. Depth perception is enhanced through egocentric visual feedback, including a semi-transparent proxy hand. We implement a virtual hand interaction technique and feedback approaches, and evaluate their performance and usability. The proposed method can apply to many 3D interaction scenarios using hands in a wearable AR environment, such as AR information browsing, maintenance, design, and games.},

We extend the design space of digital tables to include multiple layers of interaction. We leverage 3D position information of a pointing device to support interaction in the space above the active work-surface by creating multiple layers with drift-correction in which the user can interact with an application. We also illustrate through a point-design that designers can use multiple-layers to create a rich and clutter free application. A subjective evaluation showed that users liked the interaction techniques and found that, because of the drift correction we use, they could control the pointer when working in any layer.},

	abstract = {Lightweight spatially aware displays (Tangible Magic Lenses) are an effective approach for exploring complex information spaces within a tabletop environment. One way of using the 3D space above a horizontal surface is to di- vide it into discrete parallel layers stacked upon each other. Horizontal and vertical lens movements are essential tasks for the style of multi-layer interaction associated with it. We conducted a comprehensive user study with 18 partici- pants investigating fundamental issues such as optimal number of layers and their thickness, movement and hold- ing accuracies, and physical boundaries of the interaction volume. Findings include a rather limited overall interaction height (44 cm), a different minimal layer thickness for ver- tical and horizontal search tasks (1 cm/4 cm), a reasonable maximum number of layers depending on the primary task, and a convenience zone in the middle for horizontal search. Derived from that, design guidelines are also presented.},

	abstract = {With advances in tracking and increased computing power, mobile AR systems are popular in our daily life. Researchers in mobile AR technology have emphasized the technical challenges involved in the limitations imposed from mobility. They did not consider context-aware service with user-related information annotation, even if in ubiquitous computing environment, various contexts of both a user and an environment can be utilized easily as well as effectively. Moreover, it is difficult to have access to pervasive but invisible computing resources. At the same time, the more smart appliances become evolved with more features, the harder their user interfaces tend to become to use. Thus, in this paper, we propose Context-aware Mobile Augmented Reality (CaMAR) system. It lets users interact with their smart objects through personalized control interfaces on their mobile AR devices. Also, it supports enabling contents to be not only personalized but also shared selectively and interactively among user communities. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {We present Mime, a compact, low-power 3D sensor for unen- cumbered free-form, single-handed gestural interaction with head-mounted displays (HMDs). Mime introduces a real- time signal processing framework that combines a novel three-pixel time-of-flight (TOF) module with a standard RGB camera. The TOF module achieves accurate 3D hand local- ization and tracking, and it thus enables motion-controlled gestures. The joint processing of 3D information with RGB image data enables finer, shape-based gestural interaction. Our Mime hardware prototype achieves fast and precise 3D gestural control. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D sensors like TOF cameras, the Microsoft Kinect and the Leap Motion Controller, Mime offers several key advantages for mobile applications andHMDuse cases: very small size, daylight in- sensitivity, and low power consumption. Mime is built using standard, low-cost optoelectronic components and promises to be an inexpensive technology that can either be a periph- eral component or be embedded within the HMD unit. We demonstrate the utility of the Mime sensor for HMD interac- tion with a variety of application scenarios, including 3D spa- tial input using close-range gestures, gaming, on-the-move interaction, and operation in cluttered environments and in broad daylight conditions. ∗Please},

During an offline training phase, we capture full body motions with a motion capture system, as well as the corresponding foot-ground pressure distributions with a pressure sensor pad, into a database. At run time, the user acts out the animation desired on the pressure sensor pad. The system then tries to "see" the motion only through the foot-ground interactions measured, and the most appropriate motions from the database are selected, and edited online to drive the avatar. We describe our motion recognition, motion blending, and inverse kinematics algorithms in detail. They are easy to implement, and cheap to compute. FootSee can control a virtual avatar in a fixed latency of 1 second with reasonable accuracy. Our system thus makes it possible to create interactive animations without the cost or inconveniences of a full body motion capture system.},

Two experiments show that left and right feet perform at similar levels, there is little difference in selection time across target configurations or directions, but targets with an angular size under 22.5° or radial size under 5cm should be avoided due to high error rates. There is a detectable advantage to tapping compared to kicking, but little practical difference. Although cursor feedback is optimal, we show that eyes-free foot pointing achieves an error rate of 27{\%} for 45° angular targets. We translate our results into ten design guidelines and we illustrate their application by designing foot interaction techniques to control desktop applications at a standing desk.},

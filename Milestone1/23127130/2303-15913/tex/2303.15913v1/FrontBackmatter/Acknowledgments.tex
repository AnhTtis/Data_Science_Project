\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

They say that writing is a lonely job. After the experience of writing this dissertation, I would like to object to that. Over all these years (three or so\ldots), I have had wonderful support from so many people without whom this work would not have been possible. This is to each and every one of you.

First of all, I would like to thank Max Mühlhäuser (Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany), my doctoral supervisor and mentor, who over the years has always provided outstanding support, even for the craziest ideas. His undiminished interest in developing new ideas and his childlike joy in doing so are a great inspiration and source of motivation. I am also very grateful to Prof. Albrecht Schmidt (Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany) for acting as a co-referee for my work and contributing many exciting ideas.

Furthermore, I had the pleasure to spend the last years in a fantastic research group. Thanks to all current and former staff of the Telecooperation Lab -- may the TK spirit be with all of you! This applies, of course, especially to \inlinegraphicsame{Content/Figures/General/teamdarmstadt} (formally known as the TI or HCI Group). Thank you to Sepp, Martin, Jan, Hesham, Karo, Julius, Markus, Roman, Mo, and Niloo for all the support and your contributions to my work. You've been wonderful, folks.

Likewise, my deepest gratitude goes to all my students who over the years have struggled with the technical shortcomings of several generations of AR glasses from META 1 to Hololens. I would like to especially mention Domi, Daniel as well as Alex\&Daniel. It was wonderful to throw problems at you and to see, how you were able to meet impossible deadlines when solving them. I owe you guys.

Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my girlfriend Isabell, my parents, Gertrud and Peter, as well as my friends. Without your support and the patience to endure my changing moods in times of insane work, none of this would have been possible. 

Thank You.

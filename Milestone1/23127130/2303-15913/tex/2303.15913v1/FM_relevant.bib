@inproceedings{muller2016proxiwatch,
	abstract = {Smartwatches allow ubiquitous and mobile interaction with digital contents. Because of the small screen sizes, tradi-tional interaction techniques are often not applicable. In this work, we show how the degree of freedom offered by the elbow joint, i.e., flexion and extension, can be leveraged as an additional one-handed input modality for smartwatches. By moving the watch towards or away from the body, the user is able to provide input to the smartwatch without a second hand. We present the results of a controlled ex-periment focusing on the human capabilities for proximity-based interaction. Based on the results, we propose guide-lines for designing proximity-based smartwatch interfaces and present ProxiWatch: a one-handed and proximity-based input modality for smartwatches alongside a proto-typical implementation.},

@inproceedings{muller2015a,
	abstract = {On-body user interfaces utilize the human's skin for both sensing input and displaying graphical output. In this paper, we present how the degree of freedom offered by the elbow joint, i.e., flexion and extension, can be leveraged to extend the input space of projective user interfaces. The user can move his hand towards or away from himself to browse through a multi-layer information space. We conducted a controlled experiment to investigate how accurately and efficiently users can interact in the space. The results revealed that the accuracy and efficiency of proximity-based interactions mainly depend on the traveling distance to the target layer while neither the hand side nor the direction of interaction have a significant influence. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing on-body user interfaces.},

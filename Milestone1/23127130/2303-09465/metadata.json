    "abstract": "Grain boundaries are two-dimensional defects that control many physical and chemical properties of materials. We build on the recent description of grain boundaries as defect phases and devise a way to trigger and observe the transformation of grain boundary phases. The atomistic structure of a symmetric tilt grain boundary in Mg was resolved by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. By introducing Ga atoms to the grain boundary, transformations towards other grain boundary phases were tracked. Ab initio simulations were performed to construct the defect phase diagram for the grain boundary and understand the progress of their phase transformations. A pattern recognition tool was developed to compare the experimental and simulated structural units at the grain boundary and automatically trace the phase transformation. The ability to construct defect phase diagrams and tune their phase transformations without changing the geometric confinement of defects enables a new paradigm of material designs.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that it is possible to test models of gravity, such as Palatini $f(R)$ and Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld models, using seismic data from Earth. By incorporating additional limitations on Earth's moment of inertia and mass given from observational data, the models' parameters can be restricted to a $2σ$ level of accuracy. Our novel tool provides that $β\\lesssim 10^9 \\text{m}^2$ for Palatini and $ε\\lesssim 4\\cdot 10^9 \\text{m}^2$ for Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. We also discuss further enhancements to the proposed method, aimed at imposing even more stringent constraints on modified gravity proposals.",

    "abstract": "We study a model of synthetic molecular motor - a [3]-catenane consisting of two small macrocycles mechanically interlocked with a bigger one - subjected to a time-dependent driving using stochastic thermodynamics. The model presents nontrivial features due to the two interacting small macrocycles, but is simple enough to be treated analytically in limiting regimes. Among the results obtained, we find a mapping into an equivalent [2]-catenane that reveals the implications of the no-pumping theorem stating that to generate net motion of the small macrocycles, both energies and barriers need to change. In the adiabatic limit (slow driving), we fully characterize the motor's dynamics and show that the net motion of the small macrocycles is expressed as a surface integral in parameter space which corrects previous erroneous results. We also analyze the performance of the motor subjected to a step-wise driving protocols in absence and in presence of an applied load. Optimization strategies for generating large currents and maximizing free-energy transduction are proposed. This simple model provides interesting clues into the working principles of non-autonomous molecular motors and their optimization.",

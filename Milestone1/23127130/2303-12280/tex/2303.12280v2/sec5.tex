\section{Conclusion}
We proposed NLOS-NeuS, which is an extension of the NeTF for representing 3D surfaces with an SDF in NLOS scenes. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on neural implicit surfaces with volume rendering in NLOS scenes.
%\funa{Review the contributions.}
The experimental results indicate that the introduced constraints are essential for learning a correct SDF to avoid non-zero level-set surfaces in an under-constrained NLOS setup, and NLOS-NeuS with continuous representation enables high quality 3D surface reconstruction in NLOS scenes.
Future research directions include using other geometric representations and an extension for a non-confocal NLOS setup.

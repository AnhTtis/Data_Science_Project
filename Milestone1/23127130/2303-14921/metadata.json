    "abstract": "We give a concise geometric development of Poincare gauge theory in any dimension and signature, and trace the difference between the canonical and symmetric energy tensors to different choices of independent variables. Then we give extensive attention to sources for torsion, finding that symmetric kinetic terms for non-Yang-Mills bosonic fields of arbitrary rank drive torsion. Our detailed discussion of spin 3/2 Rarita-Schwinger fields shows that they source all independent parts of the torsion. We develop systematic notation for higher spin fields and find the spin tensor for arbitrary fermion spin in any dimension. For spin greater than 1/2 there is a novel direct coupling between torsion and spinor fields.",

    "abstract": "A crossover from a non-Gaussian to Gaussian sub-diffusion has been observed\nubiquitously in various polymeric/molecular glass-formers. We have developed a\nframework which generalizes the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model to\nincorporate non-Gaussian features by introducing a jump kernel. We illustrate\nthat the non-Gaussian fBm (nGfBm) model accurately characterizes the\nsub-diffusion crossover. From the solutions of the nGfBm model, we gain\ninsights into the nature of van-Hove self-correlation in non-Gaussian\nsubdiffusive regime, which are found to exhibit exponential tails, providing\nfirst such experimental evidence in molecular glass-formers. The results of the\nmodel are substantiated using incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering on\nglass-forming deep eutectic solvents.",

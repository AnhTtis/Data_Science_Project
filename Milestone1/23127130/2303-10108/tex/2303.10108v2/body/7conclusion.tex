In this work, we made the first attempt to transfer minimal sufficient knowledge from unlabeled graphs by data augmentation. We proposed a data-centric framework to use the diffusion model trained on the unlabeled graphs and use two task-related objectives to generate task-specific augmented graphs. Experiments demonstrated the performance of the proposed framework through visible augmented examples. It is better than self-supervised learning, self-training, and graph data augmentation methods on as many as 15 tasks.

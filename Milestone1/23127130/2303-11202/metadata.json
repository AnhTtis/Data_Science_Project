    "abstract": "We demonstrate ion irradiation as a wafer-scale method for the fabrication of amorphous superconducting thin films. We explore irradiation using argon and gallium ions on single-element and compound materials. Our results indicate that both ions increase disorder in the atomic structure in a qualitatively similar manner, i.e., they destroy the grain structure, increase resistivity and alter the superconducting transition temperature. However, argon irradiation tends to yield gas pockets that can be detrimental for applications. We show that gallium irradiation allows to produce a thin, uniform, and amorphous molybdenum silicide film that is promising, e.g., for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.",

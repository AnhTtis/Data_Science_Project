    "abstract": "We present a formalization of collections that Cornelius Castoriadis calls ``magmas'', especially the property which mainly characterizes them and distinguishes them from the usual cantorian sets. It is the property of their elements to {\\em depend} on other elements, either in a one-way or a two-way manner, so that one cannot occur in a collection without the occurrence of those dependent on it. Such a dependence relation can be represented by a pre-order relation $\\preccurlyeq$ Then, working in a mild strengthening of the theory ${\\rm ZFA}$, where $A$ is an infinite set of atoms equipped with a primitive pre-ordering $\\preccurlyeq$, the class of magmas over $A$ is represented by the class $LO(A,\\preccurlyeq)$ of nonempty open subsets of $A$ with respect to the lower topology of $\\langle A,\\preccurlyeq\\rangle$. Next the pre-ordering $\\preccurlyeq$ is shifted (by a kind of simulation) to a pre-ordering $\\preccurlyeq^+$ on ${\\cal P}(A)$, which turns out to satisfy the same non-minimality condition as well, and which, happily, when restricted to $LO(A,\\preccurlyeq)$ coincides with $\\subseteq$. This allows us to define a hierarchy $M_α(A)$, along all ordinals $α\\geq 1$, the``magmatic hierarchy'', such that $M_1(A)=LO(A,\\preccurlyeq)$, $M_{α+1}(A)=LO(M_α(A),\\subseteq)$, and $M_α(A)=\\bigcup_{β<α}M_β(A)$, for a limit ordinal $α$. For every $α\\geq 1$, $M_α(A)\\subseteq V_α(A)$, where $V_α(A)$ are the levels of the universe $V(A)$ of ${\\rm ZFA}$. The class $M(A)=\\bigcup_{α\\geq 1}M_α(A)$ is the ``magmatic universe above $A$.''",

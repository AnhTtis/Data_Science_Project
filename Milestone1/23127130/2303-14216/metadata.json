    "abstract": "In this work, we present the construction of two distinct finite element approaches to solve the Porous Medium Equation (PME). In the first approach, we transform the PME to a log-density variable formulation and construct a continuous Galerkin method. In the second approach, we introduce additional potential and velocity variables to rewrite the PME into a system of equations, for which we construct a mixed finite element method. Both approaches are first-order accurate, mass conserving, and proved to be unconditionally energy stable for their respective energies. The mixed approach is shown to preserve positivity under a CFL condition, while a much stronger property of unconditional bound preservation is proved for the log-density approach. A novel feature of our schemes is that they can handle compactly supported initial data without the need for any perturbation techniques. Furthermore, the log-density method can handle unstructured grids in any number of dimensions, while the mixed method can handle unstructured grids in two dimensions. We present results from several numerical experiments to demonstrate these properties.",

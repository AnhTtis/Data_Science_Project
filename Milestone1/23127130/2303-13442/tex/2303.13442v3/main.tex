Active matter is defined by the nonlinear conversion of free energy on the molecular scale into macroscopic dynamics - which means that small changes in molecular processes can crucially tip the overall system into a different area in phase space, corresponding to often counter-intuitive dynamical state changes.
\par
It is easy to move agents by external fields: with some more effort we can have them convert free energy on the molecular scale into self-propelled, autonomous motion. However, like a sorcerer's apprentice~\cite{goethe1798_hat} we find that stopping this motion is not a trivial task; after all, one is required to deplete an energy reservoir or reverse a dynamic instability. 
\par
This kind of control is important in the design and study of artificial and biological microswimmers, their theoretical modeling, experimental realization, and, ultimately, to provide design principles and dynamic control for technological application.
Autophoretic particles \cite{bechinger2016_active,moran2019_microswimmers,zhang2021_chemicallypowered,zottl2023_modeling} and, particularly, their experimental counterpart, active droplets \cite{maass2016_swimming,babu2022_motile,birrer2022_we,dwivedi2022_selfpropelled,michelin2023_selfpropulsion,hanczyc2007_fatty,thutupalli2011_swarming,peddireddy2012_solubilization,izri2014_selfpropulsion,herminghaus2014_interfacial}, 
are popular active matter models driven by purely physicochemical mechanisms. 
Generally, their dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless P\'eclet number \Pen{}, quantifying the ratio of advective and diffusive transport of chemical fuel~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous}. With increasing \Pen{}, autophoretic particles first transition  from \textit{passive} isotropic chemical conversion to \textit{active} self-propulsion, and further from persistent to unsteady motion via a sequence of broken symmetries and interfacial flow modes of increasing complexity~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,izri2014_selfpropulsion,suga2018_selfpropelled,izzet2020_tunable,meredith2020_predatorprey,hokmabad2021_emergence,suda2021_straighttocurvilinear}.
\par
Recent studies have investigated the control of speed and dynamic states of such microswimmers in response to externally applied stimuli such as temperature \cite{tu2017_self-propelled,cholakova2021_rechargeable} or illumination \cite{florea2014_photochemopropulsion,kaneko2017_phototactic,xiao2018_moving,lancia2019_reorientation,alvarez2021_reconfigurable,ryabchun2022_runandhalt,vankesteren2023_selfpropelling}. 
On heating, physical intuition suggests that motion should accelerate and destabilize, either by the increase of translational and rotational diffusion with decreasing viscosity, or by increased activity from the molecular thermodynamics driving the motion. %FIG S5
However, the nonlinear dynamics of self-organized activity can drive counter-intuitive effects, as we have previously found for active droplets which destabilize with increasing viscosity due to an associated increase in \Pen{}~\cite{hokmabad2021_emergence}. 
\par
In this study, we explore a counter-intuitive response to increasing temperature. We study active droplets using a temperature sensitive combination of co-surfactants as a fuel medium. We reversibly control the transition between three distinct dynamic states from unsteady to oscillatory to steady, straight swimming to eventual arrest with increasing ambient temperature. Notably, we are able to control \Pen{} to experimentally observe the fundamental first symmetry breaking of the inactive isotropic base state into directed self-propulsion in both chemical and hydrodynamic fields.

\end{figure*}
\par
Our experimental system consists of oil droplets (CB15) immersed in an aqueous solution of the ionic surfactant tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) at 9-1\SI{5}{\wtpc} (267--\SI{445}{\milli\molar}) and the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127  (PF127) at \SI{4}{\wtpc}, or \SI{3}{\milli\molar}. 
\par
CB15 droplets self-propel reliably in supramicellar solutions of pure TTAB above \SI{5}{\wtpc}~\cite{jin2017_chemotaxis,hokmabad2021_emergence}. Briefly put, the swimming is due to oil diffusing from the droplet into TTAB micelles~\cite{peddireddy2012_solubilization,herminghaus2014_interfacial,izzet2020_tunable}, which removes surfactant from the droplet posterior, while the anterior is replenished by the advection of fresh surfactant (Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}b). The key point here is that the empty micelles at the anterior are more thermodynamically stable than the oil-filled ones at the posterior~\cite{izzet2020_tunable,rosen2012_surfactants}: in consequence the critical micelle concentration is higher in front of a moving droplet. The resulting self-enhancing surface tension gradient drives the droplet forward until it is dissolved. Typically, a CB15 droplet of diameter \SI{50}{\um} will swim in \SI{5}{\wtpc} TTAB for 1-2 hours.  Thus, empty TTAB micelles serve as fresh, and oil-filled ones as spent fuel. Based on this mechanism, one can define a \Pen\ of droplet motion that increases with viscosity, droplet size and surfactant concentration, i.e. chemical activity~\cite{izri2014_selfpropulsion,izzet2020_tunable,hokmabad2021_emergence,hokmabad2022_spontaneously,suda2021_straighttocurvilinear}.
\par
PF127 is a nonionic, triblock copolymer surfactant that in a pure aqueous solution forms micelles with a hydrophobic core of propylene oxide (PPO) and an outer shell of hydrated ethylene oxide (PEO) \cite{alexandridis1994_micellization,wanka1994_phase,bohorquez1999_study,stoeber2006_passive,jalaal2016_rheology,jalaal2018_gelcontrolled} above the critical micelle temperature,  $\text{CMT}\approx\SI{21}{\celsius}$ at $\SI{4}{\wtpc}$ PF127~\cite{bohorquez1999_study}. 
In the presence of ionic co-surfactants like TTAB, which bind strongly with PF127, mixed TTAB/PF127 aggregates form (\figref{fig:setup}a, SI section \ref{SIsec:mixedmicelles}, Figs.\ \ref{SIfig:DLS}, \ref{SIfig:Zaverage} and \ref{SIfig:DSC}), with excess TTAB forming single-species micelles \cite{nambam2012_effects,hecht1994_interaction,li2001_binding,tam2006_insights}. 
It has been found \cite{li2001_binding} that the TTAB binding capacity of PF127 is amplified with increasing temperature, due to an increasing dehydration of the PPO blocks (hydrophobic effect~\cite{butt2003_physics,alexandridis1994_micellization}).



Under our experimental conditions, we expect a significant coverage of TTAB at the interface (SI \figref{SIfig:anchoring}).  Furthermore, CB15 droplets are completely immotile and hardly solubilize in pure PF127 solutions (SI \figref{SIfig:dissolution}), while in a mixed TTAB/PF127 medium self-propelling at speeds $\approx\SI{20}{\um/\second}$, comparable to experiments in pure TTAB solutions (cf. \cite{jin2017_chemotaxis,hokmabad2021_emergence} and SI \figref{SIfig:ttab}). We therefore regard TTAB as the primary surfactant involved in the solubilization and the interfacial gradients driving the droplet motion. This activity is controlled by PF127 binding and relasing TTAB micelles in the bulk medium (Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}a,b).
Thus, the P\'eclet number \Pen{} of droplet activity \textit{decreases} with \textit{increasing} temperature, as an increasing fraction of TTAB is bound in mixed micelles.

According to literature on the composition of PF127/TTAB aggregates \cite{hecht1994_interaction,li2001_binding,hecht1995_interaction}, the amount of bound TTAB in our swimming medium should exceed $\SI{1}{\wtpc}$ and further increase with temperature, which is on the order of the amounts required ($<\SI{5}{\wtpc}$) to suppress droplet motility~\cite{herminghaus2014_interfacial,hokmabad2021_emergence}, as observed in the experiments we show below (see also Fig.\ \ref{SIfig:swimming}). 
We further note that the swimming medium is Newtonian, with only weakly temperature dependent viscosity (SI \figref{SIfig:viscosity}).

\label{fig:traj}
\end{figure*}
%
We begin with an overview of the general swimming dynamics taken from wide-field video microscopy under changing the ambient temperature, and for a range of TTAB concentrations.
The setup contains a quasi-2D microfluidic cell on a temperature controlled stage (\figref{fig:setup}c). 
\figref{fig:traj}a (Movie S1) plots a trajectory colour-coded once by speed and once by temperature, recorded at a set heating/cooling rate of \SI{1}{\kelvin/\min}, using a swimming medium containing \SI{10}{\wtpc} TTAB.
\par
We start at $T \approx \SI{15}{\celsius}< \text{CMT}$. 
Below $T_\text{straight} = \SI{22}{\celsius}$, the droplet meanders. Above, the motion is straight, gradually slows down and eventually stops at $T_\text{stop} \approx \SI{27}{\celsius}$. 
During a subsequent cooling ramp, the droplet remains immotile down to a significantly lower temperature $T_\text{start} \approx \SI{17}{\celsius}$, where it abruptly starts to meander again. 
\par
As well as by temperature, the swimming dynamics are also susceptible to the TTAB concentration. Previous studies on single-surfactant systems found a transition from straight to reorienting to unsteady swimming~\cite{izzet2020_tunable,hokmabad2022_spontaneously} in response to an increase in fuel surfactant. This increase corresponds to increased \Pen{}, leading to the emergence of destabilising higher order modes in the interfacial flow and chemical fields, as predicted by canonical models for isotropic autophoretic particles~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,michelin2023_selfpropulsion,morozov2019_nonlinear}.
\par
At low temperatures, the presence of a co-surfactant does not change these dynamics, as we find a transition from meandering to unsteady motion (Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}d, Movie S2) with increasing TTAB concentration.  We have summarized these swimming dynamics  in a map spanned by temperature and surfactant concentration in \figref{fig:traj}b.
With increasing temperature, we observe a universal transition via straight swimming to eventual arrest. We posit that the temperature dependent TTAB depletion lowers \Pen{} below the critical thresholds of higher order interfacial modes, down to $n=1$ for straight swimming and finally $n=0$, below the fundamental advection-diffusion instability. We do not provide a quantitative estimate of \Pen{} following~\cite{hokmabad2021_emergence}, as we cannot quantify the temperature dependence of the underlying physical chemistry parameters.
Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}b also shows the transition temperatures to increase with TTAB concentration:  
for the droplet to arrest, more TTAB needs to be removed from the swimming medium. We found the stop/start hysteresis for all TTAB concentrations in use (Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}c).
\par
These state transitions are well reversible with temperature, up to some slowdown attributable to droplet shrinkage. The experiment shown in \figref{fig:traj}e-g and Movie S3 was recorded at a faster rate of \SI{10}{\kelvin/\min} to permit multiple heating and cooling cycles, with dynamics similar to the system cooled at slower rates. \figref{fig:traj}e and f show the droplet trajectory color coded by temperature and a corresponding plot of speed over time. The initial motion is recovered after each heating and cooling cycle, apart from a very gradual decrease in maximum speed which we may attribute to droplet shrinkage. We have further analyzed speed versus temperature in \figref{fig:traj}g), and found a  hysteresis cycle with a delayed re-onset of motion reproducible over multiple heating/cooling ramps.

\subsection{Chemical and flow fields}
\begin{figure*}

(c) Snapshots of droplet chemical trails at different temperatures as marked by I-IV in (a) and (b).

\label{fig:fluo}
\end{figure*}
We continue with a discussion of the chemical dynamics during the droplet arrest, to motivate the hysteresis in the re-onset of motion; and of the corresponding flow field to investigate the interfacial mode evolution.
\par
The field of spent chemical fuel affects the interfacial Marangoni gradients driving the droplet~\cite{izzet2020_tunable,hokmabad2021_emergence,ramesh2023_interfacial}. We visualise it by doping the droplet with the fluorescent dye Nile Red~\cite{hokmabad2022_chemotactic}, which co-moves with the oil phase into the filled micelles, and extracting the fluorescence intensity $I$ under videomicroscopy (Movie S4). In Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}, we analyze the chemical dynamics for one droplet during a heating and cooling cycle, by a speed-coded trajectory (a), a kymograph of $I$ around the droplet perimeter, $\theta$ vs. time and recorded temperature (b), and with micrographs at the times marked I--IV (c). 
\par
During heating, the droplet transitions from unsteady to straight swimming to immotility (Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}a). We note that this particular experiment featured some global drift causing translation even in the immotile state (see Movie S4).  In the kymograph  (Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}b), at $T < \SI{26}{\celsius}$, the band corresponding to the chemical trail translates in the angular space due to the reorientation of the droplet (I). At $T \approx \SI{26}{\celsius}$, the droplet slows down and comes to a halt. As the system is cooled down to $T \approx \SI{21}{\celsius}$, the inactive droplet still solubilises isotropically, and oil-filled micelles accumulate around the perimeter $\theta$. Correspondingly, the band in the kymograph widens over the entire angular space (II). The accumulated filled micelles block empty micelles from reaching the interface \cite{ramesh2023_interfacial,morozov2020_adsorption}, such that in the presence of oil-filled micelles even more mixed micelles need to disintegrate to restart activity. Thus, the motility transition temperature is lowered, here to $T_\text{start} = \SI{16.8}{\celsius}$, where the droplet escapes the oil-filled micelle cloud (III) and swims away (IV). 
\par

\label{fig:piv}
\end{figure*}
Before discussing the flow fields, we note two more consequences of oil saturation. First, the hysteresis in \figref{fig:traj}c) can be reduced (e.g. to approximately half of $T_\text{stop}-T_\text{start}$ at \SI{13}{\wtpc} TTAB) if the system is not heated to full inactivity, but it is never entirely suppressed.
This can be understood as follows:  during the late stage of the heating ramp, the droplet is already dispersing oil into its local environment by recirculation, starting from the posterior  - an effect we have also found in self-throttling pumping droplets in \cite{ramesh2023_interfacial}. During heating, the droplets will come to a stop even before activity has fully ceded (see the discussion of \figref{fig:piv}b below), and self-propulsion would always need to restart from inside an oil-rich region as shown in \figref{fig:fluo}c-II.

The regime of straight swimming appears to be highly localized on cooling (Movies S1 and S6): the droplet switches after a few seconds to a meandering motion (Movie S1). We argue here that outside the strongly localized cloud of spent fuel (see Movie S4 and Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}c), more empty TTAB micelles have been released, such that the droplet experiences a higher \Pen{} once it escapes its self-generated local trap.

To analyze the mode evolution causing arrest and sudden onset of motion during heating and cooling (Movie S5), we added tracer colloids to the oil phase, performed high resolution bright field videomicroscopy and analyzed the internal flow field $\vec{u}(x,y)$ by particle image velocimetry (PIV). \figref{fig:piv}b shows the evolution of $\vec{u}$ with increasing temperature. At $T = \SI{16}{\celsius}$, we see a  mixed  dipolar and quadrupolar flow field (modes $n=1,2$) corresponding to the meandering trajectory in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}a~\cite{suda2021_straighttocurvilinear,hokmabad2021_emergence}. At even higher temperature, $T = \SI{21}{\celsius}$, the droplet swims straight, \Pen{} decreases and the flow field is purely dipolar ($n=1$).  As the droplet begins to slow down, an inactive region spreads from the droplet posterior ($T = \SI{24}{\celsius}$). Finally ($T = \SI{27}{\celsius}$), just before the droplet stops ($n=0$), only a small region at the droplet anterior is active \cite{ramesh2023_interfacial}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}II, the local environment isotropically saturates with spent fuel while the droplet is immotile.
\par
The gradual increase of \Pen{} during cooling now allows us to directly observe the fundamental first transition from the immotile base state to self-propelled motion~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,michelin2023_selfpropulsion}. This can be realised theoretically using hydrodynamic models, originally proposed in~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous} as follows:

A spherical particle of radius $R$ is immersed in a fluid medium containing a chemical fuel at concentration $c$. At negligible Reynolds numbers, the flow is governed by the Stokes equations, $\mu\nabla^2\vec{u}=\nabla p$, $\nabla\cdot\vec{u}=0.$  The chemical field is coupled by an advection-diffusion equation, 
\begin{align}|\Pen|\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla c\right) &= \nabla^2c, &
\Pen{}&\equiv \frac{\mathcal{AM}R}{D^2},\end{align} and by the particle consuming fuel at its boundary, \mbox{$\partial_t c(R) =-\mathcal{A}$}.  The P\'eclet number is set by the activity $\mathcal{A}$, mobility $\mathcal{M}$ and diffusivity $D$ of the chemical species and the particle radius $R$. Using a decomposition into squirmer modes and a linear stability analysis around the isotropic base state (mode $n=0$), the authors find a transition to the propulsive dipolar state ($n=1$) above a threshold value of $\Pen{}=4$.

Our mixed surfactant method allows us to observe the growth of the bipolar mode in situ and a detailed comparison with the theory. We recorded the droplet speed $V$ at the onset of motion and performed a simulation of the interfacial instability, solving for the full 3D problem following~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,picella2022_confined} and adapted to our cell geometry (see SI section~\ref{SIsec:numerics}), with good qualitative agreement between experimental and numerical data (Fig.~\ref{fig:piv}a, Movie S6).

\section{Conclusions}
We show that controlling the dynamics of self-propelling droplets by micelle mediated interactions \cite{babu2021_acceleration,wentworth2022_chemically} provides a promising framework to regulate active droplet dynamics: we can now control self-propulsion from an unsteady or meandering state over quasi-ballistic propulsion to full arrest without needing to change the chemistry of the system. The transitions are almost fully reversible, excepting a slight reduction in peak speed that can be attributed to droplet shrinkage. 

Our hypothesis -- fuel binding by thermosensitive polymer cosurfactants --  does not include the behavior of adsorbed polymer at the interface, which might also be temperature dependent. However, we argue that these effects are, if present, secondary to the binding and release of TTAB in the swimming medium: generally, the desorption kinetics of large polymers are assumed to be exceedingly slow~\cite{butt2003_physics}.  
Thus, if these kinetics were the main drivers of thermoresponsive mode switching, it would not be consistent with our observations of cyclic reversibility and the fast response to changed external conditions, i.e. the onset of motion in Fig.~\ref{fig:piv}a and particularly the fast, local adaptation to the fuel-rich medium outside the saturation area.

\par 
Our experiments fit into the framework of the  canonical theory for autophoretic particles, where the observed dynamic regimes correspond to interfacial modes becoming unstable with increasing or decreasing P\'eclet number. 
\par
While such higher order modes have been documented individually, the fundamental spontaneous transition from an isotropic zero order base state to a first order propulsion state is hard to observe experimentally, as the setup of the experiment usually provides sufficient disturbances to instantaneously set off droplet motion. By a non-invasive temperature driven crossing of the critical \Pen{} threshold, this is now possible, and, as we have demonstrated by chemical and flow signatures, even quantifiable.

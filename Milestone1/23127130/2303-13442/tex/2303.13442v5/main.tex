\section{Introduction}
Active matter is defined by the nonlinear conversion of free energy on the molecular scale into macroscopic dynamics~\cite{bowick2022_symmetry}: these nonlinear dynamics pose a challenge to the control of active agents, as small changes in system parameters can crucially tip the system over into a new dynamic equilibrium, for example from metastable inactivity to a state of directed motility.
More so, like a sorcerer's apprentice~\cite{goethe1798_zauberlehrling} we find that stopping this motion is not a trivial task; after all, one is required to deplete an energy reservoir or reverse a dynamic instability~\cite{obyrne2022_time}. 
This kind of control is important in the design and study of artificial and biological microswimmers, their theoretical modeling, experimental realization, and, ultimately, to provide design principles and dynamic control for technological application \cite{tu2017_motion,fusi2023_achieving}.
\par
Autophoretic particles \cite{bechinger2016_active,moran2019_microswimmers,zhang2021_chemicallypowered,zottl2023_modeling} and, particularly, their experimental counterpart, active droplets propelled by spontaneously self-generated chemophoretic flows \cite{maass2016_swimming,babu2022_motile,birrer2022_we,dwivedi2022_selfpropelled,michelin2023_selfpropulsion,hanczyc2007_fatty,thutupalli2011_swarming,peddireddy2012_solubilization,izri2014_selfpropulsion,herminghaus2014_interfacial}, 
are popular active matter models driven by purely physicochemical mechanisms, with typical sizes ranging between $\approx \SI{30}{\um}$ up to several hundred \SI{}{\um}. 
Generally, their dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless P\'eclet number $\Pen{}=U_cR/D$ representing the ratio of advective and diffusive transport of chemical fuel~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous}, with $U_c$, $R$ and $D$ quantifying the characteristic flow speed, droplet radius and the fuel's diffusivity. With increasing \Pen{}, autophoretic particles first transition  from \textit{passive} isotropic chemical conversion to \textit{active} self-propulsion, and further from persistent to unsteady motion via a sequence of broken symmetries and interfacial flow modes of increasing complexity~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,izri2014_selfpropulsion,suga2018_selfpropelled,izzet2020_tunable,meredith2020_predatorprey,hokmabad2021_emergence,suda2021_straightcurvilinear}.
\par
Recent studies have investigated the control of speed and dynamic states of such microswimmers in response to externally applied stimuli such as temperature \cite{tu2017_selfpropelled,cholakova2021_rechargeable} or illumination \cite{florea2014_photochemopropulsion,kaneko2017_phototactic,xiao2018_moving,lancia2019_reorientation,alvarez2021_reconfigurable,ryabchun2022_runandhalt,benzion2022_cooperation,vankesteren2023_selfpropelling}.
On heating, physical intuition might suggest that motion should accelerate and destabilize, either by the increase of translational and rotational diffusion with decreasing viscosity, or by increased activity from the molecular thermodynamics driving the motion. %FIG S5
However, the nonlinear dynamics of self-organized activity can drive counter-intuitive effects, as we have previously found for active droplets which destabilize with increasing viscosity due to an increase in \Pen{}~\cite{hokmabad2021_emergence}. 
\par
In this study, we explore another counter-intuitive response, this time to increasing temperature. We study active droplets using a temperature sensitive combination of co-surfactants in aqueous solution as a fuel medium. With  increasing ambient temperature we find a transition between distinct dynamic states from unsteady to oscillatory to steady, straight swimming to eventual arrest, which is reversible and cyclic with temperature. Notably, by this method we are able to drive \Pen{} across the critical activity threshold: we experimentally observe, live and in situ, the fundamental first symmetry breaking of the inactive isotropic base state into directed self-propulsion, analyzing both chemical and hydrodynamic fields.
 This observation requires an undisturbed, unchanged ambient fuel medium, which we engineer by exploiting temperature dependent surfactant-polymer interactions~\cite{tam2006_insights} that were previously not considered in active droplets - opening new design possibilities to control the motion of micro-droplets as active agents in smart materials driven by purely physicochemical mechanisms~\cite{zhang2021_autonomous}.

\end{figure*}
\par
Our experimental system consists of oil droplets (CB15) immersed in an aqueous solution of the ionic surfactant tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) at 9-1\SI{5}{\wtpc} (267--\SI{445}{\milli\molar}) and the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127  (PF127) at \SI{4}{\wtpc}, or \SI{3}{\milli\molar}. 
\par
CB15 droplets self-propel reliably in supramicellar solutions of pure TTAB above \SI{5}{\wtpc}~\cite{jin2017_chemotaxis,hokmabad2021_emergence}. Briefly put, the swimming is due to oil diffusing from the droplet into TTAB micelles~\cite{peddireddy2012_solubilization,herminghaus2014_interfacial,izzet2020_tunable}, which removes surfactant from the droplet posterior, while the anterior is replenished by the advection of fresh surfactant (Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}b). The key point here is that the empty micelles at the anterior are less thermodynamically stable than the oil-filled ones at the posterior~\cite{izzet2020_tunable,rosen2012_surfactants}: in consequence the critical micelle concentration is higher in front of a moving droplet. The resulting self-enhancing surface tension gradient drives the droplet forward until it is dissolved. Typically, a CB15 droplet of diameter \SI{50}{\um} will swim in \SI{5}{\wtpc} TTAB for 1-2 hours.   Based on this mechanism, one can define a P\'eclet number \Pen\ of droplet activity that increases with viscosity, droplet radius  and surfactant concentration, i.e. chemical activity~\cite{izri2014_selfpropulsion,izzet2020_tunable,hokmabad2021_emergence,hokmabad2022_spontaneously,suda2021_straightcurvilinear}.  In a surfactant solution where all micelles are oil-saturated, droplets would not propel, and they are are repelled by gradients in filled and attracted by gradients in empty micelles~\cite{jin2017_chemotaxis}. We may in this sense regard empty TTAB micelles as fresh, and oil-filled ones as spent fuel.
\par
PF127 is a nonionic triblock copolymer surfactant that in a pure aqueous solution forms micelles with a hydrophobic core of propylene oxide (PPO) and an outer shell of hydrated ethylene oxide (PEO) \cite{alexandridis1994_micellization,wanka1994_phase,bohorquez1999_study,stoeber2006_passive,jalaal2016_rheology,jalaal2018_gelcontrolled} above the critical micelle temperature,  $\text{CMT}\approx\SI{21}{\celsius}$ at $\SI{4}{\wtpc}$ PF127~\cite{bohorquez1999_study}. 
In the presence of ionic co-surfactants like TTAB, which bind strongly with PF127, mixed TTAB/PF127 aggregates form (\figref{fig:setup}a, Supplement \ref{SIsec:mixedmicelles}, Figs.\ \ref{SIfig:DLS}, \ref{SIfig:Zaverage} and \ref{SIfig:DSC}), with excess TTAB forming single-species micelles \cite{nambam2012_effects,hecht1994_interaction,li2001_binding,tam2006_insights}. 
It has been found \cite{li2001_binding} that the TTAB binding capacity of PF127 is amplified with increasing temperature, due to an increasing dehydration of the PPO blocks (hydrophobic effect~\cite{butt2003_physics,alexandridis1994_micellization}).


Under our experimental conditions, we expect a significant coverage of TTAB at the interface (Supplement \figref{SIfig:anchoring}).  Furthermore, CB15 droplets are completely immotile and hardly solubilize in pure PF127 solutions (Supplement \figref{SIfig:dissolution}), while in a mixed TTAB/PF127 medium self-propelling at speeds $\approx\SI{20}{\um/\second}$, comparable to experiments in pure TTAB solutions (cf. \cite{jin2017_chemotaxis,hokmabad2021_emergence} and Supplement \figref{SIfig:ttab}). We therefore regard TTAB as the primary surfactant mediating the solubilization and the interfacial gradients driving the droplet motion. This activity is controlled by PF127 binding and releasing TTAB micelles in the bulk medium (Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}a,b).
Thus, the \Pen{} of droplet activity \textit{decreases} with \textit{increasing} temperature, as an increasing fraction of TTAB is bound in mixed micelles.

According to literature on the composition of PF127/TTAB aggregates \cite{hecht1994_interaction,li2001_binding,hecht1995_interaction}, the amount of bound TTAB in our swimming medium should exceed $\SI{1}{\wtpc}$ and further increase with temperature, which is on the order of the amounts required ($<\SI{5}{\wtpc}$) to suppress droplet motility~\cite{herminghaus2014_interfacial,hokmabad2021_emergence}, as observed in the experiments we show below (see also Supplement \figref{SIfig:swimming}). 
We further note that the swimming medium is Newtonian, with only weakly temperature dependent viscosity (Supplement \figref{SIfig:viscosity}). The Stokes-Einstein diffusion coefficient for a particle of radius $\SI{25}{\um}$ is $D<\SI{1e-2}{\um^2/s}$, such that we can neglect Brownian motion within the duration of observation.

\end{figure*}
%
We begin with an overview of the general swimming dynamics taken from wide-field video microscopy under changing the ambient temperature, and for a range of TTAB concentrations.
The setup contains a quasi-2D microfluidic cell on a temperature controlled stage (\figref{fig:setup}c). 
\figref{fig:traj}a (Movie S1) plots a trajectory color-coded once by speed and once by temperature, recorded at a set heating/cooling rate of \SI{1}{\kelvin/\min}, using a swimming medium containing \SI{10}{\wtpc} TTAB.
\par
We start at $T \approx \SI{15}{\celsius}< \text{CMT}$. 
Below $T_\text{straight} = \SI{22}{\celsius}$, the droplet meanders, i.e. periodically reorients. Above, the motion is straight, gradually slows down and eventually stops at $T_\text{stop} \approx \SI{27}{\celsius}$. 
During a subsequent cooling ramp, the droplet remains immotile down to a significantly lower temperature $T_\text{start} \approx \SI{17}{\celsius}$, where it abruptly starts to meander again. 
\par
As well as to temperature, the swimming dynamics are susceptible to the TTAB concentration. Previous studies on reference systems using a single surfactant species as fuel found a transition from straight to reorienting to unsteady swimming~\cite{izzet2020_tunable} with increasing fuel concentration: with activity, the flow speed $U_c$ increases, and therefore \Pen{}. Alternatively, similar transitions have been found in experiment if \Pen{} was raised via the droplet size or the viscosity of the swimming medium~\cite{suda2021_straightcurvilinear,hokmabad2021_emergence,hokmabad2022_spontaneously}.  
These dynamics fit into the canonical model for isotropic autophoretic particles~\cite{michelin2023_selfpropulsion,michelin2013_spontaneous,izri2014_selfpropulsion,morozov2019_nonlinear,morozov2020_adsorption,suda2021_straightcurvilinear}, which describes fuel consumption at a spherical interface via a hydrodynamic advection-diffusion model non-dimensionalized by \Pen{}. The solution ansatz, in the weakly non-linear limit, decomposes the flow and chemical fields into a series of higher order modes in the interfacial flow and chemical fields, with associated critical \Pen{} and growth rates. With increasing \Pen{}, starting from the isotropic base, $n=0$, higher modes like dipolar, $n=1$, and quadrupolar, $n=2$ are consecutively excited. At very high \Pen{}, numerical studies predict true chaos due to the nonlinearity of the underlying problem~\cite{li2022_swimming,hu2022_spontaneous}.
\par 
We have previously investigated the relation between these interfacial modes and straight, meandering and unsteady swimming via dual channel microscopy~\cite{hokmabad2021_emergence}: here, \textit{straight swimming} at barely supercritical $\Pen\sim 4$ corresponds to a pure dipolar interfacial flow structure, \textit{meandering} at intermediate $\Pen\sim 30$ is primarily dipolar with intermittent excitation of a quadrupolar mode that leads to smooth reorientation, while at high $\Pen\gtrsim 300$ the extensile quadrupolar mode dominates, with only short propulsive dipolar intervals, causing a characteristic \textit{unsteady} `stop-and-go' motion.  


\par
Adding the PF127 co-surfactant does not appear to change these dynamics at constant low temperature qualitatively, since we find a similar transition from meandering to unsteady motion (Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}, Movie S2) with increasing TTAB concentration.  We have summarized these swimming dynamics  in a map spanned by temperature and surfactant concentration in \figref{fig:traj}b.
With increasing temperature, we observe a universal transition via straight swimming to eventual arrest. We posit that the temperature dependent TTAB depletion lowers \Pen{} below the critical thresholds of higher order interfacial modes, down to $n=1$ for straight swimming and finally $n=0$, below the fundamental advection-diffusion instability. We do not provide a quantitative estimate of \Pen{} following~\cite{hokmabad2021_emergence}, as we cannot quantify the temperature dependence of the underlying physical chemistry parameters.
Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}b also shows a general trend of the transition temperatures to increase with TTAB concentration:  
for the droplet to arrest, more TTAB needs to be removed from the swimming medium. We found the stop/start hysteresis noted above for all TTAB concentrations in use (Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}c).
\par
These state transitions are well reversible with temperature. The experiment shown in \figref{fig:traj}e-g and Movie S3 was recorded at a faster rate of \SI{10}{\kelvin/\min} to permit multiple heating and cooling cycles, with dynamics similar to the system cooled at slower rates. \figref{fig:traj}e and f show the droplet trajectory color coded by temperature and a corresponding plot of speed over time. The initial motion is recovered after each heating and cooling cycle, apart from a very gradual decrease in maximum speed which we may attribute to droplet shrinkage. The residual motion in the lab frame at peak heating, specifically during the first cycle, appears to be drift in the swimming medium (SI Fig.~S13).  We have further analyzed speed versus temperature in \figref{fig:traj}g, and found a  hysteresis cycle with a delayed re-onset of motion reproducible over multiple heating/cooling ramps. The sample in Movie S3 contained three larger droplets ($d\approx\SI{60}{\um}$): \Pen\ should increase with the droplet radius, and, correspondingly, these droplets switch from reorienting to straight motion at later times and therefore higher temperatures.

\subsection{Chemical and flow fields}

(c) Snapshots of droplet chemical trails at different temperatures as marked by I-IV in (a) and (b).
		See also Movie S4. \SI{250}{\um} scale bars and color maps as defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}.\label{fig:fluo}}
	
\end{figure*}
We continue with a discussion of the chemical dynamics during the droplet arrest, to motivate the hysteresis in the re-onset of motion; and of the corresponding flow field to investigate the interfacial mode evolution.
\par
The self-generated field of spent fuel in the local environment affects the droplet motility, both via chemorepulsive gradients ~\cite{izzet2020_tunable,hokmabad2021_emergence} and via accumulation of filled micelles, which suppresses the interfacial activity~\cite{ramesh2023_interfacial}. We visualize this field by doping the droplet with the fluorescent dye Nile Red~\cite{hokmabad2022_chemotactic}, which co-moves with the oil phase into the filled micelles, and extract the fluorescence intensity $I$ from videomicroscopy data (Movie S4). In Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}, we analyze these chemical dynamics for one droplet during a heating and cooling cycle, showing a speed-coded trajectory (a), a kymograph of $I$ around the droplet perimeter, $\theta$ vs. time and recorded temperature (b), and micrographs at the times marked I--IV (c). 
\par
During heating, the droplet transitions from unsteady to straight swimming to immotility (Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}a, and Movie S4. We note again slight drift in the swimming medium, see SI section 10).  In the kymograph  (Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}b), at $T < \SI{26}{\celsius}$, the band corresponding to the chemical trail translates in the angular space due to the reorientation of the droplet (I). At $T \approx \SI{26}{\celsius}$, the droplet slows down and comes to a halt. As the system is cooled down to $T \approx \SI{21}{\celsius}$, the inactive droplet still solubilizes isotropically, and oil-filled micelles accumulate around the perimeter $\theta$. Correspondingly, the band in the kymograph widens over the entire angular space (II). We know from experiments in pure TTAB media that these accumulations locally suppress the interfacial activity~\cite{ramesh2023_interfacial,morozov2020_adsorption}, as the density of empty micelle `fuel' is reduced - it follows that in the presence of oil-filled micelles even more mixed micelles need to disintegrate to restart activity. Thus, the motility transition temperature is lowered, here to $T_\text{start} = \SI{16.8\pm 0.2}{\celsius}$, where the droplet escapes the oil-filled micelle cloud (III) and swims away (IV). 
\par

\end{figure*}
Before discussing the flow fields, we note two more consequences of oil saturation. First, the hysteresis in \figref{fig:traj}c is reduced by several degrees if the system is not heated to full droplet arrest, but it is never entirely suppressed (Appendix Fig.\figref{SIfig:incomplete}).
This can be understood as follows:  during the late stage of the heating ramp, the droplet is already dispersing oil into its local environment by recirculation, starting from the posterior  - an effect we have also found in self-throttling pumping droplets in \cite{ramesh2023_interfacial}. During heating, the droplets will come to a stop even before the interfacial activity has fully ceded (see the discussion of \figref{fig:piv}b below), and self-propulsion would always need to restart from inside an oil-rich region as shown in \figref{fig:fluo}c-II.

Second, the regime of straight swimming appears to be highly localized on cooling (Movies S1 and S6): the droplet switches after a few seconds to a meandering motion (Movie S1). We argue here that outside the strongly localized cloud of spent fuel (see Movie S4 and Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}c), more empty TTAB micelles have been released, such that the droplet experiences a higher \Pen{} once it escapes its self-generated local trap. We note that during this escape there is a radial gradient from filled to empty micelles, which would also locally rectify the droplet motion.

To analyze the mode evolution causing arrest and sudden onset of motion during heating and cooling (Movie S5), we added tracer colloids to the oil phase, performed high resolution bright field videomicroscopy and evaluated the internal flow field $\vec{u}(x,y)$ by particle image velocimetry (PIV) at a series of equilibrated set temperatures. \figref{fig:piv}b shows the evolution of $\vec{u}$ with increasing temperature. At $T = \SI{16}{\celsius}$, we see a  mixed  dipolar and quadrupolar flow field ($n=1,2$) corresponding to the meandering trajectory in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj}a~\cite{suda2021_straightcurvilinear,hokmabad2021_emergence}. At even higher temperature, $T = \SI{21}{\celsius}$, the droplet swims straight, \Pen{} decreases and the flow field is purely dipolar ($n=1$).  As the droplet begins to slow down, an inactive region spreads from the droplet posterior ($T = \SI{24}{\celsius}$). Finally ($T = \SI{27}{\celsius}$), just before the droplet stops ($n=0$), only a small region at the droplet anterior is active \cite{ramesh2023_interfacial}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}II, the local environment isotropically saturates with spent fuel while the droplet is immotile.
\par
\subsection{Simulations}
The gradual increase of \Pen{} during cooling now allows us to directly observe the fundamental first transition from the immotile base state to self-propelled motion~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,michelin2023_selfpropulsion}. This can be motivated theoretically using hydrodynamic advection-diffusion models, canonically set out by Michelin et al.~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous} as follows:

A spherical particle of radius $R$ is immersed in a fluid medium containing a chemical fuel at concentration $c$. At negligible Reynolds numbers, the flow is governed by the Stokes equations, $\mu\nabla^2\vec{u}=\nabla p$, $\nabla\cdot\vec{u}=0.$  The chemical field is coupled by an advection-diffusion equation, 

\begin{align}|\Pen|\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla c\right) &= \nabla^2c, &
\Pen{}&\equiv \frac{\mathcal{AM}R}{D^2},\label{eq:adv_diff}			
\end{align}
and by the particle consuming fuel at its boundary, \mbox{$\partial_t c(R) =-\mathcal{A}$}.  The P\'eclet number is set by the activity $\mathcal{A}$, mobility $\mathcal{M}$ and diffusivity $D$ of the chemical species and the particle radius $R$. Using a decomposition into squirmer modes and a linear stability analysis around the isotropic base state, $n=0$, the authors of \cite{michelin2013_spontaneous} find a transition to the propulsive dipolar state, $n=1$, above a threshold value of $\Pen{}=4$.

The mixed surfactant approach allows us to observe the growth of the dipolar mode in situ and analyzing it in the context of the canonical model. We performed a simulation of the interfacial instability, following standard protocols~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,picella2022_confined}, but here solving for the full 3D problem and adapted to our cell geometry (see Appendix~\ref{SIsec:numerics}). We compared our simulation to the experimental droplet speed $V$ at the onset of motion, with good agreement between re-dimensionalized numerical and experimental results (Fig.~\ref{fig:piv}a, Movie S6). For one, the timescales for the onset of motion, of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{1}{\s})$, and the evolution of the steady state at $V_\infty$, of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{5}{\s})$, are similar. Second, there is a characteristic overshoot in $V/V_\infty$ shortly after the onset of motion, common to various numerical approaches~\cite{schmitt2013_swimming,peng2023_weakly}, and already noted as `surprising'~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous}. This initial push could be provided by the diffusive cloud of consumed or depleted fuel around the droplet (see eg. Fig.~\ref{fig:fluo}c-II), which causes a radial chemorepulsive gradient. 
Such gradients would be enhanced in confined geometries~\cite{anderson1989_colloid, picella2022_confined}: simulations have found the overshoot to increase with confinement~\cite{picella2022_confined}, and we find a similar tendency in our experimental data (Fig.\ \ref{fig:piv}(a)).

\section{Conclusions and outlook}
Tuning the dynamics of self-propelling droplets by temperature-driven surfactant interactions provides a promising framework to regulate micelle-mediated~\cite{babu2021_acceleration,wentworth2022_chemically} active droplet dynamics: we can now control self-propulsion from an unsteady or meandering state over quasi-ballistic propulsion to full arrest without needing to change the chemistry of the system. The gait control is encoded in the swimming medium and does not require complex micro-engineered swimmer design. Since the hydrophobic effect underlying the temperature dependent complex formation is entropy driven and similar aggregation effects are established for numerous surfactant-polymer combinations~\cite{nambam2012_effects,parmar2014_pluronic,li2001_binding,tam2006_insights,hecht1994_interaction}, this control method likely applies to active droplet models driven by micellar solubilization in general, and could be tested in further studies. For example, autophoretic droplet propulsion is known for SDS surfactant, DEP oil~\cite{izzet2020_tunable,thutupalli2018_flowinduced}, and a large number of oil/surfactant combinations tabulated in reviews~\cite{birrer2022_we}, and one could tune the transition temperatures by using different pluronics like PF88 or PF123~\cite{hecht1995_kinetic}. The transitions are almost fully reversible, excepting a slight reduction in peak speed that can be attributed to droplet shrinkage. 

Our hypothesis -- fuel binding by thermosensitive polymer cosurfactants --  does not account for the dynamics of adsorbed polymer at the interface, which might also be temperature dependent. However, we argue that these effects are, if present, secondary to the binding and release of TTAB in the swimming medium: generally, the desorption kinetics of large polymers are assumed to be exceedingly slow~\cite{butt2003_physics}.  
Thus, if these kinetics were the main drivers of thermoresponsive mode switching, it would not be consistent with our observations of cyclic reversibility and the fast response to changed external conditions, i.e. the instantaneous onset of motion in Fig.~\ref{fig:piv}a and particularly the fast, local adaptation to the fuel-rich medium outside the saturation area.

\par 
Our experiments fit into the framework of the  canonical theory for autophoretic particles, where the observed dynamic regimes correspond to interfacial modes becoming unstable with increasing or decreasing P\'eclet number. 
\par
While such higher order modes have been documented individually, the fundamental spontaneous transition from an isotropic zero order base state to a first order propulsion state is hard to observe experimentally, as the setup of the experiment usually provides sufficient disturbances to instantaneously set off droplet motion. By a non-invasive temperature driven crossing of the critical \Pen{} threshold, this is now experimentally observable in both chemical and flow signatures. 
As the idealized theory cited in eq.~\ref{eq:adv_diff} and its extensions are widely used in numerical work on autophoretic swimmers in complex geometries and confinement, modeling many body interactions, or chaotic dynamics in a huge parameter space, it is important to test its predictive power in an experimental context. The inactive-active transition analyzed in Fig.~\ref{fig:piv} experimentally matches  a common numerical validation case~\cite{michelin2013_spontaneous,hu2022_spontaneous,chen2021_instabilities,peng2023_weakly,wang2024_selfpropulsion} and highlights the importance of chemical history and spatial confinement in matching numerics and experiment~\cite{picella2022_confined,deblois2021_swimming,peng2023_weakly}.

The approach of depletant-mediated state control can be combined with a number of methods to guide and functionalize autophoretic swimmers in 2D and 3D~\cite{thutupalli2018_flowinduced,kruger2016_dimensionality,lancia2019_reorientation}
Solubilization based swimmers are known to exhibit chemo-, rheo-, electro-, photo- and magnetotaxis~\cite{jin2017_chemotaxis,moerman2017_solutemediated,lagzi2010_maze,dey2022_oscillatory,dwivedi2021_rheotaxis,buness2024_electrotaxis,ryabchun2022_runandhalt,xiao2018_moving,florea2014_photochemopropulsion,wagner2024_magnetotaxis,khan2024_perturbing}. Specifically, photo- and magnetotaxis are engineered by a modification of the oil phase like doping, colloidal inclusions or liquid crystalline phases, and therefore independently tunable from the fuel binding in the outer medium. 





The co-surfactant based fuel depletion approach should also apply to solubilization based models that do not activate by spontaneous symmetry breaking of an isotropic base state. These could be ab initio asymmetric Janus droplets, either realized by compound droplets~\cite{balaj2020_reconfigurable}, or by adding colloidal patches to the interface~\cite{ikcheon2021_interfaciallyadsorbed}, which would also be arrested by fuel binding.

Moreover, it would be compatible with cargo functionalization - nematic self propelling droplets are stable carriers of configurable aqueous compartments which can be released by dissolution, nematic phase transition or coalescence~\cite{poulin1997_novel,hokmabad2019_topological,wang2024_selftimed}.
We also anticipate that it would inhibit activity in larger droplet-based autophoretic micropumps~\cite{ramesh2023_interfacial}.


Finally, tunable activity can be used to influence aggregation and collective behavior. Autophoretic droplets are known to show complex collective behavior depending on number densities and state of confinement~\cite{thutupalli2011_swarming,moerman2017_solutemediated,hokmabad2022_chemotactic,kruger2016_dimensionality,thutupalli2018_flowinduced,meredith2020_predatorprey}. We note that the cosurfactant mediated arrest mechanism is conceptually different from the self trapping observed previously in single surfactant systems~\cite{hokmabad2022_chemotactic}, where active droplets were trapped in self generated cages of chemorepulsive trails of oil-filled micelles, such that the swimmer ensemble is creating its own `chemical landscape'. The latter is a collective phenomenon, the trapping is transient and the $\Pen$ based state of activity is not modified. This chemorepulsive effect is also observable under PF127 addition: in samples with a higher number density, we have found multiple instances of repulsion interactions (SI section 11). Another collective effect that could be controlled by fuel depletion is the formation of `hovercraft' clusters under gravity in 3D reservoirs~\cite{kruger2016_dimensionality,thutupalli2018_flowinduced,hokmabad2022_spontaneously}: droplets self assemble into crystalline arrangements floating above the container bottom, stabilized by a balance of active upward motion and downward sedimentation. If the activity is suppressed by fuel depletion, these aggregates would sink to the bottom and disintegrate.

In the context of smart, active materials, controllable dynamic states are crucial for programmable motility, function, sensing and adaptation~\cite{alvarez2021_reconfigurable,vankesteren2023_selfpropelling}. In the multi-scale and multidisciplinary study of synthetic microswimmers presented here, three
distinct macroscopic motile states emerge from the nano-scale control of molecular assembly, 
and we observe a counter-intuitive effect of dynamic arrest upon heating. These state transitions are driven by very general thermodynamic principles - our findings therefore offer a general physico-chemical design framework for the local and global control of synthetic active matter, beyond the system used here, and offer new avenues to further manipulate different types of active agents from the single to the collective scale.

One of the challenges in tailoring the dynamics of active, self-propelling agents lies in arresting and releasing these agents at will. Here, we present an experimental system of active droplets with thermally controllable and reversible states of motion, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states depend on the Péclet number of the chemical reaction driving the motion, which we can tune by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as a fuel medium. We quantify the droplet dynamics  by analysing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles.  In the context of these models, we are able to observe in situ the fundamental first transition between the isotropic, immotile base state and self-propelled motility.

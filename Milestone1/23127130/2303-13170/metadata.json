    "abstract": "The $β$-encoder is an analog circuit that converts an input signal $x \\in [0,1]$ into a finite bit stream $\\{b_i\\}$. The bits $\\{b_i\\}$ are correlated and therefore are not immediately suitable for random number generation, but they can be used to generate bits $\\{a_i\\}$ that are (nearly) uniformly distributed. In this article we study two such methods. In the first part the bits $\\{a_i\\}$ are defined as the digits of the base-2 representation of the original input $x$. Under the assumption that there is no noise in the amplifier we then study a question posed by Jitsumatsu and Matsumura on how many bits $b_1, \\ldots, b_m$ are needed to correctly determine the first $n$ bits $a_1,\\ldots,a_n$. In the second part we show this method fails for random amplification factors. Nevertheless, even in this case, nearly uniformly distributed bits can still be generated from $b_1,\\ldots,b_m$ using modern cryptographic techniques.",

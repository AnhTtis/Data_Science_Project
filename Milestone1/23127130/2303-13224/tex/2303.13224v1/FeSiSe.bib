journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {We present here the thermoelectric properties of olivine-type Fe2GeCh4 (Ch  =  S, Se and Te) using the linear augmented plane wave method based on first principles density functional calculations. The calculated transport properties using the semi-local Boltzmann transport equation reveal very high thermopower for both S and Se-based compounds compared to their Te counterparts. The main reason for this high thermopower is the quasi-flat nature of the bands at the valence and conduction band edges. The calculated thermopower of Fe2GeS4 is in good agreement with the experimental reports at room temperature, with the carrier concentration around 1018–1019cm−3. All the investigated systems show an anisotropic nature in their electrical conductivity, resulting in a value less than the order of 102 along the a-axis compared to the b- and c-axes. Among the studied compounds, Fe2GeS4 and Fe2GeSe4 emerge as promising candidates with good thermoelectric performance.}

By exact diagonalization and extrapolation, we show that the elementary excitation spectrum is the same for total spins Stot = 0 and 1, but not for Stot = 2, and has a gap only in the interval 0.4874(1) ⩽ Jbb/Jbv ⩽ 1.53(1). The gap, known to be dispersionless for Jbb = Jbv, is found to acquire increasing k-dependence as Jbb/Jbv moves away from unity.},

abstract={The origin of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic materials is one of the most intriguing aspects in condensed matter physics and has been a controversial topic for a long time. Recent studies indicate that the intrinsic AHE is closely related to the Berry curvature of occupied electronic states. In a magnetic Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry, there are significant contributions to Berry curvature around Weyl nodes, possibly leading to a large intrinsic AHE. Here, we report the quite large AHE in the half-metallic ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2 single crystal. By systematically mapping out the electronic structure of Co3Sn2S2 both theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the intrinsic AHE from the Weyl fermions near the Fermi energy is dominating. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity depends linearly on the magnetization and can be reproduced by theoretical simulation, in which the Weyl nodes monotonically move with the constrained magnetic moment on Co atom.},

number={7904},
pages={59-64},
abstract={Electronic nematicity, in which rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken by electronic degrees of freedom, has been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in correlated quantum fluids including high-temperature superconductors and quantum Hall systems1,2. Notably, the electronic nematicity in high-temperature superconductors exhibits an intriguing entanglement with superconductivity, generating complicated superconducting pairing and intertwined electronic orders. Recently, an unusual competition between superconductivity and a charge-density-wave (CDW) order has been found in the AV3Sb5 (A{\thinspace}={\thinspace}K, Rb,{\thinspace}Cs) family with two-dimensional vanadium kagome nets3--8. Whether these phenomena involve electronic nematicity is still unknown. Here we report evidence for the existence of electronic nematicity in CsV3Sb5, using a combination of elastoresistance measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S). The temperature-dependent elastoresistance coefficient (m11 minus m12) and NMR spectra demonstrate that, besides a C2 structural distortion of the 2a0{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}2a0 supercell owing to out-of-plane modulation, considerable nematic fluctuations emerge immediately below the CDW transition (approximately 94{\thinspace}kelvin) and finally a nematic transition occurs below about 35{\thinspace}kelvin. The STM experiment directly visualizes the C2-structure-pinned long-range nematic order below the nematic transition temperature, suggesting a novel nematicity described by a three-state Potts model. Our findings indicate an intrinsic electronic nematicity in the normal state of CsV3Sb5, which sets a new paradigm for revealing the role of electronic nematicity on pairing mechanism in unconventional superconductors.},

Each Fe2+ ion is described as a 5D state, and crystal field, spin-orbit coupling, isotropic Heisenberg exchange, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and external magnetic fields are taken into account. Many-particle interactions are treated in the mean-field approximation. Fundamental physical constants such as crystal-field splittings and exchange integrals are fitted to reproduce experimental results. Within this model very good agreement between theory and experiment was obtained. It is shown that the canting of magnetic moments at inversion centres is a consequence of competition between the crystal field and strong antiferromagnetic coupling to the moments in mirror planes, each preferring different orientations. The ratio of these effects is temperature dependent and explains the evolution of the canting angle. Further high-field magnetizations are determined and with the field in the (010) direction a field-induced phase transition and the magnetic phase diagram are predicted. The temperature dependence of quadrupole splitting in Mossbauer experiments is also calculated and compared with experimental results.}

No crystallographic phase transition was observed between 295 and 10K while two magnetic transitions were found. One transition around 127K denotes a change from the paramagnetic (P) to an antiferromagnetic (AF) state while at 30K the appearance of a ferrimagnetic (Fi) state is observed. Different magnetic models are presented. Relations are found between indirect magnetic interactions, on the one hand, and the Fe(4a), Fe(4c) and sulfur positions, on the other hand, and relations between the crystal structure and the magnetic models are given. The neutron powder diffraction results are compared with results, already reported, of Mössbauer and magnetization measurements.}

abstract={Elucidating the nature of the magnetic ground state of iron-based superconductors is of paramount importance in unveiling the mechanism behind their high-temperature superconductivity. Until recently, it was thought that superconductivity emerges only from an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic stripe phase, which can in principle be described in terms of either localized or itinerant spins. However, we recently reported that tetragonal symmetry is restored inside the magnetically ordered state of certain hole-doped compounds, revealing the existence of a new magnetic phase at compositions close to the onset of superconductivity. Here, we present M{\"o}ssbauer data that show that half of the iron sites in this tetragonal phase are non-magnetic, establishing conclusively the existence of a novel magnetic ground state with a non-uniform magnetization that is inconsistent with localized spins. Instead, this state is naturally explained as the interference between two commensurate spin-density waves, a rare example of collinear double-Q magnetic order. Our results demonstrate the itinerant character of the magnetism of the iron pnictides, and the primary role played by magnetic degrees of freedom in determining their phase diagram.},

abstract={Kagome-lattices of 3d-transition metals hosting Weyl/Dirac fermions and topological flat bands exhibit non-trivial topological characters and novel quantum phases, such as the anomalous Hall effect and fractional quantum Hall effect. With consideration of spin--orbit coupling and electron correlation, several instabilities could be induced. The typical characters of the electronic structure of a kagome lattice, i.e., the saddle point, Dirac-cone, and flat band, around the Fermi energy (EF) remain elusive in magnetic kagome materials. We present the experimental observation of the complete features in ferromagnetic kagome layers of YMn6Sn6 helically coupled along the c-axis, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We demonstrate a Dirac dispersion near EF, which is predicted by spin-polarized theoretical calculations, carries an intrinsic Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in transport measurements. In addition, a flat band and a saddle point with a high density of states near EF are observed. These multi-sets of kagome features are of orbital-selective origin and could cause multi-orbital magnetism. The Dirac fermion, flat band and saddle point in the vicinity of EF open an opportunity in manipulating the topological properties in magnetic materials.},

abstract={A kagome lattice of 3d transition metal ions is a versatile platform for correlated topological phases hosting symmetry-protected electronic excitations and magnetic ground states. However, the paradigmatic states of the idealized two-dimensional kagome lattice---Dirac fermions and flat bands---have not been simultaneously observed. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and de Haas--van Alphen quantum oscillations to reveal coexisting surface and bulk Dirac fermions as well as flat bands in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeSn, which has spatially decoupled kagome planes. Our band structure calculations and matrix element simulations demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from in-plane localized Fe-3d orbitals, and evidence that the coexisting Dirac surface state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized two-dimensional Dirac fermions due to spin-layer locking in FeSn. The prospect to harness these prototypical excitations in a kagome lattice is a frontier of great promise at the confluence of topology, magnetism and strongly correlated physics.},

abstract={Electronic systems with flat bands are predicted to be a fertile ground for hosting emergent phenomena including unconventional magnetism and superconductivity1--15, but materials that manifest this feature are rare. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the atomically resolved electronic states and their magnetic response in the kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2 (refs.{\thinspace}16--20). We observe a pronounced peak at the Fermi level, which we identify as arising from the kinetically frustrated kagome flat band. On increasing the magnetic field up to {\textpm}8{\thinspace}T, this state exhibits an anomalous magnetization-polarized many-body Zeeman shift, dominated by an orbital moment that is opposite to the field direction. Such negative magnetism is induced by spin--orbit-coupling quantum phase effects21--25 tied to non-trivial flat band systems. We image the flat band peak, resolve the associated negative magnetism and provide its connection to the Berry curvature field, showing that Co3Sn2S2 is a rare example of a kagome magnet where the low-energy physics can be dominated by the spin--orbit-coupled flat band.},

journal = {Chinese Physics Letters},
abstract = {We report the discovery of superconductivity and detailed normal-state physical properties of RbV3Sb5 single crystals with V kagome lattice. RbV3Sb5 single crystals show a superconducting transition at T c ∼ 0.92 K. Meanwhile, resistivity, magnetization and heat capacity measurements indicate that it exhibits anomalies of properties at T * ∼ 102–103 K, possibly related to the formation of charge ordering state. When T is lower than T *, the Hall coefficient R H undergoes a drastic change and sign reversal from negative to positive, which can be partially explained by the enhanced mobility of hole-type carriers. In addition, the results of quantum oscillations show that there are some very small Fermi surfaces with low effective mass, consistent with the existence of multiple highly dispersive Dirac band near the Fermi energy level.}

abstract = {A large anomalous Hall effect is observed in the triangular antiferromagnet Mn3Ge arising from an intrinsic electronic Berry phase. It is well established that the anomalous Hall effect displayed by a ferromagnet scales with its magnetization. Therefore, an antiferromagnet that has no net magnetization should exhibit no anomalous Hall effect. We show that the noncolinear triangular antiferromagnet Mn3Ge exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect comparable to that of ferromagnetic metals; the magnitude of the anomalous conductivity is ~500 (ohm·cm)−1 at 2 K and ~50 (ohm·cm)−1 at room temperature. The angular dependence of the anomalous Hall effect measurements confirms that the small residual in-plane magnetic moment has no role in the observed effect except to control the chirality of the spin triangular structure. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the large anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Ge originates from a nonvanishing Berry curvature that arises from the chiral spin structure, and that also results in a large spin Hall effect of 1100 (ħ/e) (ohm·cm)−1, comparable to that of platinum. The present results pave the way toward the realization of room temperature antiferromagnetic spintronics and spin Hall effect–based data storage devices.}}

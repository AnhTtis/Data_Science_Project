	abstract="In this chapter, the van de Pol oscillator model is reviewed. The van der Pol oscillator model is an approximation valid for a fairly wide class of oscillators. In practice, this is the only oscillator for which the oscillator harmonics distortion was calculated analytically. Using the harmonics amplitudes, one can find a very important performance parameter, the total harmonic distortion (THD). We describe here how the oscillator can be represented by the corresponding van der Pol model. We give the amplitude calculations, compare the results of calculations and simulations and discuss the results.",

    "abstract": "We describe a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture to learn the flow function of a causal, time-invariant and continuous-time control system from trajectory data. By restricting the class of control inputs to piecewise constant functions, we show that learning the flow function is equivalent to learning the input-to-state map of a discrete-time dynamical system. This motivates the use of an RNN together with encoder and decoder networks which map the state of the system to the hidden state of the RNN and back. We show that the proposed architecture is able to approximate the flow function by exploiting the system's causality and time-invariance. The output of the learned flow function model can be queried at any time instant. We experimentally validate the proposed method using models of the Van der Pol and FitzHugh Nagumo oscillators. In both cases, the results demonstrate that the architecture is able to closely reproduce the trajectories of these two systems. For the Van der Pol oscillator, we further show that the trained model generalises to the system's response with a prolonged prediction time horizon as well as control inputs outside the training distribution. For the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator, we show that the model accurately captures the input-dependent phenomena of excitability.",

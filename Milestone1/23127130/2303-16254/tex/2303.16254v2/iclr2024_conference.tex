% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors' names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows for the high-resolution reconstruction of 3D structures of proteins and other biomolecules. 
%
Successful reconstruction of both shape and movement greatly helps understand the fundamental processes of life.
% 
However, it is still challenging to reconstruct the continuous motions of 3D structures from hundreds of thousands of noisy and randomly oriented 2D cryo-EM images.
% 
Recent advancements use Fourier domain coordinate-based neural networks to continuously model 3D conformations, yet they often struggle to capture local flexible regions accurately.
%
We propose \textit{CryoFormer}, a new approach for continuous heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction.
% 
Our approach leverages an implicit feature volume directly in the real domain as the 3D representation.
%
We further introduce a novel query-based deformation transformer decoder to improve the reconstruction quality.
%
Our approach is capable of refining pre-computed pose estimations and locating flexible regions.
% 
In experiments, our method outperforms current approaches on three public datasets (1 synthetic and 2 experimental) and a new synthetic dataset of PEDV spike protein. The code and new synthetic dataset will be released for better reproducibility of our results. Project page: \url{https://cryoformer.github.io}.

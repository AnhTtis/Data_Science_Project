%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
%
%Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a powerful tool for investigating the 3D structures of proteins and other biomolecules.
High-resolution heterogeneous reconstruction of 3D structures of proteins and other biomolecules using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is essential for understanding fundamental processes of life. 
%
However, it is still challenging to reconstruct the continuous motions of 3D structures from hundreds of thousands of noisy and randomly oriented 2D cryo-EM images.
%
Existing methods based on coordinate-based neural networks show compelling results to model continuous conformations of 3D structures in the Fourier domain, but they suffer from a limited ability to model local flexible regions and lack interpretability.
%
We propose a novel approach, \textit{cryoFormer}, that utilizes a transformer-based network architecture for continuous heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction. We for the first time directly reconstruct continuous conformations
of 3D structures using an implicit feature volume in the 3D spatial domain.
%
A novel deformation transformer decoder further improves reconstruction quality and, more importantly, locates and robustly tackles flexible 3D regions caused by conformations. 
%
In experiments, our method outperforms current approaches on three public datasets (1 synthetic and 2 experimental) and a new synthetic dataset of PEDV spike protein. The code and new synthetic dataset will be released for better reproducibility of our results.  Project page: \url{https://cryoformer.github.io}.

\section{Training Corpus}
\label{app:corpus}
\vspace{-0.5em}

In the following, we describe how the corpus for the simulated paper-reviewer assignment process is generated. 
%
The PC of the \emph{43rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy} conference consists of 165 persons. For each PC member, we construct an archive of papers representative for the person's expertise and interests by crawling their \emph{Google Scholar} profile. In rare cases, this profile is not available and we use the profile from \emph{DBLP computer science bibliography} instead. We sort all papers first by year and then by number of citations to obtain an approximation of the recent research interests. From this list, we remove all papers with no citation and for which we cannot obtain a PDF file (e.g., paywalled files we cannot access). Furthermore, we remove papers that are already used as a target submission. From the remaining list, we select the first 40 papers (if available). 

To construct reviewer archives $\archive_\reviewer$, we randomly sample 20 paper for each reviewer and compile the corpus as the union of these archives. The remaining 20 papers are used to simulate the black-box scenario. Here, we consider different levels of overlaps between 0\% (i.e., no overlap between the training data of the surrogates and target system) and 100\% (i.e., complete overlap).

\section{Hyperparameter Selection}
\label{app:hyperparameters}
\vspace{-0.5em}
In the following, we describe how we determine the hyperparameters of our attack in the two scenarios.

\paragraph{White-box scenario.}
We perform a grid search over 100 randomly sampled targets from all three objectives and optimize parameters as a trade-off between attack efficacy and efficiency. To not overfit to a specific model, we train 8 AutoBid systems on different random seeds and randomly select one system per target. Note that an attacker with full-knowledge could also choose parameters that perform best for a specific target. We set the beam width $\beamwidth = 8 \in \{2^0, \dots, 2^3\}$, step size $\stepsize = 128 \in \{2^5, \dots, 2^8\}$, number of successors $\nosuccessors = 512 \in \{2^7,\dots, 2^{9}\}$, and reviewer window to $\reviewerwindow = 6 \in \{2^1, \dots, 2^3\}$ with offset $\revieweroffset = 3 \in \{0, \dots, 3\}$. The target rank for rejected reviewer is set to $rank^{rej}_{\submission} = 10$ and we consider $\reviewerwordsmax = 5000$ words per reviewer. We run the attack for at most $\maxitr = 1000$ iterations with at most $\switches = 8$ transitions between spaces and a target margin of $\margin = -0.02$. 

\paragraph{Black-box scenario.}
We repeat the grid search and train 8 systems on a surrogate corpus at 70\% overlap. We randomly sample 100 targets from all three objectives and assign each a random surrogate system. We set the beam width $\beamwidth = 4 \in \{2^0, \dots, 2^3\}$, step size $\stepsize = 256 \in \{2^5, \dots, 2^8\}$, number of successors $\nosuccessors = 128 \in \{2^7,\dots, 2^{9}\}$, and reviewer window to $\reviewerwindow = 2 \in \{2^1, \dots, 2^3\}$ with offset $\revieweroffset = 1 \in \{0, \dots, 3\}$. Finally, to increase the robustness of our attack, we set the margin as $\margin = -0.16$. All other parameters are the same as before.

\section{Feature-Space Search}
\label{app:boxplots}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We report the $L_1$ norms of individual attacks exemplary for the selection objective. We consider 8 different assignment system and sample 100 random targets per system (i.\,e., 800 attacks in total).\smallskip

\section{Generalization of Attack}
\label{app:generalizaton}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We empirically evaluate our attack on two conferences with differently sized committees: (a) the \emph{29th USENIX Security Symposium} with 120 reviewers and (b) the \emph{43rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy} conference with a larger committee consisting of 165 reviewers. We simulate the attack for all three objectives and report the aggregated success rate, the median running time, and the median $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ norm.

\resizebox{1\columnwidth}{!}{

IEEE S\&P '22 & 99.67\,\% & 7m~12s & $1115$ & $35$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{center}

\section{Scaling of Target Reviewer}
\label{app:scaling}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We run the attack for different combinations of the number of selected and rejected target reviewers. For each combination, we report the median $L_1$ norm as well as the success rate over 100 targets.

\section{Surrogate Ensembles}
\label{app:surrogate-boxplots}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We report the $L_1$ norms for the black-box scenario with varying sizes of surrogate ensembles. We report the $L_1$ over 100 targets for all three objectives.

\section{Overlap}
\label{app:cp-overlap}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We compare the cross-entropy of reviewer-to-words distributions across models trained on a corpus with different overlaps. We randomly select 10 reviewers and report the mean cross-entropy and standard deviation between 8 models each (i.e., 64 pairs per overlap and reviewer).

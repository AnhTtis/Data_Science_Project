    \caption{\textbf{Feature-problem-space attack.} For a submission $\inputpdf$, we construct an adversarial submission~$\inputpdf'$ that leads to a targeted assignment of reviewers. Our attack alternately switches between \Dom and \F. In step~\stepone, we extract word counts $\submission$ from submission $\inputpdf$, and use a search algorithm to change $\submission$ in~\F to obtain the desired ranking (step~\steptwo). To guide this search, we query the paper-reviewer assignment system for scores (step~\stepthree). Next, we realize the modifications in the problem space~\Dom and manipulate \inputpdf (step~\stepfour). Projecting the resulting submission back to \F, the submission vector will be shifted due to side effects and transformation limitations (step~\stepfive). This shift is considered by continuing the search process from this new position and repeating this process iteratively (step~\stepsix) until we obtain a valid adversarial submission $\inputpdf'$ (step~\stepseven).}

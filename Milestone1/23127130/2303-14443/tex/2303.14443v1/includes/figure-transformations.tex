    \caption{\textbf{Feature-problem-space attack.} We simulate the attack with differently scaled attack budgets $\attackbudgetscale$ (left) and $\switches = 8$ switches. We repeat the experiment (right) with the base budget $\sigma = 1$ and vary $\switches$. For both cases, we randomly select 100 targets from all three objectives that require $\leq 1,000$ changes in $\F$. We report the mean success rate over 8 repetitions.}

    \caption{\textbf{Reviewer words.} Based on the topic model, we associate reviewer with a set of predictive words. Given target reviewer $\tilde{\reviewer}$ and a set of concurring reviewers $\surroundingreviewers = \{\reviewer_1, \reviewer_2\}$, we construct distributions $\reviewerwords^+_{\tilde{\reviewer}, \surroundingreviewers}$ and $\reviewerwords^-_{\tilde{\reviewer}, \surroundingreviewers}$. Sampling from these distributions yield words that are only predictive for reviewer $\tilde{\reviewer}$ respectively reviewers in $\surroundingreviewers$. }

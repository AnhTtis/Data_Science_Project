    "abstract": "We consider a baby--Skyrme model with Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interaction (DMI) and two types of potential terms. The model has a close connection with the vacuum functional of fermions coupled with $O(3)$ nonlinear $\\bm{n}$-fields and with a constant $SU(2)$ gauge background. The energy functional can be derived from the heat-kernel expansion for the fermion determinant. The model possesses normal skyrmions with topological charge $Q = 1$. The restricted version of the model also includes both the weak-compacton case (at the boundary, not continuously differentiable) and genuine-compacton case (continuously differentiable). The model consists of only the Skyrme term, and the DMI provides soliton solutions that are also known as \\textit{skyrmions without any potential}.",

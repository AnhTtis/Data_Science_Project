title = {The Temperature of Atoms in a Magneto-optical Trap},
journal = {Europhysics Letters},
abstract = {A cloud of ultracold atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) has a temperature greater than that of a low-density vapour in the same light field. It has been observed (Drewsen M. et al., Appl. Phys. B, 59 (1994) 283) that this temperature excess is proportional to the cube root of the total number of trapped atoms (N1/3). We present an explanation for this effect in terms of the scattering which arises when photons spontaneously emitted by atoms have an appreciable probability of being reabsorbed within the cloud. This hypothesis has been tested by time-of-flight measurements of the temperature of clouds of atoms released from a MOT into 1-dimensional and 3-dimensional optical molasses in the σ+-σ- and lin ⊥ lin configuration.}

abstract = {A cesium magneto-optical trap operating at a large atomic density in multiple scattering regime has been investigated. The trap operates with a large Rabi frequency for trapping lasers. The atomic number, the dimension of the atomic cloud, the atomic density, and the atomic temperature have been measured as a function of trap parameters. At different trap conditions, the product of the atomic number and of the atomic density, which determines the occurrence of collisional processes, has been also examined. Our results are interpreted on the basis of laser cooling processes.}

abstract = {We have studied the temperature scaling laws for the conditions under which a cloud of trapped ^85Rb atoms in the sigma$+$/sigma- configuration makes the transition from the temperature-limited regime to the multiple-scattering regime. Our experimental technique for measuring temperature relies on measuring the ballistic expansion of the cloud after turning off the confining forces and imaging the cloud size as a function of time with two CCD cameras. In the transition regime, the temperature T is shown to depend on the number of atoms N and the peak density n as (T-T_0) proportional N^1/3 and as (T-T_0) proportional n^2/3, in a manner consistent with theoretical predictions. Here T_0 is defined as the equilibrium temperature of a low-density optical molasses. In the multiple-scattering regime we find that T proportional Omega^2/(delta Gamma), where Omega and delta are the Rabi frequency and the detuning of the trapping laser, respectively, and Gamma is the natural linewidth of the cycling transition. We have also measured the ratio of temperatures along the axial and radial directions of the magnetic field gradient coils and find that the temperature is isotropic only if the intensities of the three orthogonal trapping beams are equal, and that the ratio is generally independent of trapping laser intensity and magnetic field gradient. Finally we demonstrate a measurement of the gravitational acceleration precise to approximately 0.1\% by tracking the center of the cloud during ballistic expansion.},

ABSTRACT = {A review of experimental studies of the measurement of the photoionization cross-section for the excited states of the alkali atoms, alkaline earth atoms, and rare-gas atoms is presented, with emphasis on using multi-step laser excitation, ionization, and the saturation technique. The dependence of the photoionization cross-section from different intermediate states populated in the first step and ionized in the second step are discussed, including results on the photoionization cross-sections measured above the first ionization threshold. Results based on different polarizations of the exciting and the ionizing dye lasers are also discussed. Examples are provided, illustrating the photoionization cross-sections measured using thermionic diode ion detector, atomic beam apparatus in conjunction with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and DC/RF glow discharge cell as an optogalvanic detection.},

We explore the possibility of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage from the continuum of ion–atom scattering states to an ionic molecular state. We provide physical conditions under which coherent population transfer is possible in stimulated Raman photoassociation. Our results are important for experimental realization of PA in ion–atom cold collisions.}

abstract = {We study ultracold atom–ion collisions in the presence of an external magnetic field. At low collision energy the field can drastically modify the translational motion of the ion, which follows quantized cyclotron orbits. We present a rigorous theoretical approach for the calculation of quantum scattering amplitudes in these conditions. Collisions in different magnetic field regimes, identified by the size of the cyclotron radius with respect to the range of the interaction potential, are investigated. Our results are important in cases where use of a magnetic field to control the atom–ion collision dynamics is envisioned.}

	abstract = {By photoionizing samples of laser-cooled atoms with laser light tuned just above the ionization limit, plasmas can be created with electron and ion temperatures below 10 K. These ultracold neutral plasmas have extended the temperature bounds of plasma physics by two orders of magnitude. Table-top experiments, using many of the tools from atomic physics, allow for the study of plasma phenomena in this new regime with independent control over the density and temperature of the plasma through the excitation process. Characteristic of these systems is an inhomogeneous density profile, inherited from the density distribution of the laser-cooled neutral atom sample. Most work has dealt with unconfined plasmas in vacuum, which expand outward at velocities of order 100 m/s, governed by electron pressure, and with lifetimes of order 100 μs, limited by stray electric fields. Using detection of charged particles and optical detection techniques, a wide variety of properties and phenomena have been observed, including expansion dynamics, collective excitations in both the electrons and ions, and collisional properties. Through three-body recombination collisions, the plasmas rapidly form Rydberg atoms, and clouds of cold Rydberg atoms have been observed to spontaneously avalanche ionize to form plasmas. Of particular interest is the possibility of the formation of strongly coupled plasmas, where Coulomb forces dominate thermal motion and correlations become important. The strongest impediment to strong coupling is disorder-induced heating, a process in which Coulomb energy from an initially disordered sample is converted into thermal energy. This restricts electrons to a weakly coupled regime and leaves the ions barely within the strongly coupled regime. This review will give an overview of the field of ultracold neutral plasmas, from its inception in 1999 to current work, including efforts to increase strong coupling and effects on plasma properties due to strong coupling.},

We give an overview of UNP experiments with an emphasis on measurements of the time-evolving ion density and velocity distributions, the electronion thermalization rate, and plasma self-assembly—all just inside the strongly coupled plasma regime. We also present theoretical and computational models that were developed to understand a subset of HEDP experiments. However, because HEDP experiments display similar degrees of strong coupling, many aspects of these models can be vetted using precision studies of UNPs. This comparison is important because some statistical assumptions used for ideal plasmas are of questionable validity in the strongly coupled plasma regime. We summarize two theoretical approaches that extend kinetic theories into the strong-coupling regime and show good agreement for momentum transfer and self-diffusion. As capabilities improve, both computationally and experimentally, UNP measurements may help guide the ongoing development of HEDPappropriate plasma models. Future opportunities in viscosity, energy relaxation, and magnetized plasmas are discussed.},

abstract = {We present simulations of some of the early time properties of ultracold neutral plasmas. We focus on three aspects of this system. First, we study the earliest electron dynamics when the initial temperature of the electrons would place them in the strongly coupled regime. We focus on times out to ∼10 plasma periods of the electron but also present results out to ∼85 plasma periods. In particular, we study how the formation of Rydberg atoms leads to heating and how the mass of the ion could enter the dynamics. Second, we study how the ions behave when the electrons are at high temperatures by comparing simulations that treat the electrons as a fluid and simulations that simultaneously include the electrons and ions. For light ions, the electron–ion scattering transfers substantial energy from the electrons to the ions. Finally, we study the ion motion at early times and at low temperatures where the electron evolution and ion motion could be at comparable time scales. This allows a test of electron–ion scattering when the electron plasma is nearly strongly coupled and we find that the recent values for the electron–ion scattering rate underestimate the ion heating in our calculations.}

Although some types of chemical reaction still occur at 1 μK, they can no longer adhere to the conventional picture of reactants passing over an activation energy barrier to become products. Indeed, at ultracold temperatures, the system enters a fully quantum regime, and quantum mechanics replaces the classical picture of colliding particles. In this Review, we discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments that allow us to explore chemical reactions at temperatures that range from 100 K to 500 nK.

	abstract = {Cold chemical reactions between laser-cooled Ca{\textasciicircum}+ ions and Rb atoms were studied in an ion-atom hybrid trap. Reaction rate constants were determined in the range of collision energies {\textless}E\_\{coll\}{\textgreater}/k\_B = 20 mK-20 K. The lowest energies were achieved in experiments using single localized Ca{\textasciicircum}+ ions. Product branching ratios were studied using resonant-excitation mass spectrometry. The dynamics of the reactive processes in this system (non-radiative and radiative charge transfer as well as radiative association leading to the formation of CaRb{\textasciicircum}+ molecular ions) have been analyzed using high-level quantum-chemical calculations of the potential energy curves of CaRb{\textasciicircum}+ and quantum-scattering calculations for the radiative channels. For the present low-energy scattering experiments, it is shown that the energy dependence of the reaction rate constants is governed by long-range interactions in line with the classical Langevin model, but their magnitude is determined by short-range non-adiabatic and radiative couplings which only weakly depend on the asymptotic energy. The quantum character of the collisions is predicted to manifest itself in the occurrence of narrow shape resonances at well-defined collision energies. The present results highlight both universal and system-specific phenomena in cold ion-neutral reactive collisions.},

They include extended uniform-density ellipsoids, rings of atoms around a small central ball, and clumps of atoms orbiting a central core. The distributions depend sensitively on the number of atoms and the alignment of the laser beams. Abrupt bistable transitions between different distributions are seen. This system is studied in detail, and much of this behavior can be explained by the incorporation of long-range interactions between the atoms in the equation of equilibrium. It is shown how attenuation and multiple scattering of the incident photons lead to these interactions.},

	abstract = {Ultracold neutral plasmas formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near the ionization threshold have electron temperatures in the 1–1000 K range and ion temperatures from tens of millikelvin to a few Kelvin. They represent a new frontier in the study of neutral plasmas, which traditionally deals with much hotter systems, but they also blur the boundaries of plasma, atomic, condensed matter, and low temperature physics. Modeling these plasmas challenges computational techniques and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so the ﬁeld has attracted great interest from the theoretical and computational physics communities. By varying laser intensities and wavelengths it is possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy, and charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements for comparison with theoretical predictions.},

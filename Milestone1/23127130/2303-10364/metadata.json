    "abstract": "Based on the Rb$^+$-Rb hybrid trap, we investigate the effect of ion-atom elastic collisions on the number and temperature of the remaining atoms. We measured the remaining atomic number and temperature as a function of the wavelength and intensity of the ionization laser, and whether the ion trap was turned on. Fittings with a single exponential decay function plus an offset to the number and radius of the remaining atoms are found to be in good agreement. We found a difference in the exponential factor of different wavelengths of ionization laser with the ion trap on or off. We suppose that the presence of electrons affects ion-atom collisions through disorder-induced heating. Our research contributes to a better understanding of how ultracold neutral plasma evolves, particularly the subsequent kinetics of atomic processes, which also serves as a useful reference for high-energy-density plasma.",

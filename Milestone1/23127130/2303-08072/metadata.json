    "abstract": "The thermal corrections to the propagator of a loosely bound charm-meson molecule in a pion gas are calculated to next-to-leading order in the heavy-meson expansion using a zero-range effective field theory. Ultraviolet divergences in the charm-meson-pair self energy are canceled by corrections to the charm-meson-pair contact vertex. Terms that are singular at the charm-meson-pair threshold can be absorbed into thermal corrections to the rest energies and kinetic masses of the charm-meson constituents. The remaining terms reduce to a thermal correction to the binding momentum that is proportional to the pion number density and suppressed by the pion/charm-meson mass ratio. The correction gives a tiny decrease in the binding energy of the charm-meson molecule relative to the charm-meson-pair threshold in the pion gas and a change in its thermal width that is small compared to the thermal widths of the charm-meson constituents. These results are encouraging for the prospects of observing $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ in the expanding hadron gas produced by heavy-ion collisions.",

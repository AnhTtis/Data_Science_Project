    "abstract": "The $k$-coalescence of two graphs is obtained by merging a $k$-clique of each graph. The $A_α$-matrix of a graph is the convex combination of its degree matrix and adjacency matrix. In this paper, we present some structural properties of a non-regular graph which is obtained from the $k$-coalescence of two graphs. Also, we derive the $A_α$-characteristic polynomial of $k$-coalescence of two graphs and then compute the $A_α$-spectra of $k$-coalescence of two complete graphs. In addition, we estimate the $A_α$-energy of $k$-coalescence of two complete graphs. Furthermore, we obtain some topological indices of $k$-coalescence of two graphs, and as an application, we determine the Wiener, hyper-Wiener and Zagreb indices of Lollipop and Dumbbell graphs. From these results, we calculate the Wiener, hyper-Wiener and Zagreb indices of the organic compound 1,2-dicyclohexylethane(\\ce{C_{14}H_{26}}).",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction of intense, femtosecond X-ray pulses with heavy\natoms is crucial for gaining insights into the structure and dynamics of\nmatter. One key aspect of nonlinear light-matter interaction was, so far, not\nstudied systematically at free-electron lasers -- its dependence on the photon\nenergy. Using resonant ion spectroscopy, we map out the transient electronic\nstructures occurring during the complex charge-up pathways. Massively hollow\natoms featuring up to six simultaneous core holes determine the spectra at\nspecific photon energies and charge states. We also illustrate how the\ninfluence of different X-ray pulse parameters that are usually intertwined can\nbe partially disentangled. The extraction of resonance spectra is facilitated\nby the fact that the ion yields become independent of the peak fluence beyond a\nsaturation point. Our study lays the groundwork for novel spectroscopies of\ntransient atomic species in exotic, multiple-core-hole states that have not\nbeen explored previously.",

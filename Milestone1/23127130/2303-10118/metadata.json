    "abstract": "We present the ASP-based visualization tool, clingraph, which aims at visualizing various concepts of ASP by means of ASP itself. This idea traces back to the aspviz tool and clingraph redevelops and extends it in the context of modern ASP systems. More precisely, clingraph takes graph specifications in terms of ASP facts and hands them over to the graph visualization system graphviz. The use of ASP provides a great interface between logic programs and/or answer sets and their visualization. Also, clingraph offers a python API that extends this ease of interfacing to clingo's API, and in turn to connect and monitor various aspects of the solving process.",

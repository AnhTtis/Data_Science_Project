    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations for machine learning models are used to find minimal interventions to the feature values such that the model changes the prediction to a different output or a target output. A valid counterfactual explanation should have likely feature values. Here, we address the challenge of generating counterfactual explanations that lie in the same data distribution as that of the training data and more importantly, they belong to the target class distribution. This requirement has been addressed through the incorporation of auto-encoder reconstruction loss in the counterfactual search process. Connecting the output behavior of the classifier to the latent space of the auto-encoder has further improved the speed of the counterfactual search process and the interpretability of the resulting counterfactual explanations. Continuing this line of research, we show further improvement in the interpretability of counterfactual explanations when the auto-encoder is trained in a semi-supervised fashion with class tagged input data. We empirically evaluate our approach on several datasets and show considerable improvement in-terms of several metrics.",

Automation, monitoring and standardization should be considered at the early stages of the developmental cycle of cell products to deliver more robust and effective therapies and treatment plans to the bedside, reducing healthcare expenditure and improving services and patient care.},

Today, bioscreening and high–throughput screening processes are well automated. In contrast, a deficit can be found in the area of analytical measurements with complex and frequently changing processes. Robots undertake not only transportation tasks, but also direct sample manipulation and subsequent analytical measurements. Due to their human-like structure, dual-arm robots perform such processes similar to human operation. Liquid handling is required to transfer chemicals, to prepare standard solutions, or to dilute samples. Two electronic pipettes with different volume ranges (5–200 µL and 50–1000 µL) were integrated into a dual–arm robotic system. The main focus in this publication is the software interface for alternating robot and pipette control as well as the high–level process control system. The performance using a dual–arm robot equipped with electronic pipettes and conventional manual pipettes was determined and compared. The automation system presented is the first integration of a dual-arm robot in analytical measurement processes. Conventional manual laboratory pipettes and electronic pipettes are simultaneously used for liquid-handling tasks. The software control system enables a flexible and user-friendly process generation.},

	abstract = {In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.},

So there are many well-established techniques to measure the liquid levels for different heights.

In order to avoid false positive or negative results which lead to higher costs due to the replication of the experiments it is necessary to monitor the process and success of liquid delivery. An easy method for the determination of the liquid levels in microplates has been developed and evaluated. The optical method bases on the measurement of the liquid level using CCD cameras followed by special algorithms for the evaluation and visualization of the measured data. The proposed method was tested in changing environmental lighting for two different liquids. These tests confirm our approach towards optical liquid level determination for smallest volumes in microplates and also show the challenges regarding environmental lighting and different physical properties of fluids.},

The potential sources and consequences of cell-culture contamination are unique to the cell culture system and the contaminant. Biological contamination represents the greatest threat to a cell-culture system because living organisms metabolize and replicate. Replication increases the titer of the contaminant, while metabolism increases the array of potential effects on the cell-culture system by reducing essential nutrients and introducing exotic byproducts, such as unique enzymes, antigens, and toxins. Biological contamination in a cell-culture system is basically an in vitro equivalent to an emerging disease. The most cost efficient means of establishing the security of cell cultures is establishing a frozen cell repository. There should be a master cell bank (MCB), which represents a lifetime supply of antibiotic-free parental (master) cell cultures that will be used to establish antibiotic-free working cell banks (WCBs). To use cell culture as an effective tool, all apparent cell-culture conditions must be stabilized and reproducible.},

	abstract = {We describe a method that uses total internal reflection at the water–air interface inside a large, transparent tank, to measure the interface’s deflections. Using this configuration, we obtain an optical set-up where the liquid surface acts as a deformable mirror. The set-up is shown to be extremely sensitive to very small disturbances of the reflecting water surface, which are detected by means of visualising the reflections of a reference pattern. When the water surface is deformed, it reflects a distorted image of the reference pattern, similar to a synthetic Schlieren set-up. The distortions of the pattern are analysed using a suitable image correlation method. The displacement fields thus obtained correlate to the local spatial gradients of the water surface. The gradient fields are integrated in a least-squares sense to obtain a full instantaneous reconstruction of the water surface. This method is particularly useful when a solid object is placed just above water surface, whose presence makes the liquid surface otherwise optically inaccessible.},

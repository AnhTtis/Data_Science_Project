    "abstract": "For a transparent well with a known volume capacity, changes in fluid level result in predictable changes in magnification of an overhead light source. For a given well size and fluid, the relationship between volume and magnification can be calculated if the fluid's index of refraction is known or in a naive fashion with a calibration procedure. Light source magnification can be measured through a camera and processed using computer vision contour analysis with OpenCV. This principle was applied in the design of a 3D printable sensing device using a raspberry pi zero and a camera",

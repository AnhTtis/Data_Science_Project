    "abstract": "Recent work on database application development platforms has sought to include a declarative formulation of a conceptual data model in the application code, using annotations or attributes. Some recent work has used metadata to include the details of such formulations in the physical database, and this approach brings significant advantages in that the model can be enforced across a range of applications for a single database. In previous work, we have discussed the advantages for enterprise integration of typed graph data models (TGM), which can play a similar role in graphical databases, leveraging the existing support for the unified modelling language UML. Ideally, the integration of systems designed with different models, for example, graphical and relational database, should also be supported. In this work, we implement this approach, using metadata in a relational database management system (DBMS).",

	abstract = {Both this paper and Chain recurrence and attraction in noncompact spaces, [Ergodic Theory Dynamical Systems (to appear)] are concerned with the question of extending certain results obtained by C. Conley for dynamical systems on compact spaces to systems on arbitrary metric spaces. The basic result is the analogue of Conley's theorem that characterizes the chain recurrent set of f in terms of the attractors of f and their basins of attraction. The point of view taken in the above-mentioned paper was that the given metric was of primary importance rather than the topology that it generated. The purpose of this note is to give results that depend on the topology induced by a metric rather than on the particular choice of the metric.},

	abstract = {We present a methodology based on the energy shaping framework to derive strict Lyapunov functions for a class of global regulators for robot manipulators. The class of controllers is described by control laws composed by the gradient of an artificial potential energy plus a linear velocity feedback. We provide explicit sufficient conditions on the artificial potential energy that allow to obtain in a straightforward manner strict Lyapunov functions ensuring directly global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. As an important consequence of this methodology, we also establish a framework for designing adaptive versions for this class of regulators. An explicit update law is proposed that guarantees closed-loop stability and global positioning. Finally, we characterize a class of tracking controllers for which global uniform asymptotic stability is ensured via strict Lyapunov functions.}

	abstract = {In the early days of nonlinear control theory most of the stability, optimality and uncertainty concepts were descriptive rather than constructive. This survey describes their ‘activation’ into design tools and constructive procedures. Structural properties of nonlinear systems, such as relative degree and zero dynamics, are connected to passivity, while dissipativity, as a finite L2-gain property, also appears in the disturbance attenuation problem, a nonlinear counterpart of robust linear control. Passivation-based designs exploit the connections between passivity and inverse optimality, and between Lyapunov functions and optimal value functions. Recursive design procedures, such as backstepping and forwarding, achieve certain optimal properties for important classes of nonlinear systems. The survey concludes with four representative applications. The selection of the topics and their interpretations are greatly influenced by the experience and personal views of the senior author.}

This paper presents a survey of recent results in this area, focusing on the relationships between geometric phases, controllability, and curvature, and the role of trajectory generation in nonlinear controller synthesis.

Towards achieving effective localization, in the absence of GPS, we combine complementary localization algorithms of dead reckoning and Wifi signal strength fingerprinting. Dead reckoning is performed using the on-board accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope sensors to detect motion and estimate orientation. At the same time, Wifi signal strength fingerprinting is employed to provide an independent position estimate. These measurements along with a pre-built map of the environment are combined using a particle filter towards more accurate pose estimation. We discuss a procedure for collecting Wifi calibration data which uses a robot to reduce the amount of time needed to train the system for a given environment. The system was tested using multiple participants in two different indoor environments. It was found to achieve localization accuracies of within 10 meters, sufficient for a variety of navigation and context-aware applications. I.},

   abstract = {Position sensing with inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes usually requires other aided sensors or prior knowledge of motion characteristics to remove position drift resulting from integration of acceleration or velocity so as to obtain accurate position estimation. A method based on analytical integration has previously been developed to obtain accurate position estimate of periodic or quasi-periodic motion from inertial sensors using prior knowledge of the motion but without using aided sensors. In this paper, a new method is proposed which employs linear filtering stage coupled with adaptive filtering stage to remove drift and attenuation. The prior knowledge of the motion the proposed method requires is only approximate band of frequencies of the motion. Existing adaptive filtering methods based on Fourier series such as weighted-frequency Fourier linear combiner (WFLC), and band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) are modified to combine with the proposed method. To validate and compare the performance of the proposed method with the method based on analytical integration, simulation study is performed using periodic signals as well as real physiological tremor data, and real-time experiments are conducted using an ADXL-203 accelerometer. Results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method outperforms the existing analytical integration method.},

Motion tracking controllers such as the Nintendo Wiimote are not sensitive enough to accurately measure performance in all components of balance. Additionally, users can figure out how to "cheat" inaccurate trackers by performing minimal movement (e.g. wrist twisting a Wiimote instead of a full arm swing). Physical rehabilitation requires accurate and appropriate tracking and feedback of performance. To this end, we are developing applications that leverage recent advances in commercial video game technology to provide full-body control of animated virtual characters. A key component of our approach is the use of newly available low cost depth sensing camera technology that provides markerless full-body tracking on a conventional PC. The aim of this research was to develop and assess an interactive game-based rehabilitation tool for balance training of adults with neurological injury.},

Current, advanced technologies facilitate the design of novel biofeedback systems that possess diverse parameters, advanced cue display, and sophisticated control systems for use in task-oriented biofeedback. In light of these advancements, this article: (1) reviews early biofeedback studies and their conclusions; (2) presents recent developments in biofeedback technologies and their applications to task-oriented biofeedback interventions; and (3) discusses considerations regarding the therapeutic system design and the clinical application of task-oriented biofeedback therapy.

We assess exercise quality by building a classifier that labels incorrect exercises. The incorrect performances are divided into a number of classes of errors as defined by a physical therapist. We focus on exercises commonly prescribed for knee osteoarthritis: standing hamstring curl, reverse hip abduction, and lying straight leg raise. The methods presented here will form the basis for an at-home rehabilitation device that will recognize errors in patient exercise performance, provide appropriate feedback on the performance, and motivate the patient to continue the prescribed regimen.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Robotic devices for walking rehabilitation allow new possibilities for providing performance-related information to patients during gait training. Based on motor learning principles, augmented feedback during robotic-assisted gait training might improve the rehabilitation process used to regain walking function. This report presents a method to provide visual feedback implemented in a driven gait orthosis (DGO). The purpose of the study was to compare the immediate effect on motor output in subjects during robotic-assisted gait training when they used computerized visual feedback and when they followed verbal instructions of a physical therapist.

SUBJECTS: Twelve people with neurological gait disorders due to incomplete spinal cord injury participated.

METHODS: Subjects were instructed to walk within the DGO in 2 different conditions. They were asked to increase their motor output by following the instructions of a therapist and by observing visual feedback. In addition, the subjects' opinions about using visual feedback were investigated by a questionnaire.

RESULTS: Computerized visual feedback and verbal instructions by the therapist were observed to result in a similar change in motor output in subjects when walking within the DGO. Subjects reported that they were more motivated and concentrated on their movements when using computerized visual feedback compared with when no form of feedback was provided.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Computerized visual feedback is a valuable adjunct to robotic-assisted gait training. It represents a relevant tool to increase patients' motor output, involvement, and motivation during gait training, similar to verbal instructions by a therapist.},

   abstract = {The proliferation of miniaturized electronics has fueled a shift toward wearable sensors and feedback devices for the mass population. Quantified self and other similar movements involving wearable systems have gained recent interest. However, it is unclear what the clinical impact of these enabling technologies is on human gait. The purpose of this review is to assess clinical applications of wearable sensing and feedback for human gait and to identify areas of future research. Four electronic databases were searched to find articles employing wearable sensing or feedback for movements of the foot, ankle, shank, thigh, hip, pelvis, and trunk during gait. We retrieved 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria and identified four common clinical applications: (1) identifying movement disorders, (2) assessing surgical outcomes, (3) improving walking stability, and (4) reducing joint loading. Characteristics of knee and trunk motion were the most frequent gait parameters for both wearable sensing and wearable feedback. Most articles performed testing on healthy subjects, and the most prevalent patient populations were osteoarthritis, vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, and post-stroke hemiplegia. The most widely used wearable sensors were inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope packaged together) and goniometers. Haptic (touch) and auditory were the most common feedback sensations. This review highlights the current state of the literature and demonstrates substantial potential clinical benefits of wearable sensing and feedback. Future research should focus on wearable sensing and feedback in patient populations, in natural human environments outside the laboratory such as at home or work, and on continuous, long-term monitoring and intervention.},

The structures, called Special Cubic Structures (SCS), are a class of 2.5-D truss-like structures free of overhangs and holes. Quadrotors equipped with grippers pick up, transport, and assemble the structural elements. The design of the nodes and members imposes constraints on assembly, which are incorporated into the design of the algorithms used for assembly. We show that any SCS can be built using only the feasible assembly modes for individual structural elements and present simulation and experimental results for a team of quadrotors performing automated assembly. The paper includes a theoretical analysis of the SCS construction algorithm, the rationale for the design of the structural nodes, members and quadrotor gripper, a description of the quadrotor control methods for part pickup, transport and assembly, and an empirical analysis of system performance.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a system architecture to provide end-to-end network connectivity for autonomous teams of robots is discussed. The core of the proposed system is a cyber-physical controller whose goal is to ensure network connectivity as robots move to accomplish their assigned tasks. Due to channel quality uncertainties inherent to wireless propagation, we adopt a stochastic model where achievable rates are modeled as random variables. The cyber component of the controller determines routing variables that maximize the probability of having a connected network for given positions. The physical component determines feasible robot trajectories that are restricted to safe configurations which ensure these probabilities stay above a minimum reliability level. Local trajectory planning algorithms are proposed for simple environments and leveraged to obtain global planning algorithms to handle complex surroundings. The resulting integrated controllers are robust in that end-to-end communication survives with high probability even if individual point-to-point links are likely to fail with significant probability. Experiments demonstrate that the global planning algorithm succeeds in navigating a complex environment while ensuring that end-to-end communication rates meet or exceed prescribed values within a target failure tolerance.},

In our framework, the desired behavior of a group of robots is specified using a set of safe linear temporal logic (LTL) properties. Our method relies on a library of motion primitives, each of which corresponds to a controller that ensures a particular trajectory in a given configuration. Using the closed-loop behavior of the robots under the action of different controllers, we formulate the motion planning problem as an SMT solving problem and use an off-the-shelf SMT solver to generate trajectories for the robots. Our approach can also be extended to synthesize optimal cost trajectories where optimality is defined with respect to the available motion primitives. Experimental results show that our framework can efficiently solve complex motion planning problems in the context of multi-robot systems.},

This paper develops an autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking algorithm through cluttered environments for the STARMAC platform. A system relying on a single optimization must trade off the complexity of the planned path with the rate of update of the control input. In this paper, a trajectory tracking controller for quadrotor helicopters is developed to decouple the two problems. By accepting as inputs a path of waypoints and desired velocities, the control input can be updated frequently to accurately track the desired path, while the path planning occurs as a separate process on a slower timescale. To enable the use of planning algorithms that do not consider dynamic feasibility or provide feedforward inputs, a computationally efficient algorithm using space-indexed waypoints is presented to modify the speed profile of input paths to guarantee feasibility of the planned trajectory and minimum time traversal of the planned. The algorithm is an efficient alternative to formulating a nonlinear optimization or mixed integer program. Both indoor and outdoor flight test results are presented for path tracking on the STARMAC vehicles.},

We utilize differential algebra where flatness- and defect are best defined without distinguishing between input, state, output and other variables. Many realistic classes of examples are flat. We treat two popular ones: the crane and the car with n trailers, the motion planning of which is obtained via elementary properties of plane curves. The three non-flat examples, the simple, double and variable length pendulums, are borrowed from non-linear physics.

We extend the existing work on polynomial trajec- tory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path seg- ments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for high- order polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for ef- ficient sparse computation.We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differen- tially flat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehi- cle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sac- rifices the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide.

   abstract = {The recent works on quadrotor have focused on more and more challenging tasks on increasingly complex systems. Systems are often augmented with slung loads, inverted pendulums or arms, and accomplish complex tasks such as going through a window, grasping, throwing or catching. Usually, controllers are designed to accomplish a specific task on a specific system using analytic solutions, so each application needs long preparations. On the other hand, the direct multiple shooting approach is able to solve complex problems without any analytic development, by using on-the-shelf optimization solver. In this paper, we show that this approach is able to solve a wide range of problems relevant to quadrotor systems, from on-line trajectory generation for quadrotors, to going through a window for a quadrotor-and-pendulum system, through manipulation tasks for a aerial manipulator.},

These robots are formed by an underactuated aerial vehicle, a planar-Vertical Take-Off and Landing (PVTOL), equipped with any number of different parallel manipulator arms with the only property that all the first joints are attached at the Center of Mass (CoM) of the PVTOL, while the center of actuation of the PVTOL can be anywhere. We prove that protocentric aerial manipulators (PAMs) are differentially flat systems regardless the number of joints of each arm and their kinematic and dynamic parameters. The set of flat outputs is constituted by the CoM of the PVTOL and the absolute orientation angles of all the links. The relative degree of each output is equal to four. More amazingly, we prove that PAMs are differentially flat even in the case that any number of the joints are elastic, no matter the internal distribution between elastic and rigid joints. The set of flat outputs is the same but in this case the total relative degree grows quadratically with the number of elastic joints. We validate the theory by simulating object grasping and transportation tasks with unknown mass and parameters and using a controller based on dynamic feedback linearization.},

The approach aims at limiting the influence of impacts on the controlled attitude dynamics in order to allow the aerial manipulator to remain stable during and after impact. The developed concept is intended to convert kinetic energy into potential energy, which is permanently stored into elastic elements by means of directional locking mechanisms. The proposed approach has been tested on a 2 d.o.f. manipulator mounted on a quadrotor UAV. The manipulation system has one active rotational d.o.f. compensating for pitch movements of the UAV and one passive linear joint which is in charge of absorbing the impact energy. The device has been used to validate the method through experiments, in comparison with a rigid manipulator. The results show that the proposed approach and the developed mechanical system achieve stable impact absorption without bouncing away from the interacting environment. Our work has the ambition to propose a new direction towards aerial manipulators that are capable of performing highly dynamic physical interaction tasks.},

Despite recent work, several major challenges remain to be overcome before it will be practical to manipulate objects from UAVs. Among these challenges are: (a) The constantly moving UAV platform and compliance of manipulator arms make it difficult to position the UAV and end-effector relative to an object of interest precisely enough for manipulation, and (b) The motions of the manipulator impact the stability of the host UAV, further complicating positioning. Solving these challenges will bring UAVs one step closer to being able to perform meaningful tasks such as infrastructure repair, disaster response, casualty extraction, and cargo resupply. Toward solutions to these challenges, this paper describes a hyper-redundant manipulator, manipulator control approaches and system design considerations to position the manipulator relative to objects of interest in such a way that impacts on platform stability are minimized.},

We propose a planning method to find the optimized grasping form for the multilinks while they are on the air, which is based on the original planar enveloping algorithm, along with the optimization of the internal force and joint torque for the force-closure. We then propose the aerial approach and grasp motion strategy, which is devoted to the determination of the form and position of the aerial robot to approach and grasp effectively the object from the air. Finally we present the experimental results of the aerial manipulation which involves grasping, carrying and dropping different types of object.

The proposed approach applies the online active set strategy to generate a feasible trajectory of the joints, in order to accomplish a set of tasks with defined bounds and constraint inequalities. The definition of the problem in the acceleration domain allows to integrate and perform a large set of tasks and, as a result, to obtain smooth motion of the joints. A weighting strategy, associated with a normalization procedure, allows to easily define the relative importance of the tasks. This approach is useful to accomplish different phases of a mission with different redundancy resolution strategies. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated through real experiments with all the algorithms running onboard in real time. In particular, the aerial manipulator can successfully perform navigation and interaction phases, while keeping motion within prescribed bounds and avoiding collisions with external obstacles.},

As a consequence, the hexarotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory while the center of mass is tracking a position trajectory. In this paper, we consider a different hexarotor architecture where propellers are tilted, without the need of any additional hardware. In this way, the hexarotor gains a 6–DoF actuation which allows to independently reach positions and orientations in free space and to be able to exert forces on the environment to resist any wrench for aerial manipulation tasks. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed hexarotor, we discuss the controllability and the tilt angle optimization to reduce the control effort for the specific task. An exact feedback linearization and decoupling control law is proposed based on the input-output mapping, considering the Jacobian and task acceleration, for non-linear trajectory tracking. The capabilities of our approach are shown by simulation results.},

In such cases, the accuracy of the resulting solution hinges on the availability of a precise initial estimate, which is often not available. In order to address this issue, we divide the problem into two least-squares sub-problems, and analytically solve each one to determine a precise initial estimate for the unknown parameters. We further increase the accuracy of these initial estimates by iteratively minimizing a batch nonlinear least-squares cost function. In addition, we provide the minimal identifiability conditions, under which it is possible to accurately estimate the unknown parameters. Experimental results consisting of photorealistic 3D reconstruction of indoor and outdoor scenes, as well as standard metrics of the calibration errors, are used to assess the validity of our approach.},

This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

Adjustment of the photogrammetric data is then repeated using the extracted LCPs in a self-calibrating bundle adjustment with additional parameters. This methodology was tested using two different photogrammetric datasets, a Microsoft UltraCamX large format camera and an Applanix DSS322 medium format camera. Systematic sensitivity testing explored the influence of the number and weighting of LCPs.

The calibration parameters are estimated by maximizing the mutual information obtained between the sensor-measured surface intensities. We calculate the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound (CRLB) and show that the sample variance of the estimated parameters empirically approaches the CRLB for a sufficient number of views. Furthermore , we compare the calibration results to independent ground-truth and observe that the mean error also empirically approaches to zero as the number of views are increased. This indicates that the proposed algorithm, in the limiting case, calculates a minimum variance unbiased (MVUB) estimate of the calibration parameters.

However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camera- to-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities.

We also present a fast approximate method to reduce the computational requirements of the entropy evaluation, allowing unsupervised calibration in vast environments with millions of points. The algorithm is analyzed using real world data gathered in many locations, showing robust calibration performance and substantial speed improvements from the approximations.},

The author presents three classes of extrinsic calibration procedures. All use closed-form solutions. The class A calibration procedure requires a reference object at a recalibrated location. The class B calibration procedure takes advantage of robot mobility. It requires a reference frame, but not precalibration. The class C procedure, by taking full advantage of both robot mobility and dexterity, requires no reference object but the simplest one-a visible point. In simulation studies, the class A, B, and C calibration procedures have produced estimates successfully converging to true extrinsic parameter values. Results of field experiments carried out for class B and C calibration procedures are presented. For comparison, two existing B-type calibration methods have also been tested with real data},

   abstract = {Cameras are often a good choice as the primary outward-looking sensor for mobile robots, and a wide field of view is usually desirable for responsive and accurate navigation, SLAMand relocalisation. While this can potentially be provided by a single omnidirectional camera, it can also be flexibly achieved by multiple cameras with standard optics mounted around the robot. However, such setups are difficult to calibrate. Here we present a general method for fully automatic extrinsic auto-calibration of a fixed multi camera rig, with no requirement for calibration patterns or other infrastructure, which works even in the case where the cameras have completely non-overlapping views. The robot is placed in a natural environment and makes a set of programmed movements including a full horizontal rotation and captures a synchronized image sequence from each camera. These sequences are processed individually with a monocular visual SLAM algorithm. The resulting maps are matched and fused robustly based on corresponding invariant features, and then all estimates are optimised full joint bundle adjustment, where we constrain the relative poses of the cameras to be fixed. We present results showing accurate performance of the method for various two and four camera configurations.},

Our approach is oriented for intelligent vehicle applications, where the separation distance between sensors frames are frequently very important. For this purpose, we use a circle-based calibration object because its geometry allows us to obtain not only an accurate estimation pose by taking advantage of the 3D multi-layer laser range finder perception but also a simultaneous estimation of the pose in the camera frame and the camera intrinsic parameters. These advantages simplify the calibration task in outdoor environments. The method determines the relative position of the sensors by estimating sets of corresponded features and by solving the classical absolute orientation problem. The proposed method is evaluated by using different synthetics environments and real data. An error propagation analysis is made in order to estimate the calibration accuracy and the confidence intervals. Finally, we present a laser data projection into images to validate the consistency of the results.},

   abstract = {Virtual immersive environments or telepresence setups often consist of multiple cameras that have to be calibrated. We present a convenient method for doing this. The minimum is three cameras, but there is no upper limit. The method is fully automatic and a freely moving bright spot is the only calibration object. A set of virtual 3D points is made by waving the bright spot through the working volume. Its projections are found with subpixel precision and verified by a robust RANSAC analysis. The cameras do not have to see all points; only reasonable overlap between camera subgroups is necessary. Projective structures are computed via rank-4 factorization and the Euclidean stratification is done by imposing geometric constraints. This linear estimate initializes a postprocessing computation of nonlinear distortion, which is also fully automatic. We suggest a trick on how to use a very ordinary laser pointer as the calibration object. We show that it is possible to calibrate an immersive virtual environment with 16 cameras in less than 60 minutes reaching about 1/5 pixel reprojection error. The method has been successfully tested on numerous multicamera environments using varying numbers of cameras of varying quality.},

This approach does not require any calibration object. Only few point correspondences are used, which are manually selected by the user from a scene viewed by the two sensors. The proposed method relies on a novel technique to visualize the range information obtained from a 3D laser scanner. This technique converts the visually ambiguous 3D range information into a 2D map where natural features of a scene are highlighted. We show that by enhancing the features the user can easily find the corresponding points of the camera image points. Therefore, visually identifying laser- camera correspondences becomes as easy as image pairing. Once point correspondences are given, extrinsic calibration is done using the well-known PnP algorithm followed by a noninear refinement process. We show the performance of our approach through experimental results. In these experiments, we will use an omnidirectional camera. The implication of this method is important because it brings 3D computer vision systems out of the laboratory and into practical use.},

Precise initial estimates of NLS are obtained by dividing it into two sub-problems that are solved individually. With the precise initializations, the calibration parameters are further refined by iteratively optimizing the NLS problem. The algorithm is validated on both simulated and real data, as well as a 3D reconstruction application. Moreover, since the trihedral target used for calibration can be either orthogonal or not, it is very often present in structured environments, making the calibration convenient.},

Given a coarse initial estimate of the parameters, the relative poses between cameras are refined through recur- sive filtering. The approach is purely vision based and relies on plane induced homographies between successive frames. Overlapping fields of view are not required. Instead, the ground plane serves as a natural reference object. In contrast to other approaches, motion, relative camera poses, and the ground plane are estimated simultaneously using a single iterated extended Kalman filter. This reduces not only the number of parameters but also the computational complexity. Further- more, an arbitrary number of cameras can be incorporated. Several experiments on synthetic as well as real data were conducted using a setup of four synchronized wide angle fisheye cameras, mounted on a moving platform. Results were obtained, using both, a planar and a general motion model with full six degrees of freedom. Additionally, the effects of uncertain intrinsic parameters and nonplanar ground were evaluated experimentally.},

The derivation is presented without relying on unique properties of specific sensors and, therefore, represents the first general technique for temporal calibration in robotics. The broad applicability of this approach is demonstrated through spatiotemporal calibration of a camera with respect to an inertial measurement unit as well as between a stereo camera and a laser range finder.

Then, in order to overcome the mechanical limitations of the previous layer, the residual of the arm static effects on the UAV is computed and compensated through the given control thrust and torques. Finally, an estimator of external forces and moments acting on the aerial vehicle is considered and the estimations are fed back to the controller to compensate neglected aerodynamic effects and the arm dynamics. The performance of the proposed architecture has been experimentally evaluated.},

The multi-rotor has eight rotors and large payload to integrate a 7-degrees of freedom arm and to carry sensors and processing hardware needed for outdoor positioning. The arm can also carry an end-effector and sensors to perform different missions. The paper focuses on the control design and implementation aspects. A stable backstepping-based controller for the multirotor that uses the coupled full dynamic model is proposed, and an admittance controller for the manipulator arm is outlined. Several experimental tests with the aerial manipulator are also presented. In one of the experiments, the performance of the pitch attitude controller is compared to a PID controller. Other experiments of the arm controller following an object with the camera are also presented.},

This new system presents a solution for the drawbacks found in the current quadrotor manipulation system which uses a gripper fixed to a quadrotor. Unlike the current system, the proposed system enables the end-effector to achieve any arbitrary orientation and thus increases its degrees of freedom from 4 to 6. Also, it provides enough distance between the quadrotor and the object to be manipulated. This is useful in some applications such as demining applications. System kinematics and dynamics are derived which are highly nonlinear. Controller is designed based on feedback linearization to track desired trajectories. Controlling the movements in the horizontal directions is simplified by utilizing the derived nonholonmic constraints. Finally, the proposed system is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK program. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Most previous efforts seeking to coordinate the combined manipulator-UAV system have focused on using a manipulator to extend the UAV's reach and assume that both the UAV and manipulator can reliably reach commanded goal poses. This work accepts the reality that state of the art UAV positioning precision is not of a high enough quality to reliably perform simple tasks such as grasping objects. A 6 degree of freedom parallel manipulator is used to robustly maintain precise end-effector positions despite host UAV perturbations. A description of a unique parallel manipulator that allows for very little moving mass, and is easily stowed below a quadrotor UAV is presented along with flight test results and an analytical comparison to a serial manipulator.},

We then design control laws for the tool-tip position/orientation tracking of the (under-actuated) tool system with two quadro-tors and the (fully-actuated) tool system with three quadrotors.

Spatial calibration between an LRF and a camera has been extensively studied, but so far the temporal relationship between the two has largely been neglected. While this may be sufficient for applications where the setup is mounted on a vehicle, which imposes bounds on the dynamics, we aim for employment on a hand-held scanning device, where angular velocities can easily exceed hundreds of degrees per second. Employing a continuous-time batch estimation framework, this work demonstrates that the transformation between the LRF and the visual/inertial setup-but also its temporal relationship-can be estimated accurately. In contrast to the majority of established calibration approaches, our approach does not require an overlap in the field of view of the LRF and camera, allowing for previously infeasible sensor configurations to be calibrated. Preliminary results for a novel hand-held scanning device suggest improvements in 3D reconstructions and image based point cloud coloring, especially for highly dynamic motions.},

We model the flexible cable(s) as a finite series of links with spherical joints with mass concentrated at the end of each link. The resulting systems are thus high-dimensional with high degree-of-underactuation. For each of these systems, we show that the dynamics are differentially-flat, enabling planning of dynamically feasible trajectories. For the single quadrotor with a point-mass payload suspended through a flexible cable with five links (16 degrees-of-freedom and 12 degrees-of-underactuation), we use the coordinate-free dynamics to develop a geometric variation-based linearized equations of motion about a desired trajectory. We show that a finite-horizon linear quadratic regulator can be used to track a desired trajectory with a relatively large region of attraction.},

   abstract = {This paper addresses the boundedness property of the inertia matrix and the skewsymmetric property of the Coriolis matrix for vehicle-manipulator systems. These properties are widely used in Lyapunov-based stability proofs and are therefore important to identify. For example, the skew-symmetric property does not depend on the system at hand, but on the choice of parameterisation of the Coriolis matrix, which is not unique. It is the authors' experience that many researchers take this assumption for granted without taking into account that there exist several parameterisations for which this is not true. In fact, most researchers refer to references that do not show this property for vehicle-manipulator systems, but for other systems such as single rigid bodies or manipulators on a fixed base. As a result, the otherwise rigorous stability proofs fall apart. In this paper we point out several references that are widely used, but that do not show this property and we refer to the correct references. As most references on this topics are not easily accessible, we also give the correct proofs for commonly used parameterisations of the Coriolis matrix and thus provide a proof for future reference. The same is the case for the boundedness property of the inertia matrix which for a bad choice of state variables will not necessarily hold. This can be solved by deriving the dynamics for vehiclemanipulator systems in terms of quasi-velocities, which allows us to describe the dynamics without the presence of the Euler angle singularities that normally arise in vehicle-manipulator dynamics. To the authors' best knowledge we derive for the first time the dynamic equations with both the skew-symmetric property of the Coriolis matrix and the boundedness property of the inertia matrix for vehicle-manipulator systems with non-Euclidean joints.},

Quaternions over dual numbers are an established alternative representation; however, their use presents certain challenges: the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm contain a zero-angle singular-ity, and many common operations are less efficient using dual quaternions than with matrices. We present a new derivation of the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm that removes the singularity, and we show an implicit representation of dual quaternions offers analytical and empirical efficiency advantages compared to both matrices and explicit dual quaternions. Analytically, implicit dual quaternions are more compact and require fewer arithmetic instructions for common operations, including chaining and exponentials. Empirically, we demonstrate a 25%-40% speedup to compute the forward kinematics of multiple robots. This work offers a practical connection between dual quaternions and modern exponential coordinates, demonstrating that a quaternion-based approach provides a more efficient alternative to matrices for robot kinematics.},

   abstract = {© 2018 Wilde, Kwok Choon, Grompone and Romano. The paper provides a step-by-step tutorial on the Generalized Jacobian Matrix (GJM) approach for modeling and simulation of spacecraft-manipulator systems. The General Jacobian Matrix approach describes the motion of the end-effector of an underactuated manipulator system solely by the manipulator joint rotations, with the attitude and position of the base-spacecraft resulting from the manipulator motion. The coupling of the manipulator motion with the base-spacecraft are thus expressed in a generalized inertia matrix and a GJM. The focus of the paper lies on the complete analytic derivation of the generalized equations of motion of a free-floating spacecraft-manipulator system. This includes symbolic analytic expressions for all inertia property matrices of the system, including their time derivatives and joint-angle derivatives, as well as an expression for the generalized Jacobian of a generic point on any link of the spacecraft-manipulator system. The kinematics structure of the spacecraft-manipulator system is described both in terms of direction-cosine matrices and unit quaternions. An additional important contribution of this paper is to propose a new and more detailed definition for the modes of maneuvering of a spacecraft-manipulator. In particular, the two commonly used categories free-flying and free-floating are expanded by the introduction of five categories, namely floating, rotation-floating, rotation-flying, translation-flying, and flying. A fully-symbolic and a partially-symbolic option for the implementation of a numerical simulation model based on the proposed analytic approach are introduced and exemplary simulation results for a planar four-link spacecraft-manipulator system and a spatial six-link spacecraft manipulator system are presented.},

An outer loop control governs the desired admittance behavior and an inner loop based on geometric control ensures pose tracking. The interaction forces are estimated by a momentum based observer. Control and observation are made possible by a precise control and measurement of the speed of each propeller. An extensive experimental campaign shows that the Tilt-Hex is able to outperform the classical underactuated multi-rotors in terms of stability, accuracy and dexterity and represent one of the best choice at date for tasks requiring aerial physical interaction.},

Aerial manipulator system, usually composed of rotor aerial robot and the manipulator, is a new type of robot system with active operating capability.

Unfortunately, the new aerial manipulation system also brings new challenges, such as strong dynamics coupling, the modeling and stabilization problem, etc. which may affect its further application. Thus, in our work, an actual physical aerial manipulator system is designed and implemented for its system and application research.

The method is composed by two parts, a nominal input/state generator that takes into account the full-body nonlinear and coupled dynamics of the system, and a decentralized feedback controller acting on the actuated degrees of freedom that confers the needed robustness to the closed-loop system. We show how to apply the method to Protocentric Aerial Manipulators (PAM) by first using their differential flatness property on the vertical 2D plane in order to generate dynamical input/state trajectories, then statically extending the 2D structure to the 3D, and finally closing the loop with a decentralized controller having the dual task of both ensuring the preservation of the proper static 3D immersion and tracking the dynamic trajectory on the vertical plane. We demonstrate that the proposed controller is able to precisely track dynamic trajectories when implemented on a standard hardware composed by a quadrotor and a robotic arm with servo-controlled joints (even if no torque control is available). Comparative experiments clearly show the benefit of using the nominal input/state generator, and also the fact that the use of just static gravity compensation might surprisingly perform worse, in dynamic maneuvers, than the case of no compensation at all. We complement the experiments with additional realistic simulations testing the applicability of the proposed method to slightly non-protocentric aerial manipulators.},

We propose a control-aware planner based on the paradigm of tight coupling between planning and control. Such paradigm is especially useful in aerial manipulation, where the separation between planning and control is not advisable. The proposed sampling based motion planner uses a controller composed of a second-order inverse kinematics algorithm and a dynamic tracker, as a local planner, thus allowing a more natural consideration of the closed-loop system dynamics. For task-constrained motions, this method let us to sample directly in the reduced and more relevant task space, predict the behavior of the controller avoiding motions that bring to singularities or large tracking errors, and guarantee the correct execution of the maneuver. The method is tested in simulation for a multidirectional-thrust vehicle endowed with a 2-DoF manipulator.

   abstract = {Perching helps small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) extend their time of operation by saving battery power. However, most strategies for UAV perching require complex maneuvering and rely on specific structures, such as rough walls for attaching or tree branches for grasping. Many strategies to perching neglect the UAV’s mission such that saving battery power interrupts the mission. We suggest enabling UAVs with the capability of making and stabilizing contacts with the environment, which will allow the UAV to consume less energy while retaining its altitude, in addition to the perching capability that has been proposed before. This new capability is termed “resting.” For this, we propose a modularized and actuated landing gear framework that allows stabilizing the UAV on a wide range of different structures by perching and resting. Modularization allows our framework to adapt to specific structures for resting through rapid prototyping with additive manufacturing. Actuation allows switching between different modes of perching and resting during flight and additionally enables perching by grasping. Our results show that this framework can be used to perform UAV perching and resting on a set of common structures, such as street lights and edges or corners of buildings. We show that the design is effective in reducing power consumption, promotes increased pose stability, and preserves large vision ranges while perching or resting at heights. In addition, we discuss the potential applications facilitated by our design, as well as the potential issues to be addressed for deployment in practice.},

The main purpose is to control the aerial platform taking into account the presence of the moving manipulator. Three layers are considered in this work. First, a novel mechanism is proposed considering a moving battery to counterweight the statics of the robotic arm. Then, in order to overcome the mechanical limitations of the previous layer, the residual of the arm static effects on the UAV is computed and compensated through the given control thrust and torques. Finally, an estimator of external forces and moments acting on the aerial vehicle is considered and the estimations are fed back to the controller to compensate neglected aerodynamic effects and the arm dynamics. The performance of the proposed architecture has been experimentally evaluated.},

Relying on this structure, we propose a novel backstepping-like end-effector tracking control law, which can allow us to assign different roles for the center-of-mass control and for the internal rotational dynamics control according to task objectives.

A new hybrid switched reactive-based visual servo control structure, inspired from a sensing-and-reaction behavior without the inverse interaction matrix computing, is proposed to handle this problem efficiently. The proposed structure is similar to the logic-based approaches, but the requirements of the fuzzy modeling and/or the fuzzy-rule base learning are omitted. To achieve this, a novel hardware-aware reactive function approach is presented to directly map an image position error vector to a desired end-effector velocity vector under the consideration of hardware limitations. This approach helps to simplify the implementation of visual servo systems with improved reliability. Moreover, the proposed control system is a hybrid switching controller consisting of both image-based and position-based reactive planning schemes, which allows improving the robustness and effectiveness of the visual servo system. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed visual servo control method in a realistic scenario setting.},

This limitation leads to singularities and other artifacts in case the configuration space has a different topology, for example, in the case of ball joints or a free-floating mechanism. This paper discusses an extension of classical methods that allows for a more general class of joints, including all joints with a Lie group structure as well as nonholonomic joints. The model equations are derived using the Boltzmann-Hamel equations and have very similar structure and complexity as obtained using classical methods. However, singularities are avoided through the use of global non-Euclidean configuration coordinates, together with mappings describing a local Euclidean structure around each configuration. The resulting equations are explicit (unconstrained) differential equations, both for holonomic and nonholonomic joints, which do not require a coordinate atlas and can be directly implemented in simulation software.},

It refers to trans-porting a cylindrical object by rolling on its circular edge, as human workers maneuver a gas cylinder on the ground for example. Our robotic edge-rolling is achieved by controlling the object to roll on the bottom edge in contact with the ground, and to slide on the surface of the robot's end-effector. It can thus be regarded as a form of robotic dexterous, in-hand manipulation. We mainly address the problem of grasp planning for edge-rolling by studying how to design appropriate end-effectors with zero internal mobility and how to find feasible grasps for stably rolling the object quasidynamically with the simple end-effectors. An extensive set of experiments is performed with a conventional manipulator arm on not only flat surfaces but also a U-shaped half-pipe track. Long-range edge-rolling is demonstrated with a modular mobile manipulator which is capable of active steering control.},

typical wet laboratory for the development of a robot-assisted, rapid

symmetric geometry, then leverages simulated pours as priors for a given
fluid to pour precisely and quickly in a single attempt. The fluid is
detected in the transparent receiving container by combining weight and
vision. The change of volume in the receiver is a function of the
geometry of the pouring container, the pouring angle, and rate. To
determine the volumetric flow rate, the profile for maximum containable
volume for a given angle is estimated along with the time delay of the
fluid exiting the container. A trapezoidal trajectory generation
algorithm prescribes the desired volumetric flow rate as a function of
the estimation accuracy. A hybrid control strategy is then used to
attenuate volumetric error. Three methods are compared for estimating
the volume-angle profile, and it is shown that a combination of online
system identification and leveraged model priors results in reliable
performance. The major contributions of this work are a system capable
of pouring quickly and precisely from varying symmetric containers in a
single attempt with limited priors, and a novel fluid detection method.

Not surprisingly, there have been several recent studies in the application of UAS imagery for PA. The results of these studies would indicate that, to provide a reliable end product to farmers, advances in platform design, production, standardization of image georeferencing and mosaicing, and information extraction workflow are required.

We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological systems.

Traditionally, these platforms have been designed with each of the four propellers to spin in the designated direction (two clockwise and two counter-clockwise) to produce unidirectional thrust–this allows the vehicle to oppose gravity when in its nominal hover orientation. In this paper, we present a quadrotor which is capable of bidirectional thrust actuation: it is generated by reversing the direction of the driving motors and hence propeller spins. This configuration is motivated by the desire to increase the vehicle’s agility, as well as to imbue it with functionalities not available to the standard unidirectional thrust platforms. We present the dynamics model of a quadrotor with bidirectional thrust, the controller adapted to this configuration, and details of the implementation of the bidirectional capability in hardware and software, using the state-of-the-art Pixhawk micro-controller and PX4 flight stack. The transient thrust characteristics of a symmetric propeller are experimentally determined, highlighting the maximum rate of change and dead-zone specific to bidirectional thrust. Results starting from simulation, to hardware-in-the-loop testing, to experiments conducted with an outdoor platform are presented for a half flip maneuver, demonstrating the performance and upside down hovering of the vehicle.},

The parabolic motion is studied to obtain the ball trajectory and computes the capture limit time.

However, catching and throwing back objects is one form of physical engagement that still maintains a safe distance between the robot and participants.

We use an external camera system (ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE) to locate balls and a Kalman filter to predict ball destination and timing. The robot's hand and joint-space are calibrated to the vision coordinate system using a least-squares technique, such that the hand can be positioned to the predicted location. Successful catches are thrown back two and a half meters forward to the participant, and missed catches are detected to trigger suitable animations that indicate failure. Human to robot partner juggling (three ball cascade pattern, one hand for each partner) is also achieved by speeding up the catching/throwing cycle. We tested the throwing/catching system on six participants (one child and five adults, including one elderly), and the juggling system on three skilled jugglers. ? 2012 IEEE.},

Pontryagin's minimum principle is used to show that the interception maneuver that minimizes the time to rest after the interception is identical to the time-optimal maneuver that drives the vehicle to the position at which it comes to rest after the interception. This fact is leveraged to apply previously de-veloped, computationally efficient methods for the computation of interception maneuvers. The resulting trajectory generation algorithm is computationally lightweight, permitting its use as an implicit feedback law by replanning the trajectory at each controller update. The validity and performance of the approach is demonstrated experimentally by intercepting balls mid-flight. The real-time trajectory generation permits to take into account changes in the predicted ball flight path at each controller update.},

This paper presents a trajectory tracking control strategy based on the subspace stabilization approach to accurately manipulate an under-actuated flying robot from a known initial state to the desired terminal state. To facilitate the development of this tracking strategy, the dynamical model of the quadrotor is firstly proposed. Subsequently, an optimal trajectory generation algorithm is adopted to generate dynamically consistent trajectories regarding the initial and terminal state constraints in specific missions. Then, a trajectory tracking control strategy based on the subspace stabilization approach is developed considering the lumped disturbances and time delays. The developed control strategy is applied for ball juggling of a highly under-actuated quadrotor, which is a popular flying robot in recent years. Real-time experimental results show that the quadrotor can be accurately manipulated from a known initial state to the desired terminal state within a given time horizon. In the consecutive juggling tasks, the quadrotor with a racket of radius 0.065 m can consecutively juggle the ball for averagely 4 hits in each rally, and a longest rally achieved by the developed control strategy is 14 hits. The feasibility of the developed control strategy is also preliminarily verified through the cooperative juggling between two quadrotors.

In terms of robotics, it requires fast and reliable perception and control; in terms of artificial intelligence, it requires fast decision making to determine the best motion to hit the ball; in terms of machine learning, it requires the ability to accurately estimate where and when the ball will be so that it can be hit. The use of sophisticated perception (relying, for example, in multi-camera vision systems) and state-of-the-art robot manipulators significantly alleviates concerns with perception and control, leaving room for the exploration of novel approaches that focus on estimating where, when and how to hit the ball. In this paper, we move away from the hardware setup commonly used in this domain-typically relying on robotic manipulators combined with an array of multiple fixed cameras-and give the first steps towards having autonomous aerial table tennis robotic players. Specifically, we focus on the task of hitting a ping pong ball thrown at a commercial drone, equipped with a light cardboard racket and an onboard camera. We adopt a general framework for learning complex robot tasks and show that, in spite of the perceptual and actuation limitations of our system, the overall approach enables the quadrotor system to successfully respond to balls served by a human user.},

With the increasing demand of humans and robots collaborating in a confined workspace, it is essential that robots can react instantaneously to unforeseen events while respecting comfort of human co-workers. As the human pays especial attention to the end-effector movement rather than individual joints in such tasks, we argue that it is necessary to limit exactly these end-effector dynamics directly on SE(3), regardless of any specific coordinate system. Only then it is possible to constrain the robot end-effector in its absolute dynamic values, to enhance human comfort. Common online trajectory generators (OTGs) are either limited to single degrees of freedom (DOFs) or consider decoupled multi-DOF mainly in joint space. While these strategies can be directly applied to Cartesian coordinate systems by using Euler angles for orientation, constraining the change in Euler angles does not lead to the correct angular velocities. In this work we present a novel OTG with constraints on translational and rotational magnitudes on SE(3).

Executing agile quadrotor maneuvers with cablesuspended payloads is a challenging problem and complications induced by the dynamics typically require trajectory optimization. State-of-the-art approaches often need significant computation time and complex parameter tuning. We present a novel dynamical model and a fast trajectory optimization algorithm for quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload. Our first contribution is a new formulation of the suspended payload behavior, modeled as a link attached to the quadrotor with a combination of two revolute joints and a prismatic joint, all being passive. Differently from state of the art, we do not require the use of hybrid modes depending on the cable tension. Our second contribution is a fast trajectory optimization technique for the aforementioned system. Our model enables us to pose the trajectory optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Desired behaviors of the system (e.g., obstacle avoidance) can easily be formulated within this framework. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of computation speed and guarantees feasibility of the trajectory with respect to both the system dynamics and control input saturation, while utilizing far fewer tuning parameters. We experimentally validate our approach on a real quadrotor showing that our method generalizes to a variety of tasks, such as flying through desired waypoints while avoiding obstacles, or throwing the payload toward a desired target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that three-dimensional, agile maneuvers exploiting the system dynamics have been achieved on quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload.},

   abstract = {Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool with many important applications in robotic motion planning and control. However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints. We demonstrate ALTRO's capabilities on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation (DIRCOL) method.},

   abstract = {Quadrotors have been used in many areas such as cargo transportation, agriculture, and search and rescue. The low energy density of power sources and the low energy efficiency of quadrotors have prevented quadrotors from a wider range of applications where a large payload has to be carried or long flight time is required. This paper optimizes the energy efficiency of a quadrotor via rotating its arms to proper positions calculated based on the dynamics model of the quadrotor and the power–thrust curve of rotors. The conditions that a quadrotor in steady-state can achieve the optimal energy efficiency are mathematically derived and the energy efficiency of a quadrotor in various scenarios is analyzed. Based on the analysis, an arm-rotation approach is proposed to optimize the energy efficiency of a quadrotor with a center-of-gravity offset in steady hovering. It is shown with simulation that an example quadrotor with rotatable arms can save up to 13% of energy. Experiments show that the same example quadrotor can save even more energy in practice, owing to the byproduct of the arm-rotation approach.},

   abstract = {External wrench estimation is very helpful for aerial exploration and manipulation tasks. During the exploration, there might be unseen obstacles to cause dangerous collisions. The estimation of the external force and torque is also beneficial in aerial manipulation tasks. In this paper, we present a framework of estimating the external wrench for the aerial multilink robot based on the onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, joints state and robot dynamic models. Compared to the conventional multirotor robot, the center of mass (CoM) is always changing when the robot transforms. The sensor could not be attached to CoM to observe the acceleration data. Consequently, we present a novel method by applying a distributed IMU system to estimate the CoM linear and angular accelerations for the external wrench estimation. With the help of the robot model, the position of the contact point could be estimated, which is useful in exploring tasks to safely interact with the physical world. We design the contact-aided navigation strategy and computationally efficient motion primitives library to help our robot react to the unexpected collision. We experimentally validate our framework with a two-dimensional multilink aerial robot to show the results of external wrench estimator and its further applications2.2Experiment video: https://youtu.be/R-WDReLnWWI},

Hindered by its nonlinear objective and complex constraints, this problem is hard even for state-of-the-art nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers. The proposed framework addresses the problem by bilevel optimization. Specifically, the original problem is divided into an inner layer, which computes a time-optimal velocity profile along a fixed geometric path, and an outer layer, which refines the geometric path by a Quasi-Newton method. The inner optimization is convex and efficiently solved by interior-point methods. A novel variable reordering method is introduced to accelerate the optimization of the velocity profile. The gradients of the outer layer can be derived from the Lagrange multipliers using sensitivity analysis of parametric optimization problems. The method is guaranteed to return a feasible solution at any time, and numerical experiments on a ground vehicle with friction circle dynamics model show that the proposed method performs more robustly than general NLP solvers.},

Computationally lightweight motion primitives for which closed-form solutions exist are presented and an efficient method to test their feasibility is derived. The algorithm is shown to be able to generate trajectories and verify their feasibility within a few microseconds and can thus be used as an implicit feedback law or in high-level path planners that involve evaluating a large number of possible trajectories to achieve some high-level goal. The algorithm's performance is analyzed by comparing it with time-optimal trajectories.

The proposed robot has a rigid spherical shell as its body, which contains active 2-d.o.f. pendulum inside as the control component. The robot is supposed to roll on the flat horizontal floor without any slippage, and to spin around the vertical axis depending on kinematical settings when allowed. Through the dynamical analysis based on the model and several numerical simulations, we observe that the settings concerned with the spin is so crucial that the sphere tends to be severely affected by the torque from the ground, and point out that it should be the essential factors for the modeling and new robot creation in the future work.},

   abstract = {The motion of a rolling ball actuated by internal point masses that move inside the ball’s frame of reference is considered. The equations of motion are derived by applying Euler–Poincaré’s symmetry reduction method in concert with Lagrange–d’Alembert’s principle, which accounts for the presence of the nonholonomic rolling constraint. As a particular example, we consider the case when the masses move along internal rails, or trajectories, of arbitrary shape and fixed within the ball’s frame of reference. Our system of equations can treat most possible methods of actuating the rolling ball with internal moving masses encountered in the literature, such as circular motion of the masses mimicking swinging pendula or straight line motion of the masses mimicking magnets sliding inside linear tubes embedded within a solenoid. Moreover, our method can model arbitrary rail shapes and an arbitrary number of rails such as several ellipses and/or figure eights, which may be important for future designs of rolling ball robots. For further analytical study, we also reduce the system to a single differential equation when the motion is planar, that is, considering the motion of the rolling disk actuated by internal point masses, in which case we show that the results obtained from the variational derivation coincide with those obtained from Newton’s second law. Finally, the equations of motion are solved numerically, illustrating a wealth of complex behaviors exhibited by the system’s dynamics. Our results are relevant to the dynamics of nonholonomic systems containing internal degrees of freedom and to further studies of control of such systems actuated by internal masses.},

Our control algorithm takes into account communication constraints, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, by synthesizing a piecewise smooth vector field for safe navigation. First, the feasible free joint configuration space is tessellated into polytopes that account for the desired constraints. We search the graph of these polytopes to find a discrete path to the goal polytope. We then use a novel navigation function-based feedback controller that drives the system from one polytope to the next and eventually to the goal. The controller exploits the fact that two adjoining polytopes in the planned discrete path together form a star-shaped object that is obstacle free; this enables the design of navigation function-based controller for kinematic and dynamic fully actuated robots without spurious minima. We sequentially compose these controllers to drive the state to the goal. For a polygonal space, the algorithm we propose is complete. We present successful simulation results of the algorithm on a group of ground vehicles and quadrotors performing a cooperative navigation task in constrained environments.},

   abstract = {We present a new methodology for exact robot motion planning and control that unifies the purely kinematic path planning problem with the lower level feedback controller design. Complete information about the freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function—a navigation function—that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all intial free configurations. Since navigation functions exist for any robot and obstacle course, our methodology is completely general in principle. However, this paper is mainly concerned with certain constructive techniques for a particular class of motion planning problems. Specifically, we present a formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disc by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint discs representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation that we show how to build. Our constructions exploit these coordinate transformations to adapt a navigation function on the model space to its more geometrically complicated (but topologically equivalent) instances. The formula that we present admits sphere-worlds of arbitrary dimension and is directly applicable to configuration spaces whose forbidden regions can be modeled by such generalized discs. We have implemented these navigation functions on planar scenarios, and simulation results are provided throughout the paper. © 1992 IEEE},

These maps, which we term navigation functions, are constructed on an arbitrary sphere world-a compact connected subset of Euclidean n-space whose boundary is formed from the disjoint union of a finite number of (n - l)-spheres. We show that this class is invariant under composition with analytic diffeomorphisms: our sphere world construction immediately generates a navigation function on all manifolds into which a sphere world is deformable. On the other hand, certain well known results of S. Smale guarantee the existence of smooth navigation functions on any smooth manifold. This suggests that analytic navigation functions exist, as well, on more general analytic manifolds than the deformed sphere worlds we presently consider. © 1990.},

Systems are often augmented with slung loads, inverted pendulums or arms, and accomplish complex tasks such as going through a window, grasping, throwing and catching. Usually, controllers are designed to accomplish a specific task on a specific system using analytic solutions, so each application needs long preparations. On the other hand, the direct multiple shooting approach is able to solve complex problems without any analytic development, by using off-the-shelf optimization solver. In this paper, we show that this approach is able to solve a wide range of problems relevant to quadrotor systems, from on-line trajectory generation for quadrotors to going through a window for a quadrotor-and-pendulum system, through manipulation tasks for a aerial manipulator.},

   abstract = {There is extensive literature on using convex optimization to derive piece-wise polynomial trajectories for controlling differential flat systems with applications to three-dimensional flight for Micro Aerial Vehicles. In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC). The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning , which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.},

   abstract = {Robots with flying capabilities, so calledaerial robots, are essentially robotic platforms,which are autonomously controlled via some sophisticated control engineering tools. Similarto manyaerial vehicles(e.g. fixed-wing planes or the helicopters which are already animportant part of our lives since almost a century), they can overcome the gravitationalforces thanks to their design and/or actuation type. What makes them different from theconventional aerial vehicles, is the level of theirautonomy. Reducing the complexity forpiloting of such robots/vehicles provide the human operator more freedom and comfort.Particularly the small size (or miniature) aerial robots (such asquadrotors) are becoming abigger part of our lives, while they are rapidly advanced in the robotics society for improvingour life quality. With their increasing autonomy, they can perform many complicated tasksby their own (such as surveillance, monitoring, or inspection), leaving the human operatorthe most high-level decisions to be made, if necessary. In this way they can be operatedin hazardous and challenging environments, which might posses high risks to the humanhealth. Thanks to their wide range of usage, the ongoing researches on these robots willhave an increasing impact on the human life.Over the past two decades, aerial robots have been extremely put in use for tasks e.g.surveillance, monitoring, filming, obstacle avoidance, etc. All these tasks had at least onething in common: avoiding the flying robot any physical interaction with its environment.The obvious reason is because such interaction could lead the robot to a crash or to anunstable/uncontrolled scenario. This would be of course undesired, because it might finishthe mission earlier than planned and even damage the fragile electronics onboard of therobot. In the time this thesis work had started, novel methods and technologies werebecoming emerging needs on how to perform meaningful physical interaction tasks withaerial robots, while maintaining their stable flight.Today, using the aerial robots for physical interaction and manipulation is a populartopic, with a great interest of many researchers. Including this thesis work, there have beenvarious studies addressing the design, modeling and control problem ofAerial PhysicalInteraction(APhI) andAerial Manipulation. A clear motivation of using aerial robots forphysical interaction, is to benefit their great workspace and agility. Moreover, developingrobots that can perform not only APhI but also aerial manipulation can bring the greatworkspace of the flying robots together with the vast dexterity of the manipulating arms.However achieving this is not only challenged by the limited technology, but also by thelack of sophisticated methods for handling the control of the system in a desired and stableway during physical interaction. It is important to note, that the APhI is still an open topicin many senses, and many studies are addressing it using different perspectives. This thesiswork is one of those, which humbly tries to provide rigorous solutions to that problem usingSystem/Control, Mechanics, Electronics and Computer Engineering tools.In this doctoral thesis, the APhI and theAerial Manipulationis studied in terms ofdesign,modelingandcontrolof aerial robots and manipulating arms; when they cometogether and become one system. Although fixed-wing planes, or helicopters can be (and are) considered as aerial robots, during the course of this thesis we focus on thequadrotors,mostly because of their accessibility andVertical Take-off and Landing(VTOL) ability.Using thenonlinearmathematical models of the robots at hand, here we propose severaldifferent control methods for APhI and aerial manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we presentnovel design tools (e.g. new manipulating arms) to be used together with miniature aerialrobots, and contribute to the robotics society not only in terms of theory but also practicalimplementation and experimental robotics.},

We propose a new methodology to find a feasible catching configuration in a probabilistic manner. We use the dynamical systems approach to encode motion from several demonstrations. This enables a rapid and reactive adaptation of the arm motion in the presence of sensor uncertainty.

   abstract = {Furthering the aim of reducing human exposure to hazardous environments, this monograph presents a detailed study of the modeling and control of vehicle-manipulator systems. The text shows how complex interactions can be performed at remote locations using systems that combine the manipulability of robotic manipulators with the ability of mobile robots to locomote over large areas. The first part studies the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies and standard robotic manipulators and can be used as an introduction to robotics focussing on robust mathematical modeling. The monograph then moves on to study vehicle-manipulator systems in great detail with emphasis on combining two different configuration spaces in a mathematically sound way. Robustness of these systems is extremely important and Modeling and Control of Vehicle-manipulator Systems effectively represents the dynamic equations using a mathematically robust framework. Several tools from Lie theory and differential geometry are used to obtain globally valid representations of the dynamic equations of vehicle-manipulator systems. The specific characteristics of several different types of vehicle-manipulator systems are included and the various application areas of these systems are discussed in detail. For underwater robots buoyancy and gravity, drag forces, added mass properties, and ocean currents are considered. For space robotics the effects of free fall environments and the strong dynamic coupling between the spacecraft and the manipulator are discussed. For wheeled robots wheel kinematics and non-holonomic motion is treated, and finally the inertial forces are included for robots mounted on a forced moving base. Modeling and Control of Vehicle-manipulator Systems will be of interest to researchers and engineers studying and working on many applications of robotics: underwater, space, personal assistance, and mobile manipulation in general, all of which have similarities in the equations required for modeling and control. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control.

We also discuss implementations of the algorithm directly in Cartesian space, the exploitation of kinematic redundancies, and applications to adaptive compliant motion control.

   abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive description of a new method of factorization for the Coriolis/centripetal matrix. In the past three decades, studies on dynamics have rapidly developed through the efforts of many researchers in the field of mechanics. While direct methods for deriving the Coriolis/centripetal matrix are well known and have been widely used in the last century, the entries of this matrix were always obtained by means of the Christoffel symbols of first kind. Startling techniques for deriving dynamic equations of robot manipulators first appeared about 30 years ago. Since then, much has been done to refine and develop the method, but it is still a highly active field of research, with many outstanding problems, both theoretical and in applications. This work presents, in a unitary frame and from a new perspective, the main concepts and results of one of the most fascinating aspects of mechanics, namely the factorization of structures, and offers the reader another point of view concerning a possible way to approach the Coriolis/centripetal matrix. It aims to study a theory of representation for such a matrix based on an elegant method of fundamental matrices. The paper is intended to be self-contained by presenting complete properties emerging from these novel structures. This work is useful not only to researchers in mechanics, but also to control engineers who are interested in learning some of the mechanical modeling. Toward this end, the paper provides numerical examples, as well as practical adaptive applications for modern designers to use at the system level. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

   abstract = {Common control methods for free-floating robots assume zero initial linear and angular momenta, for which a reduced joint dynamics equivalent to that of a fixed-base robot can be obtained. On the other hand, a disturbance is induced in the system dynamics when the linear or angular momenta are not zero, leading to a deviation of the end effector. In this work the dynamics of the free-floating robot in presence of momentum is analyzed and a torque feedback control is proposed. An operational space formulation is considered to identify the disturbing Coriolis/centrifugal forces and to cancel them by feedback. A stability proof for the proposed controller is developed using a time-varying approach. The effectiveness of the control is shown in simulation for a seven degrees-of-freedom arm connected to a floating-base under the effect of linear and angular momenta considering model parameters uncertainties.},

Increased yaw authority is achieved by tilting the propellers' thrust directions in the direction that increases their yaw torque. The power reduction is achieved in noisy environments, where the vehicle experiences external disturbances. This is due to the lower variance in motor forces required for yaw control, and the convex functional relationship between force and power consumed. We present a theoretical analysis motivating a reduction in power consumed to first order in increasing propeller tilt, in addition to increasing agility. Experiments validate the idea, where the measured electric power is used instead of the mechanical power consumption. Experiments are performed on two quadcopters of very different scales, with masses ranging from 45g to 1.15kg, with both showing a power improvement.},

We first motivate the use of representing nonlinear systems as linear Koopman operator systems by illustrating the improved model-based control performance with an actuated Van der Pol system. Information-theoretic methods are then applied to the Koopman operator formulation of dynamical systems where we derive a controller for active learning of robot dynamics. The active learning controller is shown to increase the rate of information about the Koopman operator. In addition, our active learning controller can readily incorporate policies built on the Koopman dynamics, enabling the benefits of fast active learning and improved control. Results using a quadcopter illustrate single-execution active learning and stabilization capabilities during free fall. The results for active learning are extended for automating Koopman observables and we implement our method on real robotic systems.},

For instance, think of tasks like the inspection of a bridge, the inspection and the fixing-up of high-voltage electric lines, the repairing of rotor blades and so on. These tasks are both very unsafe and expensive because they require the performance of professional climbers and/or specialists in the field. A drone with manipulation capabilities can instead assist the human operator in these jobs or, at least, in the most hazardous and critical situations. As a matter of fact, such devices can indeed operate in dangerous tasks like reaching the bottom of the deck of a bridge or the highest places of a plant or a building; they can avoid dangerous work at height; aerial platforms can increase the total number of inspections of a plant, monitoring the wear of the components.

   abstract = {Differential flatness is a property of certain systems that greatly simplifies the generation of optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories. Using a differentially flat model, there is no need to integrate the system dynamics to retrieve the states and the constraints of the optimization problem are simpler. Recently, the concept of partial differential flatness has been introduced covering a broader class of systems. In particular, it allows to reduce the need for integration by limiting it to a subset of the states. However, finding an analytical expression for the (partial) differential flatness requires the manipulation of the equations of motion in a very specific manner such that a series of properties are fulfilled. In general, finding such analytical model is not straightforward nor compatible with algorithmic models. In order to tackle this problem, in this paper we present a numerical method to find a (partially) differentially flat model of a system around a collection of states and inputs trajectories. We present results on three underactuated nonlinear systems (cart-pole, planar ballbot and a 3D quadrotor). As use case examples, we show online trajectory re-planning tasks. The validity of the trajectories obtained with the locally flat models is verified by forward integrating the original equations of motion together with an optimal stabilizer.},

We provide several examples of underactuated systems which are not differentially flat, but are partially differentially flat.

Optimal sampling-based planners like RRT∗, FMT∗, and BIT∗ when applied to kinodynamic systems require solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) to perform exact connections between nodes in the tree. Two-point BVPs are non-trivial to solve, hence the prevalence of alternative approaches that focus on specific instances of kinodynamic systems, use approximate solutions to the two-point BVP, or use random propagation of controls. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting recent advances in numerical optimal control and optimization to solve these two-point BVPs for arbitrary kinodynamic systems and how they can be integrated with existing optimal planning algorithms. We combine BIT∗ with a two-point BVP solver that uses sequential quadratic programming (SQP). We consider the problem of computing minimum-time trajectories. Since the duration of trajectories is not known a-priori, we include the time-step as part of the optimization to allow SQP to optimize over the duration of the trajectory while keeping the number of discrete steps fixed for every connection attempted. Our experiments indicate that using a two-point BVP solver in the inner-loop of BIT∗ is competitive with the state-of-the-art in sampling-based optimal planning that explicitly avoids the use of two-point BVP solvers.},

A simple but not trivial example of reaching in a dynamic environment is the rest-to-rest manipulation of a multi-mass flexible object with the elimination of residual vibrations. Two approaches to the prediction of reaching movements are formulated in position and force actuation settings. In the first approach, either the position of the hand or the hand force is specified by the lowest order polynomial satisfying the boundary conditions of the reaching task. The second approach is based on the minimization of either the hand jerk or the hand force-change, with taking into account the dynamics of the flexible object. To verify the resulting four mathematical models, an experiment on the manipulation of a ten-masses flexible object of low stiffness is conducted. The experimental results show that the second approach gives a significantly better prediction of human movements, with the minimum hand force-change model having a slight but consistent edge over the minimum hand jerk one.},

It can be shown that the extension of the control from the kinematic to the dynamic model is straight-forward using the same flat outputs under the same diffeomorphism between the state/input space and the flat output space. Given that the application of such system is considerably ubiquitous recently, this paper is a reminder that a simple control method exists without too much effort in developing new dedicated controllers.

These underactuated manipulators arise in a number of important applications such as free-flying space robots, hyperredundant manipulators, manipulators with structural flexibility, etc. In the analysis such underactuated manipulators are decomposed into component active and passive arms. This decomposition allows techniques previously developed for regular (fully actuated) manipulators to be applied to underactuated systems. Spatial operator identities are used to develop closed-form expressions for the generalized accelerations for the system. These expressions form the basis for a recursive O(N) dynamics algorithm. The structure of this algorithm is a hybrid of known forward and inverse dynamics algorithms for regular manipulators. Expressions and computational algorithms are also developed for the generalized and disturbance Jacobians for underactuated manipulators.

The platform consists of an RRT robot and a cable suspended swinging actuator that form a subsequent parallel kinematic chain and it is equipped with ducted fan actuators. In spite of the complementary ducted fan actuators, the system is under-actuated. The method of computed torques is applied to control the motion of the robot. The under-actuated systems have less control inputs than degrees of freedom. We assume that the investigated under-actuated system has desired outputs of the same number as inputs. In spite of the fact that the inverse dynamical calculation leads to the solution of a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE), the desired control inputs can be determined uniquely by the method of computed torques. We use natural (Cartesian) coordinates to describe the configuration of the robot, while a set of algebraic equations represents the geometric constraints. In this modeling approach the mathematical model of the dynamical system itself is also a DAE. The paper discusses the inverse dynamics problem of the complex hybrid robotic system. The results include the desired actuator forces as well as the nominal coordinates corresponding to the desired motion of the carried payload. The method of computed torque control with a PD controller is applied to under-actuated systems described by natural coordinates, while the inverse dynamics is solved via the backward Euler discretization of the DAE system for which a general formalism is proposed. The results are compared with the closed form results obtained by simplified models of the system.

These dynamical systems have configuration spaces with non-trivial geometry but are often modeled with restrictions to their configuration space to simplify the geometry. Instead, we leverage techniques for differential geometry and Lie algebra to model the intrinsic geometry of these robots correctly and in a coordinate-free fashion. Using these models, we tackle problems in planning, control, and estimation with the goal of efficient computationally limited onboard implementation for real systems.     Trajectory generation for robots in cluttered environments requires enforcing of collision free constraints. We utilize tools from computational geometry to model obstacles and formulate useful convex partitions of free space. Targeting on-line applications, these modeling methods are co-designed with the optimization-based formulations to be able to enable real-time planning through unknown environments without offboard sensing or computation.    We use convex and non-convex optimization approaches to solve for dynamically feasible trajectories in Rn, Lie groups  SO(3), SE(3), and smooth manifolds. Using a variety of sensor models, we use environment observations to build representations which allows us to enforce collision free constraints in these optimization formulations using convex approximations. We address how to use multiple charts to represent these manifolds and how to control and estimate the states of robots with this representation. These methods are applied to free flying systems such as a myriad of quadrotor platforms with under actuated dynamics and a free flying space robot with over actuated dynamics.},

   abstract = {Manifolds are used in almost all robotics applications even if they are not modeled explicitly. We propose a differential geometric approach for optimizing trajectories on a Riemannian manifold with obstacles. The optimization problem depends on a metric and collision function specific to a manifold. We then propose our safe corridor on manifolds (SCM) method of computationally optimizing trajectories for robotics applications via a constrained optimization problem. Our method does not need equality constraints, which eliminates the need to project back to a feasible manifold during optimization. We then demonstrate how this algorithm works on an example problem on SO(3) and a perception-aware planning example for visual–inertially guided robots navigating in three dimensions. Formulating field of view constraints naturally results in modeling with the manifold R3 × S2, which cannot be modeled as a Lie group. We also demonstrate the example of planning trajectories on SE(3) for a formation of quadrotors within an obstacle filled environment.},

Their physical properties are subsumed by a linearizing output and they might be regarded as providing another nonlinear extension of Kalman’s controllability. The distance to flatness is measured by a non-negative integer, the defect. We utilize differential algebra where flatness and defect are best defined without distinguishing between input, state, output and other variables. Many realistic classes of examples are flat. We treat two popular ones: the crane and the car with n trailers, the motion planning of which is obtained via elementary properties of plane curves. The three non-flat examples, the simple, double and variable length pendulums, are borrowed from non-linear physics. A high frequency control strategy is proposed such that the averaged systems become flat. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

   abstract = {The inverse dynamics analysis of underactuated multibody systems aims at determining the control inputs in order to track a prescribed trajectory. This paper studies the inverse dynamics of non-minimum phase underactuated multibody systems with serial and parallel planar topology, e.g. for end-effector control of flexible manipulators or manipulators with passive joints. Unlike for minimum phase systems, the inverse dynamics of non-minimum phase systems cannot be solved by adding trajectory constraints (servo-constraints) to the equations of motion and applying a forward time integration. Indeed, the inverse dynamics of a non-minimum phase system is known to be non-causal, which means that the control forces and torques should start before the beginning of the trajectory (pre-actuation phase) and continue after the end-point is reached (post-actuation phase). The existing stable inversion method proposed for general nonlinear non-minimum phase systems requires to derive explicitly the equations of the internal dynamics and to solve a boundary value problem. This paper proposes an alternative solution strategy which is based on an optimal control approach using a direct transcription method. The method is illustrated for the inverse dynamics of an underactuated serial manipulator with rigid links and four degrees-of-freedom and an underactuated parallel machine. An important advantage of the proposed approach is that it can be applied directly to the standard equations of motion of multibody systems either in ODE or in DAE form. Therefore, it is easier to implement this method in a general purpose simulation software. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

However, in the case with three robots, when the tensions of the cables are also specified, this inverse kinematics problem is shown to have a finite number of solutions. In order to obtain all possible solutions, an efficient analytic algorithm based on dialytic elimination is presented in this paper. Case studies with an equilateral triangle payload and a general payload are used for demonstration. In addition, a numerical procedure is developed to determine the set of allowable tensions.

In the previous work, a manipulator or a gripper is attached to the bottom of a quadrotor to facilitate the interaction with the environment.

In this paper, a quadrotor with a 2-DOF manipulator that has a unique topology to enable the end-effector to track a desired 6-DOF trajectory with minimum possible actuators is investigated. The proposed system is designed and modeled. However, such a system produces complexity in its inverse kinematics and control. A novel solution to the inverse kinematics problem is presented, which requires a solution of complicated algebraic/differential equations. Its accuracy is verified via numerical results. In order to solve the control problem, the system nonholonomic constraints are utilized with amodelfree and low computation cost robust control technique. Moreover, the system stability proof under the proposed controller is carried out. A prototype of the proposed system is built and its design is verified via a flight test. In addition, the system feasibility and efficiency are enlightened.},

The proposed controllers incorporate the combined dynamics of the UAV base and the serial arm, and properly account for the two degrees of underactuation in the plane of the propellers. The control developments follow the so-called method of virtual decomposition, which by employing a Newtonian formulation of the UAV-manipulator dynamics, sidesteps the complexities associated with the derivation and parametrization of a lumped Lagrangian dynamics model. The algorithms are guaranteed to produce feasible control commands as the constraints associated with the underactuation are explicitly considered in the control calculations. A Lyapunov analysis demonstrates the stability of the overall system and the convergence of the motion tracking errors.

The system dynamics is then formulated in the local tangent space to the manifold at the system representation point. Imposed constraints on the system, the tangent space splits into the velocity restricted and velocity admissible subspaces, while the system configuration manifold confines to the holonomic constraint manifold. Based on these geometrical concepts, a uniform vector-matrix formulation is developed. Both holonomic and nonholonomic systems are treated in a unified way, and the dynamic equations are expressible either in generalized velocities or in quasi-velocities. Using a geometrically grounded projection method, compact schemes for obtaining different types of equations of motion and for determination of constraint reactions are provided. Some fresh contributions to the theory of constrained systems are reported. A relationship between the present formulation and the other classical methods of analytical dynamics is shown.},

   abstract = {The paper deals with controlled mechanical systems in which the number of control inputs is equal to the number of desired system outputs, and is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The determination of control input strategy that force the underactuated system to complete the partly specified motion is a challenging problem. In the present formulation, the outputs (performance goals), expressed in terms of system states, are treated as constraints on the system - called control or program constraints as distinct from contact constraints in the classical sense, and a mathematical resemblance of the inverse control problem to the constrained system dynamics is exploited. However, while the reactions of contact constraints act in the directions orthogonal to the respective constraint manifold, the available control reactions may have arbitrary directions with respect to the program constraint manifold, and in the extreme may be tangent. A specific methodology must then be developed to find the solution of such "singular" problems, related to a class of control tracking problems such as position control of elastic joint robots, control of cranes, and aircraft control in prescribed trajectory flight. The governing equations of the problem arise as a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and an effective method for solving the DAEs, based on backward Euler method, is proposed. The open-loop control formulation obtained this way is then extended by a closed-loop control law to provide stable tracking of the required reference trajectories in the presence of perturbations. Some examples of applications of the theory and results of numerical simulations are reported.},

The overhead crane is inherently underactuated and modeled as a two-dimensional mechanical system with nonlinear system dynamics. Actuators are modeled as first-order systems to simplify implementation and account for velocity-controlled drives. The control based on servo-constraints is shown to be an effective method of trajectory control for overhead cranes. It will be demonstrated that the formulation is solvable in real-time using linear implicit Euler integration. The feedforward solution is made robust by an augmentation with LQR as well as a sliding mode controller. Experiments are conducted on a laboratory crane of 13 m motion range.},

   abstract = {Underactuated mechanical systems have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom. The specified in time outputs, equal in number to the number of inputs, lead to servo-constraints on the system. The servo-constraint problem is then a specific inverse simulation problem in which an input control strategy (feedforward control) that forces an underactuated system to complete the partly specified motion is determined. Since mechanical systems may be "underactuated" in several ways, and the control forces may be arbitrarily oriented with respect to the servo-constraint manifold, this is, in general, a challenging task. The use of servo-constraints in the inverse dynamics analysis of underactuated systems is discussed here with an emphasis on diverse possible ways of the constraint realization. A formulation of the servo-constraint problem in configuration coordinates is compared with a setting in which the actuated coordinates are replaced with the outputs. The governing equations can then be set either as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The existence and nonexistence of an explicit solution to the servo-constraint problem is further discussed, related to so-called flat systems (with no internal dynamics) and nonflat systems (with internal dynamics). In case of nonflat systems, of paramount importance is stability of the internal dynamics. Simple case studies are reported to illustrate the discussion and formulations. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

Methods: The PubMed database from inception to June 2015 was searched for English literature on the clinical use of DVSSP in general surgery, urology and gynecology. Results: Twenty-nine articles involving the clinical application of DVSSP were identified; 15 articles on general surgery (561 procedures), four articles on urology (48 procedures) and 10 articles on gynecology (212 procedures). All studies have proven the safety and feasibility of the use of DVSSP. The principal reported advantage is the restoration of intra-abdominal triangulation, while the main reported limitation is the lack of the endowrist. Conclusions: Da Vinci systems have proven to be valuable assets in single-site surgery, owing to the combination of robot use with the dedicated single-incision platform.

This is a thorough review of the literature on the nature and development of this device with emphasis on surgical applications. We have reviewed the published literature and classified robotic arms by their application: show, industrial application, medical application, etc. There is a definite trend in the manufacture of robotic arms toward more dextrous devices, more degrees-of-freedom, and capabilities beyond the human arm. da Vinci designed the first sophisticated robotic arm in 1495 with four degrees-of-freedom and an analog on-board controller supplying power and programmability. von Kemplen's chess-playing automaton left arm was quite sophisticated. Unimate introduced the first industrial robotic arm in 1961, it has subsequently evolved into the PUMA arm. In 1963 the Rancho arm was designed; Minsky's Tentacle arm appeared in 1968, Scheinman's Stanford arm in 1969, and MIT's Silver arm in 1974. Aird became the first cyborg human with a robotic arm in 1993. In 2000 Miguel Nicolalis redefined possible man-machine capacity in his work on cerebral implantation in owl-monkeys directly interfacing with robotic arms both locally and at a distance. The robotic arm is the end-effector of robotic systems and currently is the hallmark feature of the da Vinci Surgical System making its entrance into surgical application. But, despite the potential advantages of this computer-controlled master-slave system, robotic arms have definite limitations. Ongoing work in robotics has many potential solutions to the drawbacks of current robotic surgical systems. © Springer London 2007.},

   abstract = {Mobile manipulators are intrinsically nonholonomic systems since the mobile base is subject to nonholonomic constraints that result from no-slip constraints on the wheels. The highly nonlinear dynamic coupling between the mobile base and the manipulator arm, in addition to the nonholonomic constraints at the base, makes these systems difficult to plan and control. If the system is under-actuated, the problem becomes even more difficult. In this paper, using a special inertia distribution on the manipulator arm, the differential flatness property of mobile manipulators is achieved. An integrated planning and control methodology is presented for two different types of under-actuated planar mobile manipulators, with a two-wheeled differentially driven mobile base and with a car-like mobile base, respectively. A mobile manipulator with either of the two bases is shown to be differentially flat. In addition, this paper shows that a wide range of under-actuated arm designs results in differential flatness. Through illustrative examples of under-actuated two-link planar mobile manipulators, it is demonstrated that with the differential flatness property, the trajectory planning and feedback controller design problem can be solved in an efficient and simplified way. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The proposed method finds the joint torques necessary to produce a specified end-effector motion. Since the inverse dynamic problem in elastic manipulators is closely coupled to the inverse kinematic problem, the solution of the first also renders the displacements and rotations at any point of the manipulator, including the joints. Furthermore the formulation is complete in the sense that it includes all the nonlinear terms due to the large rotation of the links. The Timoshenko beam theory is used to model the elastic characteristics, and the resulting equations of motion are discretized using the finite element method. An iterative solution scheme is proposed that relies on local linearization of the problem. The solution of each linearization is carried out in the frequency domain. The performance and capabilities of this technique are tested, first through simulation analysis, and second through experimental validation using feed-forward control. Results show the potential use of this method not only for open-loop control, but also for incorporation in feedback control strategies .},

First, we derive the modified non-linear dynamics for a rolling system. Also, the singularity regions for this underactuated system is demonstrated. Then, the wave parameters are designed under certain conditions to remove the coupling singularities. We obtain these conditions from the positive definiteness of the inertia matrix in the inverse dynamics.

   abstract = {Underactuated multibody systems have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom. In trajectory tracking control of such systems an accurate and efficient feedforward control is often necessary. For multibody systems feedforward control by model inversion can be designed using servo-constraints. So far servo-constraints have been mostly applied to differentially flat underactuated mechanical systems. Differentially flat systems can be inverted purely by algebraic manipulations and using a finite number of differentiations of the desired output trajectory. However, such algebraic solutions are often hard to find and therefore the servo-constraint approach provides an efficient and practical solution method. Recently first results on servo-constraint problems of non-flat underactuated multibody systems have been reported. Hereby additional dynamics arise, so-called internal dynamics, yielding a dynamical system as inverse model. In this paper the servo-constraint problem is analyzed for both, differentially flat and non-flat systems. Different arising important phenomena are demonstrated using two illustrative examples. Also strategies for the numerical solution of servo-constraint problems are discussed. © 2013 Author(s).},

We use directly the exponential product formula to formulate the kinematic equation of an unfixed-base manipulator. In order to derive the dynamic equation of an unfixed-base manipulator, geometric variations, Riemannian metric, and Christoffel symbol are introduced. And, a concise, closed-form and coordinate-free dynamic equation is given according to the Hamilton's variational principle. This derived model has two characteristics. On one hand, the dynamic model of the fixed-base manipulator is obtained naturally from this dynamic model of the unfixed-base manipulator. On the other hand, it is a control-oriented model and has some important structural properties which may be used to construct the tracking control law.},

A challenging question of how to perform point-to-point motions in the state space of such a highly nonlinear system, in spite of the absence of some actuators in the arm, is answered in this paper. We show that, by appropriate inertia distribution of the links and addition of torsion springs at the joints, a range of underactuated designs is possible, where the underactuated mobile manipulator system is differentially flat. The differential flatness property allows one to efficiently solve the problem of trajectory planning and feedback controller design for point-to-point motions in the state space. The proposed method is illustrated by the example of a mobile vehicle with an underactuated three-link manipulator. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

   abstract = {This paper focuses on the synchronizing control of multiple interconnected flexible robotic manipulators using differential flatness theory. The flatness theory has the advantage of simplifying trajectory tracking tasks of complex mechanical systems. Using this theory, we propose a new synchronization scheme whereby a formation of flatness based systems can be stabilized using their respective flat outputs. Using the flat outputs, we eliminate the need for cross coupling laws and communication protocols associated with such formations. The problem of robot coordination is reduced to synchronizing the flat outputs between the respective robot manipulators. Furthermore, the selection of the flat output used for the synchronizing control is not restricted as any system variable can be used. The problem of unmeasured states used in the control is also solved by reconstructing the missing states using flatness based interpolation. The proposed control law is less computationally intensive when compared to earlier reported work as integration of the differential equations is not required. Simulations using a formation of single link flexible joint robots are used to validate the proposed synchronizing control.},

We show that for these systems, the resulting time-varying linear system obtained as the linearization about a reference trajectory is controllable for all possible reference trajectories. Finally, a linear quadratic regulator-based controller is designed to attenuate the error so as to locally exponentially stabilize tracking of a reference trajectory for the nonlinear system.

   abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles, particularly quadrotors, have been used in a wide range of applications. However, the literature on aerial manipulation and grasping is limited and the work is based on quasi-static models. In this paper, we draw inspiration from agile, fast-moving birds such as raptors, that are able to capture moving prey on the ground or in water, and develop similar capabilities for quadrotors. We address dynamic grasping, an approach to prehensile grasping in which the dynamics of the robot and its gripper are significant and must be explicitly modeled and controlled for successful execution. Dynamic grasping is relevant for fast pick-and-place operations, transportation and delivery of objects, and placing or retrieving sensors. We show how this capability can be realized (a) using a motion capture system and (b) without external sensors relying only on onboard sensors. In both cases we describe the dynamic model, and trajectory planning and control algorithms. In particular, we present a methodology for flying and grasping a cylindrical object using feedback from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit onboard the aerial robot. This is accomplished by mapping the dynamics of the quadrotor to a level virtual image plane, which in turn enables dynamically-feasible trajectory planning for image features in the image space, and a vision-based controller with guaranteed convergence properties. We also present experimental results obtained with a quadrotor equipped with an articulated gripper to illustrate both approaches. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK.},

   abstract = {The hovering ability, rapidity of maneuvers and upregulated aerobic capacity of hummingbirds have long attracted the interest of flight biologists. The range of intra- and interspecific variation in flight performance among hummingbirds, however, is equally impressive. A dominant theme in hummingbird evolution is progressive invasion of higher-elevation habitats. Hypobaric challenge is met behaviorally through compensatory changes in wingbeat kinematics, particularly in stroke amplitude. Over evolutionary time scales, montane colonization is associated with increases in body mass and relative wing area. Hovering ability has been well-studied in several North American hummingbird taxa, yet the broad range of interspecific variation in hummingbird axial and appendicular anatomy remains to be assessed mechanistically. Such varied features as tail length, molt condition and substantial weight change due to lipid-loading can dramatically alter various features of the flight envelope. Compared with our present knowledge of hovering performance in hummingbirds, the mechanics of forward flight and maneuvers is not well understood. Relationships among flight-related morphology, competitive ability and foraging behavior have been the focus of numerous studies on tropical and temperate hummingbirds. Ecologists have hypothesized that the primary selective agents on hummingbird flight-related morphology are the behaviors involved in floral nectar consumption. However, flight behaviors involved in foraging for insects may also influence the evolution of wing size and shape. Several comparisons of hummingbird communities across elevational gradients suggest that foraging strategies and competitive interactions within and among species vary systematically across elevations as the costs of flight change with body size and wing shape.},

   abstract = {Hummingbirds are nature's masters of aerobatic manoeuvres. Previous research shows that hummingbirds and insects converged evolutionarily upon similar aerodynamic mechanisms and kinematics in hovering. Herein, we use three-dimensional kinematic data to begin to test for similar convergence of kinematics used for escape flight and to explore the effects of body size upon manoeuvring.We studied four hummingbird species in North America including two large species (magnificent hummingbird, Eugenes fulgens, 7.8 g, and blue-throated hummingbird, Lampornis clemenciae, 8.0 g) and two smaller species (broad-billed hummingbird, Cynanthus latirostris, 3.4 g, and black-chinned hummingbirds Archilochus alexandri, 3.1 g). Starting from a steady hover, hummingbirds consistently manoeuvred away from perceived threats using a drastic escape response that featured body pitch and roll rotations coupled with a large linear acceleration. Hummingbirds changed their flapping frequency and wing trajectory in all three degrees of freedom on a stroke-by-stroke basis, likely causing rapid and significant alteration of the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic forces. Thus it appears that the flight control of hummingbirds does not obey the 'helicopter model' that is valid for similar escape manoeuvres in fruit flies. Except for broad-billed hummingbirds, the hummingbirds had faster reaction times than those reported for visual feedback control in insects. The two larger hummingbird species performed pitch rotations and global-yaw turns with considerably larger magnitude than the smaller species, but roll rates and cumulative roll angles were similar among the four species.},

Middle: Simulated Laikago robot imitating reference motions. Bottom: Real Laikago robot imitating reference motions. Abstract-Reproducing the diverse and agile locomotion skills of animals has been a longstanding challenge in robotics. While manually-designed controllers have been able to emulate many complex behaviors, building such controllers involves a time-consuming and difficult development process, often requiring substantial expertise of the nuances of each skill. Reinforcement learning provides an appealing alternative for automating the manual effort involved in the development of controllers. However, designing learning objectives that elicit the desired behaviors from an agent can also require a great deal of skill-specific expertise. In this work, we present an imitation learning system that enables legged robots to learn agile locomotion skills by imitating real-world animals. We show that by leveraging reference motion data, a single learning-based approach is able to automatically synthesize controllers for a diverse repertoire behaviors for legged robots. By incorporating sample efficient domain adaptation techniques into the training process, our system is able to learn adaptive policies in simulation that can then be quickly adapted for real-world deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we train an 18-DoF quadruped robot to perform a variety of agile behaviors ranging from different locomotion gaits to dynamic hops and turns.

An independent control structure is used in the aerial manipulator control system, i.e., the hex-rotor and the manipulator are controlled separately. In the hex-rotor's controller, the system CoM (Center of Mass) offset motion is used to compensate disturbance of the robotic arm. In the manipulator's controller, the relative kinematics between the target and the aerial vehicle is taken into consideration to grasp the target. At last aerial grasping experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme and the reliability of our aerial manipulator system.},

This combination makes it a truly-redundant manipulator going beyond standard aerial manipulators based on collinear multirotor platforms.

A kinodynamic task-constrained and control-aware global motion planner is used. Experiments show that the proposed aerial manipulator system, equipped with an Eddy current probe, is able to scan a metallic pipe sliding the sensor over its surface and preserving the contact.

   abstract = {There is a strong demand in the oil and gas industry to develop alternatives to manual inspection. This paper presents AeroX, a novel aerial robotic manipulator that provides physical contact inspection with unprecedented capabilities. AeroX has a semi-autonomous operation, which provides interesting advantages in contact inspection. In the free-flight mode, the pilot guides the robot until performing contact with its end-effector on the surface to be inspected. During contact, AeroX is in its fully-autonomous global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-free contact–flight mode, in which the robot keeps its relative position w.r.t. the surface contact point using only its internal sensors. During autonomous flight, the inspector can move—with uninterrupted contact—the end-effector on the surface for accurately selecting the points where to perform A-scan measurements or continuous B-scan or C-scan inspections. AeroX adopts an eight-tilted rotor configuration and a simple and efficient design, which provides high stability, maneuverability, and robustness to rotor failure. It can perform contact inspection on surfaces at any orientation, including vertical, inclined, horizontal-top or horizontal-bottom, and its operation can be easily integrated into current maintenance operations in many industries. It has been extensively validated in outdoor experiments including a refinery and has been awarded the EU Innovation Radar Prize 2017.},

Classical inversion provides exact output tracking but leads to internal instability, while recent nonlinear regulation provides stable asymptotic tracking but admits large transient errors. As a first step to solve this problem, this paper addresses the stable inversion of non-minimum phase nonlinear systems. Using the notions of zero dynamics and stable/unstable manifolds, an invertibility condition is established for a class of systems. A stable but non-causal inverse is obtained offline that can be incorporated into a stabilizing controller for dead-beat output tracking. This inverse contrasts with the causal inverse proposed by Hirschorn where unstable zero dynamics result in unbounded inverse solutions. Our results reduce to those of Hirschorn for minimum phase systems, however. In a numerical example, the stable inverse has achieved much superior tracking performance as compared with that produced using nonlinear regulation. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

The manipulator is visually controlled with stereo vision in an eye-to-hand configuration. A novel Kohonen's self-organizing map (KSOM) based visual servoing scheme has been proposed for a redundant manipulator with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF). The inverse kinematic relationship of the manipulator is learned using a Kohonen's self-organizing map. This learned map is shown to be an approximate estimate of the inverse Jacobian, which can then be used in conjunction with the proportional controller to achieve closed loop servoing in real-time. It is shown through Lyapunov stability analysis that the proposed learning based servoing scheme ensures global stability. A generalized weight update law is proposed for KSOM based inverse kinematic control, to resolve the redundancy during the learning phase. Unlike the existing visual servoing schemes, the proposed KSOM based scheme eliminates the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix in real-time. This makes the proposed algorithm computationally more efficient. The proposed scheme has been implemented on a 7 DOF PowerCubeTM robot manipulator with visual feedback from two cameras. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We consider the problem of generating a time-optimal quadrotor trajectory that attains a set of prescribed waypoints. This problem is challenging since the optimal trajectory is located on the boundary of the set of dynamically feasible trajectories. This boundary is hard to model as it involves limitations of the entire system, including hardware and software, in agile high-speed flight. In this work, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework that models the feasibility constraints based on analytical approximation, numerical simulation, and real-world flight experiments. By combining evaluations at different fidelities, trajectory time is optimized while keeping the number of required costly flight experiments to a minimum. The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated in both simulation and real-world flight experiments at speeds up to 11 m/s. Resulting trajectories were found to be significantly faster than those obtained through minimum-snap trajectory planning.},

   abstract = {Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can execute aggressive (\ie, high-speed and high-acceleration) maneuvers have attracted significant attention in the past few years. This article focuses on accurate tracking of aggressive quadcopter trajectories. We propose a novel control law for tracking of position and yaw angle and their derivatives of up to fourth order, specifically velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap along with yaw rate and yaw acceleration. Jerk and snap are tracked using feedforward inputs for angular rate and angular acceleration based on the differential flatness of the quadcopter dynamics. Snap tracking requires direct control of body torque, which we achieve using closed-loop motor speed control based on measurements from optical encoders attached to the motors. The controller utilizes incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) for robust tracking of linear and angular accelerations despite external disturbances, such as aerodynamic drag forces. Hence, prior modeling of aerodynamic effects is not required. We rigorously analyze the proposed control law through response analysis and demonstrate it in experiments. The controller enables a quadcopter UAV to track complex 3-D trajectories, reaching speeds up to 12.9 m/s and accelerations up to 2.1 g, while keeping the root-mean-square tracking error down to 6.6 cm, in a flight volume that is roughly 18 m x 7 m and 3-m tall. We also demonstrate the robustness of the controller by attaching a drag plate to the UAV in flight tests and by pulling on the UAV with a rope during hover.},

There are two fundamentally different issues which result in the need for some form of regularization; the existence of multiple solution branches (global ill-posedness) and the existence of excess degrees of freedom (local ill- posedness). For certain classes of manipulators, learning methods applied to input-output data generated from the forward function can be used to globally regularize the problem by partitioning the domain of the forward mapping into a finite set of regions over which the inverse problem is well-posed. Local regularization can be accomplished by an appropriate parameterization of the redundancy consistently over each region. As a result, the ill-posed problem can be transformed into a finite set of well-posed problems. Each can then be solved separately to construct approximate direct inverse functions.},

The proposed aerial manipulator consists of a multidirectional-thrust aerial vehicle-to enhance physical interaction capabilities-endowed with a 2-DoFs lightweight arm-to enlarge its workspace. This combination makes it a truly-redundant manipulator going beyond standard aerial manipulators based on collinear multirotor platforms. The controller is based on a PID method with a 'displaced' positional part that ensures asymptotic stability despite the arm elasticity. A kinodynamic task-constrained and control-aware global motion planner is used. Experiments show that the proposed aerial manipulator system, equipped with an Eddy current probe, is able to scan a metallic pipe sliding the sensor over its surface and preserving the contact.

Any small imprecision may lead the fingers to close too abruptly and let the object fly away from the hand before closing. We present a strategy to overcome for sensorimotor imprecision by introducing softness in the catching approach. Soft catching consists of having the robot moves with the object for a short period of time, so as to leave more time for the fingers to close on the object. We use a dynamic system-based control law to generate the appropriate reach and follow motion, which is expressed as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. We propose a method to approximate the parameters of LPV systems using Gaussian mixture models, based on a set of kinematically feasible demonstrations generated by an offline optimal control framework. We show theoretically that the resulting DS will intercept the object at the intercept point, at the right time with the desired velocity direction. Stability and convergence of the approach are assessed through Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed method is validated systematically to catch three objects that generate elastic contacts and demonstrate important improvement over a hard catching approach.},

Nevertheless, the choice of the tasks is required to be such that, after being properly decoupled, they are all feasible and lead to an invertible Jacobian matrix. In this work, a modification is proposed that removes both these restrictions. The user is free to specify as many tasks as desired and especially without necessarily guaranteeing in advance that none of the tasks will become singular during the execution. Whenever tasks with higher priority use-up all the degrees of freedom, all the other tasks are naturally ignored. Still, as soon as some of the tasks with higher priority become singular, then the freed-up controllability is used to execute the next task in the stack. This is realized automatically, without any rearrangement of the tasks in the priority stack. As an application, the case of trajectory tracking on a submanifold of the workspace is considered, in which multiple charts of the atlas are used for the tasks. Simulations are used to validate the stability analysis.},

   abstract = {The control of a quadrotor is typically split into two subsequent problems: finding desired accelerations to control its position, and controlling its attitude and the total thrust to track these accelerations and to track a yaw angle reference. While the thrust vector, generating accelerations, and the angle of rotation about the thrust vector, determining the yaw angle, can be controlled independently, most attitude control strategies in the literature, relying on representations in terms of quaternions, rotation matrices or Euler angles, result in an unnecessary coupling between the control of the thrust vector and of the angle about this vector. This leads, for instance, to undesired position tracking errors due to yaw tracking errors. In this paper we propose to tackle the attitude control problem using an attitude representation in the Cartesian product of the 2-sphere and the 1-sphere, denoted by mathcal\{S\}\{2\} times mathcal\{S\}\{1\}. We propose a non-linear tracking control law on mathcal\{S\}\{2\} times mathcal\{S\}\{1\} that decouples the control of the thrust vector and of the angle of rotation about the thrust vector, and guarantees almost global asymptotic stability. Simulation results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over previous approaches.},

The quadrocopter's attitude error is split into a reduced attitude error, which describes the misalignment of the thrust direction, and a yaw error, which describes the orientation error about the thrust direction. A model-based proportional-derivative control law is derived, where the proportional action is in terms of the reduced attitude and yaw errors, and the derivative action is in terms of the quadrocopter's angular velocity error. Almost global asymptotic convergence of the reduced attitude error is established, and the convergence of the yaw error is proven. It is further shown that the attitude control law decouples the reduced attitude error dynamics from the yaw error dynamics. A control allocation strategy is derived which exploits the decoupling in order to prioritize the correction of the reduced attitude over the yaw error. The proposed control strategy is computationally lightweight and therefore well-suited to run on board quadrocopters at high rates. Experimental results demonstrate improved error recovery and position tracking performance.},

This stabilization technique cannot be captured using the averaging approach commonly used in literature. In contrast, it is elucidated using a special type of calculus: the chronological calculus. Our result is supported through experiments on a real hawkmoth subjected to pitch disturbance from hovering. This finding could be particularly useful to biologists because the vibrational stabilization mechanism may also be exploited by many other creatures.

   abstract = {Accelerations and directional changes of flying animals derive from interactions between aerodynamic force production and the inertial resistance of the body to translation and rotation. Anatomical and allometric features of body design thus mediate the rapidity of aerial maneuvers. Both translational and rotational responsiveness of the body to applied force decrease with increased total mass. For flying vertebrates, contributions of the relatively heavy wings to whole-body rotational inertia are substantial, whereas the relatively light wings of many insect taxa suggest that rotational inertia is dominated by the contributions of body segments. In some circumstances, inertial features of wing design may be as significant as are their aerodynamic properties in influencing the rapidity of body rotations. Stability in flight requires force and moment balances that are usually attained via bilateral symmetry in wingbeat kinematics, whereas body roll and yaw derive from bilaterally asymmetric movements of both axial and appendicular structures. In many flying vertebrates, use of the tail facilitates the generation of aerodynamic torques and substantially enhances quickness of body rotation. Geometrical constraints on wingbeat kinematics may limit total force production and thus accelerational capacity in certain behavioral circumstances. Unitary limits to animal flight performance and maneuverability are unlikely, however, given varied and context-specific interactions among anatomical, biomechanical, and energetic features of design.},

Thus, there are no guarantees on the payload trajectory or the cable tensions, which must be non negative. In this paper, we develop a complete dynamic model for the case when payload is a point load and for the case when the payload is a rigid body. We show in both cases the resulting system is differentially flat when the cable tensions are strictly positive. We also consider the case where the tensions are non negative (including the case with zero tensions) and establish that these systems are differentially flat hybrid systems by considering the switching dynamics induced by the unilateral tension constraints. We use the differential flatness property to find dynamically feasible trajectories for the payload+quadrotors system. We show using numerical and experimental methods that these trajectories are superior to those obtained by quasi-static models.},

Maxwell's equations are linear and hence this solution requires a source of magnetic field, namely the monopole which sits at the origin. We will see later in this course that there are other monopoles which do not require sources and which extend smoothly to the 'origin'. In modern language, the vector field B is understood as the 2-form F ∈ Ω 2 (R 3 \ \{0\}) given by F = 1 2πr 3 x 1 d x 2 ∧ d x 3 + cyclic in the cartesian coordinates of R 3 . Maxwell's equations say that d F = 0. This is perhaps more evident in spherical coordinates (x 1 = r sin θ cos φ,...), where F = 1 4π sin θd θ ∧ d φ . Since d F = 0 we may hope to find a one-form A such that F = d A. For example, A = − 1 4π cos θd φ . This is not regular over all of R 3 \\{0\}, however. This should not come as a surprise, since after all spherical coordinates are singular on the x 3 -axis. Rewriting A in cartesian coordinates A = x 3 4πr x 2 d x 1 − x 1 d x 2 x 2 1 + x 2 2 , clearly displays the singularity at x 1 = x 2 = 0. In the old Physics literature this singularity is known as the " Dirac string, " a language we shall distance ourselves from in this course. This singularity will afflict any A we come up with. Indeed, notice that F restricts to the (normalised) area form on the unit sphere S ⊂ R 3 , whence S F = 1 . If F = d A for a smooth one-form A, then Stokes's theorem would have forced S F = 0. The principal aim of the first couple of lectures is to develop the geometric framework to which F (and A) belong: the theory of connections on principal fibre bundles, to which we now turn. GT 2006 (jmf) 4 1.2 Principal fibre bundles A principal fibre bundle consists of the following data: • a manifold P, called the total space; • a Lie group G acting freely on P on the right: P × G → P (p, g) → pg (or sometimes R g p) where by a free action we mean that the stabilizer of every point is trivial, or paraphrasing, that every element G (except the identity) moves every point in P. We will also assume that the space of orbits M = P/G is a manifold (called the base) and the natural map π : P → M taking a point to its orbit is a smooth surjection. For every m ∈ M, the submanifold π −1 (m) ⊂ P is called the fibre over m. Further, this data will be subject to the condition of local triviality: that M admits an open cover \{U α \} and G-equivariant diffeomorphisms ψ α : π −1 U α → U α × G such that the following diagram commutes},

   abstract = {Connections on principal bundles play a fundamental role in expressing the equations of motion for mechanical systems with symmetry in an intrinsic fashion. A discrete theory of connections on principal bundles is constructed by introducing the discrete analogue of the Atiyah sequence, with a connection corresponding to the choice of a splitting of the short exact sequence. Equivalent representations of a discrete connection are considered, and an extension of the pair groupoid composition, that takes into account the principal bundle structure, is introduced. Computational issues, such as the order of approximation, are also addressed. Discrete connections provide an intrinsic method for introducing coordinates on the reduced space for discrete mechanics, and provide the necessary discrete geometry to introduce more general discrete symmetry reduction. In addition, discrete analogues of the Levi-Civita connection, and its curvature, are introduced by using the machinery of discrete exterior calculus, and discrete connections.},

Based on first principles models, a launch condition for the pole is derived and used to design an optimal trajectory to throw the pole towards a second quadrocopter. An optimal catching instant is derived and the corresponding position is predicted by simulating the current position and velocity estimates forward in time. An algorithm is introduced that generates a trajectory for moving the catching vehicle to the predicted catching point in real time. By evaluating the pole state after the impact, an adaptation strategy adapts the catch maneuver such that the pole rotates into the upright equilibrium by itself.

We utilize the infinite dimensional geometry developed by Vinogradov and coworkers: a control system is a diffiety, or more precisely, an ordinary diffiety, i.e. a smooth infinite-dimensional manifold equipped with a privileged vector field. After recalling the definition of a Lie-Backlund mapping, we say that two systems ar equivalent if they are related by a Lie-Backlund isomorphism. Flat systems are those systems which are equivalent to a controllable linear one. The interest of such an abstract setting relies mainly on the fact that the above system equivalence is interpreted in terms of endogenous dynamic feedback. The presentation is as elementary as possible and illustrated by the VTOL aircraft.},

Such polynomial matrices are useful to compute the ideal of differential forms generated by the differentials of all possible trivializations. We introduce the notion of a strongly closed ideal of differential forms, and prove that flatness is equivalent to the strong closedness of the latter ideal, which, in turn, is equivalent to the existence of solutions of the so-called generalized moving frame structure equations.

Therefore, we present an approach to model aerodynamic effects using Gaussian Processes, which we incorporate into a Model Predictive Controller to achieve efficient and precise real-time feedback control, leading to up to 70% reduction in trajectory tracking error at high speeds.

We address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation frame that depends only on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the flatness of the mechanical connection associated with the robotic system. Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature.

We consider a quadrotor equipped with an arbitrary n-joint articulated arm. We show that the combined underactuated system is differentially flat, however the flat outputs do not correspond directly to the motion of the end effector. We therefore develop a method which determines the family of flat output trajectories which will exactly produce any desired task trajectory, even in the case of dynamic maneuvers. We also give criteria on the manipulator geometry which will ensure certain important stability properties, informing hardware design. The entire approach is demonstrated in simulation for systems of varying geometry and number of joints. The simultaneous resolution of the kinematic and dynamic constraints allows these tasks to be performed dynamically without sacrificing accuracy.},

   abstract = {Non-linear model predictive control (nMPC) is a powerful approach to control complex robots (such as humanoids, quadrupeds, or unmanned aerial manipulators (UAMs)) as it brings important advantages over other existing techniques. The full-body dynamics, along with the prediction capability of the optimal control problem (OCP) solved at the core of the controller, allows to actuate the robot in line with its dynamics. This fact enhances the robot capabilities and allows, e.g., to perform intricate maneuvers at high dynamics while optimizing the amount of energy used. Despite the many similarities between humanoids or quadrupeds and UAMs, full-body torque-level nMPC has rarely been applied to UAMs. This paper provides a thorough description of how to use such techniques in the field of aerial manipulation. We give a detailed explanation of the different parts involved in the OCP, from the UAM dynamical model to the residuals in the cost function. We develop and compare three different nMPC controllers: Weighted MPC, Rail MPC, and Carrot MPC, which differ on the structure of their OCPs and on how these are updated at every time step. To validate the proposed framework, we present a wide variety of simulated case studies. First, we evaluate the trajectory generation problem, i.e., optimal control problems solved offline, involving different kinds of motions (e.g., aggressive maneuvers or contact locomotion) for different types of UAMs. Then, we assess the performance of the three nMPC controllers, i.e., closed-loop controllers solved online, through a variety of realistic simulations. For the benefit of the community, we have made available the source code related to this work.},

In some aerospace vehicles, the effects of the control of the attitude dynamics appears in the translational dynamics. We present a general framework for decoupling of these effects. The decoupling is done by applying a change of coordinates in explicit form that transforms the original system into a cascade nonlinear system. We obtain three types of cascade normal forms, namely, nonlinear systems in strict feedback form, strict feedforward form, and nontriangular quadratic form. For a class of underactuated systems that are differentially flat, we obtain the flat outputs automatically as a by-product of the decoupling change of coordinates.},

   abstract = {Accurate trajectory tracking control for quadrotors is essential for safe navigation in cluttered environments. However, this is challenging in agile flights due to nonlinear dynamics, complex aerodynamic effects, and actuation constraints. In this article, we empirically compare two state-of-the-art control frameworks: the nonlinear-model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the differential-flatness-based controller (DFBC), by tracking a wide variety of agile trajectories at speeds up to 20 m/s (i.e.,72 km/h). The comparisons are performed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. We show the superiority of NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical convergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect of adding an inner-loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model. Our real-world experiments, performed in one of the world's largest motion capture systems, demonstrate more than 78% tracking error reduction of both NMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner-loop controller and aerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.},

   abstract = {The locomotion of articulated mechanical systems is often complex and unintuitive, even when considered with the aid of reduction principles from geometric mechanics. In this paper, we present two tools for gaining insights into the underlying principles of locomotion: connection vector fields and connection height functions. Connection vector fields illustrate the geometric structure of the relationship between internal shape changes and the system body velocities they produce. Connection height functions measure the curvature of their respective vector fields and capture the net displacement over any cyclic shape change, or gait , allowing for the intuitive selection of gaits to produce desired displacements. Height function approaches have been previously attempted, but such techniques have been severely limited by their basis in a rotating body frame, and have only been useful for calculating planar rotations and infinitesimal translations. We circumvent this limitation by introducing a notion of optimal coordinates defining a body frame that rotates very little in response to shape changes, while still meeting the requirements of the geometric mechanics theory on which the vector fields and height functions are based. In these optimal coordinates, the height functions provide close approximations of the net displacement resulting from a broad selection of possible gaits. © 2011 The Author(s).},

Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering. Unfortunately, the system's nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a significant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simplifications like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload. In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman filter. We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full three-dimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor. We show control of load swings up to 53 from the vertical axis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle.},

	abstract = {Underactuated multibody systems have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom. In trajectory tracking control of such systems an accurate and efficient feedforward control is often necessary. For multibody systems feedforward control by model inversion can be designed using servo-constraints. So far servo-constraints have been mostly applied to differentially flat underactuated mechanical systems. Differentially flat systems can be inverted purely by algebraic manipulations and using a finite number of differentiations of the desired output trajectory. However, such algebraic solutions are often hard to find and therefore the servo-constraint approach provides an efficient and practical solution method. Recently first results on servo-constraint problems of non-flat underactuated multibody systems have been reported. Hereby additional dynamics arise, so-called internal dynamics, yielding a dynamical system as inverse model. In this paper the servo-constraint problem is analyzed for both, differentially flat and non-flat systems. Different arising important phenomena are demonstrated using two illustrative examples. Also strategies for the numerical solution of servo-constraint problems are discussed. © 2013 Author(s).},

    "abstract": "We have developed a mathematical model that captures stress-induced mutagenesis, a fundamental aspect of pathogenic and neoplastic evolutionary dynamics, on the fitness landscape with multiple relevant genetic traits as a high-dimensional Euclidean space. In this framework, stress-induced mutagenesis manifests as a heterogeneous diffusion process. We show how increasing mutations, and thus reducing exploitation, in a static ecology with fixed carrying capacity and maximum growth rates, can paradoxically boost population size. Remarkably, this unexpected biophysical phenomenon applies universally to any number of traits.",

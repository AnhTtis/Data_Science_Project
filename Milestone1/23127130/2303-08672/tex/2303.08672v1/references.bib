We next discuss salinity measurement systems, followed by measurement systems for depth and pressure. After these three fundamental ocean properties are descriptions of measurement systems for sea level (including satellite altimetry), wave height and direction, Eulerian current velocity (including acoustic Doppler current profilers), Lagrangian current velocity (including the subsurface Argo float program), autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous above water vehicles (wave gliders), wind, precipitation, and nutrients. The chapter continues with a discussion of oceanic light measuring systems, and ends with a brief outline of various chemical tracers and their use.},

Thus, the ocean plays a crucial role in determining the climate of the planet. Observing the oceans is problematic even under the most favourable of conditions. Historically, shipboard ocean sampling has left vast expanses, particularly in the Southern Ocean, unobserved for long periods of time. Within the past 15 years, with the advent of the global Argo array of profiling floats, it has become possible to sample the upper 2,000 m of the ocean globally and uniformly in space and time. The primary goal of Argo is to create a systematic global network of profiling floats that can be integrated with other elements of the Global Ocean Observing System. The network provides freely available temperature and salinity data from the upper 2,000 m of the ocean with global coverage. The data are available within 24 hours of collection for use in a broad range of applications that focus on examining climate-relevant variability on seasonal to decadal timescales, multidecadal climate change, improved initialization of coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models and constraining ocean analysis and forecasting systems.},

Autonomous platforms equipped with biogeochemical sensors allow for the observation of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem dynamics, covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The international Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) project is currently building a global, multidisciplinary ocean-observing network of autonomous Argo floats equipped with an extensive range of biogeochemical sensors. Other autonomous platforms, such as gliders and surface vehicles, have also incorporated such sensors, mainly operating on regional scales and near the ocean surface.

	abstract = {Advancing our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry, biology, and ecosystems relies on the ability to make observations both in the ocean and at the critical boundaries between the ocean and other earth systems at relevant spatial and temporal scales. After decades of advancement in ocean observing technologies, one of the key remaining challenges is how to cost-effectively make measurements at the increased resolution necessary for illuminating complex system processes and rapidly evolving changes. In recent years, biogeochemical in situ sensors have been emerging that are threefold or more lower in cost than established technologies; the cost reduction for many biological in situ sensors has also been significant, although the absolute costs are still relatively high. Cost savings in these advancements has been driven by miniaturization, new methods of packaging, and lower-cost mass-produced components such as electronics and materials. Recently, field projects have demonstrated the potential for science-quality data collection via large-scale deployments using cost-effective sensors and deployment strategies. In the coming decade, it is envisioned that ocean biogeochemistry and biology observations will be revolutionized by continued innovation in sensors with increasingly low price points and the scale-up of deployments of these in situ sensor technologies. The goal of this study is therefore to: (1) provide a review of existing sensor technologies that are already achieving cost-effectiveness compared with traditional instrumentation, (2) present case studies of cost-effective in situ deployments that can provide insight into methods for bridging observational gaps, (3) identify key challenge areas where progress in cost reduction is lagging, and (4) present a number of potentially transformative directions for future ocean biogeochemical and biological studies using cost-effective technologies and deployment strategies.},

	abstract = {The ignition of flammable liquids and gases in offshore oil and gas environments is a major risk and can cause loss of life, serious injury, and significant damage to infrastructure. Power supplies that are used to provide regulated voltages to drive motors, relays, and power electronic controls can produce heat and cause sparks. As a result, the European Union requires ATEX certification on electrical equipment to ensure safety in such extreme environments. Implementing designs that meet this standard is time-consuming and adds to the cost of operations. Soft robots are often made with soft materials and can be actuated pneumatically, without electronics, making these systems inherently compliant with this directive. In this paper, we aim to increase the capability of new soft robotic systems moving from a one-to-one control-actuator architecture and implementing an electronics-free control system. We have developed a robot that demonstrates locomotion and gripping using three-pneumatic lines: a vacuum power line, a control input, and a clock line. We have followed the design principles of digital electronics and demonstrated an integrated fluidic circuit with eleven, fully integrated fluidic switches and six actuators. We have realized the basic building blocks of logical operation into combinational logic and memory using our fluidic switches to create a two-state automata machine. This system expands on the state of the art increasing the complexity over existing soft systems with integrated control.},

Although soft digital logic gates based on soft valves have been demonstrated as a replacement for electronic control, the development of memory from logic gates is cumbersome (three logic gates with mono-stable membranes for the development of a single S-R latch), and such memory is only capable of holding, but not storing, information; after a power reset, the membranes relax to their idle states, and the information is lost. In this work, we introduce a soft memory device with a bistable membrane that allows the permanent storage of binary information in soft materials, and we demonstrate its writing and erasing operations. We also introduce a new type of pneumatically-driven soft display, the soft bubble display. We connect the display to our soft memory device to visualize the information that is held in the memory. Our work highlights the importance of material-based memory and its future use for programming soft robots.},

For AUVs to benefit from the same success other long term monitoring platforms have had (moorings, ARGO), it is critical to understand their limits in both monitoring and process studies. We present results from several Seaglider deployments by the University of East Anglia where Seagliders were pushed to the limit of their abilities. Comparison of missions in extreme conditions at the limits of their depth range (70 to 1000 m) and battery life shows a need for tailored survey design and flight parameters in order to maximise mission duration, control over the Seaglider and most efficient science sampling. In particular, we look at post-processing of Seaglider data and present aspects of a new MATLAB toolbox which greatly improves on timestamp correction of Seaglider data by accounting for errors introduced by using a single thread processor. © 2012 IEEE.},

The fish swimming types are presented, following the well-established classification scheme and nomenclature originally proposed by Breder. Fish swim either by body and/or caudal fin (BCF) movements or using median and/or paired fin (MPF) propulsion. The latter is generally employed at slow speeds, offering greater maneuverability and better propulsive efficiency, while BCF movements can achieve greater thrust and accelerations. For both BCF and MPF locomotion, specific swimming modes are identified, based on the propulsor and the type of movements (oscillatory or undulatory) employed for thrust generation. Along with general descriptions and kinematic data, the analytical approaches developed to study each swimming mode are also introduced. Particular reference is made to lunate tail propulsion, undulating fins, and labriform (oscillatory pectoral fin) swimming mechanisms, identified as having the greatest potential for exploitation in artificial systems.},

	abstract = {Rapid mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is affecting sea level and, through increased freshwater and sediment discharge, ocean circulation, sea-ice, biogeochemistry, and marine ecosystems around Greenland. Key to interpreting ongoing and projecting future ice loss, and its impact on the ocean, is understanding exchanges of heat, freshwater, and nutrients that occur at the GrIS marine margins. Processes governing these exchanges are not well understood because of limited observations from the regions where glaciers terminate into the ocean and the challenge of modeling the spatial and temporal scales involved. Thus, notwithstanding their importance, ice sheet/ocean exchanges are poorly represented or not accounted for in models used for projection studies. Widespread community consensus maintains that concurrent and long-term records of glaciological, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters at the ice sheet/ocean margins are key to addressing this knowledge gap by informing understanding, and constraining and validating models. Through a series of workshops and documents endorsed by the community-at-large, a framework for an international, collaborative, Greenland Ice sheet-Ocean Observing System (GrIOOS), that addresses the needs of society in relation to a changing GrIS, has been proposed. This system would consist of a set of ocean, glacier, and atmosphere essential variables to be collected at a number of diverse sites around Greenland for a minimum of two decades. Internationally agreed upon data protocols and data sharing policies would guarantee uniformity and availability of the information for the broader community. Its development, maintenance, and funding will require close international collaboration. Engagement of end-users, local people, and groups already active in these areas, as well as synergy with ongoing, related, or complementary networks will be key to its success and effectiveness.},

In the shape optimization of BWBUG, the lift to drag ratio is often used as the optimization target. However this results in lose of internal space. In this paper, the energy reserve is defined as the direct proportional function of the internal space of BWBUG. A motion model, which relates gliding range to steady gliding motion parameters as well as energy consumption, is established by analyzing the steady-state gliding motion. The maximum gliding range is used as the optimization target instead of the lift to drag ratio to optimizing the shape of BWBUG. The result of optimization shows that the maximum gliding range of initial design is increased by 32.1\% though an Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) process.},

The ECM and the cells continuously engage in a complex and highly dynamic interplay, shaping both the matrix as well as the cellular outcome. To study these dynamic, bidirectional interactions in a systematic manner, the ability to dynamically control cellular environments is highly desirable. Stimuli-responsive materials are a class of materials that have been engineered to respond to external cues, e.g., light, electricity, or magnetic field, and therefore hold fascinating potentials as an ideal experimental platform to introduce changing spatiotemporal signals to cells. Here, we review the state of the art in stimuli-responsive materials and their design strategies, with an emphasis on the dynamic introduction of physical and mechanical cues. The effects of such dynamic stimuli on the responses of living cells are examined on three different levels: cellular phenotypes, intracellular and cytoskeletal changes, and nuclear and epigenetic effects. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and limitations as well as the potential outlooks in exploiting stimuli-responsive biomaterials.},

	abstract = {Combustion in soft and compliant materials may enable new methods for underwater locomotion. Inspired by the motion of the soft bodied cephalopods, we developed a combustion-powered hydro-jet engine (CPHJE) using an expandable silicone bladder. The CPHJE used high energy density methane combustion to expand a silicone bladder and accelerate water into a hydro-jet that propelled the CPHJE. Cephalopods demonstrate the epitome of underwater soft robot capabilities. Their use of hydrojetting as a mode of high-speed underwater motion resembles high-power combustion events. This paper describes a soft combustion engine that propels a ∼0.7 kg body, with hydrodynamic surfaces in the likeness of an ellipsoid shaped squid, at instantaneous velocities of at least 0.8 m s−1 and single-pulse average velocities of 0.1 m s−1. High-speed videography informs a model for the CPHJE's motion in time; the imaging also reveals that the hydrojetting generates a ring vortex. Tracking of this vortex results in an estimate that the working fluid is ejected in excess of 6.7 m s−1. We demonstrate the CPHJE motion is both repeatable and able to produce multiple actuations with the same bladder. These results demonstrate a new method of underwater propulsion using combustion in soft and compliant bladders.},

Without any motor, the fish is driven solely by a soft electroactive structure made of dielectric elastomer and ionically conductive hydrogel. The electronic fish can swim at a speed of 6.4 cm/s (0.69 body length per second), which is much faster than previously reported untethered soft robotic fish driven by soft responsive materials. The fish shows consistent performance in a wide temperature range and permits stealth sailing due to its nearly transparent nature. Furthermore, the fish is robust, as it uses the surrounding water as the electric ground and can operate for 3 hours with one single charge.

However, according to the authors' knowledge, the effect of winglet on underwater gliders has not been investigated in detail. This paper aims to investigate the impact of winglet on hydrodynamic performance and gliding trajectory of a blended-wing-body underwater glider (BWBUG). The hydrodynamic performance of the BWBUG without winglet (BWBUG-I) is firstly calculated. Then the hydrodynamic performance of BWBUG with winglet (BWBUG-II) is analyzed and compared. To estimate the influence of winglet on gliding trajectory, a dynamic model is established by considering the buoyancy and pitch regulating system. From the CFD results, the lift force acting on the glider is increased by the winglet, while the drag force remains at the same level. The lift-to-drag ratio is thereby improved. By comparing trajectories, the average gliding ratio for BWBUG-II is 5.10, 2.2\% higher than 4.99 for BWBUG-I. With the winglet, the extreme attack angle is reduced from 7.2° to 6.1° when switching from rising to diving. The steady gliding speed is improved by 6.3\%, and the squat depth is reduced by 11\% under particular condition.},

Simulating AUGs is rendered particularly difficult by the identification of the underlying dynamic model, as these vehicles embed several internal movable components. Acausal simulators can significantly improve the possibility to study and understand the dynamics of this class of vehicles and can in turn support the design of more robust control systems. In this paper, an open-source simulator architecture designed in OpenModelica is proposed to simulate underwater gliders. The validation is carried out using two different AUGs models, a ROGUE and a Seawing. The vehicle dynamics is firstly compared with analytical results and, following, with values obtained by means of another simulator. Further steps will entail comparing the dynamics of a simulated Seaglider with real deployment data publicly available. In this work, some of the main hydrodynamic and geometrical properties of a Seaglider are identified, computed through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses and retrieved from the mission ballast sheet. Overall, the developed model is expected to enhance gliders' control strategies, thus improving their performance and mitigating incidents such as being carried away by undesired ocean currents.},

We briefly describe recent developments at NRC-IOT, in particular the development of a laboratory-scale glider for dynamics and control research and the concept of a regional ocean observation system using underwater gliders. © 2004 IEEE.},

The design of a fish-like soft body has been extended to deform under hydraulic instead of pneumatic power. Moreover, a new closed-circuit drive system that uses water as a transmission fluid is used to actuate the soft body. Circulation of water through internal body channels provides control over the fish's caudal fin propulsion and yaw motion. A new fabrication technique for the soft body is described, which allows for arbitrary internal fluidic channels, enabling a wide-range of continuous body deformations. Furthermore, dynamic diving capabilities are introduced through pectoral fins as dive planes. These innovations enable prolonged fish-like locomotion in three dimensions.},

	abstract = {The ocean and human activities related to the sea are under increasing pressure due to climate change, widespread pollution, and growth of the offshore energy sector. Data, in under-sampled regions of the ocean and in the offshore patches where the industrial expansion is taking place, are fundamental to manage successfully a sustainable development and to mitigate climate change. Existing technology cannot cope with the vast and harsh environments that need monitoring and sampling the most. The limiting factors are, among others, the spatial scales of the physical domain, the high pressure, and the strong hydrodynamic perturbations, which require vehicles with a combination of persistent autonomy, augmented efficiency, extreme robustness, and advanced control. In light of the most recent developments in soft robotics technologies, we propose that the use of soft robots may aid in addressing the challenges posed by abyssal and wave-dominated environments. Nevertheless, soft robots also allow for fast and low-cost manufacturing, presenting a new potential problem: marine pollution from ubiquitous soft sampling devices. In this study, the technological and scientific gaps are widely discussed, as they represent the driving factors for the development of soft robotics. Offshore industry supports increasing energy demand and the employment of robots on marine assets is growing. Such expansion needs to be sustained by the knowledge of the oceanic environment, where large remote areas are yet to be explored and adequately sampled. We offer our perspective on the development of sustainable soft systems, indicating the characteristics of the existing soft robots that promote underwater maneuverability, locomotion, and sampling. This perspective encourages an interdisciplinary approach to the design of aquatic soft robots and invites a discussion about the industrial and oceanographic needs that call for their application.},

The manta has been considered to swim with a high efficiency stroke, but this assertion has not been previously examined. The oscillatory swimming strokes of the manta were examined by detailing the kinematics of the pectoral fin movements swimming over a range of speeds and by analyzing simulations based on computational fluid dynamic potential flow and viscous models. These analyses showed that the fin movements are asymmetrical up- and downstrokes with both spanwise and chordwise waves interposed into the flapping motions. These motions produce complex three-dimensional flow patterns. The net thrust for propulsion was produced from the distal half of the fins. The vortex flow pattern and high propulsive efficiency of 89\% were associated with Strouhal numbers within the optimal range (0.2–0.4) for rays swimming at routine and high speeds. Analysis of the swimming pattern of the manta provided a baseline for creation of a bio-inspired underwater vehicle, MantaBot.},

	abstract = {We consider observations and data from live fish and cetaceans, as well as data from engineered flapping foils and fishlike robots, and compare them against fluid mechanics based scaling laws. These laws have been derived on theoretical/numerical/experimental grounds to optimize the power needed for propulsion, or the energy needed for turning and fast starting. The rhythmic, oscillatory motion of fish requires an "impedance match-ing" between the dynamics of the actively controlled musculature and the fluid loads, to arrive at an optimal motion of the fish's body. Hence, the degree to which data from live fish, optimized robots, and experimental apparatus are in accordance with, or deviate from these flow-based laws, allows one to assess limitations on performance due to control and sensing choices, and material and structural limitations. This review focuses primarily on numerical and experimental studies of steadily flapping foils for propulsion; three-dimensional effects in flapping foils; multiple foils and foils interacting with bodies; maneuvering and fast-starting foils; the interaction of foils with oncoming, externally-generated vorticity; the influence of Reynolds number on foil performance; scaling effects of flexing stiffness of foils; and scaling laws in fishlike swimming.

	abstract = {Almost all pneumatic and hydraulic actuators useful for mesoscale functions rely on hard valves for control. This article describes a soft, elastomeric valve that contains a bistable membrane, which acts as a mechanical "switch" to control air flow. A structural instability-often called "snap-through"-enables rapid transition between two stable states of themembrane. The snap-upward pressure, ΔP1 (kilopascals), of the membrane differs fromthe snap-downward pressure, ΔP2 (kilopascals). The values ΔP1 and ΔP2 can be designed by changing the geometry and the material of themembrane. The valve does not require power to remain in either "open" or "closed" states (although switching does require energy), can be designed to be bistable, and can remain in either state without further applied pressure. When integrated in a feedback pneumatic circuit, the valve functions as a pneumatic oscillator (between the pressures ΔP1 and ΔP2), generating periodic motion using air from a single source of constant pressure. The valve, as a component of pneumatic circuits, enables (i) a gripper to grasp a ball autonomously and (ii) autonomous earthworm-like locomotion using an air source of constant pressure. These valves are fabricated using straightforwardmolding and offer a way of integrating simple control and logic functions directly into soft actuators and robots.},

The friction drag of the three target models are very similar; the body shape affected form drag coefficient is order as swordfish {\textless} killer whale {\textless} manta ray; the induced wave breaking upon the body of the manta ray performs different to killer whale and swordfish.

	abstract = {The deep sea remains the largest unknown territory on Earth because it is so difficult to explore1–4. Owing to the extremely high pressure in the deep sea, rigid vessels5–7 and pressure-compensation systems8–10 are typically required to protect mechatronic systems. However, deep-sea creatures that lack bulky or heavy pressure-tolerant systems can thrive at extreme depths11–17. Here, inspired by the structure of a deep-sea snailfish15, we develop an untethered soft robot for deep-sea exploration, with onboard power, control and actuation protected from pressure by integrating electronics in a silicone matrix. This self-powered robot eliminates the requirement for any rigid vessel. To reduce shear stress at the interfaces between electronic components, we decentralize the electronics by increasing the distance between components or separating them from the printed circuit board. Careful design of the dielectric elastomer material used for the robot’s flapping fins allowed the robot to be actuated successfully in a field test in the Mariana Trench down to a depth of 10,900\&nbsp;metres and to swim freely in the South China Sea at a depth of 3,224\&nbsp;metres. We validate the pressure resilience of the electronic components and soft actuators through systematic experiments and theoretical analyses. Our work highlights the potential of designing soft, lightweight devices for use in extreme conditions.

	abstract = {Although soft devices (grippers, actuators, and elementary robots) are rapidly becoming an integral part of the broad field of robotics, autonomy for completely soft devices has only begun to be developed. Adaptation of conventional systems of control to soft devices requires hard valves and electronic controls. This paper describes completely soft pneumatic digital logic gates having a physical scale appropriate for use with current (macroscopic) soft actuators. Each digital logic gate utilizes a single bistable valve—the pneumatic equivalent of a Schmitt trigger—which relies on the snap-through instability of a hemispherical membrane to kink internal tubes and operates with binary high/low input and output pressures. Soft, pneumatic NOT, AND, and OR digital logic gates—which generate known pneumatic outputs as a function of one, or multiple, pneumatic inputs—allow fabrication of digital logic circuits for a set–reset latch, two-bit shift register, leading-edge detector, digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and toggle switch. The DAC and toggle switch, in turn, can control and power a soft actuator (demonstrated using a pneu-net gripper). These macroscale soft digital logic gates are scalable to high volumes of airflow, do not consume power at steady state, and can be reconfigured to achieve multiple functionalities from a single design (including configurations that receive inputs from the environment and from human users). This work represents a step toward a strategy to develop autonomous control—one not involving an electronic interface or hard components—for soft devices.},

This work demonstrates a soft, pneumatic ring oscillator that induces temporally coordinated periodic motion in soft actuators using a single, constant-pressure source, without hard valves or electronic controls. The fundamental unit of this ring oscillator is a soft, pneumatic inverter (an inverting Schmitt trigger) that switches between its two states (“on” and “off”) using two instabilities in elastomeric structures: buckling of internal tubing and snap-through of a hemispherical membrane. An odd number of these inverters connected in a loop produces the same number of periodically oscillating outputs, resulting from a third, system-level instability; the frequency of oscillation depends on three system parameters that can be adjusted. These oscillatory output pressures enable several applications, including undulating and rolling motions in soft robots, size-based particle separation, pneumatic mechanotherapy, and metering of fluids.

Soft robotics have so far necessarily included some 'hard' or metallic elements, in particular in the form of batteries or wiring, to connect them to an external power source. Additionally, external wiring tethering them to a power source places limits on the autonomy of such robots. Now Jennifer Lewis and colleagues have combined a 3D-printed soft polymeric robot with microfluidic logic and hydrogen peroxide as an onboard fuel to produce an eight-armed robot — an 'octobot' — that actuates its arms, without the incorporation of any hard structures. The hydrogen peroxide decomposes in the presence of a platinum catalyst to produce oxygen and a volumetric expansion that fills bladders embedded within the arms of the octobot. The design of the fuel reservoirs, microfluidic channels and vents to release the gas means that two sets of arms actuate cyclically. Soft robots possess many attributes that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with conventional robots composed of rigid materials1,2. Yet, despite recent advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and power sources3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic11 that autonomously regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation12. The body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique13,14. The fluidic and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale. Our integrated design and rapid fabrication approach enables the programmable assembly of multiple materials within this architecture, laying the foundation for completely soft, autonomous robots.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing interest in soft robotics, little attention has been paid to the development of soft matter computational mechanisms. Embedding computation directly into soft materials is not only necessary for the next generation of fully soft robots but also for smart materials to move beyond stimulus-response relationships and toward the intelligent behaviors seen in biological systems. This article describes soft matter computers (SMCs), low-cost, and easily fabricated computational mechanisms for soft robots. The building block of an SMC is a conductive fluid receptor (CFR), which maps a fluidic input signal to an electrical output signal via electrodes embedded into a soft tube. SMCs could perform both analog and digital computation. The potential of SMCs is demonstrated by integrating them into three soft robots: (i) a Softworm robot was controlled by an SMC that generated the control signals necessary for three distinct gaits; (ii) a soft gripper was given a set of reflexes that could be programmed by adjusting the parameters of the CFR; and (iii) a two–degree of freedom bending actuator was switched between three distinct behaviors by varying only one input parameter. SMCs are a low-cost way to integrate computation directly into soft materials and an important step toward entirely soft autonomous robots.},

	abstract = {We are part of a growing community of researchers who are developing a new class of soft machines. By using mechanically soft materials (MPa modulus) we can design systems which overcome the bulk-mechanical mismatches between soft biological systems and hard engineered components. To develop fully integrated soft machines - which include power, communications, and control sub-systems - the research community requires methods for interconnecting between soft and hard electronics. Sensors based upon eutectic gallium alloys in microfluidic channels can be used to measure normal and strain forces, but integrating these sensors into systems of heterogeneous Young's modulus is difficult due the complexity of finding a material which is electrically conductive, mechanically flexible, and stable over prolonged periods of time. Many existing gallium-based liquid alloy sensors are not mechanically or electrically robust, and have poor stability over time. We present the design and fabrication of a high-resolution pressure-sensor soft system that can transduce normal force into a digital output. In this soft system, which is built on a monolithic silicone substrate, a galinstan-based microfluidic pressure sensor is integrated with a flexible printed circuit board. We used conductive thread as the interconnect and found that this method alleviates problems arising due to the mechanical mismatch between conventional metal wires and soft or liquid materials. Conductive thread is low-cost, it is readily wetted by the liquid metal, it produces little bending moment into the microfluidic channel, and it can be connected directly onto the copper bond-pads of the flexible printed circuit board. We built a bridge-system to provide stable readings from the galinstan pressure sensor. This system gives linear measurement results between 500-3500 Pa of applied pressure. We anticipate that integrated systems of this type will find utility in soft-robotic systems as used for wearable technologies like virtual reality, or in soft-medical devices such as exoskeletal rehabilitation robots.},

The polymer films exhibit conductivities comparable to the best reported values for PEDOT:PSS, with over 3100 S/cm under 0\% strain and over 4100 S/cm under 100\% strain—among the highest for reported stretchable conductors. It is highly durable under cyclic loading, with the conductivity maintained at 3600 S/cm even after 1000 cycles to 100\% strain. The conductivity remained above 100 S/cm under 600\% strain, with a fracture strain of 800\%, which is superior to even the best silver nanowire– or carbon nanotube–based stretchable conductor films.

Soft pneumatic oscillators can reduce the demand on controllers by generating complex movements required for locomotion from a single, constant input pressure, but either have been constrained to low rates of flow of air or have required complex fabrication processes. Here, we describe a pneumatic oscillator fabricated from flexible, but inextensible, sheets that provides high rates of airflow for practical locomotion by combining three instabilities: out-of-plane buckling of the sheets, kinking of tubing attached to the sheets, and a system-level instability resulting from connection of an odd number of pneumatic inverters made from these sheets in a loop. This device, which we call a "buckling-sheet ring oscillator" (BRO), directly generates movement from its own interaction with its surroundings and consists only of readily available materials assembled in a simple process- specifically, stacking acetate sheets, nylon film, and double-sided tape, and attaching an elastomeric tube. A device incorporating a BRO is capable of both translational and rotational motion over varied terrain (even without a tether) and can climb upward against gravity and downward against the buoyant force encountered under water},

	abstract = {Abstract Many pneumatic energy sources are available for use in autonomous and wearable soft robotics, but it is often not obvious which options are most desirable or even how to compare them. To address this, we compare pneumatic energy sources and review their relative merits. We evaluate commercially available battery-based microcompressors (singly, in parallel, and in series) and cylinders of high-pressure fluid (air and carbon dioxide). We identify energy density (joules/gram) and flow capacity (liters/gram) normalized by the mass of the entire fuel system (versus net fuel mass) as key metrics for soft robotic power systems. We also review research projects using combustion (methane and butane) and monopropellant decomposition (hydrogen peroxide), citing theoretical and experimental values. Comparison factors including heat, effective energy density, and working pressure/flow rate are covered. We conclude by comparing the key metrics behind each technology. Battery-powered microcompressors provide relatively high capacity, but maximum pressure and flow rates are low. Cylinders of compressed fluid provide high pressures and flow rates, but their limited capacity leads to short operating times. While methane and butane possess the highest net fuel energy densities, they typically react at speeds and pressures too high for many soft robots and require extensive system-level development. Hydrogen peroxide decomposition requires not only few additional parts (no pump or ignition system) but also considerable system-level development. We anticipate that this study will provide a framework for configuring fuel systems in soft robotics.},

Such achievements are reviewed here in terms of the abilities that they provide robots that were not possible before. An analysis of the evolution of this field shows how, after a few pioneering works in the years 2009 to 2012, breakthrough results were obtained by taking seminal technological and scientific challenges related to soft robotics from actuation and sensing to modeling and control. Further progress in soft robotics research has produced achievements that are important in terms of robot abilities—that is, from the viewpoint of what robots can do today thanks to the soft robotics approach. Abilities such as squeezing, stretching, climbing, growing, and morphing would not be possible with an approach based only on rigid links. The challenge ahead for soft robotics is to further develop the abilities for robots to grow, evolve, self-heal, develop, and biodegrade, which are the ways that robots can adapt their morphology to the environment.},

            Soft devices offer many useful characteristics, including safe operation in close proximity to humans, the ability to adapt to their surroundings, ease of sterilization, simplicity, low cost, and light weight. Current soft devices, however, are still actuated by hard valves and electronic controls, and reliance on these components limits the use of soft devices in applications where hard structures or electronics are not compatible. This work demonstrates completely soft digital logic gates that can be integrated into soft devices and that allow computation and control within these devices, without hard valves or electronics. We demonstrate data storage, signal processing, digital-to-analog conversion, environmental sensing, and collaborative interaction between humans and soft devices.
          , 
            Although soft devices (grippers, actuators, and elementary robots) are rapidly becoming an integral part of the broad field of robotics, autonomy for completely soft devices has only begun to be developed. Adaptation of conventional systems of control to soft devices requires hard valves and electronic controls. This paper describes completely soft pneumatic digital logic gates having a physical scale appropriate for use with current (macroscopic) soft actuators. Each digital logic gate utilizes a single bistable valve—the pneumatic equivalent of a Schmitt trigger—which relies on the snap-through instability of a hemispherical membrane to kink internal tubes and operates with binary high/low input and output pressures. Soft, pneumatic NOT, AND, and OR digital logic gates—which generate known pneumatic outputs as a function of one, or multiple, pneumatic inputs—allow fabrication of digital logic circuits for a set–reset latch, two-bit shift register, leading-edge detector, digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and toggle switch. The DAC and toggle switch, in turn, can control and power a soft actuator (demonstrated using a pneu-net gripper). These macroscale soft digital logic gates are scalable to high volumes of airflow, do not consume power at steady state, and can be reconfigured to achieve multiple functionalities from a single design (including configurations that receive inputs from the environment and from human users). This work represents a step toward a strategy to develop autonomous control—one not involving an electronic interface or hard components—for soft devices.},

          , 
            Closeup exploration of underwater life requires new forms of interaction, using biomimetic creatures that are capable of agile swimming maneuvers, equipped with cameras, and supported by remote human operation. Current robotic prototypes do not provide adequate platforms for studying marine life in their natural habitats. This work presents the design, fabrication, control, and oceanic testing of a soft robotic fish that can swim in three dimensions to continuously record the aquatic life it is following or engaging. Using a miniaturized acoustic communication module, a diver can direct the fish by sending commands such as speed, turning angle, and dynamic vertical diving. This work builds on previous generations of robotic fish that were restricted to one plane in shallow water and lacked remote control. Experimental results gathered from tests along coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean show that the robotic fish can successfully navigate around aquatic life at depths ranging from 0 to 18 meters. Furthermore, our robotic fish exhibits a lifelike undulating tail motion enabled by a soft robotic actuator design that can potentially facilitate a more natural integration into the ocean environment. We believe that our study advances beyond what is currently achievable using traditional thruster-based and tethered autonomous underwater vehicles, demonstrating methods that can be used in the future for studying the interactions of aquatic life and ocean dynamics.},

    "abstract": "Let $Ass_k(n)$ denote the simplicial complex of $(k+1)$-crossing-free subsets of edges in $\\binom{n}{2}$. Here $k,n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $n\\ge 2k+1$. It is conjectured that this simplicial complex is polytopal (Jonsson 2005). However, despite several recent advances, this is still an open problem.\n  In this paper we attack this problem using as a vector configuration the rows of a rigidity matrix, namely, hyperconnectivity restricted to bipartite graphs. We see that in this way $Ass_k(n)$ can be realized as a polytope for $k=2$ and $n\\le 10$, and as a fan for $k=2$ and $n\\le 13$, and for $k=3$ and $n\\le 11$. However, we also prove that the cases with $k\\ge 3$ and $n\\ge \\max\\{12,2k+4\\}$ are not realizable in this way.\n  We also give an algebraic interpretation of the rigidity matroid, relating it to a projection of determinantal varieties with implications in matrix completion, and prove the presence of a fan isomorphic to $Ass_{k-1}(n-2)$ in the tropicalization of that variety.",

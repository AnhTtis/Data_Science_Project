@article{Gouldby2017,
   abstract = {It is widely recognised that coastal flood events can arise from combinations of extreme waves and sea levels. For flood risk analysis and the design of coastal structures it is therefore necessary to assess the joint probability of the occurrence of these variables. Traditional methods have involved the application of joint probability contours, defined in terms of extremes of sea conditions that can, if applied without correction factors, lead to the underestimation of flood risk and under-design of coastal structures. This paper describes the application of a robust multivariate statistical model to analyse extreme offshore waves, wind and sea levels around the coast of England. The approach described here is risk based in that it seeks to define extremes of response variables directly, rather than the joint extremes of sea conditions. The output of the statistical model comprises a Monte Carlo simulation of extreme events. These distributions of extreme events have been transformed from offshore to nearshore using a statistical emulator of a wave transformation model. The resulting nearshore extreme sea condition distributions have the potential to be applied for a range of purposes. The application is demonstrated using two structures located on the south coast of England.},

@article{Youngman2019,
   abstract = {Generalized additive model (GAM) forms offer a flexible approach to capturing marginal variation. Such forms are used here to represent distributional variation in extreme values and presented in terms of spatio-temporal variation, which is often evident in environmental processes. A two-stage procedure is proposed that identifies extreme values as exceedances of a high threshold, which is defined as a fixed quantile and estimated by quantile regression. Excesses of the threshold are modelled with the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). GAM forms are adopted for the threshold and GPD parameters, and directly estimated—in particular smoothing parameters—by restricted maximum likelihood, which provides an objective and relatively fast method of inference. The GAM models are used to produce return level maps for extreme wind gust speeds over the United States, which show extreme quantiles of the distribution of annual maximum gust speeds. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

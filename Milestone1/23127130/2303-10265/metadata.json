    "abstract": "Kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb) provide a rich platform for intertwined orders, where evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking, likely due to the long-sought loop currents, has emerged in STM and muon spin relaxation experiments. An isotropic component in the spontaneous optical rotation has also been reported, and it was interpreted as the magneto-optic Kerr effect arising from time-reversal symmetry breaking. Intriguingly, the observed rotations differ by five orders of magnitude between different wavelengths and samples, suggesting more intricate physics. Here we report optical rotation and polar Kerr measurements in CsV3Sb5 crystals at the same wavelength. We observe large isotropic components of 1 milliradian in the optical rotation that do not respond to applied magnetic fields but flip sign between samples, while the spontaneous Kerr signal is less than 20 nanoradian. Our results prove unambiguously that the reported isotropic rotation is not related to time-reversal symmetry breaking but instead indicates a new intertwined order that onsets at the same temperature.",

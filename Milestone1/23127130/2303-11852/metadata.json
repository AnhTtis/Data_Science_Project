    "abstract": "We develop a generalization of the Wigner scheme for constructing the relativistic fields corresponding to irreducible representations of the four-dimensional Poincaré group with infinite spin. The fields are parameterized by a vector and an additional commuting vector or spinor variable. The equations of motion for fields of infinite spin are derived in both formulations under consideration.",

% In this paper, we derive a data-driven method to design a robust safe controller for polynomial systems, using density functions as safety certificate. Two sets are defined in parameter space, one for compatible systems and one for safe systems. The inclusion of two sets is formulated as a polynomial feasibility problem. With the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy, the problem is solved by Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solvers. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the safety of closed-loop systems.
This paper performs data-driven synthesis of robustly safe control laws for polynomial dynamical systems using density functions. The resultant controllers are robust to process noise both during the learning process and during execution. Synthesis proceeds using a set-containment framework, in which the set of all consistent systems is certifiably contained within the set of all controller-secured systems using sum-of-squares nonnegativity proofs. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the safety of closed-loop systems.

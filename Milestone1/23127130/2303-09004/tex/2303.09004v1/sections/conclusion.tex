\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}


This paper uses density functions to find provably safe controllers for systems whose data-observations and executions are both corrupted by $L_\infty$-bounded noise. The output of Algorithm \ref{alg:1} (if successful) is a rational controller $u$, along with a density certificate $\rho$ that guarantees robust safety of all trajectories starting in the initial set. Future work involves steering safe trajectories to a destination set (e.g. reach avoid, asymptotic stability), adding performance objectives, and extension to other noise and disturbance models (e.g. $L_2$ or semidefinite bounded signals).

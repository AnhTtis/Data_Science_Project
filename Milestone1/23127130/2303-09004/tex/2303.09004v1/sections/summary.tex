This paper has the following structure: 
Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} reviews preliminaries such as notation, density functions for safety, 
%the Extended Farkas Lemma for polytope containtment
and \ac{SOS} polynomials.
% \urg{SOS polynomials could also be defined in Section \ref{sec:sos_safety}}. 
Section \ref{sec:safe_no_w} performs data-driven synthesis of safe controllers using density functions and \ac{SOS} methods in the case where $L_\infty$-bounded noise  occurs at data collection and  the dynamics are subject to unknown but bounded disturbances. 
% Section \ref{sec:safe_with_w} extends the \ac{SOS}-density method towards the synthesis of robustly safe controllers where $L_\infty$-bounded noise also affects system execution (process noise). 
Section \ref{sec:examples} demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach  on several  example systems. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.

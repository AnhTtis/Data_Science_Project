This section presents the main results of the paper: a convex, tractable  reformulation of Problem 1.  In order to present these results, we begin by presenting  a tractable characterization of all systems that could have generated the observed data. 

Assume the sample data $\dc$ is corrupted by a sample (offline) noise bounded by $\epsilon$. The consistency set $\mathcal{P}_1$, 
which contains all systems that are consistent with the data, is defined as:

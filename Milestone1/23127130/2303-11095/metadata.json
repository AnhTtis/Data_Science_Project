    "abstract": "We investigate the role of nonlinearity via optical parametric oscillator on the entropy production rate and quantum correlations in a hybrid optomechanical system. Specifically, we derive the modified entropy production rate of an optical parametric oscillator placed in the optomechanical cavity which is well described by the two-mode Gaussian state. We find a dramatic deviation in the irreversibility and quantum mutual information for small detuning. Our analysis shows that the system irreversibility can be reduced by choosing the appropriate phase of the self-induced nonlinearity. We further demonstrate that the nonlinearity effect persist for a reasonable range of cavity decay rate.",

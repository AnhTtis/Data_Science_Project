    "abstract": "The centrality determination and the estimated fluctuations of number of\nparticipant nucleons $N_{part}$ in Au-Au collisions at 1.23 $A$GeV beam kinetic\nenergy suffers from severe model dependencies. Comparing the Glauber Monte\nCarlo (MC) and UrQMD transport models, it is shown that $N_{part}$ is a\nstrongly model dependant quantity. In addition, for any given centrality class,\nGlauber MC and UrQMD predicts drastically different $N_{part}$ distributions.\nThe impact parameter $b$ and the number of charged particles $N_{ch}$ on the\nother hand are much more correlated and give an almost model independent\ncentrality estimator. It is suggested that the total baryon number balance,\nfrom integrated rapidity distributions, can be used instead of $N_{part}$ in\nexperiments. Preliminary HADES data show significant differences to both, UrQMD\nsimulations and STAR data in this respect.",

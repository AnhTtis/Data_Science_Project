              for patients with childhood craniopharyngioma such as growth
              hormone (GH) replacement, which some believe can exacerbate
              recurrence/progression. We prospectively assessed the risk of
              tumor recurrence/progression in survivors of childhood
              craniopharyngioma. METHODS: Multivariable analyses of risk
              factors (age at diagnosis, degree of resection, irradiation, GH
              treatment and gender) and descriptive analyses of overall
              survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were performed
              in 117 patients, recruited prospectively and evaluated after 3
              years of follow-up in the German, Austrian and Swiss multicenter
              trial KRANIOPHARYNGEOM 2000. RESULTS: We observed a 3-year OS of
              0.97 and a 3-year EFS of 0.46, indicating high recurrence rates
              after complete resection (CR) (n = 47; 3-year-EFS: 0.64) and high
              progression rates after incomplete resection (IR) (n = 64; 3-year
              EFS: 0.31). The risk of an event decreased by 80\% after CR
              compared to IR (hazard ratio = 0.20; p < 0.001). Irradiation had
              protective effects on EFS: irradiated patients had an 88\% lower
              risk of recurrence/progression compared to patients
              without/before irradiation (hazard ratio = 0.12; p < 0.001). GH
              treatment had no impact on 3-year EFS rates. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor
              recurrences/progressions are frequent and occur early after
              initial treatment of childhood craniopharyngioma. A radical
              resection preserving the integrity of hypothalamic structures
              appears optimal at original diagnosis. Irradiation was efficient
              in preventing recurrences/progressions. GH treatment had no
              impact on the low 3-year EFS observed in our study. However,
              further conclusions on the influence of GH on recurrence rates
              have to be refined to long-term follow-up studies of patients

  abstract = "OBJECT: The value of extent of resection (EOR) in improving
              survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains
              controversial. Specifically, it is unclear what proportion of
              contrast-enhancing tumor must be resected for a survival
              advantage and how much survival improves beyond this threshold.
              The authors attempt to define these values for the patient with
              newly diagnosed GBM in the modern neurosurgical era. METHODS: The
              authors identified 500 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with
              supratentorial GBM treated at the University of California, San
              Francisco between 1997 and 2009. Clinical, radiographic, and
              outcome parameters were measured for each case, including MR
              imaging-based volumetric tumor analysis. RESULTS: The patients
              had a median age of 60 years and presented with a median
              Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The mean clinical
              follow-up period was 15.3 months, and no patient was unaccounted
              for. All patients underwent resection followed by chemotherapy
              and radiation therapy. The median postoperative tumor volume was
              2.3 cm(3), equating to a 96\% EOR. The median overall survival
              was 12.2 months. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, age,
              KPS score, and EOR were predictive of survival (p < 0.0001). A
              significant survival advantage was seen with as little as 78\%
              EOR, and stepwise improvement in survival was evident even in the
              95\%-100\% EOR range. A recursive partitioning analysis validated
              these findings and provided additional risk stratification
              parameters related to age, EOR, and tumor burden. CONCLUSIONS:
              For patients with newly diagnosed GBMs, aggressive EOR equates to
              improvement in overall survival, even at the highest levels of
              resection. Interestingly, subtotal resections as low as 78\% also
              correspond to a survival benefit.",

              important prognostic factor for survival in patients undergoing
              initial resection of glioblastoma (GBM), but the significance of

              study the authors investigate the impact of EOR at initial and
              repeat resection of GBM on overall survival. METHODS: Medical
              records were reviewed for all patients undergoing craniotomy for
              GBM at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center
              from January 1, 2005, through August 15, 2009. Patients who had a
              second craniotomy for pathologically confirmed recurrence
              following radiation and chemotherapy were evaluated. Volumetric
              EOR was measured and classified as gross-total resection (GTR, >
              95\% by volume) or subtotal resection (STR, $\leq$ 95\% by
              volume) after independent radiological review. Overall survival
              was compared between groups using univariate and multivariate
              analysis accounting for known prognostic factors, including age,
              eloquent location, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and
              adjuvant therapies. RESULTS: Multiple resections were performed
              in 107 patients. Fifty-two patients had initial GTR, of whom 31
              (60\%) had GTR at recurrence, with a median survival of 20.4
              months (standard error [SE] 1.0 months), and 21 (40\%) had STR at
              recurrence, with a median survival of 18.4 months (SE 0.5 months)
              (difference not statistically significant). Initial STR was
              performed in 55 patients, of whom 26 (47\%) had GTR at
              recurrence, with a median survival of 19.0 months (SE 1.2
              months), and 29 (53\%) had STR, with a median survival of 15.9
              months (SE 1.2 months) (p = 0.004). A Cox proportional hazards
              model was constructed demonstrating that age (HR 1.03, p =
              0.004), KPS score at recurrence (HR 2.4, p = 0.02), and EOR at
              repeat resection (HR 0.62, p = 0.02) were independent predictors
              of survival. Extent of initial resection was not a statistically
              significant factor (p = 0.13) when repeat EOR was included in the
              model, suggesting that GTR at second craniotomy could overcome
              the effect of an initial STR. CONCLUSIONS: Extent of resection at
              recurrence is an important predictor of overall survival. If GTR
              is achieved at recurrence, overall survival is maximized
              regardless of initial EOR, suggesting that patients with initial
              STR may benefit from surgery with a GTR at recurrence.",

              we evaluate the capacity of SRH for use in the intraoperative
              diagnosis of pediatric type brain tumors. SRH revealed key
              diagnostic features in fresh tissue specimens collected from 33
              prospectively enrolled pediatric type brain tumor patients,
              preserving tumor cytology and histoarchitecture in all specimens.
              We simulated an intraoperative consultation for 25 patients with
              specimens imaged using both SRH and standard hematoxylin and
              eosin histology. SRH-based diagnoses achieved near-perfect

              accuracy of 92\% to 96\%. We then developed a quantitative
              histologic method using SRH images based on rapid image feature

              fields of view were used to develop and validate a decision-tree

              diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening
              and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and
              histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin
              lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the
              fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general
              and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object
              categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions
              using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly,
              using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN
              using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images-two orders of
              magnitude larger than previous datasets-consisting of 2,032
              different diseases. We test its performance against 21
              board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images
              with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte
              carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant
              melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the
              identification of the most common cancers, the second represents
              the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves
              performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks,
              demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying
              skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to

              and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute
              were used to evaluate the breast cancer survival experience in a
              representative sample of women from the United States. Actuarial
              (life table) methods were used to investigate the 5-year relative
              survival rates in cases with known operative/pathologic axillary
              lymph node status and primary tumor diameter. Survival rates
              varied from 45.5\% for tumor diameters equal to or greater than 5
              cm with positive axillary nodes to 96.3\% for tumors less than 2
              cm and with no involved nodes. The relation between tumor size
              and lymph node status was investigated in detail. Tumor diameter
              and lymph node status were found to act as independent but
              additive prognostic indicators. As tumor size increased, survival
              decreased regardless of lymph node status; and as lymph node

              analysis of the burden of surgical disease and breadth of cancer
              surgery, economics and financing, factors for strengthening
              surgical systems for cancer with multiple-country studies, the

              making in this area. We found wide equity and economic gaps in

              have access to cancer surgery, and the failure to train more
              cancer surgeons and strengthen systems could result in as much as

              investment in public surgical systems, low investment in

              improve quality and scale up cancer surgical systems through
              education and training. Our key messages are directed at many
              global stakeholders, but the central message is that to deliver

              Pathologists Q-Probes laboratory quality improvement program
              prospectively collected data on up to 30 FS procedures performed
              on elective inpatient surgical cases and completed questionnaires
              profiling their FS practice characteristics. SETTING: Surgical
              pathology laboratories serving private and public hospitals.
              PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred institutions located in North America
              (667), Australia (12), New Zealand (1), the United Kingdom (3),
              Hong Kong (1), Mexico (1), and Norway (1). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
              The 90\% FS block completion time defined as the time interval,
              in minutes, within which the fastest 90\% of all FS blocks were
              completed, measured from the time pathologists received FS
              specimens to the time they communicated FS results to the
              surgeon. RESULTS: Participants submitted data on 32868 FS blocks.
              Ninety percent of FS procedures were completed within 20 minutes.
              Frozen section turnaround times exceeding 20 minutes, termed
              outlier turnaround times, were more likely to occur when more
              than one pathologist participated in the FS diagnosis, pathology
              residents and medical students participated in the FS procedure,
              the pathologist had to retrieve and review previous case material
              during the FS procedure, the pathologist simultaneously received
              additional specimens from other FS cases, the pathologist was
              unable to reach a final FS diagnosis, and when technical problems
              occurred during the FS procedure. Seventy percent of all
              participating hospitals completed 90\% of their frozen sections
              within 20 minutes. The institutional 90\% completion times were
              shorter for hospitals containing 300 or fewer occupied beds than
              for those containing more than 300 occupied beds. CONCLUSIONS:
              The data suggest that 90\% of FS block turnaround times can be
              performed within 20 minutes, measured from the time that
              pathologists receive FS specimens to the time that pathologists

              resonance imaging (MRI), in conjunction with clinical assessment
              and corticosteroid dose (the Macdonald Criteria). It is
              increasingly apparent that there are significant limitations to
              these criteria, which only address the contrast-enhancing
              component of the tumor. For example, chemoradiotherapy for newly
              diagnosed glioblastomas results in transient increase in tumor
              enhancement (pseudoprogression) in 20\% to 30\% of patients,
              which is difficult to differentiate from true tumor progression.
              Antiangiogenic agents produce high radiographic response rates,
              as defined by a rapid decrease in contrast enhancement on CT/MRI
              that occurs within days of initiation of treatment and that is
              partly a result of reduced vascular permeability to contrast
              agents rather than a true antitumor effect. In addition, a subset
              of patients treated with antiangiogenic agents develop tumor
              recurrence characterized by an increase in the nonenhancing
              component depicted on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion
              recovery sequences. The recognition that contrast enhancement is
              nonspecific and may not always be a true surrogate of tumor
              response and the need to account for the nonenhancing component
              of the tumor mandate that new criteria be developed and validated
              to permit accurate assessment of the efficacy of novel therapies.

              criteria for clinical trials in brain tumors. In this proposal,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The ability to diagnose brain tumors intraoperatively
              and identify tumor margins during resection could maximize
              resection and minimize morbidity. Advances in optical imaging
              enabled production of a handheld intraoperative confocal
              microscope. OBJECTIVE: To present a feasibility analysis of the
              intraoperative confocal microscope for brain tumor resection.
              METHODS: Thirty-three patients with brain tumor treated at Barrow
              Neurological Institute were examined. All patients received an
              intravenous bolus of sodium fluorescein before confocal imaging
              with the Optiscan FIVE 1 system probe. Optical biopsies were
              obtained within each tumor and along the tumor-brain interfaces.
              Corresponding pathologic specimens were then excised and
              processed. These data was compared by a neuropathologist to
              identify the concordance for tumor histology, grade, and margins.
              RESULTS: Thirty-one of 33 lesions were tumors (93.9\%) and 2
              cases were identified as radiation necrosis (6.1\%). Of the
              former, 25 (80.6\%) were intra-axial and 6 (19.4\%) were
              extra-axial. Intra-axial tumors were most commonly gliomas and
              metastases, while all extra-axial tumors were meningiomas. Among
              high-grade gliomas, vascular neoproliferation, as well as tumor
              margins, were identifiable using confocal imaging. Meningothelial
              and fibrous meningiomas were distinct on confocal microscopy--the
              latter featured spindle-shaped cells distinguishable from
              adjacent parenchyma. Other tumor histologies correlated well with
              standard neuropathology tissue preparations. CONCLUSION:
              Intraoperative confocal microscopy is a practicable technology
              for the resection of human brain tumors. Preliminary analysis
              demonstrates reliability for a variety of lesions in identifying
              tumor cells and the tumor-brain interface. Further refinement of
              this technology depends upon the approval of tumor-specific
              fluorescent contrast agents for human use.",

              facilitates greater extent of resection and improves 6-month
              progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas.
              But there remains a paucity of studies that have examined whether
              the intensity of ALA fluorescence correlates with tumor
              cellularity. Therefore, a Phase II clinical trial was undertaken
              to examine the correlation of intensity of ALA fluorescence with
              the degree of tumor cellularity. METHODS A single-center,
              prospective, single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial of
              ALA fluorescence-guided resection of high-grade gliomas (Grade
              III and IV) was held over a 43-month period (August 2010 to
              February 2014). ALA was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg body
              weight. Intraoperative biopsies from resection cavities were
              collected. The biopsies were graded on a 4-point scale (0 to 3)
              based on ALA fluorescence intensity by the surgeon and
              independently based on tumor cellularity by a neuropathologist.
              The primary outcome of interest was the correlation of ALA
              fluorescence intensity to tumor cellularity. The secondary
              outcome of interest was ALA adverse events. Sensitivities,
              specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative
              predictive values (NPVs), and Spearman correlation coefficients
              were calculated. RESULTS A total of 211 biopsies from 59 patients
              were included. Mean age was 53.3 years and 59.5\% were male. The
              majority of biopsies were glioblastoma (GBM) (79.7\%). Slightly
              more than half (52.5\%) of all tumors were recurrent. ALA
              intensity of 3 correlated with presence of tumor 97.4\% (PPV) of
              the time. However, absence of ALA fluorescence (intensity 0)
              correlated with the absence of tumor only 37.7\% (NPV) of the
              time. For all tumor types, GBM, Grade III gliomas, and recurrent
              tumors, ALA intensity 3 correlated strongly with cellularity
              Grade 3; Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were 0.65, 0.66,
              0.65, and 0.62, respectively. The specificity and PPV of ALA
              intensity 3 correlating with cellularity Grade 3 ranged from 95\%
              to 100\% and 86\% to 100\%, respectively. In biopsies without
              tumor (cellularity Grade 0), 35.4\% still demonstrated ALA
              fluorescence. Of those biopsies, 90.9\% contained abnormal brain
              tissue, characterized by reactive astrocytes, scattered atypical
              cells, or inflammation, and 8.1\% had normal brain. In
              nonfluorescent (ALA intensity 0) biopsies, 62.3\% had tumor cells
              present. The ALA-associated complication rate among the study
              cohort was 3.4\%. CONCLUSIONS The PPV of utilizing the most
              robust ALA fluorescence intensity (lava-like orange) as a
              predictor of tumor presence is high. However, the NPV of
              utilizing the absence of fluorescence as an indicator of no tumor
              is poor. ALA intensity is a strong predictor for degree of tumor
              cellularity for the most fluorescent areas but less so for lower
              ALA intensities. Even in the absence of tumor cells, reactive
              changes may lead to ALA fluorescence.",

              postoperative pituitary function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
              retrospectively reviewed data from 71 patients with CD who
              underwent microscope navigation TSS (MN-TSS) in Saint-Luc
              Hospital between 1996 and 2017. True remission was defined as
              normal fasting cortisol level, normal 24-hour urinary free
              cortisol, or continued need for hydrocortisone replacement for 1
              year after surgery. RESULTS: Overall remission rate after 1 or
              repeated MN-TSS was 83\%. Highest remission rate was found in
              patients with macroadenomas (92\%). Successful first MN-TSS was
              correlated with a high final remission rate (95\%), whereas
              failed first MN-TSS was correlated with a low final remission
              rate (36\%). Although day 1 cortisol levels were significantly
              lower in patients with long-term remission, high levels were
              still observed in a few patients, especially those who had had CD
              for many years. We found a low rate of postoperative pituitary
              long-term hypofunction (9.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: MN-TSS is a safe and
              effective procedure to treat CD, allowing remission rates of
              83\%. One-year remission period after first surgery is correlated
              with a final remission rate of 95\%. Although day 1 morning
              cortisol value is the most significant predictor for long-term
              remission, some patients with CD for many years may keep high
              postoperative cortisol levels and be in later remission, likely
              because of secondary adrenal hyperplasia. Our focused approach
              with microscope navigation resulted in low rates of postoperative
              pituitary hypofunction and kept a recurrence rate comparable to
              that in the literature.",

              complicated by postoperative microvascular brainstem ischemia.
              METHODS: Charts were retrospectively reviewed of all patients who
              had an MRI within 14 days of VSS in years 2005-2016. Patient
              characteristics, preoperative and postoperative imaging features,
              clinical course and potential predictors of brainstem ischemia
              were recorded. Cadaveric dissections of 4 cerebellopontine angle
              (CPA) cisterns with focus on the anterior inferior cerebellar
              artery (AICA) microvascular were also performed to identify
              candidate vessels and potential etiology. RESULTS: Fifty-four of
              258 patients had an MRI within 14 days of VSS. Retrosigmoid
              approach was used in 61.1\% of patients, translabyrinthine
              approach in 25.9\%, and middle fossa approach in 13.0\%. Four
              patients (7.4\%) had acute microvascular ischemia involving the
              middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) adjacent to the cranial nerve
              (CN) VII-VIII complex demonstrated on postoperative MRI. A
              statistically significant association was found between the
              translabyrinthine approach and acute brainstem ischemia (odds
              ratio, 10.6; 95\% confidence interval, 1.004-112.7). Dissection
              of CPAs revealed 10-20 perforating arteries per specimen
              originating from the lateral pontine and the flocculopeduncular
              segments of the AICA. Most microvessels travelled in retrograde
              fashion along the anteroinferior surface of the CN VII-VIII
              complex to perforate the cisternal surface of the MCP. No patient
              had residual or delayed neurologic deficits related to brainstem
              ischemia at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: While effort should be
              made to preserve perforating vessels, microvascular brainstem
              ischemia is often asymptomatic and did not lead to permanent

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Attempted gross-total resection for the management of
              cystic retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas can cause severe
              hypothalamic dysfunction and decrease overall survival.
              Ventriculoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive alternative;
              however, potential indications and technique have not been well
              defined. OBJECTIVE: To present our indications and technique for
              the ventriculoscopic treatment of cystic retrochiasmatic
              craniopharyngiomas. METHODS: We evaluated all patients with
              retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas for ventriculoscopic surgery.
              Indications and operative technique were developed to minimize
              operative morbidity, relieve mass effect, and optimize functional
              outcome. Cyst size and functional outcomes were statistically
              evaluated to determine radiographic and short-term clinical
              outcome. RESULTS: Indications for ventriculoscopic surgery
              included (1) radiographic evidence of hypothalamic involvement
              and (2) major cystic component. Ten patients met indications, and
              mean follow-up was 2.5 $\pm$ 1.6 yr. The surgical technique
              included wide cyst fenestration at the foramen of Monro, and
              fenestration of inferior cyst wall/third ventriculostomy
              (``through-and-through'' technique). Preoperative Karnofsky
              performance status was 70 $\pm$ 15 and was inversely correlated
              with preoperative cyst size (13 $\pm$ 13 cm3). A statistically
              significant reduction in cyst size was found on early
              postoperative imaging (2.1 $\pm$ 4.3 cm3). Seven patients
              received postoperative radiotherapy. Postoperative performance
              scores (81 $\pm$ 8.3) had improved; no patient suffered
              functional decline. Pre- and postoperative body mass indices were
              similar. No patient had short-term hypothalamic obesity.
              CONCLUSION: Ventriculoscopic surgery, with or without adjuvant
              treatments, can reduce early postoperative tumor volume and
              improve short-term functional status in cystic retrochiasmatic
              craniopharyngiomas with hypothalamic involvement; it should be
              considered a minimally invasive option in the multimodal
              treatment of craniopharyngiomas. Further studies are needed to
              determine long-term efficacy.",

              controversial. This study seeks to identify the frequency with
              which patients undergoing elective supratentorial tumor resection
              require care, aside from frequent neurologic checks, that is
              specific to an ICU and to determine the frequency of new
              complications during ICU admission. Additionally, clinical
              predictors of ICU-specific care are identified, and a scoring
              system to discriminate patients most likely to require
              ICU-specific treatment is validated. DESIGN: Retrospective
              observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic neurosurgical
              center. PATIENTS: Two-hundred consecutive adult patients who
              underwent supratentorial brain tumor surgery. An additional 100
              consecutive patients were used to validate the prediction score.
              INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate
              statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to
              identify clinical characteristics associated with ICU-specific
              treatment. Eighteen patients (9\%) received ICU-specific care,
              and 19 (9.5\%) experienced new complications or underwent
              emergent imaging while in the ICU. Factors significantly
              associated with ICU-specific care included nonelective admission,
              preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale, and volume of IV fluids. A
              simple clinical scoring system that included Karnofsky
              Performance Status less than 70 (1 point), general endotracheal
              anesthesia (1 point), and any early postoperative complications
              (2 points) demonstrated excellent ability to discriminate
              patients who required ICU-specific care in both the derivation
              and validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Less than 10\% of patients
              required ICU-specific care following supratentorial tumor
              resection. A simple clinical scoring system may aid clinicians in
              stratifying the risk of requiring ICU care and could inform

  abstract = "Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic memory disorder caused by a
              severe deficiency of thiamine that is most commonly observed in
              alcoholics. However, some have proposed that focal structural
              lesions disrupting memory circuits-in particular, the mammillary
              bodies, the mammillothalamic tract, and the anterior thalamus-can
              give rise to this amnestic syndrome. Here, the authors present 4
              patients with reversible Korsakoff syndromes caused by
              suprasellar retrochiasmatic lesions compressing the mammillary
              bodies and adjacent caudal hypothalamic structures. Three of the
              patients were found to have large pituitary macroadenomas in
              their workup for memory deficiency and cognitive decline with
              minimal visual symptoms. These tumors extended superiorly into
              the suprasellar region in a retrochiasmatic position and caused
              significant mass effect in the bilateral mammillary bodies in the
              base of the brain. These 3 patients had complete and rapid
              resolution of amnestic problems shortly after initiation of
              treatment, consisting of resection in 1 case of nonfunctioning
              pituitary adenoma or cabergoline therapy in 2 cases of
              prolactinoma. The fourth patient presented with bizarre and
              hostile behavior along with significant memory deficits and was
              found to have a large cystic craniopharyngioma filling the third
              ventricle and compressing the midline diencephalic structures.
              This patient underwent cyst fenestration and tumor debulking,
              with a rapid improvement in his mental status. The rapid and
              dramatic memory improvement observed in all of these cases is
              probably due to a reduction in the pressure imposed by the
              lesions on structures contiguous to the third ventricle, rather
              than a direct destructive effect of the tumor, and highlights the
              essential role of the caudal diencephalic structures-mainly the
              mammillary bodies-in memory function. In summary, large pituitary
              lesions with suprasellar retrochiasmatic extension and third
              ventricular craniopharyngiomas can cause severe Korsakoff-like
              amnestic syndromes, probably because of bilateral pressure on or
              damage to mammillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei, or their
              major connections. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may rapidly and
              completely reverse shortly after initiation of therapy via
              surgical decompression of tumors or pharmacological treatment of
              prolactinomas. Early identification of these lesions with timely
              treatment can lead to a favorable prognosis for this severe
              neuropsychiatric disorder.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: In glioma surgery, it is critical to maximize tumor
               resection without compromising adjacent noncancerous brain
               tissue. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive,
               label-free, real-time, high-resolution imaging modality that has
               been explored for glioma infiltration detection. Here, we report
               a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted method for
               automated, real-time, in situ detection of glioma infiltration
               at high spatial resolution. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Volumetric OCT
               datasets were intraoperatively obtained from resected brain
               tissue specimens of 21 patients with glioma tumors of different
               stages and labeled as either noncancerous or glioma-infiltrated
               on the basis of histopathology evaluation of the tissue
               specimens (gold standard). Labeled OCT images from 12 patients
               were used as the training dataset to develop the AI-assisted
               OCT-based method for automated detection of glioma-infiltrated
               brain tissue. Unlabeled OCT images from the other 9 patients
               were used as the validation dataset to quantify the method
               detection performance. RESULTS: Our method achieved excellent
               levels of sensitivity (∼100\%) and specificity (∼85\%) for
               detecting glioma-infiltrated tissue with high spatial resolution
               (16 $\mu$m laterally) and processing speed (∼100,020 OCT
               A-lines/second). CONCLUSIONS: Previous methods for OCT-based
               detection of glioma-infiltrated brain tissue rely on estimating
               the tissue optical attenuation coefficient from the OCT signal,
               which requires sacrificing spatial resolution to increase signal
               quality, and performing systematic calibration procedures using
               tissue phantoms. By overcoming these major challenges, our
               AI-assisted method will enable implementing practical OCT-guided
               surgical tools for continuous, real-time, and accurate
               intraoperative detection of glioma-infiltrated brain tissue,

              812 surgical cases performed in the Hamilton Regional Laboratory
              Medicine Programme during a 6-month period in 2007. We reviewed
              the frozen section and permanent slides from all potentially
              discordant cases using a multiheaded microscope to arrive at a
              consensus pertaining to the type and reason for error. We
              reviewed the clinical record to determine whether there had been
              a potential adverse impact on immediate clinical management.
              RESULTS: Frozen sections were most commonly requested for head
              and neck, nervous system and female genital tract specimens.
              Twenty-eight frozen sections (3\%) were deferred. We identified

              communication is required between the pathologist and surgeon to
              obtain the best care for their mutual patient. Intraoperative

              tissue adequacy in the context of the clinical and imaging
              features of the patient. FS can guarantee that the surgeon is in
              the desired anatomic location, but most often serves to ensure

              and permanent section discrepancies will be briefly reviewed so
              that pathologists will understand that some difficulties are
              inherent in neurosurgical specimens and are not specific to their
              practice, or to a given pathologist. Hopefully, this knowledge

              Therefore, fluorescent labels were exploited for direct
              assessment of the interpretation of CARS images of solid and

              mice (n = 7). The neoplastic nature of cells imaged by CARS
              microscopy was unequivocally verified by addressing two-photon
              fluorescence of GFP on fresh brain slices and in vivo. In fresh
              unfixed biopsies of human glioblastoma (n = 10), the fluorescence

              gene are early genetic events in glioma pathogenesis and cause
              profound metabolic changes. Because this genotype is found in
              virtually every tumor cell, therapies targeting mutant IDH1
              protein are being developed. The intraoperative administration of
              those therapies would require fast technologies for the
              determination of IDH1 genotype. As of today, there is no such
              diagnostic test available. Recently, infrared spectroscopy was
              shown to bridge this gap. Here, we tested Raman spectroscopy for
              analysis of IDH1 genotype in glioma, which constitutes an
              alternative contact-free technique with the potential of being
              applicable in situ. METHODS: Human glioma samples (n = 36) were
              obtained during surgery and cryosections were prepared. IDH1
              mutations were assessed using DNA sequencing and 100 Raman
              spectra were obtained for each sample. RESULTS: Analysis of Raman
              spectra revealed increased intensities in spectral bands related
              to DNA in IDH1 mutant glioma while bands assigned to molecular
              vibrations of lipids were significantly decreased. Moreover,
              intensities of Raman bands assigned to proteins differed in IDH1
              mutant and IDH1 wild-type glioma, suggesting alterations in the
              protein profile. The selection of five bands (498, 826, 1003,
              1174 and 1337 cm-1) allowed the classification of Raman spectra
              according to IDH1 genotype with a correct rate of 89\%.
              CONCLUSION: Raman spectroscopy constitutes a simple, rapid and
              safe procedure for determination of the IDH1 mutation that shows

              pre-operative distinction of neoplastic and benign pathologies
              remains elusive. Definitive diagnosis still requires brain biopsy
              in a significant number of cases. CARS microscopy, a nonlinear,

              chemically-selective three-dimensional imaging without exogenous
              labeling agents. Like MRI, CARS can be tuned to provide a wide
              variety of possible tissue contrasts, but with sub-cellular
              spatial resolution and near real time temporal resolution. These

              from 22 neurosurgical patients. SRS detects tumor infiltration in
              near-perfect agreement with standard hematoxylin and eosin light
              microscopy ($\kappa$ = 0.86). The unique chemical contrast
              specific to SRS microscopy enables tumor detection by revealing

              is important for grading, specimens containing only necrosis are
              diagnostically useless. Raman microspectroscopic mapping
              experiments were performed on unfixed cryosections of
              glioblastoma, obtained from 20 patients. After spectral
              acquisition, a clustering analysis was performed, resulting in
              groups of similar spectra. Each cluster was assigned a color, and
              pseudo-color Raman maps of the tissue sections were constructed.
              After the Raman experiments, the tissue sections were stained for

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Treatment response assessment in high-grade gliomas
              uses contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI, but is unreliable. Novel
              advanced MRI techniques have been studied, but the accuracy is
              not well known. Therefore, we performed a systematic
              meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of anatomical and
              advanced MRI for treatment response in high-grade gliomas.
              METHODS: Databases were searched systematically. Study selection
              and data extraction were done by two authors independently.
              Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects
              model when $\geq$5 studies were included. RESULTS: Anatomical MRI
              (five studies, 166 patients) showed a pooled sensitivity and
              specificity of 68\% (95\%CI 51-81) and 77\% (45-93),
              respectively. Pooled apparent diffusion coefficients (seven
              studies, 204 patients) demonstrated a sensitivity of 71\% (60-80)
              and specificity of 87\% (77-93). DSC-perfusion (18 studies, 708
              patients) sensitivity was 87\% (82-91) with a specificity of 86\%
              (77-91). DCE-perfusion (five studies, 207 patients) sensitivity
              was 92\% (73-98) and specificity was 85\% (76-92). The
              sensitivity of spectroscopy (nine studies, 203 patients) was 91\%
              (79-97) and specificity was 95\% (65-99). CONCLUSION: Advanced
              techniques showed higher diagnostic accuracy than anatomical MRI,
              the highest for spectroscopy, supporting the use in treatment
              response assessment in high-grade gliomas. KEY POINTS: •
              Treatment response assessment in high-grade gliomas with
              anatomical MRI is unreliable • Novel advanced MRI techniques have
              been studied, but diagnostic accuracy is unknown • Meta-analysis
              demonstrates that advanced MRI showed higher diagnostic accuracy
              than anatomical MRI • Highest diagnostic accuracy for
              spectroscopy and perfusion MRI • Supports the incorporation of
              advanced MRI in high-grade glioma treatment response assessment.",

               which is the most common primary brain malignancy, remains poor
               with current treatment modalities. However, an enhanced
               understanding of gliomagenesis is supporting the development of
               targeted molecular therapies with the potential for improving
               clinical outcomes. AREAS COVERED: Epidermal growth factor
               receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
               (VEGFR) initiate key signaling pathways in GBM; however, trials
               with anti-EGFR agents have failed to show improved outcomes.
               Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, remains the
               only FDA-approved molecular drug in GBM; yet its use has only
               improved progression-free survival without any improvement in
               overall survival. We review the evidence supporting the
               continued evaluation of targeted molecular therapies in
               recurrent GBM. In addition, newer potential therapies targeting
               other signaling pathways, heat shock proteins and proteosomes,
               as well as the concept of targeting glioma stem cells are
               discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The complex genetic origin of GBM
               makes it challenging to identify molecular subsets that may
               benefit from specific targeted therapies. Pathway inhibition,
               via multisite kinase inhibitors or a carefully selected
               combination of molecular drugs with or without cytotoxic agents,
               is currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials and may
               improve outcomes in these patients.",

              cancers, many of which eventually transform into more aggressive
              tumors. Despite recent findings of frequent mutations in IDH1 and
              other genes, knowledge about their pathogenesis is still
              incomplete. Here, combining two large sets of high-throughput

              population with diverse perioperative risk factors,
              endocrinopathies, and other tumor-related comorbidities. This
              heterogeneity makes predicting postoperative outcomes challenging
              when using traditional scoring systems. Modern machine learning
              algorithms can automatically identify the most predictive risk
              factors and learn complex risk-factor interactions using training
              data to build a robust predictive model that can generalize to
              new patient cohorts. The authors sought to build a predictive
              model using supervised machine learning to accurately predict
              early outcomes of pituitary adenoma surgery.METHODSA
              retrospective cohort of 400 consecutive pituitary adenoma
              patients was used. Patient variables/predictive features were
              limited to common patient characteristics to improve model
              implementation. Univariate and multivariate odds ratio analysis
              was performed to identify individual risk factors for common
              postoperative complications and to compare risk factors with
              model predictors. The study population was split into 300
              training/validation patients and 100 testing patients to train
              and evaluate four machine learning models using binary
              classification accuracy for predicting early outcomes.RESULTSThe
              study included a total of 400 patients. The mean $\pm$ SD patient
              age was 53.9 $\pm$ 16.3 years, 59.8\% of patients had
              nonfunctioning adenomas and 84.7\% had macroadenomas, and the
              mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.6 $\pm$ 7.8 (58.0\% obesity
              rate). Multivariate odds ratio analysis demonstrated that age <
              40 years was associated with a 2.86 greater odds of postoperative
              diabetes insipidus and that nonobese patients (BMI < 30) were 2.2
              times more likely to develop postoperative hyponatremia. Using
              broad criteria for a poor early postoperative outcome-major
              medical and early surgical complications, extended length of
              stay, emergency department admission, inpatient readmission, and
              death-31.0\% of patients met criteria for a poor early outcome.
              After model training, a logistic regression model with elastic
              net (LR-EN) regularization best predicted early postoperative
              outcomes of pituitary adenoma surgery on the 100-patient testing
              set-sensitivity 68.0\%, specificity 93.3\%, overall accuracy
              87.0\%. The receiver operating characteristic and
              precision-recall curves for the LR-EN model had areas under the
              curve of 82.7 and 69.5, respectively. The most important
              predictive variables were lowest perioperative sodium, age, BMI,
              highest perioperative sodium, and Cushing's
              disease.CONCLUSIONSEarly postoperative outcomes of pituitary
              adenoma surgery can be predicted with 87\% accuracy using a
              machine learning approach. These results provide insight into how

              approach. Various studies have compared the outcomes from

              have been limited by substantial differences in the patient
              populations receiving each approach. In this study we compare
              outcomes of open and endoscopic techniques and use propensity
              score matching to control for these differences in the patient
              populations. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study including
              all patients > 18 years old receiving primary surgery for
              malignant sinonasal or skull base tumors at our institution from
              2002 to 2013. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients met
              criteria; 82 received endoscopic-only surgery, and 42 had an open
              component to their approach. There was an 86\% 3-year overall
              survival and a 74\% disease-free survival. Without controlling
              for differences in the groups, the endoscopic patients fared

              develop a new road map for cytoreductive surgery. Design,
              Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, multicenter cohort
              study included a development cohort from the University of
              California, San Francisco (761 patients diagnosed from January 1,
              1997, through December 31, 2017, with 9.6 years of follow-up) and
              validation cohorts from the Mayo Clinic (107 patients diagnosed
              from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, with 5.7 years
              of follow-up) and the Cleveland Clinic's Ohio Brain Tumor Study
              (99 patients with data collected from January 1, 2008, through
              December 31, 2011, with a median follow-up of 10.9 months). Image
              accessors were blinded to patient groupings. Eligible patients
              underwent surgical resection for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and
              had available survival, molecular, and clinical data and
              preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance images. Data
              were analyzed from November 15, 2018, to March 15, 2019. Main
              Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival. Results: Among the 761
              patients included in the development cohort (468 [61.5\%] men;
              median age, 60 [interquartile range, 51.6-67.7] years), younger
              patients with IDH-wild-type tumors and aggressive resection of CE
              and NCE tumors had survival similar to that of patients with
              IDH-mutant tumors (median overall survival [OS], 37.3 [95\% CI,
              31.6-70.7] months). Younger patients with IDH-wild-type tumors
              and reduction of CE tumor but residual NCE tumors fared worse
              (median OS, 16.5 [95\% CI, 14.7-18.3] months). Older patients
              with IDH-wild-type tumors benefited from reduction of CE tumor
              (median OS, 12.4 [95\% CI, 11.4-14.0] months). The results were
              validated in the 2 external cohorts. The association between
              aggressive CE and NCE in patients with IDH-wild-type tumors was
              not attenuated by the methylation status of the promoter region
              of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase.
              Conclusions and Relevance: This study confirms an association
              between maximal resection of CE tumor and OS in patients with
              glioblastoma across all subgroups. In addition, maximal resection
              of NCE tumor was associated with longer OS in younger patients,
              regardless of IDH status, and among patients with IDH-wild-type
              glioblastoma regardless of the methylation status of the promoter
              region of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA
              methyltransferase. These conclusions may help reassess surgical
              strategies for individual patients with newly diagnosed

              outcomes in adults with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II
              low-grade gliomas (LGG). However, recent studies demonstrate that
              LGGs bearing a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)
              gene are a distinct molecular and clinical entity. It remains
              unclear whether maximizing EOR confers an equivalent clinical
              benefit in IDH mutated (mtIDH) and IDH wild-type (wtIDH) LGGs.
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of EOR on malignant
              progression-free survival (MPFS) and overall survival (OS) in
              mtIDH and wtIDH LGGs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
              review of 74 patients with WHO grade II gliomas and known IDH
              mutational status undergoing resection at a single institution.
              EOR was assessed with quantitative 3-dimensional volumetric
              analysis. The effect of predictor variables on MPFS and OS was
              analyzed with Cox regression models and the Kaplan-Meier method.
              RESULTS: Fifty-two (70\%) mtIDH patients and 22 (30\%) wtIDH
              patients were included. Median preoperative tumor volume was 37.4
              cm3; median EOR of 57.6\% was achieved. Univariate Cox regression
              analysis confirmed EOR as a prognostic factor for the entire
              cohort. However, stratifying by IDH status demonstrates that
              greater EOR independently prolonged MPFS and OS for wtIDH
              patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.002 [95\% confidence interval
              \{CI\} 0.000-0.074] and HR = 0.001 [95\% CI 0.00-0.108],
              respectively), but not for mtIDH patients (HR = 0.84 [95\% CI
              0.17-4.13] and HR = 2.99 [95\% CI 0.15-61.66], respectively).
              CONCLUSION: Increasing EOR confers oncologic and survival
              benefits in IDH1 wtLGGs, but the impact on IDH1 mtLGGs requires
              further study.",

              oligodendrogliomas, the role of maximal tumor surgical resection
              remains unclear, with early retrospective series limited by lack
              of molecular classification or appropriate control groups.
              METHODS: The characteristics, management, and overall survival
              (OS) of patients $\geq$20 years old presenting with
              histology-proven WHO grade II 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas
              during 2010-2016 were evaluated using the National Cancer
              Database and validated using multi-institutional data. Patients
              were stratified by watchful waiting (biopsy only) versus surgical
              resection. OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and
              risk-adjusted proportional hazards. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety
              adults met inclusion criteria, of whom 79.0\% (n = 466) underwent
              surgical resection. Of patient and tumor characteristics, younger
              patients were more likely to be resected. Achieving gross total
              resection (GTR; n = 320) was significantly associated with
              smaller tumors, management at integrated network cancer programs
              (vs community cancer programs), and Medicare insurance (as
              compared with no, private, or Medicaid/other government
              insurance) and independent of other patient or tumor
              characteristics. In risk-adjusted analyses, GTR, but not subtotal
              resection (STR), demonstrated improved OS (vs biopsy only: hazard
              ratio 0.28, 95\% CI: 0.09-0.85, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: WHO grade
              II 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas amenable to resection
              demonstrated improved OS with GTR, but not STR, compared with
              biopsy-only watchful waiting. The OS benefits of GTR were
              independent of age, tumor size, or tumor location.
              Medicare-insured and integrated network cancer program patients

              and a new pseudo-hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) recoloring
              methodology. To quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of our
              approach, we use modularized assessment of diagnostic accuracy
              beyond cancer/non-cancer determination and neuropathologist
              confidence for SRH images contrasted to H\&E-stained frozen and
              formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Our

              improved diagnosis can be achieved if full SRS information is
              used. In summary, our findings show that pseudo-H\&E recolored
              SRS images in combination with lipid and protein chemical
              information can maximize the use of SRS during intraoperative

              experts in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle,
              estimating ejection fraction and assessing cardiomyopathy.
              Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments
              the left ventricle with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92,
              predicts ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 4.1\%
              and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection
              fraction (area under the curve of 0.97). In an external dataset
              from another healthcare system, EchoNet-Dynamic predicts the
              ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 6.0\% and
              classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an
              area under the curve of 0.96. Prospective evaluation with
              repeated human measurements confirms that the model has variance

              follow-up was 35.4 months (95\% CI 1.0-56.7). Contrast-enhancing
              tumour was resected completely in 90 (65\%) of 139 patients
              assigned 5-aminolevulinic acid compared with 47 (36\%) of 131
              assigned white light (difference between groups 29\% [95\% CI
              17-40], p<0.0001). Patients allocated 5-aminolevulinic acid had
              higher 6-month progression free survival than did those allocated
              white light (41.0\% [32.8-49.2] vs 21.1\% [14.0-28.2]; difference
              between groups 19.9\% [9.1-30.7], p=0.0003, Z test). Groups did
              not differ in the frequency of severe adverse events or adverse
              events in any organ system class reported within 7 days after
              surgery. INTERPRETATION: Tumour fluorescence derived from
              5-aminolevulinic acid enables more complete resections of
              contrast-enhancing tumour, leading to improved progression-free
              survival in patients with malignant glioma.",

               demonstrating promising performance in various applications, we
               observe that existing deep clustering algorithms either do not
               well take advantage of convolutional neural networks or do not
               considerably preserve the local structure of data generating
               distribution in the learned feature space. To address this
               issue, we propose a deep convolutional embedded clustering
               algorithm in this paper. Specifically, we develop a
               convolutional autoencoders structure to learn embedded features
               in an end-to-end way. Then, a clustering oriented loss is
               directly built on embedded features to jointly perform feature
               refinement and cluster assignment. To avoid feature space being
               distorted by the clustering loss, we keep the decoder remained
               which can preserve local structure of data in feature space. In
               sum, we simultaneously minimize the reconstruction loss of
               convolutional autoencoders and the clustering loss. The
               resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by
               mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation.
               Experiments on benchmark datasets empirically validate the power

               treat cancer patients. However, the gigapixel resolution of
               Whole Slide Histopathological Images (WSIs) makes traditional
               survival models computationally impossible. These models usually
               adopt manually labeled discriminative patches from region of
               interests (ROIs) and are unable to directly learn discriminative
               patches from WSIs. We argue that only a small set of patches
               cannot fully represent the patients survival status due to the
               heterogeneity of tumor. Another challenge is that survival
               prediction usually comes with insufficient training patient
               samples. In this paper, we propose an effective Whole Slide
               Histopathological Images Survival Analysis framework (WSISA) to
               overcome above challenges. To exploit survival-discriminative
               patterns from WSIs, we first extract hundreds of patches from
               each WSI by adaptive sampling and then group these images into
               different clusters. Then we propose to train an aggregation
               model to make patient-level predictions based on cluster-level
               Deep Convolutional Survival (DeepConvSurv) prediction results.
               Different from existing state-of-the-arts image-based survival
               models which extract features using some patches from small
               regions of WSIs, the proposed framework can efficiently exploit
               and utilize all discriminative patterns in WSIs to predict
               patients survival status. To the best of our knowledge, this has
               not been shown before. We apply our method to the survival
               predictions of glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer using three
               datasets. Results demonstrate the proposed framework can
               significantly improve the prediction performance compared with

              over a 15-year period (2002-2017) with this approach. Patient
              outcomes, including cranial nerve function, tumor control, and
              surgical complications were recorded. RESULTS: The authors
              identified 50 patients who underwent subtotal resection via
              frontotemporal craniotomy concurrently with decompression of the
              cavernous sinus and ipsilateral optic nerve. Of these, 25 (50\%)
              underwent adjuvant radiation to the remaining tumor within the
              cavernous sinus. Patients most commonly presented with a cranial
              nerve (CN) palsy involving CN III-VI (70\%), a visual deficit
              (62\%), headaches (52\%), or proptosis (44\%). Thirty-five
              patients had cranial nerve deficits preoperatively. In 52\% of
              these cases, the neuropathy improved postoperatively; it remained
              stable in 46\%; and it worsened in only 2\%. Similarly, 97\% of
              preoperative visual deficits either improved or were stable
              postoperatively. Notably, 12 new cranial nerve deficits occurred
              postoperatively in 10 patients. Of these, half were transient and
              ultimately resolved. Finally, radiographic recurrence was noted
              in 5 patients (10\%), with a median time to recurrence of 4.6
              years. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of cavernous sinus meningiomas
              using surgical decompression with or without adjuvant radiation
              is an effective oncological strategy, achieving excellent tumor
              control rates with low risk of neurological morbidity.",

              Retrospective review was performed for transsphenoidal resections
              of pituitary adenomas from July 2012 to September 2016. Total
              cost, subcategory costs, and potential cost drivers were
              evaluated. RESULTS: There were 272 patients (mean age 51.5 years
              $\pm$ 17.7, 45.6\% male) with mean length of stay of 4 days $\pm$
              4 evaluated. Total costs included facility utilization (60\%),
              physician professional fees (16\%), pharmacy (11\%), supplies and
              implants (7\%), laboratory studies (5\%), and imaging (1\%).
              Facility costs were driven by neurocritical care unit (30.7\%),
              neurosurgical operating room (16.6\%), and neurosurgical floor
              (11.2\%) costs. Multivariable linear regression, after adjusting
              for length of stay and American Society of Anesthesiologists
              grade, showed that overall cost was heavily influenced by
              facility utilization ($\rho$ = 0.98, P = 0.001), pharmacy ($\rho$
              = 0.71, P = 0.001), supplies and implants ($\rho$ = 0.51, P =
              0.0001), imaging ($\rho$ = 0.51, P = 0.0001), and laboratory
              ($\rho$ = 0.79, P = 0.001) costs. The top 10 outlier patients
              accounted for 18.7\% of total costs (mean cost for all patients
              0.24\% $\pm$ 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the
              importance of facility utilization and pharmaceutical,
              supply/implant, imaging, and laboratory costs as overall cost
              drivers during transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection.
              Facility utilization was a stronger cost driver than any other
              aspect of care. Strategies to mitigate cost include stratifying
              low-risk patients to an intermediate care unit and reducing

              undergoing 1000 vestibular schwannoma operations at Nordstadt's
              neurosurgical department from 1978 to 1993. RESULTS: By the
              suboccipital transmeatal approach, 979 tumors were completely
              removed; in 21 cases, deliberate partial removal was performed
              either in severely ill patients for decompression of the brain

              Thirty-nine ONB patients who underwent surgical resection at our
              institution from 1996 to 2017 were retrospectively identified.
              Univariate, multivariate, and survival analysis were calculated
              using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier log-rank. Results
              Median follow-up time was 59 months (range: 5.2-236 months). The
              median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for
              the entire cohort were 15 and 7.6 years, respectively. The 5-year
              cumulative OS and DFS were 83 and 72\%, respectively. The 5-year
              OS for low Hyams grade (LHG) versus high Hyams grade (HHG) was 95

              (TSS) in patients with Cushing disease (CD) with no visible
              adenoma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Between
              January 1988 and October 2010, 183 patients with CD underwent TSS
              at Toranomon Hospital. We retrospectively analyzed data in 18
              patients without visible adenomas on MRI and compared them with
              106 patients with microadenomas. RESULTS: Of 106 patients with
              MRI-visible microadenomas, postoperative remission was achieved
              in 104 patients (98.1\%) and recurrence of CD was observed in 4
              patients (3.8\%) during a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Of the 18
              patients with negative MRI, postoperative remission was achieved
              in 0 of the 3 patients with negative inferior petrosal sinus
              sampling (IPSS), in 50\% of those with positive IPSS (7 of 14
              patients), and in 1 patient with inconclusive IPSS. No disease
              recurrence has been observed during a mean follow-up of 3.3 years
              in the 8 patients with remission, and no tumor has emerged on MRI
              in 10 patients with failed surgery during a mean follow-up of 4.2
              years. No major perioperative complications, including
              hypopituitarism, occurred in this series. CONCLUSIONS: When the
              pituitary origin of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion is
              established by IPSS in patients with normal MRI findings, we
              recommend TSS as the first-line treatment for CD, although chance
              of surgical cure (50\% in this series) is lower than that of
              MRI-visible microadenomas. In contrast, other therapeutic options

              progression-free survival (PFS) in pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE:
              To identify these factors in the pediatric population. METHODS:
              We retrospectively reviewed institutional databases evaluating
              all patients $\leq$21 years with high-grade glioma treated
              between 1988 and 2010. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank
              statistics were used to compare groups univariately. Multivariate
              analyses were completed using Cox proportional hazards regression
              models. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were identified with a
              median age of 11 years. Median OS was 1.7 years, and median PFS
              was 272 days. Location was significant for OS (P < .001).
              Patients with gross total resection (GTR) had a median OS of 3.4
              years vs 1.6 years for subtotal resection and 1.3 years for
              biopsy patients (P < .001). Female patients had improved OS (P =
              .01). Female patients with GTR had a mean OS of 8.1 years vs 2.4
              years for male patients with GTR and 1.4 years for all other
              female patients and male patients (P = .001). PFS favored
              patients $\leq$3 and $\geq$13 years and females (P = .003 and
              .001). CONCLUSION: OS was significantly correlated with the
              location of the tumor and the extent of resection. GTR
              significantly improved overall survival for both glioblastoma
              multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma patients, and female

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is one of the
              deadliest central nervous system tumours of childhood, with a
              median overall survival of less than 12 months.
              Convection-enhanced delivery has been proposed as a means to
              efficiently deliver therapeutic agents directly into the
              brainstem while minimising systemic exposure and associated toxic
              effects. We did this study to evaluate the safety of
              convection-enhanced delivery of a radioimmunotherapy agent
              targeting the glioma-associated B7-H3 antigen in children with
              diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. METHODS: We did a phase 1,
              single-arm, single-centre, dose-escalation study at the Memorial
              Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Eligible
              patients were aged 3-21 years and had diffuse intrinsic pontine
              glioma as diagnosed by consensus of a multidisciplinary
              paediatric neuro-oncology team; a Lansky (patients <16 years of
              age) or Karnofsky (patients $\geq$16 years) performance score of
              at least 50 at study entry; a minimum weight of 8 kg; and had
              completed external beam radiation therapy (54·0-59·4 Gy at 1·8 Gy
              per fraction over 30-33 fractions) at least 4 weeks but no more
              than 14 weeks before enrolment. Seven dose-escalation cohorts
              were planned based on standard 3 + 3 rules: patients received a
              single infusion of 9·25, 18·5, 27·75, 37, 92·5, 120·25, or 148
              MBq, respectively, at a concentration of about 37 MBq/mL by
              convection-enhanced delivery of the radiolabelled antibody
              [124I]-8H9. The primary endpoint was identification of the
              maximum tolerated dose. The analysis of the primary endpoint was
              done in the per-protocol population (patients who received the
              full planned dose of treatment), and all patients who received
              any dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis.
              This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
              NCT01502917, and is ongoing with an expanded cohort. FINDINGS:
              From April 5, 2012, to Oct 8, 2016, 28 children were enrolled and
              treated in the trial, of whom 25 were evaluable for the primary
              endpoint. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached as no
              dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One (4\%) of 28 patients
              had treatment-related transient grade 3 hemiparesis and one (4\%)
              had grade 3 skin infection. No treatment-related grade 4 adverse
              events or deaths occurred. Estimated volumes of distribution (Vd)
              were linearly dependent on volumes of infusion (Vi) and ranged
              from 1·5 to 20·1 cm3, with a mean Vd/Vi ratio of 3·4 (SD 1·2).
              The mean lesion absorbed dose was 0·39 Gy/MBq 124I (SD 0·20).
              Systemic exposure was negligible, with an average lesion-to-whole
              body ratio of radiation absorbed dose higher than 1200.
              INTERPRETATION: Convection-enhanced delivery in the brainstem of
              children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma who have
              previously received radiation therapy seems to be a rational and
              safe therapeutic strategy. PET-based dosimetry of the
              radiolabelled antibody [124I]-8H9 validated the principle of
              using convection-enhanced delivery in the brain to achieve high
              intra-lesional dosing with negligible systemic exposure. This
              therapeutic strategy warrants further development for children
              with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. FUNDING: National

              (ACVR1)-G328V (mACVR1), was developed for testing an

              mouse model of mACVR1 brainstem glioma. Histology was used to
              characterize and validate the model. We performed RNA-sequencing
              analysis on neurospheres harboring mACVR1. mACVR1 neurospheres
              were implanted into the pons of immune-competent mice to test the
              therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of immune-stimulatory gene
              therapy using adenoviruses expressing thymidine kinase (TK) and
              fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L). mACVR1 neurospheres
              expressing the surrogate tumor antigen ovalbumin were generated
              to investigate whether TK/Flt3L treatment induces the recruitment
              of tumor antigen-specific T cells. RESULTS: Histologic analysis
              of mACVR1 tumors indicates that they are localized in the
              brainstem and have increased downstream signaling of bone
              morphogenetic pathway as demonstrated by increased
              phospho-smad1/5 and Id1 levels. Transcriptome analysis of mACVR1
              neurosphere identified an increase in the TGF$\beta$ signaling
              pathway and the regulation of cell differentiation. Adenoviral
              delivery of TK/Flt3L in mice bearing brainstem gliomas resulted
              in antitumor immunity, recruitment of antitumor-specific T cells,

              We retrospectively reviewed the Brain Tumor Registry of Japan
              database. Among 7341 patients diagnosed with intracranial
              meningioma during 2001-2008, we identified 406 patients with WHO
              grade I meningioma treated with STR as initial treatment. Data on
              progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed for their relevance
              to clinical factors including age, sex, tumor location and size,
              presence of preoperative symptoms, and AR. RESULTS: AR was
              administered for 73 patients (18.0\%). Regrowth occurred in 90
              cases (22.2\%) during the median follow-up period of 6.0 years
              (interquartile range, 2.7-7.7 years). Multivariate Cox regression
              analysis of the entire cohort showed that no AR was associated
              with significantly shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.52, 95\%
              confidence interval [CI] 1.33-5.42, p = 0.004). The therapeutic
              effect of AR was confirmed for skull base, but not non-skull
              base, meningiomas (p = 0.003 and 0.69, respectively). Propensity
              score matching analysis balanced the influence of confounding
              factors to generate AR+ and AR- cohorts of 73 patients each. PFS
              was significantly longer in the AR+ cohort than in the AR- cohort
              (HR 3.46, 95\% CI 1.53-8.59, p = 0.003). Subgroup analysis
              demonstrated the favorable effect of AR only for skull base
              meningiomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that AR improves
              tumor control after STR in WHO grade I meningiomas. However, this
              beneficial effect might be limited to skull base meningiomas.",

              experience cognitive dysfunctions due to hormonal imbalance or
              suprasellar tumor extension displacing neural structures.
              Progressively enlarging or symptomatic nonfunctioning pituitary
              adenomas with suprasellar extension are frequently resected. The
              literature on neurocognitive performance surrounding resection of
              these lesions is sparse. METHODS: A prospective matched-control
              study was conducted to investigate the impact of nonfunctioning
              pituitary adenomas with suprasellar extension on preoperative and
              postoperative cognitive performance. Controls were matched for
              age, sex, handedness, education, and profession. The
              neurocognitive test battery included perceptual speed, executive
              function, visual-spatial and verbal working memory, short- and
              long-term memory, verbal fluency, fluid intelligence, anxiety,
              and depression. RESULTS: Ten patients and 10 healthy controls
              were matched. Median suprasellar tumor extension scored 8mm,
              compression of frontal lobe parenchyma was present in all cases.
              Median sagittal tumor diameter was 21mm. Preoperatively, patients
              scored worse in perceptual speed and short-term memory tasks. All
              patients underwent surgical resection either through a
              transnasal, transsphenoidal approach or a supraorbital
              frontolateral keyhole approach. The short-term memory deficit
              disappeared one week after surgery. Perceptual speed recovered
              within two months after surgical therapy. None of the patients
              experienced worsening of cognitive function. Routine
              postoperative imaging at six months did not reveal displacement
              of neural structures or surgery-related complications in any of
              the patients. CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from nonfunctioning
              pituitary adenomas with suprasellar extension may experience
              preoperative impairments in some neurocognitive domains that
              resolve within two months after surgery. The risk for cognitive
              deterioration with surgery appears to be low.",

              cavernous sinus meningiomas who were treated either with surgery
              and radiotherapy (RT) or with RT alone. This retrospective review
              was undertaken to compare long-term efficacy and morbidity of RT
              with or without previous surgery versus complete, aggressive
              surgical removal. METHODS: Between 1980 and 1997, we performed a
              retrospective study of 31 patients harboring cavernous sinus
              meningiomas. The patient group comprised 25 women and 6 men.
              Patients were divided into two therapeutic categories: patients
              treated with surgery and RT (Group I, 17 patients) and patients
              treated with RT alone (Group II, 14 patients). Twenty-five
              patients (14 in Group I and 11 in Group II) were treated for
              primary tumors, and 6 patients (3 in Group I and 3 in Group II)
              were treated for recurrent disease. All three patients who were
              treated by RT alone at the time of recurrent disease had had
              previous surgery as initial treatment. Tumor control, treatment
              morbidity, and functional outcomes were evaluated for all
              patients. Twenty-eight patients were alive at the time of
              analysis, with a median follow-up period of 6.1 years. RESULTS:
              The progression-free survival rate was 92.8\% at 10-year
              follow-up. Only two patients exhibited tumor progression after
              initial treatment. One of the patients who experienced tumor
              regrowth 4 years after surgery and RT benefited from additional
              conventional external beam radiation, and this patient exhibited
              no evidence of tumor progression at the last follow-up
              examination 6 years later. Two patients experienced cranial nerve
              impairment after surgery, and no patients developed late
              radiation toxicity. Follow-up status as measured by the Karnofsky
              Performance Scale deteriorated in 7\% of patients and was the
              same or improved in 93\% of patients. CONCLUSION: The results of
              combined surgery and RT or RT alone indicated a high rate of
              tumor control and a low risk of complications. Complete
              aggressive surgical removal of cavernous sinus meningiomas is
              associated with an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality
              and does not demonstrate a better rate of tumor control.
              Conventional external beam radiation seems to be an efficient and
              safe initial or adjuvant treatment of these lesions, and these
              findings should serve as a basis for evaluating new alternatives
              such as radiosurgery or stereotactic RT.",

              (TV). The survey is constructed to obtain surgeons' idea of
              assessed risk when sacrificing specific venous structures during
              posterior fossa surgery. They were asked how they prep for
              surgery, number of operations conducted, and their basis of
              knowledge. Collected data were mainly qualitative and analyzed
              with a mixed-method approach. A mean absolute deviation was
              calculated measuring rate of disagreement for a given
              substructure. Consensus existed among the participating surgeons

              the main trunk of the SPV, one of the SS' and or a total

              between surgical tumor removal goal and patient outcomes in a
              prospective multicenter study. METHODS: Centrally adjudicated
              extent of tumor resection (gross total resection [GTR] and
              subtotal resection [STR]) data were analyzed using standard
              univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: GTR was
              accomplished in 148 of 171 (86.5\%) patients with planned GTR and
              32 of 50 (64.0\%) patients with planned STR (P = .001).
              Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
              predictive value of GTR goal were 82.2, 43.9, 86.5, and 36.0\%,
              respectively. Knosp grade 0-2, first surgery, and being an
              experienced surgeon were associated with surgeons choosing GTR as
              the goal (P < .01). There was no association between surgical
              goal and presence of pituitary deficiency at 6 mo (P = .31).
              Tumor Knosp grade (P = .004) and size (P = .001) were stronger
              predictors of GTR than was surgical goal (P = .014). The most
              common site of residual tumor was the cavernous sinus (29 of 41

              poor predictor of actual tumor resection. A more aggressive

              tumors, although no high-quality evidence demonstrates superior
              patient outcomes with endoscopic surgery. The goal of this
              analysis was to compare these techniques in a prospective
              multicenter controlled study. METHODS: Extent of tumor resection
              was compared after endoscopic or microscopic transsphenoidal
              surgery in adults with nonfunctioning adenomas. The primary end
              point was gross-total tumor resection determined by postoperative
              MRI. Secondary end points included volumetric extent of tumor
              resection, pituitary hormone outcomes, and standard quality
              measures. RESULTS: Seven pituitary centers and 15 surgeons
              participated in the study. Of the 530 patients screened, 260 were
              enrolled (82 who underwent microscopic procedures, 177 who
              underwent endoscopic procedures, and 1 who cancelled surgery)
              between February 2015 and June 2017. Surgeons who used the
              microscopic technique were more experienced than the surgeons who
              used the endoscopic technique in terms of years in practice and
              number of transsphenoidal surgeries performed (p 0.2). New
              hormone deficiency was present at 6 months in 28.4\% (19/67) of
              the microscopic surgery patients and 9.7\% (14/145) of the
              endoscopic surgery patients (p < 0.001, OR 3.7, 95\% CI 1.7-7.7).
              Microscopic surgery cases were significantly shorter in duration
              than endoscopic surgery cases (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
              Experienced surgeons who performed microscopic surgery and less
              experienced surgeons who performed endoscopic surgery achieved
              similar extents of tumor resection and quality outcomes in
              patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. The endoscopic
              technique may be associated with lower rates of postoperative
              pituitary gland dysfunction. This study generally supports the
              transition to endoscopic pituitary surgery when the procedure is

              survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of cranial base
              chordomas. METHODS: A systematic MEDLINE search (1999-present)
              yielded 23 observational studies and 807 patients who fit
              inclusion criteria. The following analyses were performed: 1)
              Kaplan-Meier 5-year PFS and OS compared based on the extent of
              resection and type of adjuvant radiation therapy using the
              log-rank method; 2) a random-effects model comparing 5-year PFS
              with complete or incomplete resection; and 3) paired z-test
              comparisons of weighted average 5-year OS and PFS grouped by type
              of adjuvant radiation therapy. RESULTS: The weighted average
              follow-up was 53.6 months. The weighted average 5-year PFS and OS
              were 50.8\% and 78.4\%, respectively. Complete resection
              conferred a higher 5-year PFS than incomplete resection from the
              random effects model (mean difference in PFS 20.7\%; 95\% CI
              6.57\%-34.91\%). Patients with incomplete resection were 3.83
              times more likely to experience a recurrence (95\% CI 1.63-9.00)
              and 5.85 times more likely to die (95\% CI 1.40-24.5) at 5 years
              versus patients with complete resection. There was no difference
              in 5-year OS by type of adjuvant radiation, although 5-year PFS
              was lower in patients receiving Gamma Knife surgery relative to
              carbon ion radiotherapy (p = 0.042) on paired z-test. No survival
              difference occurred between radiation therapy techniques on
              Kaplan-Meier analysis of compiled patient data. CONCLUSIONS:
              Patients with complete resection of cranial base chordomas have a
              prolonged 5-year PFS and OS. Adjuvant proton-beam, carbon ion,

  abstract = "OPINION STATEMENT: Management of chordoma along the
              cranial-spinal axis is a major challenge for both skull base and
              spinal surgeons. Although chordoma remains a rare tumor,
              occurring in approximately 1 per 1 million individuals, its
              treatment poses several challenges. These tumors are generally
              poorly responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, leading to
              surgical resection as the mainstay of treatment. Due to anatomic
              constraints and unique challenges associated with each primary
              site of disease, gross total resection is often not feasible and
              is associated with high rates of morbidity. Additionally,
              chordoma is associated with high rates of recurrence due to the
              tumor's aggressive biologic features, and postoperative radiation
              is increasingly incorporated as a treatment option for these
              patients. Despite these challenges, modern-day surgical
              techniques in both skull base and spinal surgery have facilitated
              improved patient outcomes. For example, endoscopic endonasal
              techniques have become the mainstay in resection of skull base
              chordomas, improving the ability to achieve gross total
              resection, while reducing associated morbidity of open
              transfacial techniques. Resection of spinal chordomas has been
              facilitated by emerging techniques in preoperative imaging,
              intraoperative navigation, spinal reconstruction, and
              radiotherapy. Taken collectively, the treatment of chordoma
              affecting the skull base and spinal requires a multidisciplinary
              team of surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists
              who specialize in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenoma (PA) consistency, or texture, is an
              important intraoperative characteristic that may dictate
              operative dissection techniques and/or instruments used for tumor
              removal during endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs). The impact
              of PA consistency on surgical outcomes has yet to be elucidated.
              METHODS: The authors developed an objective 5-point grading scale
              for PA consistency based on intraoperative characteristics,
              including ease of tumor debulking, manipulation, and instrument
              selection, ranging from cystic/hemorrhagic tumors (grade 1) to
              calcified tumors (grade 5). The proposed grading system was
              prospectively assessed in 306 consecutive patients who underwent
              an EEA for PAs, and who were subsequently analyzed for
              associations with surgical outcomes, including extent of
              resection (EOR) and complication profiles. RESULTS: Institutional
              database review identified 306 patients who underwent
              intraoperative assessment of PA consistency, of which 96\% were
              macroadenomas, 70\% had suprasellar extension, and 44\% had
              cavernous sinus invasion (CSI). There were 214 (69.9\%)
              nonfunctional PAs and 92 functional PAs (31.1\%). Distribution of
              scores included 15 grade 1 tumors (4.9\%), 112 grade 2 tumors
              (36.6\%), 125 grade 3 tumors (40.8\%), 52 grade 4 tumors (17\%),
              and 2 grade 5 tumors (0.7\%). Compared to grade 1/2 and grade 3
              PAs, grade 4/5 PAs were significantly larger (22.5 vs 26.6 vs
              27.4 mm, p < 0.01), more likely to exhibit CSI (39\% vs 42\% vs
              59\%, p < 0.05), and trended toward nonfunctionality (67\% vs
              68\% vs 82\%, p = 0.086). Although there was no association
              between PA consistency and preoperative headaches or visual
              dysfunction, grade 4/5 PAs trended toward preoperative (p =
              0.058) and postoperative panhypopituitarism (p = 0.066). Patients
              with preoperative visual dysfunction experienced greater
              improvement if they had a grade 1/2 PA (p < 0.05). Intraoperative
              CSF leaks were noted in 32\% of cases and were more common with
              higher-consistency-grade tumors (p = 0.048), although this
              difference did not translate to postoperative CSF leaks.
              Gross-total resection (\%) was more likely with lower PA
              consistency score as follows: grade 1/2 (60\%), grade 3 (50\%),
              grade 4/5 (44\%; p = 0.045). Extracapsular techniques were almost
              exclusively performed in grade 4/5 PAs. Assignment of scores
              showed low variance and high reproducibility, with an intraclass
              correlation coefficient of 0.905 (95\% CI 0.815-0.958),
              indicating excellent interrater reliability. CONCLUSIONS: These
              findings demonstrate clinical validity of the proposed
              intraoperative grading scale with respect to PA subtype,
              neuroimaging features, EOR, and endocrine complications. Future
              studies will assess the relation of PA consistency to
              preoperative MRI findings to accurately predict consistency,
              thereby allowing the surgeon to tailor the exposure and prepare
              for varying resection strategies.",

              relationship between Simpson resection grade and meningioma
              recurrence in their institutional experience. METHODS: This study
              is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent resection
              of a WHO grade I intracranial meningioma at the authors'
              institution from 2007 to 2017. Binary logistic regression
              analysis was used to assess for predictors of Simpson grade IV
              resection and postoperative neurological morbidity. Cox
              multivariate analysis was used to assess for predictors of tumor
              recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to
              assess and compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) of Simpson
              resection grades, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 492 patients
              with evaluable data were included for analysis, including 394
              women (80.1\%) and 98 men (19.9\%) with a mean (SD) age of 58.7
              (12.8) years. The tumors were most commonly located at the skull
              base (n = 302; 61.4\%) or the convexity/parasagittal region (n =
              139; 28.3\%). The median (IQR) tumor volume was 6.8 (14.3) cm3.
              Simpson grade I, II, III, or IV resection was achieved in 105
              (21.3\%), 155 (31.5\%), 52 (10.6\%), and 180 (36.6\%) patients,
              respectively. Sixty-three of 180 patients (35.0\%) with Simpson
              grade IV resection were treated with adjuvant radiosurgery. In
              the multivariate analysis, increasing largest tumor dimension (p
              < 0.01) and sinus invasion (p < 0.01) predicted Simpson grade IV
              resection, whereas skull base location predicted neurological
              morbidity (p = 0.02). Tumor recurrence occurred in 63 patients
              (12.8\%) at a median (IQR) of 36 (40.3) months from surgery.
              Simpson grade I resection resulted in superior RFS compared with
              Simpson grade II resection (p = 0.02), Simpson grade III
              resection (p = 0.01), and Simpson grade IV resection with
              adjuvant radiosurgery (p = 0.01) or without adjuvant radiosurgery
              (p < 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, Simpson grade I
              resection was independently associated with no tumor recurrence
              (p = 0.04). Simpson grade II and III resections resulted in
              superior RFS compared with Simpson grade IV resection without
              adjuvant radiosurgery (p < 0.01) but similar RFS compared with
              Simpson grade IV resection with adjuvant radiosurgery (p = 0.82).
              Simpson grade IV resection with adjuvant radiosurgery resulted in
              superior RFS compared with Simpson grade IV resection without
              adjuvant radiosurgery (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The Simpson
              resection grading scale continues to hold substantial prognostic
              value in the modern neurosurgical era. When feasible, Simpson
              grade I resection should remain the goal of intracranial
              meningioma surgery. Simpson grade IV resection with adjuvant

              patterns and histopathologic characteristics between skull base

              METHODS: Retrospective data of 382 patients with SBMs and 200
              patients with NSBMs who underwent primary microsurgical resection
              between January 1995 and December 2016 were analyzed. Data
              related to clinical history, neuroimaging, surgical technique,
              and follow-up were reviewed. A separate prospective cohort of 78
              meningiomas operated on from June 2016 to July 2017 was analyzed
              (World Health Organization [WHO] grade and Ki-67 proliferation
              index) for biologic comparison. RESULTS: Skull base location, WHO
              grade II tumor, and subtotal resection were independent
              predictors of unfavorable outcome. The overall tumor progression
              rate in the SBM group (33\%) was higher than in the NSBM group
              (19.7\%) (P = 0.006) (mean follow-up period, 51 months). The
              3-year, 5-year, and 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) was
              78\%, 60\%, and 45\% in the SBM group, whereas it was 90\%, 80\%,
              and 53\% in the NSBM group, respectively. Interestingly, there
              was no difference in the median PFS after 10 years of follow-up
              (SBMs 210 months vs. NSBM 212 months, P = 0.93). In the

  abstract = "OBJECT: Despite a favorable outcome for most patients with WHO
              Grade I meningiomas, a subset of these patients will have
              recurrent or progressive disease that advances to a higher grade
              and requires increasingly aggressive therapy. The goal of this
              study was to identify clinical characteristics associated with
              the recurrence of benign meningiomas and their acceleration to
              atypical and malignant histological types. METHODS: Records of
              216 patients with WHO Grade I, II, or III meningioma that were
              initially treated between 1965 and 2001 were retrospectively
              reviewed. Median follow-up was 7.2 years. RESULTS: Patients with
              non-skull base cranial meningiomas (82 of 105 [78\%]) were more
              likely to have undergone a gross-total resection than patients
              with skull base meningiomas (32 of 78 [41\%]; p < 0.001).
              Consequently, patients with Grade I non-skull base cranial
              meningiomas had better 5-year recurrence-free survival (69\%)
              than patients with Grade I skull base meningiomas (56\%) or Grade
              II or III tumors at any site (50\%; p = 0.005). Unexpectedly,
              patients with non-skull base tumors who experienced a recurrence
              (8 of 22 [36\%]) were more likely than patients with skull base
              tumors (1 of 19 [5\%]) to have a higher grade tumor at recurrence
              (p = 0.024). Furthermore, the median MIB-1 labeling index of
              Grade I non-skull base cranial meningiomas (2.60\%) was
              significantly higher than that of Grade I skull base tumors
              (1.35\%; p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Cranial meningiomas that occur
              outside of the skull base are more likely to have a higher MIB-1
              labeling index and recur with a higher grade than those within
              the skull base, suggesting that non-skull base cranial tumors may
              have a more aggressive biology than skull base tumors.",

              SETTING: Tertiary neurotologic referral center. PATIENTS: Four
              hundred patients with a vestibular schwannoma of 2.5 cm or
              greater in maximum diameter undergoing translabyrinthine
              microsurgical resection from 2001 to 2011. There were 325 gross
              total resections (GTR), 44 near total resections (NTR), and 31
              subtotal resections (STR), with an overall mean tumor size of 3.2
              cm (standard deviation, 0.7). INTERVENTION(S): Translabyrinthine
              surgical tumor resection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: House-Brackmann
              (H-B) facial nerve grade postoperatively and at 1 year, tumor
              regrowth/recurrence ($\geq$2 mm), additional treatment, and
              complications. RESULTS: Higher rates of H-B facial nerve Grades I
              and II were achieved at both the postoperative and 1-year
              follow-ups in the NTR (78\%, 97\%) and STR (71\%, 96\%) groups
              compared with GTR (53\%, 77\%) (p $\leq$ 0.001). Eye treatment,

              NTR and STR (8\% and 21\%, respectively, p $\leq$ 0.04), with no
              other differences in complications. The NTR and STR groups had a
              significantly higher rate of regrowth than GTR resection (21\%

               labeling index correlating with tumor progression is
               controversial. We identified 24 consecutive pituitary adenomas

               clinical information, blocks, and slides for study.
               Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 revealed that the tumors without
               progression had a proliferation index of 0.41\% +/- 0.01\% (mean

              has been considered the gold standard for defining the surgical
              extent of resection for WHO grade I meningiomas. Since its
              introduction, the scale and its modifications have generated
              enormous controversy. The Simpson grade is based on an
              intraoperative visual assessment of resection, which is
              subjective and notoriously inaccurate. The majority of studies in
              which the grading system was used were performed before routine
              postoperative MRI surveillance was employed, rendering
              assessments of extent of resection and the definition of
              recurrence inconsistent. The infiltration and proliferation
              potential of tumor components such as hyperostotic bone and dural
              tail vary widely based on tumor location, as does the molecular
              biology of the tumor, rendering a universal scale for all
              meningiomas unfeasible. While extent of resection is clearly
              important at reducing recurrence rates, achieving the highest
              Simpson grade resection should not always be the goal of
              surgery.Donald Simpson's name and his scale deserve to be
              recognized and preserved in the historical pantheon of pioneering
              and transformative neurosurgical concepts. Nevertheless, his
              eponymous scale is no longer relevant in modern meningioma
              surgery. While his message of maximizing extent of resection and
              minimizing morbidity is still germane, a single measure using
              subjective criteria cannot be applied universally to all
              meningiomas, regardless of location. Meningioma surgery should be
              performed with the goal of achieving maximal safe resection,
              ideally guided by molecularly tagged fluorescent labeling and
              assessed using objective criteria, including postoperative MRI as

              extent of resection (Simpson Grade, SG) is widely used as a
              prognostic factor for recurrence. However, the validity of SG is
              still a matter of debate. In preoperative imaging,
              68Ga-DOTATATE/PET-CT has been shown to detect meningioma tissue
              even more sensitively than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
              OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Simpson grading within the framework
              of modern postoperative imaging techniques (MRI; PET-CT).
              METHODS: At first, patients with WHO grade I meningioma, surgical
              resection, and postoperative 68Ga-DOTATATE/PET-CT within 6 mo
              after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Second, an analogous
              prospective cohort of patients with WHO grade I meningioma was
              investigated by comparing SG after meningioma removal with
              postoperative MRI and 68Ga-DOTATATE/PET-CT within 6 mo after
              surgery. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were retrospectively
              analyzed. In total, 5/8 patients with SG-I and II resections
              showed tumor remnants according to postoperative PET-CT (SG
              62.5\% false negative). In the prospective cohort of 52 tumors,
              PET-CT displayed tracer uptake in 15/37 SG-I or II resections
              indicating unexpected tumor remnants (SG 40.5\% false negative).
              MRI was false negative in 7 of these 15 cases (MRI 18.9\% false
              negative) (P = .037). Discordant results according to PET-CT were
              more often found in convexity (40\%) and falcine (46.7\%)
              meningiomas than in skull base meningiomas (18.2\%). CONCLUSION:
              Intraoperative Simpson grading is at risk to underestimate tumor
              remnants, predominantly in grade I and II resections.
              Postoperative PET-CT improves detection rates compared to MRI.
              Prognostic impact of postoperative meningioma remnants according
              to PET-CT needs to be investigated prospectively.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) affect young patients
              with Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF-2) and cause very serious problems
              for hearing, facial expression, and brain stem function. Our
              objective was to determine a therapy concept for the right timing
              and indication of neurosurgical therapy. METHODS: In 1000
              consecutive VS resections, 120 tumors in 82 patients with NF-2
              were surgically treated by the same surgeon (MS) at the
              Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to
              1993. The mean age of the patients was 27.5 years. Sixty tumors
              were surgically treated in 41 male patients, and 60 tumors were
              surgically treated in 41 female patients. Bilateral tumor
              resection was performed in 38 patients (76 operations, after
              previous partial surgery in 15 cases elsewhere), and unilateral
              operations were performed in 44 patients, 5 of whom had undergone
              ipsi- or contralateral surgery that was performed elsewhere. The
              operative and clinical findings are evaluated and compared with
              the data of patients without NF-2. RESULTS: In 105 cases,
              complete tumor resections were achieved. In 15 cases, deliberate
              subtotal resections were performed. These were for brain stem
              decompression in 4 cases and for hearing preservation in the last
              hearing ear in 11 cases, with successful preservation in 8 of the
              11. Pre- and postoperative hearing rates were higher in male than
              in female patients (70\% in male versus 65\% in female patients
              before surgery and 40.5 versus 31\%, respectively, after
              surgery). Hearing was preserved in 29 of 81 ears (36\%). The rate
              of preservation was 24\% in cases of large tumors and 57\% in
              cases of small tumors (<30 mm). Twenty-one of 82 patients (26\%)
              were bilaterally deaf before surgery. Twenty-five patients had
              uni- or bilateral hearing after surgery (i.e., 41 \% of those
              with preoperative hearing or 30.5\% of the whole group). Anatomic
              facial nerve preservation was achieved in 85\%. The facial nerve
              was reconstructed intracranially at the cerebellopontine angle by
              sural grafting in 17 cases and by hypoglossal-facial reanimation
              in 5. Two deaths occurred 1 and 3 months postsurgically as a
              result of malignant tumor growth with brain stem dysfunction and
              respiratory problems. In summary, for patients with NF-2, the
              presentation ages are lower, tumor progression is faster, the
              chances of anatomic and functional nerve preservation are lower,
              the chances of good outcomes are best when surgery is performed
              early and when there is good preoperative hearing function, and
              the danger of sudden hearing loss is higher. The chances and
              danger often differ from side to side among individual patients.
              CONCLUSION: The indication and the timing of tumor resections are
              in some respects different from normal VS handling and are
              dependent on the tumor extension and related necessity of brain
              stem decompression and on the auditory function. As an optimal
              goal, completeness of resection with functional cochlear nerve
              preservation is formulated, and as an acceptable compromise,
              subtotal microsurgical resection with functional cochlear nerve
              preservation in the last hearing ear is suggested.",

              greatly expanded since the introduction of stereotactic
              radiosurgery. Optimal outcomes reflect long-term tumor control,
              preservation of cranial nerve function, and retention of quality
              of life. The authors review their 15-year experience. METHODS:
              Between 1987 and 2002, some 829 patients with VSs underwent gamma
              knife surgery (GKS). Dose selection, imaging, and dose planning
              techniques evolved between 1987 and 1992 but thereafter remained
              stable for 10 years. The average tumor volume was 2.5 cm3. The
              median margin dose to the tumor was 13 Gy (range 10-20 Gy). No
              patient sustained significant perioperative morbidity. The
              average duration of hospital stay was less than 1 day. Unchanged
              hearing preservation was possible in 50 to 77\% of patients (up
              to 90\% in those with intracanalicular tumors). Facial neuropathy
              risks were reduced to less than 1\%. Trigeminal symptoms were
              detected in less than 3\% of patients whose tumors reached the
              level of the trigeminal nerve. Tumor control rates at 10 years
              were 97\% (no additional treatment needed). CONCLUSIONS: Superior
              imaging, multiple isocenter volumetric conformal dose planning,
              and optimal precision and dose delivery contributed to the
              long-term success of GKS, including in those patients in whom
              initial microsurgery had failed. Gamma knife surgery provides a
              low risk, minimally invasive treatment option for patients with
              newly diagnosed or residual VS. Cranial nerve preservation and
              quality of life maintenance are possible in long-term follow up.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Label-free Raman-based imaging techniques create
              the possibility of bringing chemical and histologic data into the
              operation room. Relying on the intrinsic biochemical properties
              of tissues to generate image contrast and optical tissue
              sectioning, Raman-based imaging methods can be used to detect
              microscopic tumor infiltration and diagnose brain tumor subtypes.
              METHODS: Here, we review the application of three Raman-based
              imaging methods to neurosurgical oncology: Raman spectroscopy,
              coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, and
              stimulated Raman histology (SRH). RESULTS: Raman spectroscopy
              allows for chemical characterization of tissue and can
              differentiate normal and tumor-infiltrated tissue based on
              variations in macromolecule content, both ex vivo and in vivo. To
              improve signal-to-noise ratio compared to conventional Raman
              spectroscopy, a second pulsed excitation laser can be used to
              coherently drive the vibrational frequency of specific Raman
              active chemical bonds (i.e. symmetric stretching of -CH2 bonds).
              Coherent Raman imaging, including CARS and stimulated Raman
              scattering microscopy, has been shown to detect microscopic brain
              tumor infiltration in fresh brain tumor specimens with submicron
              image resolution. Advances in fiber-laser technology have allowed
              for the development of intraoperative SRH as well as artificial
              intelligence algorithms to facilitate interpretation of SRH
              images. With molecular diagnostics becoming an essential part of
              brain tumor classification, preliminary studies have demonstrated
              that Raman-based methods can be used to diagnose glioma molecular
              classes intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate
              how label-free Raman-based imaging methods can be used to improve
              the management of brain tumor patients by detecting tumor
              infiltration, guiding tumor biopsy/resection, and providing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Detection of glioma recurrence remains a challenge in
              modern neuro-oncology. Noninvasive radiographic imaging is unable
              to definitively differentiate true recurrence versus
              pseudoprogression. Even in biopsied tissue, it can be challenging
              to differentiate recurrent tumor and treatment effect. We
              hypothesized that intraoperative stimulated Raman histology (SRH)
              and deep neural networks can be used to improve the
              intraoperative detection of glioma recurrence. METHODS: We used
              fiber-laser-based SRH, a label-free, non-consumptive,
              high-resolution microscopy method (<60 secs per 1 x 1 mm2) to
              image a cohort of patients (n = 35) with suspected recurrent
              gliomas who underwent biopsy or resection. The SRH images were
              then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and
              develop an inference algorithm to detect viable recurrent glioma.
              Following network training, the performance of the CNN was tested
              for diagnostic accuracy in a retrospective cohort (n = 48).
              RESULTS: Using patch-level CNN predictions, the inference
              algorithm returned a single Bernoulli distribution for the
              probability of tumor recurrence for each surgical specimen or
              patient. The external SRH validation dataset consisted of 48
              patients (recurrent, 30; pseudoprogression, 18), and we achieved
              a diagnostic accuracy of 95.8\%. CONCLUSION: SRH with CNN-based
              diagnosis can be used to improve the intraoperative detection of
              glioma recurrence in near-real time. Our results provide insight
              into how optical imaging and computer vision can be combined to
              augment conventional diagnostic methods and improve the quality

              from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas database, and enrolled those
              who underwent surgical resection. We measured the impact of the
              extent of resection on survival time in subgroups classified by
              clinical characteristics. We found that gross total resection
              (GTR) was associated with longer survival times in the entire
              cohort, and each of the three molecular subtypes. Even after age
              stratification, there was no survival benefit from GTR in those
              with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) $\leq$ 80. In patients
              aged >45 years with a KPS >80, extensive resection resulted in
              longer survival times in isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutated

              2019. Results: We received 152 responses out of 2022 SNO members
              (7.5\% of membership). 88.8\% of respondents routinely order MT

              mostly unsustainable. Responding to the four major barriers in
              PALM service delivery that were identified in the first paper of
              this Series (workforce, infrastructure, education and training,
              and quality assurance), this second paper identifies potential
              solutions that can be applied in low-income and middle-income
              countries (LMICs). Increasing and retaining a quality PALM
              workforce requires access to mentorship and continuing
              professional development, task sharing, and the development of
              short-term visitor programmes. Opportunities to enhance the
              training of pathologists and allied PALM personnel by increasing
              and improving education provision must be explored and

              essential for providing personalized surgical treatment
              strategies. Intraoperative specimen interpretation can be
              challenging because of the wide range of skull base pathologies
              and lack of intraoperative pathology resources. OBJECTIVE: To
              develop an independent and parallel intraoperative workflow that
              can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor specimen analysis
              using label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence.
              METHODS: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, nonconsumptive,
              high-resolution microscopy method (<60 seconds per 1 $\times$ 1
              mm2), called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a
              consecutive, multicenter cohort of patients with skull base
              tumor. SRH images were then used to train a convolutional neural
              network model using 3 representation learning strategies:
              cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and
              supervised contrastive learning. Our trained convolutional neural
              network models were tested on a held-out, multicenter SRH data
              set. RESULTS: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of
              both benign and malignant skull base tumors. Of the 3
              representation learning strategies, supervised contrastive
              learning most effectively learned the distinctive and diagnostic
              SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our
              multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall
              diagnostic accuracy of 91.5\%, self-supervised contrastive
              learning 83.9\%, and supervised contrastive learning 96.6\%. Our
              trained model was able to segment tumor-normal margins and detect
              regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in meningioma SRH
              images. CONCLUSION: SRH with trained artificial intelligence
              models can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative analysis of
              skull base tumor specimens to inform surgical decision-making.",

              surrogate to gross-total resection (GTR) to improve survival in
              newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM). However, SMR has

              conducted a retrospective multivariate propensity-matched
              analysis comparing survival outcomes for patients with left-sided
              eloquent nGBM undergoing SMR versus GTR. METHODS: A retrospective
              review was performed of all patients at our institution who
              underwent SMR or GTR of a left-sided eloquent nGBM during the
              period from 2011 to 2020. All patients underwent some form of
              preoperative or intraoperative functional mapping and underwent
              awake or asleep craniotomy (craniotomy under general anesthesia);
              however, awake craniotomy was performed in the majority of
              patients and the focus of the study was SMR achieved via awake
              craniotomy and functional mapping with lesionectomy and
              additional peritumoral fluid attenuated inversion recovery
              (FLAIR) resection. Propensity scores were generated controlling
              for age, tumor location, and preoperative Karnofsky Performance
              Status (KPS) score with the nearest-neighbor algorithm. RESULTS:
              A total of 102 patients (48 SMR, 54 GTR) were included in this
              study. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free
              survival (PFS) for patients receiving SMR were 22.9 and 5.1
              months, respectively. Propensity matching resulted in a final
              cohort of 27 SMR versus 27 GTR patients. SMR conferred improved
              OS (21.55 vs 15.49 months, p = 0.0098) and PFS (4.51 vs 3.59
              months, p = 0.041) compared to GTR. There was no significant
              difference in postoperative complication rates or KPS score in
              SMR compared with GTR patients (p = 0.236 and p = 0.736,
              respectively). In patients receiving SMR, improved OS and PFS
              showed a dose-dependent relationship with extent of FLAIR
              resection (EOFR) on log-rank test for trend (p < 0.001).
              CONCLUSIONS: SMR by means of awake craniotomy with functional
              mapping for left-sided eloquent nGBM is safe and confers a
              survival benefit compared to GTR obtained with lesionectomy alone
              while preserving postoperative neurological integrity. When
              tolerated, greater EOFR with SMR may be associated with improved
              survival.",

              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) section. We aim to assess the accuracy
              of SRH in a novel range of sinonasal and skull base tumors.
              METHODS: Select patients undergoing sinonasal and skull base
              surgery using the Invenio Imaging™ Nio™ Laser Imaging SRH system
              between June 2020 and September 2021 were assessed. The SRH
              images were reviewed for pathologic features similar to frozen
              section (FS) and FFPE. Time taken for results and diagnostic
              concordance was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-seven SRH images from 7
              tumor types in 12 patients were assessed. Pathologies included
              squamous cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, inverted papilloma,
              adenoid cystic carcinoma, SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma,
              mucosal melanoma, metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, and
              meningioma. Tumor was identified in 100\% of lesional specimens,
              with characteristic diagnostic features readily appreciable on
              SRH. Median time for diagnosis was significantly faster for SRH
              (4.3 min) versus FS (44.5 min; p = <.0001). Where SRH sample site
              matched precisely to FS (n = 32/67, 47.8\%), the same diagnosis
              was confirmed in 93.8\%. Sensitivity, specificity, precision, and
              overall accuracy of SRH were 93.3\%, 94.1\%, 93.8\%, and 93.3\%,
              respectively. Near-perfect concordance was seen between SRH and
              FS (Cohen's kappa [$\kappa$] = 0.89). CONCLUSION: Stimulated
              Raman histology can rapidly produce images similar to FFPE H\&E
              in sinonasal and skull base tumors. This technology has the
              potential to act as an adjunct or alternative to standard FS.

              LGG. Region-of-interest analysis was performed to measure tumor
              volumes based on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR)

              volumes and EOR were 36.6 cm(3) (range, 0.7 to 246.1 cm(3)), 3.7
              cm(3) (range, 0 to 197.8 cm(3)) and 88.0\% (range, 5\% to 100\%),

              deficits were noted in 36 patients (17\%); however, all but four
              had complete recovery. There were 34 deaths (16\%; median

              significant independent predictors of survival in these patients
              and to determine whether the extent of resection was associated
              with increased survival time. METHODS: The authors
              retrospectively analyzed 416 consecutive patients with
              histologically proven GBM who underwent tumor resection at the
              authors' institution between June 1993 and June 1999. Volumetric
              data and other tumor characteristics identified on magnetic
              resonance (MR) imaging were collected prospectively. CONCLUSIONS:
              Five independent predictors of survival were identified: age,
              Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, extent of resection, and
              the degree of necrosis and enhancement on preoperative MR imaging
              studies. A significant survival advantage was associated with
              resection of 98\% or more of the tumor volume (median survival 13
              months, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 11.4-14.6 months), compared
              with 8.8 months (95\% CI 7.4-10.2 months; p < 0.0001) for
              resections of less than 98\%. Using an outcome scale ranging from
              0 to 5 based on age, KPS score, and tumor necrosis on MR imaging,
              we observed significantly longer survival in patients with lower
              scores (1-3) who underwent aggressive resections, and a trend
              toward slightly longer survival was found in patients with higher
              scores (4-5). Gross-total tumor resection is associated with
              longer survival in patients with GBM, especially when other

              (psPD), or pseudoprogression, in low-grade glioma (LGG) is
              unknown, we retrospectively investigated this phenomenon in a
              cohort of LGG patients given radiotherapy (RT). Methods: All MRI
              scans and clinical data from patients with histologically proven
              LGG treated with radiation between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed.
              PsPD was scored when a new enhancing lesion occurred after RT and
              subsequently disappeared or remained stable for at least a year
              without therapy, including dexamethasone. Results: Sixty-three
              out of 71 patients who received RT for LGG were deemed eligible
              for evaluation of psPD. The median follow-up was 5 years (range
              1-10 y). PsPD was seen in 13 patients (20.6\%). PsPD occurred
              after a median of 12 months with a range of 3-78 months. The
              median duration of psPD was 6 months, with a range of 2-26 months
              and always occurred within the RT high dose fields of at least 45
              Gy. The area of the enhancement at the time of psPD was
              significantly smaller compared with the area of enhancement
              during ``true'' progression (median size 54mm2 [range 12-340mm2]
              vs 270mm2 [range 30-3420mm2], respectively; P = .009).
              Conclusions: PsPD occurs frequently in LGG patients receiving RT.
              This supports the policy to postpone a new line of treatment
              until progression is evident, especially when patients have small
              contrast enhancing lesions within the RT field.",

              study including 430 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
              subjected to global DNA methylation profiling. Outcome measures
              included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS),
              prognostic relevance of EOR and MGMT promoter methylation status
              as well as surgical benefit for recurrent glioblastoma. RESULTS:
              345 patients (80.2\%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. DNA
              methylation subclasses RTK I, RTK II, and mesenchymal (MES)

              [95\% CI, 2.80-9.26]; p < 0.01) tumors who underwent gross-total
              resection (GTR) or near GTR had a longer OS and PFS than
              partially resected patients. The MES subclass showed no survival
              benefit for a maximized EOR (GTR/near GTR: Ref.; PR: HR 1.45
              [95\% CI, 0.68-3.09]; p = 0.33). Therapy response-predictive
              value of MGMT promoter methylation was evident for RTK I (HR 0.37
              [95\% CI, 0.19-0.71]; p < 0.01) and RTK II (HR 0.56 [95\% CI,
              0.34-0.91]; p = 0.02) but not the MES subclass (HR 0.52 [95\% CI,
              0.27-1.02]; p = 0.06). For local recurrence (n=112), re-resection
              conveyed a progression-to-overall survival (POS) benefit (p <
              0.01), which was evident in RTK I (p = 0.03) and RTK II (p <
              0.01) tumors, but not in MES tumors (p = 0.33). CONCLUSION: We
              demonstrate a survival benefit from maximized EOR for newly
              diagnosed and recurrent glioblastomas of the RTK I and RTK II but
              not the MES subclass. Hence, it needs to be debated whether the
              MES subclass should be treated with maximal surgical resection,
              especially when located in eloquent areas and at time of
              recurrence.",

              without injuring critical brain structures. Achieving this goal
              is challenging as it can be difficult to distinguish tumor from
              nontumor tissue. While standard histopathology provides
              information that could assist tumor delineation, it cannot be
              performed iteratively during surgery as freezing, sectioning, and
              staining of the tissue require too much time. Stimulated Raman
              scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free chemical
              imaging technology that enables rapid mapping of lipids and
              proteins within a fresh specimen. This information can be
              rendered into pathology-like images. Although this approach has
              been used to assess the density of glioma cells in murine
              orthotopic xenografts models and human brain tumors, tissue
              heterogeneity in clinical brain tumors has not yet been fully
              evaluated with SRS imaging. Here we profile 41 specimens resected
              from 12 patients with a range of brain tumors. By evaluating
              large-scale stimulated Raman imaging data and correlating this
              data with current clinical gold standard of histopathology for
              4,422 fields of view, we capture many essential diagnostic
              hallmarks for glioma classification. Notably, in fresh tumor
              samples, we observe additional features, not seen by conventional

              advance over its 2007 predecessor. For the first time, the WHO
              classification of CNS tumors uses molecular parameters in
              addition to histology to define many tumor entities, thus
              formulating a concept for how CNS tumor diagnoses should be
              structured in the molecular era. As such, the 2016 CNS WHO
              presents major restructuring of the diffuse gliomas,
              medulloblastomas and other embryonal tumors, and incorporates new
              entities that are defined by both histology and molecular
              features, including glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype and glioblastoma,
              IDH-mutant; diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant; RELA

  abstract      = "Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit
                   a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they
                   learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs.
                   Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a
                   particular dataset or task, but general in that they are
                   applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must
                   eventually transition from general to specific by the last
                   layer of the network, but this transition has not been
                   studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally
                   quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in
                   each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report
                   a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively
                   affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of
                   higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense
                   of performance on the target task, which was expected, and
                   (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks
                   between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an
                   example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that
                   either of these two issues may dominate, depending on
                   whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or
                   top of the network. We also document that the
                   transferability of features decreases as the distance
                   between the base task and target task increases, but that
                   transferring features even from distant tasks can be better
                   than using random features. A final surprising result is
                   that initializing a network with transferred features from
                   almost any number of layers can produce a boost to
                   generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the
                   target dataset.",

               organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new
               database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images
               built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims
               to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with
               an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This
               will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by
               the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed
               analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247
               synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet
               is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate

                   models for many image classification tasks. However, to
                   recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on
                   gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is
                   currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of
                   cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features
                   observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in
                   this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image
                   patches will perform better than or similar to an
                   image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to
                   intelligently combine patch-level classification results and
                   model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative.
                   We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate
                   patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to
                   the best of our knowledge has not been shown before.
                   Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization
                   (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative
                   patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of
                   patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma
                   and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The
                   classification accuracy of our method is similar to the
                   inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it
                   is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally
                   demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller

              Patients eligible were surgical candidates with biopsy-proven,
              previously untreated head and neck carcinoma and were consented
              preoperatively for participation in this study. Tissue was
              collected from 50 patients, and after confirmation of tumor and
              normal specimens by hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E), there were 42
              tumor samples and 42 normal adjacent controls. Results There were
              42 confirmed carcinoma specimens on H\&E, and CRS microscopy
              identified 37 as carcinoma. Of the 42 normal specimens, CRS
              microscopy identified 40 as normal. This resulted in a

              near-perfect agreement with standard hematoxylin and eosin light
              microscopy ($\kappa$ = 0.86). The unique chemical contrast
              specific to SRS microscopy enables tumor detection by revealing
              quantifiable alterations in tissue cellularity, axonal density,
              and protein/lipid ratio in tumor-infiltrated tissues. To ensure
              that SRS microscopic data can be easily used in brain tumor
              surgery, without the need for expert interpretation, we created a
              classifier based on cellularity, axonal density, and
              protein/lipid ratio in SRS images capable of detecting tumor
              infiltration with 97.5\% sensitivity and 98.5\% specificity.
              Quantitative SRS microscopy detects the spread of tumor cells,
              even in brain tissue surrounding a tumor that appears grossly
              normal. By accurately revealing tumor infiltration, quantitative
              SRS microscopy holds potential for improving the accuracy of
              brain tumor surgery.",

              during brain-tumour surgery. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
              microscopy, a label-free optical process, has been shown to
              rapidly detect brain-tumour infiltration in fresh, unprocessed
              human tissues. Here, we demonstrate the first application of SRS
              microscopy in the operating room by using a portable

              neurosurgical patients. We also introduce an image-processing
              method - stimulated Raman histology (SRH) - which leverages SRS
              images to create virtual haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained slides,
              revealing essential diagnostic features. In a simulation of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Women with suspected early-stage ovarian cancer need
              surgical staging which involves taking samples from areas within
              the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal lymph nodes in order to
              inform further treatment. One potential strategy is to surgically
              stage all women with suspicious ovarian masses, without any
              histological information during surgery. This avoids incomplete
              staging, but puts more women at risk of potential surgical
              over-treatment.A second strategy is to perform a two-stage
              procedure to remove the pelvic mass and subject it to paraffin
              sectioning, which involves formal tissue fixing with formalin and
              paraffin embedding, prior to ultrathin sectioning and multiple
              site sampling of the tumour. Surgeons may then base further
              surgical staging on this histology, reducing the rate of
              over-treatment, but conferring additional surgical and
              anaesthetic morbidity.A third strategy is to perform a rapid
              histological analysis on the ovarian mass during surgery, known
              as 'frozen section'. Tissues are snap frozen to allow fine tissue
              sections to be cut and basic histochemical staining to be
              performed. Surgeons can perform or avoid the full surgical
              staging procedure depending on the results. However, this is a
              relatively crude test compared to paraffin sections, which take
              many hours to perform. With frozen section there is therefore a
              risk of misdiagnosing malignancy and understaging women
              subsequently found to have a presumed early-stage malignancy
              (false negative), or overstaging women without a malignancy
              (false positive). Therefore it is important to evaluate the
              accuracy and usefulness of adding frozen section to the clinical
              decision-making process. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic
              test accuracy of frozen section (index test) to diagnose
              histopathological ovarian cancer in women with suspicious pelvic
              masses as verified by paraffin section (reference standard).
              SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (January 1946 to January
              2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2015) and relevant
              Cochrane registers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies that used frozen
              section for intraoperative diagnosis of ovarian masses suspicious
              of malignancy, provided there was sufficient data to construct 2
              x 2 tables. We excluded articles without an available English
              translation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently
              assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the
              Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2)
              domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow
              and timing. Data extraction converted 3 x 3 tables of per patient
              results presented in articles into 2 x 2 tables, for two index
              test thresholds. MAIN RESULTS: All studies were retrospective,
              and the majority reported consecutive sampling of cases.
              Sensitivity and specificity results were available from 38
              studies involving 11,181 participants (3200 with invasive cancer,
              1055 with borderline tumours and 6926 with benign tumours,
              determined by paraffin section as the reference standard). The
              median prevalence of malignancy was 29\% (interquartile range
              (IQR) 23\% to 36\%, range 11\% to 63\%). We assessed test
              performance using two thresholds for the frozen section test.
              Firstly, we used a test threshold for frozen sections, defining
              positive test results as invasive cancer and negative test
              results as borderline and benign tumours. The average sensitivity
              was 90.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 87.6\% to 92.0\%; with
              most studies typically reporting range of 71\% to 100\%), and
              average specificity was 99.5\% (95\% CI 99.2\% to 99.7\%; range
              96\% to 100\%).Similarly, we analysed sensitivity and specificity
              using a second threshold for frozen section, where both invasive
              cancer and borderline tumours were considered test positive and
              benign cases were classified as negative. Average sensitivity was
              96.5\% (95\% CI 95.5\% to 97.3\%; typical range 83\% to 100\%),
              and average specificity was 89.5\% (95\% CI 86.6\% to 91.9\%;
              typical range 58\% to 99\%).Results were available from the same
              38 studies, including the subset of 3953 participants with a
              frozen section result of either borderline or invasive cancer,
              based on final diagnosis of malignancy. Studies with small
              numbers of disease-negative cases (borderline cases) had more
              variation in estimates of specificity. Average sensitivity was
              94.0\% (95\% CI 92.0\% to 95.5\%; range 73\% to 100\%), and
              average specificity was 95.8\% (95\% CI 92.4\% to 97.8\%; typical
              range 81\% to 100\%).Our additional analyses showed that, if the
              frozen section showed a benign or invasive cancer, the final
              diagnosis would remain the same in, on average, 94\% and 99\% of
              cases, respectively.In cases where the frozen section diagnosis
              was a borderline tumour, on average 21\% of the final diagnoses
              would turn out to be invasive cancer.In three studies, the same
              pathologist interpreted the index and reference standard tests,
              potentially causing bias. No studies reported blinding
              pathologists to index test results when reporting paraffin
              sections.In heterogeneity analyses, there were no statistically
              significant differences between studies with pathologists of
              different levels of expertise. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In a
              hypothetical population of 1000 patients (290 with cancer and 80
              with a borderline tumour), if a frozen section positive test
              result for invasive cancer alone was used to diagnose cancer, on
              average 261 women would have a correct diagnosis of a cancer, and
              706 women would be correctly diagnosed without a cancer. However,
              4 women would be incorrectly diagnosed with a cancer (false

              negative).If a frozen section result of either an invasive cancer
              or a borderline tumour was used as a positive test to diagnose
              cancer, on average 280 women would be correctly diagnosed with a
              cancer and 635 would be correctly diagnosed without. However, 75
              women would be incorrectly diagnosed with a cancer and 10 women
              with a cancer would be missed.The largest discordance is within
              the reporting of frozen section borderline tumours. Investigation
              into factors leading to discordance within centres and
              standardisation of criteria for reporting borderline tumours may
              help improve accuracy. Some centres may choose to perform
              surgical staging in women with frozen section diagnosis of a
              borderline ovarian tumour to reduce the number of false
              positives. In their interpretation of this review, readers should
              evaluate results from studies most typical of their population of
              patients.",

                   ``good'' minimizers of highly non-convex loss functions. It
                   is well-known that certain network architecture designs
                   (e.g., skip connections) produce loss functions that train
                   easier, and well-chosen training parameters (batch size,
                   learning rate, optimizer) produce minimizers that generalize
                   better. However, the reasons for these differences, and
                   their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well
                   understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of
                   neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on
                   generalization, using a range of visualization methods.
                   First, we introduce a simple ``filter normalization'' method
                   that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make
                   meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions.
                   Then, using a variety of visualizations, we explore how
                   network architecture affects the loss landscape, and how
                   training parameters affect the shape of minimizers.",

              and geographic characteristics associated with treatment type.
              DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of Medicare beneficiaries.
              SETTING: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.
              PATIENTS: Patients undergoing MMS or other surgical intervention
              for the treatment of NMSC from January 1, 2001, through December
              31, 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical treatment, patient, and
              lesion characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 26,931 operations
              were performed for the treatment of NMSC from 2001 through 2006,
              of which 36.4\% were MMS. Although the rate of surgical excision
              slightly increased during this period (1.8 vs 2.1 per 100
              Medicare beneficiaries), the rate of MMS doubled (0.75 vs 1.5 per
              100 Medicare beneficiaries). In 46.9\% of facial lesions, MMS was
              performed, whereas MMS was used to treat 14.7\% of total body
              lesions. Atlanta, Georgia, had the highest proportion of patients
              treated with MMS (45.1\%); Louisiana had the lowest (11.0\%).
              Age, race, lesion location, and area of country for patient
              treatment were significantly associated with MMS use (all P <
              .001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of NMSC increased
              substantially from 2001 through 2006, primarily because of a
              doubling in the rate of MMS procedures. Significant differences
              in surgical rates, depending on patient age, race, lesion
              location, and geographic region, of treatment were found.",

              malignancy, with poor prognosis and a lack of effective
              therapeutic options. Accumulating evidence suggests that
              intratumor heterogeneity likely is the key to understanding
              treatment failure. However, the extent of intratumor
              heterogeneity as a result of tumor evolution is still poorly
              understood. To address this, we developed a unique surgical
              multisampling scheme to collect spatially distinct tumor
              fragments from 11 GB patients. We present an integrated genomic
              analysis that uncovers extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with
              most patients displaying different GB subtypes within the same
              tumor. Moreover, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the fragments
              for each patient, identifying copy number alterations in EGFR and
              CDKN2A/B/p14ARF as early events, and aberrations in PDGFRA and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported on our single centre results
              regarding the diagnostic yield of stereotactic needle biopsies of
              brain lesions. The yield then (1996-2006) was 89.4\%. In the
              present study, we review and evaluate our experience with
              intraoperative frozen-section histopathologic diagnosis on-demand
              in order to improve the diagnostic yield. METHODS: One hundred
              sixty-four consecutive frameless biopsy procedures in 160
              patients (group 1, 2006-2010) were compared with the historic
              control group (group 2, n = 164 frameless biopsy procedures).
              Diagnostic yield, as well as demographics, morbidity and
              mortality, was compared. Statistical analysis was performed by
              Student's t, Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square test and backward
              logistic regression when appropriate. RESULTS: Demographics were
              comparable. In group 1, a non-diagnostic tissue specimen was
              obtained in 1.8\%, compared to 11.0\% in group 2 (p = 0.001).
              Also, both the operating time and the number of biopsies needed
              were decreased significantly. Procedure-related mortality
              decreased from 3.7\% to 0.6\% (p = 0.121). Multivariate analysis
              only proved operating time (odds ratio (OR), 1.012; 95\%
              confidence interval (CI), 1.000-1.025; p = 0.043), a right-sided
              lesion (OR, 3.183; 95\% CI, 1.217-8.322; p = 0.018) and on-demand
              intraoperative histology (OR, 0.175; 95\% CI, 0.050-0.618; p =
              0.007) important factors predicting non-diagnostic biopsies.
              CONCLUSIONS: The importance of a reliable pathological diagnosis
              as obtained by biopsy must not be underestimated. We believe that
              when performing stereotactic biopsy for intracranial lesions,
              next to minimising morbidity, one should strive for as high a
              positive yield as possible. In the present single centre
              retrospective series, we have shown that using a standardised
              procedure and careful on-demand intraoperative frozen-section
              analysis can improve the diagnostic yield of stereotactic brain
              biopsy procedures as compared to a historical series.",

              histologic class. Some are indolent; others quickly progress to
              glioblastoma. The uncertainty is compounded by interobserver
              variability in histologic diagnosis. Mutations in IDH, TP53, and
              ATRX and codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q
              codeletion) have been implicated as clinically relevant markers

              and data from RNA, DNA-copy-number, and DNA-methylation platforms
              uncovered concordant classification of three robust,
              nonoverlapping, prognostically significant subtypes of
              lower-grade glioma that were captured more accurately by IDH,
              1p/19q, and TP53 status than by histologic class. Patients who
              had lower-grade gliomas with an IDH mutation and 1p/19q
              codeletion had the most favorable clinical outcomes. Their
              gliomas harbored mutations in CIC, FUBP1, NOTCH1, and the TERT
              promoter. Nearly all lower-grade gliomas with IDH mutations and
              no 1p/19q codeletion had mutations in TP53 (94\%) and ATRX
              inactivation (86\%). The large majority of lower-grade gliomas
              without an IDH mutation had genomic aberrations and clinical
              behavior strikingly similar to those found in primary
              glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of genomewide data
              from multiple platforms delineated three molecular classes of
              lower-grade gliomas that were more concordant with IDH, 1p/19q,
              and TP53 status than with histologic class. Lower-grade gliomas
              with an IDH mutation either had 1p/19q codeletion or carried a
              TP53 mutation. Most lower-grade gliomas without an IDH mutation
              were molecularly and clinically similar to glioblastoma. (Funded

              perioperative assessment and follow-up outcome. METHODS: A
              prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted between
              2001 and 2005. A consecutive series of 238 eligible patients with
              initial imaging diagnosis of cerebral gliomas involving PTs were
              randomized into study (n = 118) and control (n = 120) groups. The
              study cases underwent DTI and three-dimensional magnetic
              resonance imaging scans. The maps of fractional anisotropy were
              calculated for PT mapping. Both three-dimensional magnetic
              resonance imaging data sets and fractional anisotropy maps were
              integrated by rigid registration, after which the tumor and
              adjacent PT were segmented and reconstructed for presurgical
              planning and intraoperative guidance. The control cases were
              operated on using routine neuronavigation. RESULTS: There was a
              trend for high-grade gliomas (HGGs) in the study group to be more
              likely to achieve gross total resection (74.4 versus 33.3\%, P <
              0.001). There was no significant difference of low-grade gliomas
              resection between the two groups. Postoperative motor
              deterioration occurred in 32.8\% of control cases, whereas it
              occurred in only 15.3\% of the study cases (P < 0.001). The
              6-month Karnofsky Performance Scale score of study cases was
              significantly higher than that of control cases (86 +/- 20 versus
              74 +/- 28 overall, P < 0.001; 93 +/- 10 versus 86 +/- 17 for
              low-grade gliomas, P = 0.013; and 77 +/- 27 versus 53 +/- 32 for
              HGGs, P = 0.001). For 81 HGGs, the median survival of study cases
              was 21.2 months (95\% confidence interval, 14.1-28.3 mo) compared
              with 14.0 months (95\% confidence interval, 10.2-17.8 mo) of
              control cases (P = 0.048). The estimated hazard ratio for the
              effect of DTI-based functional neuronavigation was 0.570,
              representing a 43.0\% reduction in the risk of death. CONCLUSION:
              DTI-based functional neuronavigation contributes to maximal safe
              resection of cerebral gliomas with PT involvement, thereby
              decreasing postoperative motor deficits for both HGGs and
              low-grade gliomas while increasing high-quality survival for
              HGGs.",

                   non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy

              themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the
              previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is
              to build ``fully convolutional'' networks that take input of
              arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with
              efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space

              OBJECTIVE: To assess the current and future supply of
              pathologists, and apply a dynamic modeling tool for assessing the
              effects of changing market forces and emerging technologies on
              the supply of pathologists' services through 2030. DESIGN: Data
              came from various sources, including the literature, College of
              American Pathologists' internal data, and primary research
              through custom-developed surveys for the membership and for
              pathology practice managers RESULTS: Through 2010, there were
              approximately 18 000 actively practicing pathologists in the
              United States (5.7 per 100 000 population), approximately 93\% of
              whom were board certified. Our model projects that the absolute
              and per capita numbers of practicing pathologists will decrease
              to approximately 14 000 full-time equivalent (FTE) pathologists
              or 3.7 per 100 000 in the coming 2 decades. This projection
              reflects that beginning in 2015, the numbers of pathologists
              retiring will increase precipitously, and is anticipated to peak
              by 2021. Including all types of separation, the net pathologist
              strength will begin falling by year 2015. Unless workforce entry
              or exit rates change, this trend will continue at least through
              2030. These changes reflect the closure of many training programs
              2 to 4 decades ago and the substantially decreased number of
              graduating residents. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis
              predicts that pathologist numbers will decline steadily beginning
              in 2015. Anticipated population growth in general and increases
              in disease incidence owing to the aging population, to be
              presented in a companion article on demand, will lead to a net
              deficit in excess of more than 5700 FTE pathologists. To reach
              the projected need in pathologist numbers of nearly 20 000 FTE by
              2030 will require an increase from today of approximately 8.1\%
              more residency positions. We believe a pathologist shortage will
              negatively impact both patient access to laboratory services and
              health care providers' abilities to deliver more effective health
              care to their patient populations.",

               large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior,
               removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of
               these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and
               validation. Objective: To apply deep learning to create an
               algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and
               diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. Design and
               Setting: A specific type of neural network optimized for image
               classification called a deep convolutional neural network was
               trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175
               retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic
               retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a
               panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology
               senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant
               algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2
               separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified
               ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency. Exposure:
               Deep learning-trained algorithm. Main Outcomes and Measures: The
               sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting
               referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and
               worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or
               both, were generated based on the reference standard of the
               majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm
               was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the
               development set, one selected for high specificity and another
               for high sensitivity. Results: The EyePACS-1 data set consisted
               of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2\%
               women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images
               [7.8\%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874
               patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6\% women; prevalence of RDR,
               254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6\%]). For detecting RDR, the
               algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of
               0.991 (95\% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95\% CI,
               0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point
               with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3\%
               (95\% CI, 87.5\%-92.7\%) and the specificity was 98.1\% (95\%
               CI, 97.8\%-98.5\%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0\%
               (95\% CI, 81.1\%-91.0\%) and the specificity was 98.5\% (95\%
               CI, 97.7\%-99.1\%). Using a second operating point with high
               sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the
               sensitivity was 97.5\% and specificity was 93.4\% and for
               Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1\% and specificity was
               93.9\%. Conclusions and Relevance: In this evaluation of retinal
               fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based
               on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity
               for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research
               is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this
               algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use
               of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes
               compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.",

                   many real-world machine learning applications. However, deep
                   neural networks with the softmax classifier are known to
                   produce highly overconfident posterior distributions even
                   for such abnormal samples. In this paper, we propose a
                   simple yet effective method for detecting any abnormal
                   samples, which is applicable to any pre-trained softmax
                   neural classifier. We obtain the class conditional Gaussian
                   distributions with respect to (low- and upper-level)
                   features of the deep models under Gaussian discriminant
                   analysis, which result in a confidence score based on the
                   Mahalanobis distance. While most prior methods have been
                   evaluated for detecting either out-of-distribution or
                   adversarial samples, but not both, the proposed method
                   achieves the state-of-the-art performances for both cases in
                   our experiments. Moreover, we found that our proposed method
                   is more robust in harsh cases, e.g., when the training
                   dataset has noisy labels or small number of samples.
                   Finally, we show that the proposed method enjoys broader
                   usage by applying it to class-incremental learning: whenever
                   out-of-distribution samples are detected, our classification
                   rule can incorporate new classes well without further
                   training deep models.",

  abstract = "OBJECT: Greater extent of resection (EOR) for patients with
              low-grade glioma (LGG) corresponds with improved clinical
              outcome, yet remains a central challenge to the neurosurgical
              oncologist. Although 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced tumor
              fluorescence is a strategy that can improve EOR in gliomas, only
              glioblastomas routinely fluoresce following 5-ALA administration.
              Intraoperative confocal microscopy adapts conventional confocal
              technology to a handheld probe that provides real-time
              fluorescent imaging at up to 1000$\times$ magnification. The
              authors report a combined approach in which intraoperative
              confocal microscopy is used to visualize 5-ALA tumor fluorescence
              in LGGs during the course of microsurgical resection. METHODS:
              Following 5-ALA administration, patients with newly diagnosed LGG
              underwent microsurgical resection. Intraoperative confocal
              microscopy was conducted at the following points: 1) initial
              encounter with the tumor; 2) the midpoint of tumor resection; and
              3) the presumed brain-tumor interface. Histopathological analysis
              of these sites correlated tumor infiltration with intraoperative
              cellular tumor fluorescence. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients
              with WHO Grades I and II gliomas underwent microsurgical
              resection with 5-ALA and intraoperative confocal microscopy.
              Macroscopic tumor fluorescence was not evident in any patient.
              However, in each case, intraoperative confocal microscopy
              identified tumor fluorescence at a cellular level, a finding that
              corresponded to tumor infiltration on matched histological
              analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative confocal microscopy can
              visualize cellular 5-ALA-induced tumor fluorescence within LGGs
              and at the brain-tumor interface. To assess the clinical value of
              5-ALA for high-grade gliomas in conjunction with neuronavigation,

  abstract = "Purpose: Somatic mutations in the human cytosolic isocitrate
              dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene cause profound changes in cell
              metabolism and are a common feature of gliomas with unprecedented
              predictive and prognostic impact. Fourier-transform infrared
              (FT-IR) spectroscopy addresses the molecular composition of cells
              and tissue and was investigated to deduct the IDH1 mutation
              status.Experimental Design: We tested the technique on human cell
              lines that were transduced with wild-type IDH1 or mutated IDH1
              and on 34 human glioma samples. IR spectra were acquired at 256
              positions from cell pellets or tissue cryosections. Moreover, IR
              spectra were obtained from fresh, unprocessed biopsies of 64
              patients with glioma.Results:IDH1 mutation was linked to changes
              in spectral bands assigned to molecular groups of lipids and
              proteins in cell lines and human glioma. The spectra of
              cryosections of brain tumor samples showed high interpatient
              variability, for example, bands related to calcifications at 1113
              cm-1 However, supervised classification recognized relevant
              spectral regions at 1103, 1362, 1441, 1485, and 1553 cm-1 and
              assigned 88\% of the tumor samples to the correct group. Similar
              spectral positions allowed the classification of spectra of fresh
              biopsies with an accuracy of 86\%.Conclusions: Here, we show that
              vibrational spectroscopy reveals the IDH1 genotype of glioma.
              Because it can provide information in seconds, an implementation
              into the intraoperative workflow might allow simple and rapid
              online diagnosis of the IDH1 genotype. The intraoperative
              confirmation of IDH1 mutation status might guide the decision to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Intraoperative MRI is increasingly used in
              neurosurgery, although there is little evidence for its use. We
              aimed to assess efficacy of intraoperative MRI guidance on extent
              of resection in patients with glioma. METHODS: In our
              prospective, randomised, parallel-group trial, we enrolled adults
              ($\geq$18 years) with contrast enhancing gliomas amenable to
              radiologically complete resection who presented to Goethe
              University (Frankfurt, Germany). We randomly assigned patients
              (1:1) with computer-generated blocks of four and a
              sealed-envelope design to undergo intraoperative MRI-guided
              surgery or conventional microsurgery (control group). Surgeons
              and patients were unmasked to treatment group allocation, but an
              independent neuroradiologist was masked during analysis of all
              preoperative and postoperative imaging data. The primary endpoint
              was rate of complete resections as established by early
              postoperative high-field MRI (1·5 T or 3·0 T). Analysis was done
              per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
              number NCT01394692. FINDINGS: We enrolled 58 patients between Oct
              1, 2007, and July 1, 2010. 24 (83\%) of 29 patients randomly
              allocated to the intraoperative MRI group and 25 (86\%) of 29
              controls were eligible for analysis (four patients in each group
              had metastasis and one patient in the intraoperative MRI group
              withdrew consent after randomisation). More patients in the
              intraoperative MRI group had complete tumour resection (23 [96\%]
              of 24 patients) than did in the control group (17 [68\%] of 25,
              p=0·023). Postoperative rates of new neurological deficits did
              not differ between patients in the intraoperative MRI group
              (three [13\%] of 24) and controls (two [8\%] of 25, p=1·0). No
              patient for whom use of intraoperative MRI led to continued
              resection of residual tumour had neurological deterioration. One
              patient in the control group died before 6 months.
              INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence for the use of

              http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00241670. FINDINGS: Median
              follow-up was 35.4 months (95\% CI 1.0-56.7). Contrast-enhancing
              tumour was resected completely in 90 (65\%) of 139 patients
              assigned 5-aminolevulinic acid compared with 47 (36\%) of 131
              assigned white light (difference between groups 29\% [95\% CI
              17-40], p<0.0001). Patients allocated 5-aminolevulinic acid had
              higher 6-month progression free survival than did those allocated
              white light (41.0\% [32.8-49.2] vs 21.1\% [14.0-28.2]; difference
              between groups 19.9\% [9.1-30.7], p=0.0003, Z test). Groups did

               during surgical resection, using preoperative magnetic resonance
               imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound (IoUS) has attracted interest
               because of its perceived safety, portability, and real-time
               imaging. This report is a meta-analysis of intraoperative
               ultrasound in gliomas. METHODS: Critical literature review and
               meta-analyses, using the MEDLINE/PubMed service. The list of
               references in each article was double-checked for any missing
               references. We included all studies that reported the use of
               ultrasound to guide glioma-surgery. The meta-analyses were
               conducted according to statistical heterogeneity between the
               studies using Open MetaAnalyst Software. If there was no
               heterogeneity, fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis;
               otherwise, a random effect model was used. Statistical
               heterogeneity was explored by $\chi$(2) and inconsistency (I(2))
               statistics; an I(2) value of 50\% or more represented
               substantial heterogeneity. RESULTS: A wide search yielded 19,109
               studies that might be relevant, of which 4819 were ultrasound in
               neurosurgery; 756 studies used ultrasound in cranial surgery, of
               which 24 studies used intraoperative ultrasound to guide
               surgical resection and 74 studies used it to guide biopsy.
               Fifteen studies fulfilled our stringent inclusion criteria,
               giving a total of 739 patients. The estimated average gross
               total resection rate was 77\%. Furthermore, the relationship
               between extent of surgical resection and study population was
               not linear. Gross total resection was more likely under IoUS
               when the lesion was solitary and subcortical, with no history of
               surgery or radiotherapy. IoUS image quality, sensitivity,
               specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
               deteriorated as surgical resection proceeded. CONCLUSION:
               IoUS-guided surgical resection of gliomas is a useful tool for
               guiding the resection and for improving the extent of resection.
               IoUS can be used in conjunction with other complementary
               technologies that can improve anatomic orientation during
               surgery. Real-time imaging, improved image quality, small probe
               sizes, repeatability, portability, and relatively low cost make
               IoUS a realistic, cost-effective tool that complements any
               existing tools in any neurosurgical operating environment.",

              achieving optimal surgical results and identification of tumor
              remains a challenge. Raman spectroscopy, a laser-based technique
              that can be used to nondestructively differentiate molecules
              based on the inelastic scattering of light, is being applied
              toward improving the accuracy of brain tumor surgery. Here, the
              authors systematically review the application of Raman
              spectroscopy for guidance during brain tumor surgery. Raman
              spectroscopy can differentiate normal brain from necrotic and
              vital glioma tissue in human specimens based on chemical
              differences, and has recently been shown to differentiate
              tumor-infiltrated tissues from noninfiltrated tissues during
              surgery. Raman spectroscopy also forms the basis for coherent
              Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy, a technique that amplifies
              spontaneous Raman signals by 10,000-fold, enabling real-time
              histological imaging without the need for tissue processing,
              sectioning, or staining. The authors review the relevant basic
              and translational studies on CRS microscopy as a means of
              providing real-time intraoperative guidance. Recent studies have
              demonstrated how CRS can be used to differentiate
              tumor-infiltrated tissues from noninfiltrated tissues and that it
              has excellent agreement with traditional histology. Under
              simulated operative conditions, CRS has been shown to identify
              tumor margins that would be undetectable using standard
              bright-field microscopy. In addition, CRS microscopy has been
              shown to detect tumor in human surgical specimens with
              near-perfect agreement to standard H \& E microscopy. The authors
              suggest that as the intraoperative application and
              instrumentation for Raman spectroscopy and imaging matures, it
              will become an essential component in the neurosurgical

              Objective: To examine the trends in the US pathology workforce
              from 2007 to 2017. Design, Setting, and Participants: A
              cross-sectional study was conducted comparing the number of US
              and Canadian physicians from 2007 to 2017 with a focus on
              pathologists, radiologists, and anesthesiologists. For the United
              States, the number of physicians was examined at the state
              population level with a focus on pathologists. New cancer
              diagnoses per pathologist were compared between the United States
              and Canada. These data from the American Association of Medical
              Colleges Center for Workforce Studies' Physician Specialty Data
              Books and the Canadian Medical Association Masterfile were
              analyzed from January 4, 2019, through March 26, 2019. Main
              Outcomes and Measures: Numbers of pathologists were compared with
              overall physician numbers as well as numbers of radiologists and
              anesthesiologists in the United States and Canada. Results:
              Between 2007 and 2017, the number of active pathologists in the
              United States decreased from 15 568 to 12 839 (-17.53\%). In
              contrast, Canadian data showed an increase from 1467 to 1767
              pathologists during the same period (+20.45\%). When adjusted for
              each country's population, the number of pathologists per 100 000
              population showed a decline from 5.16 to 3.94 in the United
              States and an increase from 4.46 to 4.81 in Canada. As a
              percentage of total US physicians, pathologists have decreased
              from 2.03\% in 2007 to 1.43\% in 2017. The distribution of US
              pathologists varied widely by state; per 100 000 population,
              Idaho had the fewest (1.37) and the District of Columbia had the
              most (15.71). When adjusted by new cancer cases per year, the
              diagnostic workload per US pathologist has risen by 41.73\%;
              during the same period, the Canadian diagnostic workload
              increased by 7.06\%. Conclusions and Relevance: The US
              pathologist workforce decreased in both absolute and
              population-adjusted numbers from 2007 to 2017. The current trends
              suggest a shortage of US pathologists.",

              MCMV-infected Mut3 mice exhibited a shorter survival time from
              their gliomas than control Mut3 mice perinatally infected with

              The authors therefore designed a retrospective study to determine
              progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and
              prognostic factors for hemispheric ependymomas. METHODS The study
              population consisted of 8 patients from our institution and 101
              patients from the literature with disaggregated survival
              information (n = 109). Patient age, sex, tumor side, tumor
              location, extent of resection (EOR), tumor grade, postoperative
              chemotherapy, radiation, time to recurrence, and survival were
              recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional
              hazard models were completed to determine survival rates and
              prognostic factors. RESULTS Anaplastic histology/WHO Grade III
              tumors were identified in 62\% of cases and correlated with older
              age. Three-, 5-, and 10-year PFS rates were 57\%, 51\%, and 42\%,
              respectively. Three-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates were 77\%, 71\%,
              and 58\%, respectively. EOR and tumor grade were identified on
              both Kaplan-Meier log-rank testing and univariate Cox
              proportional hazard models as prognostic for PFS and OS. Both EOR
              and tumor grade remained prognostic on multivariate analysis.
              Subtotal resection (STR) predicted a worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR]
              4.764, p = 0.001) and OS (HR 4.216, p = 0.008). Subgroup survival
              analysis of patients with STR demonstrated a 5- and 10-year OS of
              28\% and 0\%, respectively. WHO Grade III tumors also had worse
              PFS (HR 10.2, p = 0.004) and OS (HR 9.1, p = 0.035). Patients
              with WHO Grade III tumors demonstrated 5- and 10-year OS of 61\%
              and 46\%, respectively. Postoperative radiation was not
              prognostic for PFS or OS. CONCLUSIONS A high incidence of
              anaplastic histology was found in hemispheric ependymomas and was
              associated with older age. EOR and tumor grade were prognostic
              factors for PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. STR or WHO Grade
              III pathology, or both, predicted worse overall prognosis in
              patients with hemispheric ependymoma.",

              achieving optimal surgical results and identification of tumor
              remains a challenge. Raman spectroscopy, a laser-based technique
              that can be used to nondestructively differentiate molecules
              based on the inelastic scattering of light, is being applied
              toward improving the accuracy of brain tumor surgery. Here, the
              authors systematically review the application of Raman
              spectroscopy for guidance during brain tumor surgery. Raman
              spectroscopy can differentiate normal brain from necrotic and
              vital glioma tissue in human specimens based on chemical
              differences, and has recently been shown to differentiate
              tumor-infiltrated tissues from noninfiltrated tissues during
              surgery. Raman spectroscopy also forms the basis for coherent
              Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy, a technique that amplifies
              spontaneous Raman signals by 10,000-fold, enabling real-time
              histological imaging without the need for tissue processing,
              sectioning, or staining. The authors review the relevant basic
              and translational studies on CRS microscopy as a means of
              providing real-time intraoperative guidance. Recent studies have
              demonstrated how CRS can be used to differentiate
              tumor-infiltrated tissues from noninfiltrated tissues and that it
              has excellent agreement with traditional histology. Under
              simulated operative conditions, CRS has been shown to identify
              tumor margins that would be undetectable using standard
              bright-field microscopy. In addition, CRS microscopy has been
              shown to detect tumor in human surgical specimens with
              near-perfect agreement to standard H \& E microscopy. The authors
              suggest that as the intraoperative application and
              instrumentation for Raman spectroscopy and imaging matures, it
              will become an essential component in the neurosurgical
              armamentarium for identifying residual tumor and improving the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVEPituitary adenomas occur in a heterogeneous patient
              population with diverse perioperative risk factors,
              endocrinopathies, and other tumor-related comorbidities. This
              heterogeneity makes predicting postoperative outcomes challenging
              when using traditional scoring systems. Modern machine learning
              algorithms can automatically identify the most predictive risk
              factors and learn complex risk-factor interactions using training
              data to build a robust predictive model that can generalize to
              new patient cohorts. The authors sought to build a predictive
              model using supervised machine learning to accurately predict
              early outcomes of pituitary adenoma surgery.METHODSA
              retrospective cohort of 400 consecutive pituitary adenoma
              patients was used. Patient variables/predictive features were
              limited to common patient characteristics to improve model
              implementation. Univariate and multivariate odds ratio analysis
              was performed to identify individual risk factors for common
              postoperative complications and to compare risk factors with
              model predictors. The study population was split into 300
              training/validation patients and 100 testing patients to train
              and evaluate four machine learning models using binary
              classification accuracy for predicting early outcomes.RESULTSThe
              study included a total of 400 patients. The mean $\pm$ SD patient
              age was 53.9 $\pm$ 16.3 years, 59.8\% of patients had
              nonfunctioning adenomas and 84.7\% had macroadenomas, and the
              mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.6 $\pm$ 7.8 (58.0\% obesity
              rate). Multivariate odds ratio analysis demonstrated that age <
              40 years was associated with a 2.86 greater odds of postoperative
              diabetes insipidus and that nonobese patients (BMI < 30) were 2.2
              times more likely to develop postoperative hyponatremia. Using
              broad criteria for a poor early postoperative outcome-major
              medical and early surgical complications, extended length of
              stay, emergency department admission, inpatient readmission, and
              death-31.0\% of patients met criteria for a poor early outcome.
              After model training, a logistic regression model with elastic
              net (LR-EN) regularization best predicted early postoperative
              outcomes of pituitary adenoma surgery on the 100-patient testing
              set-sensitivity 68.0\%, specificity 93.3\%, overall accuracy
              87.0\%. The receiver operating characteristic and
              precision-recall curves for the LR-EN model had areas under the
              curve of 82.7 and 69.5, respectively. The most important
              predictive variables were lowest perioperative sodium, age, BMI,
              highest perioperative sodium, and Cushing's
              disease.CONCLUSIONSEarly postoperative outcomes of pituitary
              adenoma surgery can be predicted with 87\% accuracy using a
              machine learning approach. These results provide insight into how
              predictive modeling using machine learning can be used to improve

              the Kadish staging and Hyams grading systems with respect to
              progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
              Methods It is a retrospective review of experience in treating
              ONB at a single tertiary care hospital from 1987 through 2015.
              Major complications were defined as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
              leak, meningitis, osteomyelitis, tracheostomy, and severe
              neurologic injury. Results Forty-one patients were included. An
              open approach was used in 34 (83\%), endoscopic in 6 (15\%), and
              combined in 1 (2\%) case. Rates of major complications by
              surgical approach were 17\% after endoscopic versus 31\% after
              open ( p = 0.65). There was no significant difference in PFS or
              OS based on Kadish B versus C (PFS, p = 0.28; OS, p = 0.11) or

               METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patients treated
               initially with surgery for Cushing disease from 1980 to 2012.
               Radiographic features, pathology, remissions, recurrences, and
               complications were recorded. Patients were categorized for
               statistical analysis based on tumor size (microadenomas,
               macroadenomas, and negative imaging) and remission type (type 1
               = morning cortisol $\leq$3 $\mu$g/dL; type 2 = morning cortisol
               normal). RESULTS: Females comprised 78\% of patients and were
               older than men. Imaging showed 50\% microadenomas, 13\%
               macroadenomas, and 37\% negative for tumor. Remission rates for
               microadenomas, macroadenomas, and negative imaging were 89\%,
               66\%, and 71\%, respectively. Patients with microadenomas were
               more likely to have type 1 remission. Pathology showed
               adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenomas in 82\% of
               microadenomas, in 100\% of macroadenomas, and in 43\% of
               negative imaging. The incidence of hyperplasia was 8\%. The
               finding of hyperplasia or no tumor on pathology predicted
               treatment failure. The recurrence rate was 17\%, with an average
               time to recurrence of 4.0 years. Patients with type 1 remission
               had a lower rate of recurrence (13\% type 1 vs 50\% type 2) and
               a longer time to recurrence. Children had similar imaging
               findings, remission rates, and pathology. There were no
               operative deaths. CONCLUSION: Transsphenoidal surgery provides a
               safe and effective treatment for Cushing disease. For both

              employing Raman spectroscopy to detect intracerebral tumors in
              vivo by brain surface mapping. Raman spectroscopy is a
              non-destructive biophotonic method which probes molecular
              vibrations. It provides a specific fingerprint of the biochemical
              composition and structure of tissue without using any labels.
              Here, the Raman system was coupled to a fiber-optic probe.
              Metastatic brain tumors were induced by injection of murine
              melanoma cells into the carotid artery of mice, which led to
              subcortical and cortical tumor growth within 14 days. Before data
              acquisition, the cortex was exposed by creating a bony window
              covered by a calcium fluoride window. Spectral contributions were
              assigned to proteins, lipids, blood, water, bone, and melanin.
              Based on the spectral information, Raman images enabled the
              localization of cortical and subcortical tumor cell aggregates

              this technique to delineate and identify brain tumors. METHODS:
              Different human tumors (glioblastoma, brain metastases of
              melanoma and breast cancer) were induced in an orthotopic mouse
              model. Cryosections were investigated by CARS imaging tuned to
              probe C-H molecular vibrations, thereby addressing the lipid
              content of the sample. Raman microspectroscopy was used as
              reference. Histopathology provided information about the tumor's
              localization, cell proliferation and vascularization. RESULTS:
              The morphochemical contrast of CARS images enabled identifying
              brain tumors irrespective of the tumor type and properties: All
              tumors were characterized by a lower CARS signal intensity than
              the normal parenchyma. On this basis, tumor borders and
              infiltrations could be identified with cellular resolution.
              Quantitative analysis revealed that the tumor-related reduction
              of CARS signal intensity was more pronounced in glioblastoma than
              in metastases. Raman spectroscopy enabled relating the CARS
              intensity variation to the decline of total lipid content in the
              tumors. The analysis of the immunohistochemical stainings
              revealed no correlation between tumor-induced cytological changes
              and the extent of CARS signal intensity reductions. The results
              were confirmed on samples of human glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS:
              CARS imaging enables label-free, rapid and objective
              identification of primary and secondary brain tumors. Therefore,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lipid-rich tumours have been associated with
              increased cancer metastasis and aggressive clinical behaviours.
              Nonetheless, pathologists cannot classify lipid-rich tumours as a
              clinically distinctive form of carcinoma due to a lack of
              mechanistic understanding on the roles of lipids in cancer
              development. METHODS: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering
              (CARS) microscopy is employed to study cancer cell behaviours in
              excess lipid environments in vivo and in vitro. The impacts of a
              high fat diet on cancer development are evaluated in a Balb/c
              mice cancer model. Intravital flow cytometry and histology are
              employed to enumerate cancer cell escape to the bloodstream and
              metastasis to lung tissues, respectively. Cancer cell motility
              and tissue invasion capability are also evaluated in excess lipid
              environments. RESULTS: CARS imaging reveals intracellular lipid
              accumulation is induced by excess free fatty acids (FFAs). Excess
              FFAs incorporation onto cancer cell membrane induces membrane
              phase separation, reduces cell-cell contact, increases surface
              adhesion, and promotes tissue invasion. Increased plasma FFAs
              level and visceral adiposity are associated with early rise in
              circulating tumour cells and increased lung metastasis.
              Furthermore, CARS imaging reveals FFAs-induced lipid accumulation
              in primary, circulating, and metastasized cancer cells.
              CONCLUSION: Lipid-rich tumours are linked to cancer metastasis
              through FFAs-induced physical perturbations on cancer cell
              membrane. Most importantly, the revelation of lipid-rich
              circulating tumour cells suggests possible development of CARS

              particularly the identification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
              mutations, is critical for clinical and surgical decision-making.
              Raman spectroscopy probes the unique molecular vibrations of a
              sample to accurately characterize its molecular composition. No
              sample processing is required allowing for rapid analysis of
              tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of
              Raman spectroscopy to rapidly identify the common molecular
              genetic subtypes of diffuse glioma in the neurosurgical setting
              using fresh biopsy tissue. In addition, classification models
              were built using cryosections, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
              (FFPE) sections and LN-18 (IDH-mutated and wild-type parental
              cell) glioma cell lines. Methods: Fresh tissue, straight from
              neurosurgical theatres, underwent Raman analysis and
              classification into astrocytoma, IDH-wild-type; astrocytoma,
              IDH-mutant; or oligodendroglioma. The genetic subtype was
              confirmed on a parallel section using immunohistochemistry and
              targeted genetic sequencing. Results: Fresh tissue samples from
              62 patients were collected (36 astrocytoma, IDH-wild-type; 21
              astrocytoma, IDH-mutated; 5 oligodendroglioma). A principal
              component analysis fed linear discriminant analysis

              90\%-100\% specificity for predicting the 3 glioma genetic
              subtypes. For the prediction of IDH mutation alone, the model
              gave 91\% sensitivity and 95\% specificity. Seventy-nine
              cryosections, 120 FFPE samples, and LN18 cells were also
              successfully classified. Meantime for Raman data collection was
              9.5 min in the fresh tissue samples, with the process from

  abstract = "Raman diagnostics and imaging have been shown to be an effective
              tool for the analysis and discrimination of human brain tumors
              from normal structures. Raman spectroscopic methods have
              potential to be applied in clinical practice as they allow for
              identification of tumor margins during surgery. In this study, we
              investigate medulloblastoma (grade IV WHO) (n= 5), low-grade
              astrocytoma (grades I-II WHO) (n =4), ependymoma (n=3) and
              metastatic brain tumors (n= 1) and the tissue from the negative
              margins used as normal controls. We compare a high grade
              medulloblastoma, low grade astrocytoma and non-tumor samples from
              human central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Based on the
              properties of the Raman vibrational features and Raman images we
              provide a real-time feedback method that is label-free to monitor
              tumor metabolism that reveals reprogramming of biosynthesis of
              lipids, proteins, DNA and RNA. Our results indicate marked
              metabolic differences between low and high grade brain tumors. We
              discuss molecular mechanisms causing these metabolic changes,
              particularly lipid alterations in malignant medulloblastoma and
              low grade gliomas that may shed light on the mechanisms driving
              tumor recurrence thereby revealing new approaches for the
              treatment of malignant glioma. We have found that the high-grade
              tumors of central nervous system (medulloblastoma) exhibit
              enhanced level of $\beta$-sheet conformation and down-regulated
              level of $\alpha$-helix conformation when comparing against
              normal tissue. We have found that almost all tumors studied in
              the paper have increased Raman signals of nucleic acids. This
              increase can be interpreted as increased DNA/RNA turnover in
              brain tumors. We have shown that the ratio of Raman intensities
              I2930/I2845 at 2930 and 2845 cm-1 is a good source of information
              on the ratio of lipid and protein contents. We have found that
              the ratio reflects the different lipid and protein contents of
              cancerous brain tissue compared to the non-tumor tissue. We found
              that levels of the saturated fatty acids were significantly
              reduced in the high grade medulloblastoma samples compared with
              non-tumor brain samples and low grade astrocytoma. Differences
              were also noted in the n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
              content between medulloblastoma and non-tumor brain samples. The
              content of the oleic acid (OA) was significantly smaller in
              almost all brain high grade brain tumors than that observed in
              the control samples. It indicates that the fatty acid composition
              of human brain tumors differs from that found in non-tumor brain
              tissue. The iodine number NI for the normal brain tissue is 60.
              For comparison OA has 87, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 464,
              $\alpha$-linolenic acid (ALA) 274. The high grade tumors have the
              iodine numbers between that for palmitic acid, stearic acid,
              arachidic acid (NI=0) and oleic acid (NI=87). Most low grade
              tumors have NI similar to that of OA. The iodine number for
              arachidonic acid (AA) (NI=334) is much higher than those observed

              paper was to extract quantitatively lipids from porcine and human
              brain tissue as well as from five human gliomas using a modified
              protocol according to Folch. The lipid extracts were studied by

              brain tissues have similar water and lipid content and show
              similar Raman and mass spectra. In contrast, gliomas are
              characterized by increased water content and decreased lipid
              content. Elevated phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol ratios in
              lipid extracts of gliomas were indicated by Raman bands of the

              technique which provides molecular information about the tissue
              under examination based on the vibrational properties of the
              constituent molecules. With careful measurement and data
              processing, a spatial step and repeat acquisition of Raman
              spectra can be used to create Raman images. Forty frozen brain
              tissue sections were imaged in their entirety using a
              300-µm-square measurement grid, and two or more regions of
              interest within each tissue were also imaged using a 25 µm-square
              step size. Molecular correlates for histologic features of
              interest were identified within the Raman spectra, and novel
              imaging algorithms were developed to compare molecular features

              implications, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of
              pseudoprogression of brain tumors, in particular, but not limited
              to, high-grade glioma. Pseudoprogression is an important clinical
              problem after brain tumor treatment, interfering not only with
              day-to-day patient care but also the execution and interpretation
              of clinical trials. Radiologically, pseudoprogression is defined
              as a new or enlarging area(s) of contrast agent enhancement, in
              the absence of true tumor growth, which subsides or stabilizes
              without a change in therapy. The clinical definitions of
              pseudoprogression have been quite variable, which may explain
              some of the differences in reported incidences, which range from
              9-30\%. Conventional structural MRI is insufficient for
              distinguishing pseudoprogression from true progressive disease,
              and advanced imaging is needed to obtain higher levels of
              diagnostic certainty. Perfusion MRI is the most widely used
              imaging technique to diagnose pseudoprogression and has high
              reported diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic performance of MR
              spectroscopy (MRS) appears to be somewhat higher, but MRS is less
              suitable for the routine and universal application in brain tumor
              follow-up. The combination of MRS and diffusion-weighted imaging
              and/or perfusion MRI seems to be particularly powerful, with
              diagnostic accuracy reaching up to or even greater than 90\%.
              While diagnostic performance can be high with appropriate
              implementation and interpretation, even a combination of
              techniques, however, does not provide 100\% accuracy. It should
              also be noted that most studies to date are small, heterogeneous,
              and retrospective in nature. Future improvements in diagnostic
              accuracy can be expected with harmonization of acquisition and
              postprocessing, quantitative MRI and computer-aided diagnostic
              technology, and meticulous evaluation with clinical and

              We aimed to formulate guidance on MRI of glioma and determine its
              feasibility, by seeking information on glioma imaging practices
              from the European Neuroradiology community. METHODS: Invitations
              to a structured survey were emailed to ESNR members (n=1,662) and
              associates (n=6,400), European national radiologists' societies
              and distributed via social media. RESULTS: Responses were
              received from 220 institutions (59\% academic). Conventional
              imaging protocols generally include T2w, T2-FLAIR, DWI, and pre-
              and post-contrast T1w. Perfusion MRI is used widely (85.5\%),
              while spectroscopy seems reserved for specific indications.
              Reasons for omitting advanced imaging modalities include lack of
              facility/software, time constraints and no requests. Early
              postoperative MRI is routinely carried out by 74\% within 24-72
              h, but only 17\% report a percent measure of resection. For
              follow-up, most sites (60\%) issue qualitative reports, while
              27\% report an assessment according to the RANO criteria. A
              minority of sites use a reporting template (23\%). CONCLUSION:
              Clinical best practice recommendations for glioma imaging
              assessment are proposed and the current role of advanced MRI
              modalities in routine use is addressed. KEY POINTS: • We
              recommend the EORTC-NBTS protocol as the clinical standard glioma
              protocol. • Perfusion MRI is recommended for diagnosis and
              follow-up of glioma. • Use of advanced imaging could be promoted
              with increased education activities. • Most response assessment
              is currently performed qualitatively. • Reporting templates are
              not widely used, and could facilitate standardisation.",

              College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). RESULTS: We identified 73
              studies. MRI progression occurred in 2603 patients. Of these,
              36\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 33-40\%) demonstrated
              pseudoprogression, 60\% (95\%CI 56-64\%) tumour progression and
              unknown outcome was present in the remaining 4\% of the patients
              (range 1-37\%). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated for
              the first time a notably high pooled incidence of
              pseudoprogression in patients with a form of progression across
              the available literature. This highlighted the full extent of the
              problem of the currently conventional MRI-based Response
              Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for treatment
              evaluation in high-grade gliomas. This underscores the need for
              more accurate treatment evaluation using advanced imaging to
              improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic approach.",

              intrinsic brain tumors that correlate strongly with survival.
              Data on the effect of reoperation are sparse. OBJECTIVE: To
              evaluate the effect of reoperation on patients with LGG. METHODS:
              Fifty-two consecutive patients with reoperated LGGs treated at
              the University of Washington between 1986 and 2004 were
              identified and evaluated in a retrospective analysis. RESULTS:
              The average overall survival (OS) for this cohort was 12.95 $\pm$
              0.96 years. The overall 10-year survival rate was 57\%. The
              absence of any residual tumor at either the first or second
              operation was associated with significantly increased OS.
              Negative prognostic variables for OS included the use of upfront
              radiation and pathology at recurrence. The average overall
              progression-free survival to the first recurrence (PFS1) was 6.23
              $\pm$ 0.51 years. Positive prognostic factors for improved PFS1
              included the use of upfront radiation therapy. Variables not
              associated with differences in PFS1 included the use of upfront
              chemotherapy, enhancement, pathology, extent of resection, the
              presence of residual tumor, and Karnofsky Performance Scale score
              <80. The average overall progression-free survival to the second
              recurrence was 2.73 $\pm$ 0.39 years. Pathology at recurrence was
              associated with significant differences in progression-free
              survival to the second recurrence, as was extent of resection at
              time of first recurrence, and Karnofsky Performance Scale score
              <80. CONCLUSION: This is among the largest studies to assess
              variables associated with outcome in patients with reoperated
              LGG. Reresection appears to provide significant benefit, and
              extent of resection remains the strongest predictor of OS.",

               for many image classification tasks. However, to recognize
               cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel
               resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently
               computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer
               subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on
               image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation,
               training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform
               better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The
               challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level
               classification results and model the fact that not all patches
               will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion
               model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level
               CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown
               before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel
               Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically
               locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial
               relationships of patches. We apply our method to the
               classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases
               into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is
               similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists.
               Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we
               experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset
               of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an

              management of patients with glioblastoma, tumor recurrence
              remains inevitable. For recurrent glioblastoma, however, the
              clinical value of a second resection remains uncertain.
              Specifically, what proportion of contrast-enhancing recurrent
              glioblastoma tissue must be removed to improve overall survival
              and what is the neurological cost of incremental resection beyond
              this threshold? METHODS: The authors identified 170 consecutive
              patients with recurrent supratentorial glioblastomas treated at
              the Barrow Neurological Institute from 2001 to 2011. All patients
              previously had a de novo glioblastoma and following their initial
              resection received standard temozolomide and fractionated
              radiotherapy. RESULTS: The mean clinical follow-up was 22.6
              months and no patient was lost to follow-up. At the time of
              recurrence, the median preoperative tumor volume was 26.1 cm(3).
              Following re-resection, median postoperative tumor volume was 3.1
              cm(3), equating to an 87.4\% extent of resection (EOR). The
              median overall survival was 19.0 months, with a median
              progression-free survival following re-resection of 5.2 months.
              Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, the variables of age,
              Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, and EOR were predictive
              of survival following repeat resection (p = 0.0001).
              Interestingly, a significant survival advantage was noted with as
              little as 80\% EOR. Recursive partitioning analysis validated
              these findings and provided additional risk stratification at the
              highest levels of EOR. Overall, at 7 days after surgery, a
              deterioration in the NIH stroke scale score by 1 point or more
              was observed in 39.1\% of patients with EOR $\geq$ 80\% as
              compared with 16.7\% for those with EOR < 80\% (p = 0.0049). This
              disparity in neurological morbidity, however, did not endure
              beyond 30 days postoperatively (p = 0.1279). CONCLUSIONS: For
              recurrent glioblastomas, an improvement in overall survival can
              be attained beyond an 80\% EOR. This survival benefit must be
              balanced against the risk of neurological morbidity, which does
              increase with more aggressive cytoreduction, but only in the
              early postoperative period. Interestingly, this putative EOR
              threshold closely approximates that reported for newly diagnosed
              glioblastomas, suggesting that for a subset of patients, the
              survival benefit of microsurgical resection does not diminish
              despite biological progression.",

              vaccine (DCVax\textregistered{}-L) to standard therapy for newly
              diagnosed glioblastoma. METHODS: After surgery and
              chemoradiotherapy, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive
              temozolomide plus DCVax-L (n = 232) or temozolomide and placebo
              (n = 99). Following recurrence, all patients were allowed to
              receive DCVax-L, without unblinding. The primary endpoint was
              progression free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoint was
              overall survival (OS). RESULTS: For the intent-to-treat (ITT)
              population (n = 331), median OS (mOS) was 23.1 months from
              surgery. Because of the cross-over trial design, nearly 90\% of
              the ITT population received DCVax-L. For patients with methylated
              MGMT (n = 131), mOS was 34.7 months from surgery, with a 3-year
              survival of 46.4\%. As of this analysis, 223 patients are $\geq$
              30 months past their surgery date; 67 of these (30.0\%) have
              lived $\geq$ 30 months and have a Kaplan-Meier (KM)-derived mOS
              of 46.5 months. 182 patients are $\geq$ 36 months past surgery;
              44 of these (24.2\%) have lived $\geq$ 36 months and have a
              KM-derived mOS of 88.2 months. A population of extended survivors
              (n = 100) with mOS of 40.5 months, not explained by known
              prognostic factors, will be analyzed further. Only 2.1\% of ITT
              patients (n = 7) had a grade 3 or 4 adverse event that was deemed
              at least possibly related to the vaccine. Overall adverse events
              with DCVax were comparable to standard therapy alone.

  abstract = "OBJECT: Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and diffusely
              infiltrative primary brain tumor. Recurrence is expected and is
              extremely difficult to treat. Over the past decade, the
              accumulation of knowledge regarding the molecular and genetic
              profile of glioblastoma has led to numerous molecularly targeted
              therapies. This article aims to review the literature and
              highlight the mechanisms and efficacies of molecularly targeted
              therapies for recurrent glioblastoma. METHODS: A systematic
              search was performed with the phrase ``(name of particular agent)
              and glioblastoma'' as a search term in PubMed to identify all
              articles published up until 2014 that included this phrase in the
              title and/or abstract. The references of systematic reviews were
              also reviewed for additional sources. The review included
              clinical studies that comprised at least 20 patients and reported
              results for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma with
              molecular targeted therapies. RESULTS: A total of 42 articles
              were included in this review. In the treatment of recurrent
              glioblastoma, various targeted therapies have been tested over
              the past 10-15 years. The targets of interest include epidermal
              growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor
              receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Ras pathway,
              protein kinase C, mammalian target of rapamycin, histone
              acetylation, and integrins. Unfortunately, the clinical responses
              to most available targeted therapies are modest at best.
              Radiographic responses generally range in the realm of 5\%-20\%.
              Progression-free survival at 6 months and overall survival were
              also modest with the majority of studies reporting a 10\%-20\%
              6-month progression-free survival and 5- to 8-month overall
              survival. There have been several clinical trials evaluating the
              use of combination therapy for molecularly targeted treatments.
              In general, the outcomes for combination therapy tend to be
              superior to single-agent therapy, regardless of the specific
              agent studied. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent glioblastoma remains very
              difficult to treat, even with molecular targeted therapies and
              anticancer agents. The currently available targeted therapy
              regimens have poor to modest activity against recurrent
              glioblastoma. As newer agents are actively being developed,
              combination regimens have provided the most promising results for
              improving outcomes. Targeted therapies matched to molecular
              profiles of individual tumors are predicted to be a critical
              component necessary for improving efficacy in future trials.",

  abstract = "Glioblastoma (GBM) is distinguished by a high degree of
              intratumoral heterogeneity, which extends to the pattern of
              expression and amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).
              Although most GBMs harbor RTK amplifications, clinical trials of
              small-molecule inhibitors targeting individual RTKs have been
              disappointing to date. Activation of multiple RTKs within
              individual GBMs provides a theoretical mechanism of resistance;
              however, the spectrum of functional RTK dependence among tumor
              cell subpopulations in actual tumors is unknown. We investigated
              the pattern of heterogeneity of RTK amplification and functional
              RTK dependence in GBM tumor cell subpopulations. Analysis of The
              Cancer Genome Atlas GBM dataset identified 34 of 463 cases
              showing independent focal amplification of two or more RTKs, most
              commonly platelet-derived growth factor receptor $\alpha$
              (PDGFRA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Dual-color
              fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on eight samples
              with EGFR and PDGFRA amplification, revealing distinct tumor cell
              subpopulations amplified for only one RTK; in all cases these
              predominated over cells amplified for both. Cell lines derived
              from coamplified tumors exhibited genotype selection under
              RTK-targeted ligand stimulation or pharmacologic inhibition in
              vitro. Simultaneous inhibition of both EGFR and PDGFR was
              necessary for abrogation of PI3 kinase pathway activity in the
              mixed population. DNA sequencing of isolated subpopulations
              establishes a common clonal origin consistent with late or
              ongoing divergence of RTK genotype. This phenomenon is especially
              common among tumors with PDGFRA amplification: overall, 43\% of
              PDGFRA-amplified GBM were found to have amplification of EGFR or
              the hepatocyte growth factor receptor gene (MET) as well.",

              Therapies for recurrent disease may fail, at least in part,
              because the genomic alterations driving the growth of recurrences
              are distinct from those in the initial tumor. To explore this
              hypothesis, we sequenced the exomes of 23 initial low-grade
              gliomas and recurrent tumors resected from the same patients. In
              43\% of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial

              in TP53, ATRX, SMARCA4, and BRAF; this suggests that recurrent
              tumors are often seeded by cells derived from the initial tumor
              at a very early stage of their evolution. Notably, tumors from 6
              of 10 patients treated with the chemotherapeutic drug
              temozolomide (TMZ) followed an alternative evolutionary path to
              high-grade glioma. At recurrence, these tumors were hypermutated

                   coarse localization task by predicting pixel-level scores,
                   requiring ad-hoc heuristics when mapping back to
                   object-level scores. State-of-the-art object detectors on
                   the other hand, allow for individual object scoring in an
                   end-to-end fashion, while ironically trading in the ability

                   be particularly disadvantageous in the setting of medical
                   image analysis, where data sets are notoriously small. In

              these approaches have significant drawbacks, including

              progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the
              accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes and
              lysosomes. We sought to develop new therapeutics for this
              disorder by harnessing the body's endogenous cholesterol
              scavenging particle, high-density lipoprotein (HDL). METHODS:
              Here we design, optimize, and define the mechanism of action of
              synthetic HDL (sHDL) nanoparticles. RESULTS: We demonstrate a
              dose-dependent rescue of cholesterol storage that is sensitive to
              sHDL lipid and peptide composition, enabling the identification
              of compounds with a range of therapeutic potency. Peripheral
              administration of sHDL to Npc1 I1061T homozygous mice mobilizes
              cholesterol, reduces serum bilirubin, reduces liver macrophage
              size, and corrects body weight deficits. Additionally, a single
              intraventricular injection into adult Npc1 I1061T brains
              significantly reduces cholesterol storage in Purkinje neurons.
              Since endogenous HDL is also a carrier of sphingomyelin, we
              tested the same sHDL formulation in the sphingomyelin storage
              disease Niemann-Pick type A. Utilizing stimulated Raman
              scattering microscopy to detect endogenous unlabeled lipids, we
              show significant rescue of Niemann-Pick type A lipid storage.
              CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data establish that sHDL nanoparticles
              are a potential new therapeutic avenue for Niemann-Pick diseases.",

              incidence data from all provinces/territories in Canada. Tumor
              types were classified by site and histology using the definitions

              those aged 0-19 years, 1130 malignant brain and CNS tumors were
              diagnosed in 2009-2013 (IR: 3.36/100000 py; 95\% CI: 3.16, 3.56).
              The most common histology among the pediatric population was

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prediction of clinical behavior, response to
              therapy, and outcome of infiltrative glioma is challenging. On
              the basis of previous studies of tumor biology, we defined five
              glioma molecular groups with the use of three alterations:
              mutations in the TERT promoter, mutations in IDH, and codeletion
              of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion). We tested the
              hypothesis that within groups based on these features, tumors
              would have similar clinical variables, acquired somatic
              alterations, and germline variants. METHODS: We scored tumors as
              negative or positive for each of these markers in 1087 gliomas
              and compared acquired alterations and patient characteristics
              among the five primary molecular groups. Using 11,590 controls,
              we assessed associations between these groups and known glioma
              germline variants. RESULTS: Among 615 grade II or III gliomas,
              29\% had all three alterations (i.e., were triple-positive), 5\%
              had TERT and IDH mutations, 45\% had only IDH mutations, 7\% were
              triple-negative, and 10\% had only TERT mutations; 5\% had other
              combinations. Among 472 grade IV gliomas, less than 1\% were
              triple-positive, 2\% had TERT and IDH mutations, 7\% had only IDH
              mutations, 17\% were triple-negative, and 74\% had only TERT
              mutations. The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among
              patients who had gliomas with only IDH mutations and was highest
              (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only TERT
              mutations. The molecular groups were independently associated
              with overall survival among patients with grade II or III gliomas
              but not among patients with grade IV gliomas. The molecular
              groups were associated with specific germline variants.
              CONCLUSIONS: Gliomas were classified into five principal groups
              on the basis of three tumor markers. The groups had different
              ages at onset, overall survival, and associations with germline
              variants, which implies that they are characterized by distinct
              mechanisms of pathogenesis. (Funded by the National Institutes of

              revealed somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene
              (IDH1) in a fraction of such tumors, most frequently in tumors
              that were known to have evolved from lower-grade gliomas
              (secondary glioblastomas). METHODS: We determined the sequence of
              the IDH1 gene and the related IDH2 gene in 445 central nervous
              system (CNS) tumors and 494 non-CNS tumors. The enzymatic
              activity of the proteins that were produced from normal and
              mutant IDH1 and IDH2 genes was determined in cultured glioma
              cells that were transfected with these genes. RESULTS: We
              identified mutations that affected amino acid 132 of IDH1 in more
              than 70\% of WHO grade II and III astrocytomas and
              oligodendrogliomas and in glioblastomas that developed from these
              lower-grade lesions. Tumors without mutations in IDH1 often had
              mutations affecting the analogous amino acid (R172) of the IDH2
              gene. Tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had distinctive genetic
              and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors had a
              better outcome than those with wild-type IDH genes. Each of four
              tested IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduced the enzymatic activity of

               multiple labels, which could correspond to different objects,
               scenes, actions and attributes in an image. Traditional
               approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent
               classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding

              survival of malignant gliomas remains very poor. This Phase II,
              prospective, matched controlled, multicenter trial was conducted
              to assess the safety and efficacy of aglatimagene besadenovec
              (AdV-tk) plus valacyclovir (gene-mediated cytotoxic immunotherapy
              [GMCI]) in combination with SOC for newly diagnosed malignant
              glioma patients. METHODS: Treatment cohort patients received SOC
              + GMCI and were enrolled at 4 institutions from 2006 to 2010. The
              preplanned, matched-control cohort included all concurrent
              patients meeting protocol criteria and SOC at a fifth
              institution. AdV-tk was administered at surgery followed by SOC
              radiation and temozolomide. Subset analyses were preplanned,
              based on prognostic factors: pathological diagnosis (glioblastoma
              vs others) and extent of resection. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients
              completed SOC + GMCI, and 134 met control cohort criteria. Median
              overall survival (OS) was 17.1 months for GMCI + SOC versus 13.5
              months for SOC alone (P = .0417). Survival at 1, 2, and 3 years
              was 67\%, 35\%, and 19\% versus 57\%, 22\%, and 8\%,
              respectively. The greatest benefit was observed in gross total
              resection patients: median OS of 25 versus 16.9 months (P =
              .0492); 1, 2, and 3-year survival of 90\%, 53\%, and 32\% versus
              64\%, 28\% and 6\%, respectively. There were no dose-limiting
              toxicities; fever, fatigue, and headache were the most common
              GMCI-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: GMCI can be safely combined
              with SOC in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. Survival outcomes
              were most notably improved in patients with minimal residual
              disease after gross total resection. These data should help guide

              Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is dismal, and there
              is currently no effective therapy. We conducted a dose-finding
              and toxicity study in this population of patients, evaluating
              convection-enhanced, intratumoral delivery of the recombinant
              nonpathogenic polio-rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO). PVSRIPO
              recognizes the poliovirus receptor CD155, which is widely
              expressed in neoplastic cells of solid tumors and in major
              components of the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We enrolled
              consecutive adult patients who had recurrent supratentorial WHO
              grade IV malignant glioma, confirmed on histopathological
              testing, with measurable disease (contrast-enhancing tumor of
              $\geq$1 cm and $\leq$5.5 cm in the greatest dimension). The study
              evaluated seven doses, ranging between 107 and 1010 50\%
              tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50), first in a
              dose-escalation phase and then in a dose-expansion phase.
              RESULTS: From May 2012 through May 2017, a total of 61 patients
              were enrolled and received a dose of PVSRIPO. Dose level -1
              (5.0$\times$107 TCID50) was identified as the phase 2 dose. One
              dose-limiting toxic effect was observed; a patient in whom dose
              level 5 (1010 TCID50) was administered had a grade 4 intracranial
              hemorrhage immediately after the catheter was removed. To
              mitigate locoregional inflammation of the infused tumor with
              prolonged glucocorticoid use, dose level 5 was deescalated to
              reach the phase 2 dose. In the dose-expansion phase, 19\% of the
              patients had a PVSRIPO-related adverse event of grade 3 or
              higher. Overall survival among the patients who received PVSRIPO
              reached a plateau of 21\% (95\% confidence interval, 11 to 33) at
              24 months that was sustained at 36 months. CONCLUSIONS:
              Intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO in patients with recurrent WHO
              grade IV malignant glioma confirmed the absence of neurovirulent
              potential. The survival rate among patients who received PVSRIPO
              immunotherapy was higher at 24 and 36 months than the rate among
              historical controls. (Funded by the Brain Tumor Research Charity

              glioblastoma (GBM) remains an aggressive and uniformly fatal
              tumor. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel,
              minimally invasive treatment that holds promise for treating
              patients with GBM who are not candidates for traditional open
              craniotomy. However, due to the recent introduction of LITT into
              clinical practice, large series that evaluate safety and
              long-term outcomes after LITT are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To present
              our institution's series of over 50 GBM patients treated with
              LITT, with regard to safety, efficacy, and outcomes. METHODS: We
              performed a retrospective descriptive study of patients with
              histologically proven GBM who underwent LITT. Data collected
              included demographics, tumor location and volume, tumor genetic
              markers, treatment volume, perioperative complications, and
              long-term follow-up data. RESULTS: We performed 58 LITT
              treatments for GBM in 54 patients over 5.5 yr. Forty-one were
              recurrent tumors while 17 were frontline treatments. Forty GBMs
              were lobar in location, while 18 were in deep structures
              (thalamus, insula, corpus callosum). Average tumor volume was
              12.5 $\pm$ 13.4 cm3. Average percentage of tumor treated with the
              yellow thermal damage threshold (TDT) line (dose equivalent of
              43°C for 2 min) was 93.3\% $\pm$ 10.6\%, and with the blue TDT
              line (dose equivalent of 43°C for 10 min) was 88.0\% $\pm$
              14.2\%. There were 7 perioperative complications (12\%) and 2
              mortalities (3.4\%). Median overall survival after LITT for the
              total cohort was 11.5 mo, and median progression-free survival

              unmethylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) fare
              worse, presumably because of temozolomide resistance. AdV-tk, an
              adenoviral vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine
              kinase gene, plus prodrug synergizes with surgery and
              chemoradiotherapy, kills tumor cells, has not shown MGMT
              dependency, and elicits an antitumor vaccine effect. PATIENTS AND
              METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma received
              AdV-tk at 3 $\times$ 10(10), 1 $\times$ 10(11), or 3 $\times$
              10(11) vector particles (vp) via tumor bed injection at time of
              surgery followed by 14 days of valacyclovir. Radiation was
              initiated within 9 days after AdV-tk injection to overlap with
              AdV-tk activity. Temozolomide was administered after completing
              valacyclovir treatment. RESULTS: Accrual began December 2005 and
              was completed in 13 months. Thirteen patients were enrolled and
              12 completed therapy, three at dose levels 1 and 2 and six at
              dose level 3. There were no dose-limiting or significant added
              toxicities. One patient withdrew before completing prodrug
              because of an unrelated surgical complication. Survival at 2
              years was 33\% and at 3 years was 25\%. Patient-reported quality
              of life assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer
              Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) was stable or improved after treatment. A
              significant CD3(+) T-cell infiltrate was found in four of four
              tumors analyzed after treatment. Three patients with MGMT
              unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme survived 6.5, 8.7, and 46.4
              months. CONCLUSION: AdV-tk plus valacyclovir can be safely
              delivered with surgery and accelerated radiation in newly
              diagnosed malignant gliomas. Temozolomide did not prevent immune
              responses. Although not powered for efficacy, the survival and

                   neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference
                   between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom
                   attributes small generalization error either to properties
                   of the model family, or to the regularization techniques
                   used during training. Through extensive systematic
                   experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail
                   to explain why large neural networks generalize well in
                   practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that
                   state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image
                   classification trained with stochastic gradient methods
                   easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This

                   regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true
                   images by completely unstructured random noise. We
                   corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical
                   construction showing that simple depth two neural networks

                   hyper-parameter to tune for training deep neural networks.
                   This paper describes a new method for setting the learning
                   rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically
                   eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values
                   and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of
                   monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets
                   the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable
                   boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates
                   instead of fixed values achieves improved classification
                   accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer
                   iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to
                   estimate ``reasonable bounds'' -- linearly increasing the
                   learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition,
                   cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and

               operation, which extracts informative features by fusing spatial
               and channel-wise information together within local receptive
               fields. In order to boost the representational power of a
               network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of
               enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the

               which we term the ``Squeeze-and-Excitation'' (SE) block, that
               adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by
               explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We

              state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of
              interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image
              data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a
              modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We
              introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent
              channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction
              accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned
              beta > 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as
              state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised

                   whole slide level computational pathology methods also
                   suffer from domain adaptation and interpretability issues.
                   These challenges have prevented the broad adaptation of

                   and interpretable WSI-level processing and learning method

                   efficient, adaptable and capable of handling multi-class
                   subtyping problems. CLAM is a deep-learning-based
                   weakly-supervised method that uses attention-based learning
                   to automatically identify sub-regions of high diagnostic
                   value in order to accurately classify the whole slide, while
                   also utilizing instance-level clustering over the
                   representative regions identified to constrain and refine
                   the feature space. In three separate analyses, we
                   demonstrate the data efficiency and adaptability of CLAM and
                   its superior performance over standard weakly-supervised

                   interpretable and can be used to identify well-known and new

               split-up the image into binary superpixels which are then used
               as clustering elements. Colour features of the superpixels are

              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.
              Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging

                   VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete,

                   rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent

              their proximity to intracranial neurovascular structures because
              complete resection may pose a risk of worsening morbidity.
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of clinical outcomes and
              surgical management on patient-perceived quality-of-life
              outcomes, value, and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Patients who
              underwent resection of a skull base meningioma, had adequate
              clinical follow-up, and completed EQ-5D-3L questionnaires
              preoperatively and at 1 mo and 1 yr postoperatively were
              identified in a retrospective review. Cost data from the Value
              Driven Outcomes database were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 52
              patients (83.0\% women, mean age 51.9 yr) were categorized by
              worsened (n = 7), unchanged (n = 24), or improved (n = 21)
              EQ-5D-3L index scores at 1-mo follow-up. No difference in
              subcategory cost contribution or total cost was seen in the 3
              groups. Patients with improved scores showed a steady improvement
              through each follow-up period, whereas those with unchanged or
              worsened scores did not. Mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
              and cost per QALY improved for all groups but at a higher rate
              for patients with better outcomes at 30-d follow-up. Female sex,
              absence of proptosis, nonfrontotemporal approaches, no optic
              nerve decompression, and absence of surgical complications
              demonstrated improved EQ-5D-3L scores at 1-yr follow-up. A mean

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE Tuberculum sellae meningiomas (TSMs) are surgically
              challenging tumors that can severely impair vision. Debate exists
              regarding whether the transcranial (TC) or endoscopic
              transsphenoidal (TS) approach is best for resecting these tumors,
              and there are few large series comparing these approaches.
              METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed at 2 academic
              centers comparing TC and TS approaches with respect to vision,
              extent of resection, recurrence, and complications. The authors
              report surgical outcomes and propose a simple preoperative tumor
              grading scale that scores tumor size (1-2), optic canal invasion
              (0-2), and arterial encasement (0-2). The authors performed
              univariate, multivariate, and recursive partitioning analysis
              (RPA) to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS The TSMs were resected in 139
              patients. The median follow-up was 29 months. Ninety-five (68\%)
              cases were resected via a TC and 44 (32\%) via a TS approach.
              Tumors treated via a TC approach had a higher tumor (p = 0.0007),
              artery (p < 0.0001), and total score (p = 0.0012) on the grading
              scale. Preoperative visual deficits were present in 87\% of
              patients. Vision improved in 47\%, stayed the same in 35\%,
              declined in 10\%, and was not recorded in 8\%. The extent of
              resection was 65\% gross-total resection, 23\% near-total
              resection (95\%-99\% resection), and 12\% subtotal resection (<
              95\%). A lower tumor score was significantly associated with
              better or stable vision postoperatively (p = 0.0052). The RPA
              confirmed low tumor score as the key predictor of postoperative
              visual improvement or stability. Multivariate analysis and RPA
              demonstrate that lower canal score (p < 0.0001) and TC approach
              (p = 0.0019) are associated with gross-total resection.
              Complications occurred in 20 (14\%) patients, including CSF leak
              (5\%) and infection (4\%). There was no difference in overall
              complication rates between TC and TS approaches; however, the TS
              approach had more CSF leaks (OR 5.96, 95\% CI 1.10-32.04). The
              observed recurrence rate was 10\%, and there was no difference
              between the TC and TS approaches. CONCLUSIONS Tuberculum sellae
              meningiomas can be resected using either a TC or TS approach,
              with low morbidity and good visual outcomes in appropriately
              selected patients. The simple proposed grading scale provides a
              standard preoperative method to evaluate TSMs and can serve as a
              starting point for selection of the surgical approach. Higher
              scores were associated with worsened visual outcomes and subtotal
              resection, regardless of approach. The authors plan a multicenter
              review of this grading scale to further evaluate its utility.",

              PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this study, 120 patients were
              prospectively recruited during 2001 and 2007 and evaluated after
              3 years of follow-up (KRANIOPHARYNGEOM 2000). Body mass index
              (BMI) and QoL at diagnosis and 36 months after diagnosis were
              analysed based on the reference assessment of tumour localisation
              and post-surgical hypothalamic lesions. Treatment was analysed
              based on the neurosurgical strategy of 50 participating
              neurosurgical centres, the centre size based on the patient load.
              RESULTS: BMI SDS at diagnosis was similar in patients with or
              without hypothalamic involvement. Surgical lesions of anterior
              and posterior hypothalamic areas were associated with higher
              increase in BMI SDS during 36 months post-diagnosis compared with
              patients without or only anterior lesion (+1.8 BMISD, P=0.033,
              +2.1 BMISD; P=0.011), negative impact on QoL in patients with
              posterior hypothalamic lesions. Surgical strategies varied among
              the 50 neurosurgical centres (three large-sized, 24 middle-sized
              and 23 small-sized centres). Patients treated in small-sized
              centres presented with a higher rate of hypothalamic involvement
              compared with those treated in the middle- and large-sized
              centres. Treatment in large-sized centres was less radical, and
              the rates of complete resection and hypothalamic surgical lesions
              were lower in large-sized centres than those of the middle- and
              small-sized centres. However, a multivariable analysis showed
              that pre-operative hypothalamic involvement was the only
              independent risk factor for severe obesity (P=0.002).
              CONCLUSIONS: Radical neurosurgical strategies leading to
              posterior hypothalamic lesions are not recommended due to the
              potential to exacerbate hypothalamic obesity and impaired QoL.

              however, no prospective data are available on this topic. METHODS
              A total of 58 patients with skull base meningiomas who underwent
              surgery for the first time were enrolled in this prospective
              single-center trial. The average age of the patients was 56.4
              $\pm$ 12.5 years. Seventy-nine percent of the tumors were located
              within the anterior skull base. Neurological examinations and
              neuropsychological testing were performed at 3 time points: 1 day
              prior to surgery (T1), 3-5 months after surgery (T2), and 9-12
              months after surgery (T3). The average follow-up duration was
              13.8 months. Neuropsychological assessment consisted of quality
              of life, depression and anxiety, verbal learning and memory,
              cognitive speed, attention and concentration, figural memory, and
              visual-motor speed. RESULTS Following surgery, 23\% of patients
              showed transient neurological deficits and 12\% showed permanent
              new neurological deficits with varying grades of manifestation.
              Postoperative quality of life, however, remained stable and was
              slightly improved at follow-up examinations at T3 (60.6 $\pm$
              21.5 vs 63.6 $\pm$ 24.1 points), and there was no observed effect
              on anxiety and depression. Long-term verbal memory, working

               postoperative LD on postoperative CSF leak following standard
               reconstruction. METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled
               trial of lumbar drain placement after endoscopic endonasal skull
               base surgery was performed from February 2011 to March 2015. All
               patients had 3-month follow-up data. Surgeons were blinded to
               which patients would or would not receive the drain until after
               closure was completed. An a priori power analysis calculation
               assuming 80\% of power, 5\% postoperative CSF leak rate in the
               no-LD group, and 16\% in the LD group determined a planned
               sample size of 186 patients. A routine data and safety check was
               performed with every 50 patients being recruited to ensure the
               efficacy of randomization and safety. These interim tests were
               run by a statistician who was not blinded to the arms they were
               evaluating. This study accrued 230 consecutive adult patients
               with skull base pathology who were eligible for endoscopic
               endonasal resection. Inclusion criteria (high-flow leak) were
               dural defect greater than 1 cm2 (mandatory), extensive arachnoid
               dissection, and/or dissection into a ventricle or cistern. Sixty
               patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion
               criteria. One hundred seventy patients were randomized to either
               receive or not receive a lumbar drain. RESULTS: One hundred
               seventy patients were randomized, with a mean age of 51.6 years
               (range 19-86 years) and 38\% were male. The mean BMI for the
               entire cohort was 28.1 kg/m2. The experimental cohort with
               postoperative LD had an 8.2\% rate of CSF leak compared to a
               21.2\% rate in the control group (odds ratio 3.0, 95\%
               confidence interval 1.2-7.6, p = 0.017). In 106 patients in whom
               defect size was measured intraoperatively, a larger defect was
               associated with postoperative CSF leak (6.2 vs 2.9 cm2, p =

               when patients were grouped based on BMI 30 kg/m2, no difference

              approaches to craniofacial resection. DESIGN: A retrospective
              analysis of 72 cases at 2 academic medical centers. The main
              parameters analyzed were the disease entities treated, the
              average operating room time, the average amount of blood loss,
              the number of transfusions, the length of intensive care unit and
              hospital stays, and complication rates. These were compared with
              published data for traditional craniofacial approaches. SETTING:
              All patients were operated on by the authors in collaboration
              with neurosurgical teams at the State University of New York
              Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, and the University of
              Michigan Hospital, Ann Arbor. PATIENTS: The
              transglabellar/subcranial approach was performed 72 times in 69
              patients in this series. Forty-two procedures in 40 patients were
              performed for malignant disease and 30 procedures in 29 patients
              were performed for benign entities. Patients' ages ranged from 2
              to 78 years. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 4 years, with a
              minimum follow-up of 1 year for survivors. RESULTS: There were no
              operative mortalities. Operating time, average amount of blood
              loss, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, and
              complication rates compared favorably with published results of
              traditional craniofacial resections. CONCLUSIONS: The
              transglabellar/subcranial approach to the anterior skull base may
              be a reasonable technique for the surgical management of lesions
              in the region of the anterior skull base. It provides excellent
              exposure of the nasal cavity, the orbits, and the ethmoid and

              different cell types on histology occur in the skull base. A wide
              variety in disease and lesion appearance often complicates the
              process of radiological diagnosis. The main role of radiographic
              imaging is the detection and characterization of skull base
              lesions, with evaluation of the extent of invasion or
              preservation of adjacent critical organs. Evaluation of the skull
              base anatomy and surgical planning by using image guidance are
              also important for surgeons. Computed tomography (CT) and
              magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the preferred modalities for
              the evaluation of skull base lesions. CT and MR are used for
              lesion detection, tissue characterization and assessment of
              neurovascular and bone involvement by the lesions. Both
              modalities provide useful information, one sometimes of greater
              value than the other. T1-weighted MR imaging is useful in
              detecting skull base lesions, typically surrounded by abundant
              fatty bone marrow. T2-weighted MR imaging is generally useful for
              tumor tissue characterization. CT surpasses MR imaging in
              evaluating intratumoral calcification and bone destruction or
              hyperostosis. To date, imaging features have been well-reported
              in individual skull base tumors; however, correct diagnosis by

                   components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of
                   data augmentations plays a critical role in defining
                   effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pituitary adenomas and nonadenomatous lesions in the
              sellar region may be difficult to distinguish by imaging yet that
              distinction is critical in guiding management. The nature of the
              diagnostic errors in this setting has not been well documented.
              METHODS: Two neurosurgeons and 2 neuroradiologists of differing
              experience levels viewed deidentified MRIs of 18 nonadenomatous
              sellar lesions and 21 adenomas. They recorded their diagnoses,
              the imaging features they used to make those diagnoses, and their
              confidence in making those diagnoses. RESULTS: Among the 18
              nonadenoma cases, 11 (61\%) were incorrectly diagnosed as adenoma
              by at least 1 reader, including Rathke cleft cyst, plasmacytoma,
              aneurysm, craniopharyngioma, chordoma, Langerhans cell
              histiocytosis, metastasis, and undifferentiated sinonasal
              carcinoma. Among the 21 adenoma cases, 8 (38\%) were incorrectly
              diagnosed by at least 1 reader as craniopharyngioma, Rathke cleft
              cyst, sinonasal carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pituitary
              hyperplasia. Incorrect imaging diagnoses were made with high
              confidence in 13\% of readings. Avoidable errors among the
              nonadenomatous cases occurred when readers failed to appreciate
              that the lesion was separate from the pituitary gland.
              Unavoidable errors in those cases occurred when the lesions were
              so large that the pituitary gland had been obliterated or the
              imaging features of a nonadenomatous lesion resembled those of a
              cystic pituitary adenoma. Avoidable errors in misdiagnosis of
              adenomas as nonadenomas occurred when readers failed to
              appreciate features highly characteristic of adenomas. An
              unavoidable error occurred because a cystic adenoma had features
              correctly associated with craniopharyngioma. CONCLUSIONS: Errors
              in imaging differentiation of pituitary adenoma from
              nonadenomatous lesions occurred often and sometimes with high
              confidence among a small sample of neurosurgeons and
              neuroradiologists. In the misdiagnosis of nonadenomatous lesions
              as adenomas, errors occurred largely from failure to appreciate a
              separate pituitary gland, but unavoidable errors occurred when
              large lesions had obliterated this distinguishing feature. In the
              misdiagnosis of adenomas as nonadenomatous lesions, avoidable
              errors occurred because readers failed to recognize imaging
              features more characteristic of adenomas and because cystic
              adenomas share features with craniopharyngiomas and Rathke cleft
              cysts. Awareness of these errors should lead to improved
              management of sellar lesions.",

              visible on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However,
              management and outcome of acromegalic patients lacking imaging
              evidence of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas are undefined.
              OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate surgical exploration for
              MR-invisible GH-secreting pituitary adenomas. DESIGN AND SETTING:
              We conducted a retrospective review at two tertiary care centers.
              PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive acromegalic patients
              without imaging evidence of a pituitary adenoma on pre- and
              postcontrast, spin echo T1-weighted MR imaging and who lacked
              evidence of an ectopic (nonpituitary) source causing GH excess
              were included. INTERVENTIONS: Surgical exploration with
              identification and resection of a pituitary adenoma was
              performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory values (GH, IGF-I),
              surgical findings, and clinical outcome were analyzed. RESULTS:
              Six patients (three males, three females; 3\% of all patients)
              with suspected GH-secreting adenomas did not demonstrate imaging
              evidence of pituitary adenoma on conventional MR imaging. Three
              patients underwent a postcontrast, volumetric interpolated
              breath-hold examination MR-imaging sequence (1.2-mm slice
              thickness), which revealed a 4-mm pituitary adenoma not seen on
              the spin echo T1-weighted MR imaging in one patient. A pituitary
              adenoma was identified and removed in all patients (mean
              diameter, 5.6 mm; range, 5 to 6.7 mm). Histological analysis
              confirmed that the lesions were GH-secreting adenomas. All
              patients achieved biochemical remission after surgical resection.
              CONCLUSION: Acromegaly can be caused by GH-secreting pituitary
              adenomas that are not evident on conventional MR imaging.
              Adenomas in some of these patients become evident using
              volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination MR imaging.

              OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of
              inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) in predicting adenoma
              lateralization. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a prospective
              observational study at a tertiary care clinical research center.
              PATIENTS: A total of 501 consecutive patients (363 female) with
              confirmed ACTH adenomas and IPSS were included. MAIN OUTCOME
              MEASURE: We measured the accuracy of IPSS to predict the
              intrasellar location of an adenoma. RESULTS: IPSS confirmed a
              pituitary source of ACTH secretion in 491 patients (98\%). All 10
              patients with false-negative results had peak IPSS ACTH
              concentrations (before or after CRH) of < 400 pg/ml.
              Interpetrosal (side-to-side) ratios were $\geq$ 1.4 in 491
              patients (98\%). This ratio correctly predicted lateralization in
              273 of 396 patients (positive predictive value = 69\%) with a
              lateral adenoma. Left-sided IPSS lateralization (P = .008) and
              consistent lateralization before and after CRH administration (P
              = .02) were associated with enhanced accuracy. When positive,
              preoperative MRI correlated with adenoma location in 171 of 201
              patients (positive predictive value = 86\%). CONCLUSIONS:
              Potential false-negative results, the most common type of
              diagnostic error with IPSS for the differential diagnosis of CS,
              can be identified by peak IPSS ACTH values < 400 pg/ml. When MRI
              is normal, IPSS can be used to guide surgical exploration in
              patients with negative preoperative imaging. However, because of
              the limited accuracy of lateralization, thorough exploration of
              the pituitary gland is required when an adenoma is not readily
              discovered based on predicted location.",

              survival prospects for patients with Cushing's disease. We
              studied life expectancy in patients who had received curative
              treatment and whose hypercortisolism remained in remission for
              more than 10 years, and identified factors determining their
              survival. METHODS: We did a multicentre, multinational,
              retrospective cohort study using individual case records from
              specialist referral centres in the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands,
              and New Zealand. Inclusion criteria for participants, who had all
              been in studies reported previously in peer-reviewed
              publications, were diagnosis and treatment of Cushing's disease,
              being cured of hypercortisolism for a minimum of 10 years at
              study entry, and continuing to be cured with no relapses until
              the database was frozen or death. We identified the number and
              type of treatments used to achieve cure, and used mortality as
              our primary endpoint. We compared mortality rates between
              patients with Cushing's disease and the general population, and
              expressed them as standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). We
              analysed survival data with multivariate analysis (Cox
              regression) with no corrections for multiple testing. FINDINGS:
              The census dates on which the data were frozen ranged from Dec
              31, 2009, to Dec 1, 2014. We obtained data for 320 patients with
              3790 person-years of follow-up from 10 years after cure
              (female:male ratio of 3:1). The median patient follow-up was 11·8
              years (IQR 17-26) from study entry and did not differ between
              countries. There were no significant differences in demographic
              characteristics, duration of follow-up, comorbidities, treatment
              number, or type of treatment between women and men, so we pooled
              data from both sexes for survival analysis. 51 (16\%) of the
              cohort died during follow-up from study entry (10 years after
              cure). Median survival from study entry was similar for women (31
              years; IQR 19-38) and men (28 years; 24-42), and about 40 years
              (IQR 30-48) from remission. The overall SMR for all-cause
              mortality was 1·61 (95\% CI 1·23-2·12; p=0·0001). The SMR for
              circulatory disease was increased at 2·72 (1·88-3·95; p<0·0001),
              but deaths from cancer were not higher than expected (0·79,
              0·41-1·51). Presence of diabetes, but not hypertension, was an
              independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 2·82, 95\% CI
              1·29-6·17; p=0·0095). We noted a step-wise reduction in survival
              with increasing number of treatments. Patients cured by pituitary
              surgery alone had long-term survival similar to that of the
              general population (SMR 0·95, 95\% CI 0·58-1·55) compared with
              those who were not (2·53, 1·82-3·53; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION:
              Patients with Cushing's disease who have been in remission for
              more than 10 years are at increased risk of overall mortality
              compared with the general population, particularly from
              circulatory disease. However, median survival from cure is
              excellent at about 40 years of remission. Treatment complexity
              and an increased number of treatments, reflecting disease that is
              more difficult to control, appears to negatively affect survival.
              Pituitary surgery alone is the preferred treatment to secure an
              optimum outcome, and should be done in a centre of surgical
              excellence. FUNDING: None.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVEThe authors report their single-institution experience
              with the pathological findings, rates of remission, and
              complications in patients with presumed Cushing's disease (CD)
              who underwent a two-thirds pituitary gland resection when no
              adenoma was identified at the time of transsphenoidal surgery
              (TSS). The authors also review the literature on patients with
              CD, negative surgical exploration, and histological
              findings.METHODSThis study is a retrospective analysis of cases
              found in neurosurgery and pathology department databases between
              1989 and 2011. In all cases, patients had been operated on by the
              same neurosurgeon (K.O.L.). Twenty-two (13.6\%) of 161 patients
              who underwent TSS for CD had no adenoma identified
              intraoperatively after systematic exploration of the entire
              gland; these patients all underwent a two-thirds pituitary gland
              resection. A chart review was performed to assess treatment data
              points as well as clinical and biochemical remission
              status.RESULTSOf the 22 patients who underwent two-thirds gland
              resection, 6 (27.3\%) ultimately had lesions found on final
              pathology. All 6 patients were found to have a distinct
              adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cell adenoma. Sixteen (72.7\%)
              of the patients had no tumor identified, with 3 of these patients
              suspected of having ACTH cell hyperplasia. The follow-up duration
              for the entire group was between 14 and 315 months (mean 98.9
              months, median 77 months). Remission rates were 100\% (6/6
              patients) for the ACTH cell adenoma group and 75\% (12/16) for
              the group without adenoma. Overall, 18 (81.8\%) of the 22
              patients had no evidence of hypercortisolism at last follow-up,
              and 4 patients (18\%) had persistent hypercortisolism, defined as
              a postoperative cortisol level > 5 $\mu$g/dl. Of these 4
              patients, 1 was suspected of harboring a cavernous sinus adenoma,
              2 were found to have lung tumors secreting ACTH, and 1 remained
              with an undiagnosed etiology. Rates of postoperative
              complications were low.CONCLUSIONSThe diagnosis and treatment of
              CD can be challenging for neurosurgeons, endocrinologists, and
              pathologists alike. Failure to find a discrete adenoma at the
              time of surgery occurs in at least 10\%-15\% of cases, even in
              experienced centers. The current literature provides little
              guidance regarding rational intraoperative approaches in such
              cases. The authors' experience with 161 patients with CD, when no
              intraoperative tumor was localized, demonstrates the utility of a
              two-thirds pituitary gland resection with a novel and effective
              surgical strategy, as suggested by a high initial remission rate
              and a low operative morbidity.",

              Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the
              interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false
              positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial
              intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human
              experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in
              the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset
              from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an
              absolute reduction of 5.7\% and 1.2\% (USA and UK) in false
              positives and 9.4\% and 2.7\% in false negatives. We provide
              evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK
              to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI

              technology that may serve to expedite the acquisition and
              interpretation of histologic data in the operating room. METHODS:
              A blinded, prospective cohort study of 82 patients undergoing
              resection for tumors of the central nervous system was performed.
              Twenty-six patients with diagnoses of meningioma on SRH, frozen,

              Diagnostic time and accuracy of stimulated SRH histology images

              of SRH and frozen section diagnosis with permanent section (true)

              significantly shorter for SRH-mediated diagnosis compared with
              frozen section (9.2 vs. 35.8, P < 0.0001). Diagnostic accuracy

              Raman histology (SRH) is a novel technology that allows for rapid

              METHODS: The authors performed a prospective blinded cohort study
              of 82 consecutive patients undergoing resection of CNS tumors to
              compare diagnostic time and accuracy of SRH simulation to the
              gold standard, i.e., frozen and permanent section diagnosis.
              Diagnostic accuracy was determined by concordance of

               to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical
               image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches
               are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used
               in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we
               propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a
               volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is
               trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns
               to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We
               introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during
               training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal
               with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the

  abstract = "We propose a technique for producing `visual explanations' for
              decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network
              (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent and explainable.
              Our approach---Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
              (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say `dog'
              in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning
              network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a
              coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the
              image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches,
              Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families:
              (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for
              structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with
              multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or
              reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or
              re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained
              visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative
              visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image
              classification, image captioning, and visual question answering
              (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the
              context of image classification models, our visualizations (a)
              lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that
              seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations),
              (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15
              weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to
              adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the
              underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by
              identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our
              visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to
              localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way
              to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it
              with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern
              recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model
              decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to
              measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate
              trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM
              helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep
              network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical
              predictions. Our code is available at

               interventions. More recently, there has been a growing
               recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence
               (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to
               demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI
               (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials--Artificial
               Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for
               clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component.
               It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for
               clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items:
               Recommendations for Interventional Trials--Artificial
               Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged
               consensus process involving literature review and expert
               consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed
               by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage
               Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day
               consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a
               checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension
               includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently
               important for AI interventions that they should be routinely
               reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI
               recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the
               AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for
               use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the
               handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the
               human--AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error
               cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and
               completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions.
               It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the
               general readership, to understand, interpret and critically
               appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias

              Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central
              nervous system (CNS). Tumors of this entity arise in CNS midline
              structures of predominantly pediatric patients and are associated
              with an overall dismal prognosis. They are defined by K27M
              mutations in H3F3A or HIST1H3B/C, encoding for histone 3 variants
              H3.3 and H3.1, respectively, which are considered hallmark events
              driving gliomagenesis. Methods: Here, we characterized 85
              centrally reviewed diffuse gliomas on midline locations enrolled
              in the nationwide pediatric German HIT-HGG registry regarding
              tumor site, histone 3 mutational status, WHO grade, age, sex, and
              extent of tumor resection. Results: We found 56 H3.3 K27M-mutant
              tumors (66\%), 6 H3.1 K27M-mutant tumors (7\%), and 23
              H3-wildtype tumors (27\%). H3 K27M-mutant gliomas shared an
              aggressive clinical course independent of their anatomic
              location. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed the
              significant impact of the H3 K27M mutation as the only
              independent parameter predictive of overall survival (P = 0.009).
              In H3 K27M-mutant tumors, neither anatomic midline location nor
              histopathological grading nor extent of tumor resection had an

              radiation therapy has been the mainstay of treatment for decades.
              Recent advances in the biological understanding of the disease

              glioma (DIPG) provides clinical background, a systematic approach
              to diagnosis and initial care, and synthesizes historical,
              modern, and future directions for treatment. We present evidence
              supporting neurosurgical biopsy, early palliative care
              involvement, limitation of glucocorticoid use, and the leveraging
              of preclinical DIPG models as a pipeline to next-generation
              clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: New molecular understanding of
              pediatric high-grade gliomas has led to the reclassification of
              DIPG as one member of a family of diffuse gliomas occurring in
              the midline of the central nervous system that exhibit
              pathognomonic mutations in genes encoding histone 3 (H3 K27M).
              DIPG remains a clinically relevant term, though diagnostically
              the 80\% of DIPG cases that exhibit the H3 K27M mutation have
              been reclassified as diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant.
              Re-irradiation has been shown to be well-tolerated and of
              potential benefit. Epigenetic targeting of transcriptional
              dependencies in preclinical models is fueling molecularly
              targeted clinical trials. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell
              immunotherapy has also demonstrated efficacy in preclinical
              models and provides a promising new clinical strategy. DIPG is a
              universally fatal, epigenetically driven tumor of the pons that
              is considered part of a broader class of diffuse midline gliomas
              sharing H3 K27M mutations. Radiation remains the standard of
              care, single-agent temozolomide is not recommended, and
              glucocorticoids should be used only sparingly. A rapid evolution
              of understanding in the chromatin, signaling, and immunological
              biology of DIPG may soon result in clinical breakthroughs.",

               As IDH is a very important prognostic, diagnostic and
               therapeutic biomarker for glioma, it is of paramount importance
               to determine its mutational status. The haematoxylin and eosin
               (H\&E) staining is a valuable tool in precision oncology as it
               guides histopathology-based diagnosis and proceeding patient's
               treatment. However, H\&E staining alone does not determine the
               IDH mutational status of a tumour. Deep learning methods applied
               to MRI data have been demonstrated to be a useful tool in IDH
               status prediction, however the effectiveness of deep learning on
               H\&E slides in the clinical setting has not been investigated so
               far. Furthermore, the performance of deep learning methods in
               medical imaging has been practically limited by small sample
               sizes currently available. Here we propose a data augmentation
               method based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) deep
               learning methodology, to improve the prediction performance of
               IDH mutational status using H\&E slides. The H\&E slides were
               acquired from 266 grade II-IV glioma patients from a mixture of
               public and private databases, including 130 IDH-wildtype and 136
               IDH-mutant patients. A baseline deep learning model without data
               augmentation achieved an accuracy of 0.794 (AUC = 0.920). With
               GAN-based data augmentation, the accuracy of the IDH mutational
               status prediction was improved to 0.853 (AUC = 0.927) when the
               3,000 GAN generated training samples were added to the original
               training set (24,000 samples). By integrating also patients' age
               into the model, the accuracy improved further to 0.882 (AUC =
               0.931). Our findings show that deep learning methodology,
               enhanced by GAN data augmentation, can support physicians in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: There is high demand to develop computer-assisted
              diagnostic tools to evaluate prostate core needle biopsies
              (CNBs), but little clinical validation and a lack of clinical
              deployment of such tools. We report here on a blinded clinical
              validation study and deployment of an artificial intelligence
              (AI)-based algorithm in a pathology laboratory for routine
              clinical use to aid prostate diagnosis. METHODS: An AI-based
              algorithm was developed using haematoxylin and eosin
              (H\&E)-stained slides of prostate CNBs digitised with a Philips
              scanner, which were divided into training (1 357 480 image
              patches from 549 H\&E-stained slides) and internal test (2501
              H\&E-stained slides) datasets. The algorithm provided slide-level
              scores for probability of cancer, Gleason score 7-10 (vs Gleason
              score 6 or atypical small acinar proliferation [ASAP]), Gleason
              pattern 5, and perineural invasion and calculation of cancer
              percentage present in CNB material. The algorithm was
              subsequently validated on an external dataset of 100 consecutive
              cases (1627 H\&E-stained slides) digitised on an Aperio AT2
              scanner. In addition, the AI tool was implemented in a pathology
              laboratory within routine clinical workflow as a second read
              system to review all prostate CNBs. Algorithm performance was
              assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic
              curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity, as well as Pearson's
              correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) for cancer percentage.
              FINDINGS: The algorithm achieved an AUC of 0·997 (95\% CI 0·995
              to 0·998) for cancer detection in the internal test set and 0·991
              (0·979 to 1·00) in the external validation set. The AUC for
              distinguishing between a low-grade (Gleason score 6 or ASAP) and
              high-grade (Gleason score 7-10) cancer diagnosis was 0·941 (0·905
              to 0·977) and the AUC for detecting Gleason pattern 5 was 0·971
              (0·943 to 0·998) in the external validation set. Cancer
              percentage calculated by pathologists and the algorithm showed
              good agreement (r=0·882, 95\% CI 0·834 to 0·915; p<0·0001) with a
              mean bias of -4·14\% (-6·36 to -1·91). The algorithm achieved an
              AUC of 0·957 (0·930 to 0·985) for perineural invasion. In routine
              practice, the algorithm was used to assess 11 429 H\&E-stained
              slides pertaining to 941 cases leading to 90 Gleason score 7-10
              alerts and 560 cancer alerts. 51 (9\%) cancer alerts led to
              additional cuts or stains being ordered, two (4\%) of which led
              to a third opinion request. We report on the first case of missed
              cancer that was detected by the algorithm. INTERPRETATION: This
              study reports the successful development, external clinical
              validation, and deployment in clinical practice of an AI-based
              algorithm to accurately detect, grade, and evaluate clinically

              imaging by applying a residual convolutional neural network to
              preoperative radiographic data.Experimental Design: Preoperative
              imaging was acquired for 201 patients from the Hospital of
              University of Pennsylvania (HUP), 157 patients from Brigham and
              Women's Hospital (BWH), and 138 patients from The Cancer Imaging
              Archive (TCIA) and divided into training, validation, and testing
              sets. We trained a residual convolutional neural network for each
              MR sequence (FLAIR, T2, T1 precontrast, and T1 postcontrast) and
              built a predictive model from the outputs. To increase the size
              of the training set and prevent overfitting, we augmented the
              training set images by introducing random rotations,
              translations, flips, shearing, and zooming.Results: With our
              neural network model, we achieved IDH prediction accuracies of
              82.8\% (AUC = 0.90), 83.0\% (AUC = 0.93), and 85.7\% (AUC = 0.94)
              within training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. When
              age at diagnosis was incorporated into the model, the training,
              validation, and testing accuracies increased to 87.3\% (AUC =
              0.93), 87.6\% (AUC = 0.95), and 89.1\% (AUC = 0.95),

              conventional MR imaging using a multi-institutional data set.

              accurate, MRI-based, voxelwise deep-learning IDH classification
              network using T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and compare its
              performance to a multicontrast network. METHODS: Multiparametric
              brain MRI data and corresponding genomic information were
              obtained for 214 subjects (94 IDH-mutated, 120 IDH wild-type)
              from The Cancer Imaging Archive and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Two
              separate networks were developed, including a T2w image-only
              network (T2-net) and a multicontrast (T2w, fluid attenuated
              inversion recovery, and T1 postcontrast) network (TS-net) to
              perform IDH classification and simultaneous single label tumor
              segmentation. The networks were trained using 3D Dense-UNets.
              Three-fold cross-validation was performed to generalize the
              networks' performance. Receiver operating characteristic analysis
              was also performed. Dice scores were computed to determine tumor
              segmentation accuracy. RESULTS: T2-net demonstrated a mean
              cross-validation accuracy of 97.14\% $\pm$ 0.04 in predicting IDH
              mutation status, with a sensitivity of 0.97 $\pm$ 0.03,
              specificity of 0.98 $\pm$ 0.01, and an area under the curve (AUC)
              of 0.98 $\pm$ 0.01. TS-net achieved a mean cross-validation
              accuracy of 97.12\% $\pm$ 0.09, with a sensitivity of 0.98 $\pm$
              0.02, specificity of 0.97 $\pm$ 0.001, and an AUC of 0.99 $\pm$

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The World Health Organization has
              recently placed new emphasis on the integration of genetic
              information for gliomas. While tissue sampling remains the
              criterion standard, noninvasive imaging techniques may provide
              complimentary insight into clinically relevant genetic mutations.
              Our aim was to train a convolutional neural network to
              independently predict underlying molecular genetic mutation
              status in gliomas with high accuracy and identify the most
              predictive imaging features for each mutation. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: MR imaging data and molecular information were
              retrospectively obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archives for 259
              patients with either low- or high-grade gliomas. A convolutional
              neural network was trained to classify isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
              (IDH1) mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion, and
              O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promotor
              methylation status. Principal component analysis of the final
              convolutional neural network layer was used to extract the key
              imaging features critical for successful classification. RESULTS:
              Classification had high accuracy: IDH1 mutation status, 94\%;
              1p/19q codeletion, 92\%; and MGMT promotor methylation status,
              83\%. Each genetic category was also associated with distinctive
              imaging features such as definition of tumor margins, T1 and
              FLAIR suppression, extent of edema, extent of necrosis, and
              textural features. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that for The
              Cancer Imaging Archives dataset, machine-learning approaches
              allow classification of individual genetic mutations of both low-
              and high-grade gliomas. We show that relevant MR imaging features
              acquired from an added dimensionality-reduction technique
              demonstrate that neural networks are capable of learning key
              imaging components without prior feature selection or

              11-52 years who received primary treatment for craniopharyngioma
              between 1980 and 2009 at the University of California, San
              Francisco (UCSF). Primary endpoints were progression free
              survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints
              were development of panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus (DI),
              and visual field defects. Of 122 patients, 30 (24\%) were treated
              with gross total resection (GTR) without radiation therapy (RT),
              3 (3\%) with GTR + RT, 41 (33.6\%) with subtotal resection (STR)
              without RT, and 48 (39.3\%) with STR + RT. Median age at
              diagnosis was 30 years, with 46 patients 18 years or younger.
              Median follow-up for all patients was 56.4 months (interquartile
              range 18.9-144.2 months) and 47 months (interquartile range
              12.3-121.8 months) for the 60 patients without progression. Fifty
              six patients progressed, 10 have died, 6 without progression.
              Median PFS was 61.1 months for all patients. PFS rate at 2 years
              was 61.5\% (95\% CI: 52.1-70.9). OS rate at 10 years was 91.1\%
              (95\% CI 84.3-97.9). There was no significant difference in PFS
              and OS between patients treated with GTR vs. STR + XRT (PFS; p =
              0.544, OS; p = 0.735), but STR alone resulted in significantly
              shortened PFS compared to STR + RT or GTR (p < 0.001 for both).
              STR was associated with significantly shortened OS compared to
              STR + RT (p = 0.050) and trended to shorter OS compared to GTR (p
              = 0.066). GTR was associated with significantly greater risk of
              developing DI (56.3 vs. 13.3\% with STR + XRT, p < 0.001) and
              panhypopituitarism (54.8 vs. 26.7\% with STR + XRT, p = 0.014).
              In conclusion, for patients with craniopharyngioma, STR + RT may
              provide superior clinical outcome, achieving better disease
              control than STR and limiting side effects associated with
              aggressive surgical resection.",

              paradigm shift in the management of cavernous sinus meningiomas.
              Nevertheless, patients are still significantly affected by
              cranial nerve deficits related to the mass effect of these
              tumors. Our management strategy involves the combination of a
              functional surgical decompression followed by radiation therapy.
              Methods: We reviewed a single institution's cohort of patients
              who underwent endoscopic endonasal decompression (EED) for
              symptomatic meningiomas primarily involving the cavernous sinus
              (CS) from 2010 to 2016. The preoperative neuro-ophthalmological
              exam was compared to the 1- and 6-month postoperative exams. The
              patient's length of hospital stay, complications, and
              radiological and clinical follow-up were noted. Results: A total
              of 17 patients underwent EED for CS meningiomas that fit our
              radiological criteria. The final outcome at the 6-month visit
              showed five patients (62.5\%) with normalization of deficit and
              three patients (37.5\%) with partial improvement of the CNII
              deficit. Out of the 12 patients who had cavernous sinus cranial
              nerves (CSCN) deficits, the final outcome at the 6-month visit
              showed four patients (33.33\%) with normalization of deficit,
              seven patients (58.3\%) with partial improvement, and one patient
              (8.33\%) with no improvement. There were no intraoperative
              complications. Conclusion: The EED for CS meningiomas is a
              valuable technique when addressing acute/subacute CNII and CSCN
              deficits. This conservative surgical approach showed good
              functional outcomes, low morbidity, and low complication rates.

                   Classification Transformer (C-Tran), a general framework for
                   multi-label image classification that leverages Transformers
                   to exploit the complex dependencies among visual features
                   and labels. Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder
                   trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set
                   of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional
                   neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label
                   mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme

              dynamic properties and 21 a unique, actionable, spatial

              22 fascicles of spindle-like and aligned cells with mesenchymal

              in genetically engineered mouse glioma models, and high grade 24
              human gliomas. Oncostreams facilitate the intra-tumoral
              distribution of tumoral and non-25 tumoral cells, and the
              invasion of the normal brain. These fascicles are defined by a
              specific 26 molecular signature that regulates their organization
              and function. Oncostreams structure and 27 function depend on
              overexpression of COL1A1. COL1A1 is a central gene in the dynamic
              28 organization of glioma mesenchymal transformation, and a
              powerful regulator of glioma 29 malignant behavior. Inhibition of

              modern neuro-oncology. Noninvasive radiographic imaging is unable
              to definitively differentiate true recurrence versus
              pseudoprogression. Even in biopsied tissue, it can be challenging
              to differentiate recurrent tumor and treatment effect. We
              hypothesized that intraoperative stimulated Raman histology (SRH)
              and deep neural networks can be used to improve the
              intraoperative detection of glioma recurrence. METHODS: We used
              fiber-laser-based SRH, a label-free, non-consumptive,
              high-resolution microscopy method (<60 secs per 1 x 1 mm2) to
              image a cohort of patients (n = 35) with suspected recurrent
              gliomas who underwent biopsy or resection. The SRH images were
              then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and
              develop an inference algorithm to detect viable recurrent glioma.
              Following network training, the performance of the CNN was tested
              for diagnostic accuracy in a retrospective cohort (n = 48).
              RESULTS: Using patch-level CNN predictions, the inference
              algorithm returned a single Bernoulli distribution for the
              probability of tumor recurrence for each surgical specimen or
              patient. The external SRH validation dataset consisted of 48
              patients (recurrent, 30; pseudoprogression, 18), and we achieved
              a diagnostic accuracy of 95.8\%. CONCLUSION: SRH with CNN-based
              diagnosis can be used to improve the intraoperative detection of
              glioma recurrence in near-real time. Our results provide insight

              The presence of tumor in three anatomic sites (the sella, the
              sphenoid sinus, and the orbital apex) was also correlated with
              surgical complications. RESULTS: Category 1 tumors, which do not
              completely encircle the cavernous carotid artery, were dissected
              without injury, sacrifice, or grafting of the artery in 91\% of
              cases. Category 2 lesions completely encircle the artery but do
              not narrow its lumen; they could be dissected from the cavernous
              carotid artery without arterial injury in 61\% of cases, but
              imaging failed to discriminate differences within this group.
              Category 3 lesions, which completely encircle and narrow the
              cavernous carotid artery, are usually difficult to dissect free
              from the artery. The categories also correlated with recovery of
              extraocular motility; 84\% of category 1 lesions compared with
              only 36\% of category 2 or 3 lesions will recover to good or
              excellent extraocular motility after cavernous sinus surgery.
              Tumor involvement of the sella, orbital apex, and sphenoid sinus
              correlated with postoperative endocrine dysfunction, decreased
              visual acuity, and CSF leak, respectively. CONCLUSION: Imaging
              studies can frequently predict the difficulty of resecting
              cavernous sinus meningiomas from the cavernous carotid artery and
              the likelihood of permanent loss of extraocular motility after
              surgery on these lesions. This information is helpful in
              appropriate preoperative planning and in providing information to
              patients about to undergo such surgery.",

  abstract = "OBJECT: Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are benign tumors of the
              eighth cranial nerve sheath, representing approximately 6\%-8\%
              of all newly diagnosed brain tumors, with an annual incidence of
              2000-2500 cases in the US. Although most of these lesions are
              solid, cystic vestibular schwannomas (CVSs) compose 4\%-20\% of
              all VSs and are commonly larger at the time of presentation. The
              authors present their experience with the operative management of
              CVSs, including surgical approach, extent of resection, and
              postoperative facial nerve outcomes. The literature pertaining to
              clinical and histopathological differences between CVSs and their
              solid counterparts is reviewed. METHODS: The University of
              Southern California Department of Neurosurgery database was
              retrospectively reviewed to identify patients who had undergone
              resection of a VS between 2000 and 2010. One hundred seventy-nine
              patients with VS were identified. Patients with CVSs were the
              subject of the present analysis. Diagnosis of a CVS was made
              based on MRI findings. Clinical and neuroimaging data, including
              pre- and postoperative assessments and operative notes, were
              collected and reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients, 14 men
              (61\%) and 9 women (39\%), underwent 24 operations for CVSs.
              These patients composed 12.8\% of all cases of VS. Patient ages
              ranged from 28 to 78 years (mean 55 years), and the mean maximal
              tumor diameter was 3.6 cm (range 2.0-4.0 cm). Patients most
              frequently presented with headache, hearing loss, vertigo, and
              dizziness. Preoperative facial numbness was reported in 44\% of
              patients. Among the 24 cases, 13 were treated with retrosigmoid
              craniotomy and 11 via a translabyrinthine approach. Complete
              resection was achieved in 11 patients (48\%), subtotal resection
              (STR) in 8 patients (35\%), and near-total resection (NTR) in 4
              patients (17\%). Facial nerve outcomes were available in all
              except one case. Good facial nerve outcomes (House-Brackmann [HB]
              Grades I-III) were achieved in 82\% of the patients who had
              undergone either NTR or STR, as compared with 73\% of patients
              who had undergone gross-total resection (GTR; p > 0.05, Fisher
              exact test). In comparison, 83\% of patients with solid VSs had a
              good HB grade (p = 0.38, Fisher exact test), although this
              finding did not reach statistical significance. Complications
              included wound infection (2 patients), delayed CSF leakage (1
              patient), and a delayed temporal encephalocele following a
              translabyrinthine approach and requiring surgical repair (1
              patient). CONCLUSIONS: Cystic vestibular schwannoma represents a
              clinical and surgical entity separate from its solid counterpart,
              as demonstrated by its more rapid clinical course and early
              surgical outcomes. Facial nerve grades may correlate with the
              degree of tumor resection, trending toward poorer grades with
              more significant resections. Although GTR is recommended whenever
              possible, performing an STR when facial nerve preservation is in
              jeopardy to improve facial nerve outcomes is the preferred
              strategy at the authors' institution.",

  abstract = "OBJECT: Tumor consistency plays an important and underrecognized
              role in the surgeon's ability to resect meningiomas, especially
              with evolving trends toward minimally invasive and keyhole
              surgical approaches. Aside from descriptors such as ``hard'' or
              ``soft,'' no objective criteria exist for grading, studying, and
              conveying the consistency of meningiomas. METHODS: The authors
              designed a practical 5-point scale for intraoperative grading of
              meningiomas based on the surgeon's ability to internally debulk
              the tumor and on the subsequent resistance to folding of the
              tumor capsule. Tumor consistency grades and features are as
              follows: 1) extremely soft tumor, internal debulking with suction
              only; 2) soft tumor, internal debulking mostly with suction, and
              remaining fibrous strands resected with easily folded capsule; 3)
              average consistency, tumor cannot be freely suctioned and
              requires mechanical debulking, and the capsule then folds with
              relative ease; 4) firm tumor, high degree of mechanical debulking
              required, and capsule remains difficult to fold; and 5) extremely
              firm, calcified tumor, approaches density of bone, and capsule
              does not fold. Additional grading categories included tumor
              heterogeneity (with minimum and maximum consistency scores) and a
              3-point vascularity score. This grading system was prospectively
              assessed in 50 consecutive patients undergoing craniotomy for
              meningioma resection by 2 surgeons in an independent fashion.
              Grading scores were subjected to a linear weighted kappa analysis
              for interuser reliability. RESULTS: Fifty patients (100 scores)
              were included in the analysis. The mean maximal tumor diameter
              was 4.3 cm. The distribution of overall tumor consistency scores
              was as follows: Grade 1, 4\%; Grade 2, 9\%; Grade 3, 43\%; Grade
              4, 44\%; and Grade 5, 0\%. Regions of Grade 5 consistency were
              reported only focally in 14\% of heterogeneous tumors. Tumors
              were designated as homogeneous in 68\% and heterogeneous in 32\%
              of grades. The kappa analysis score for overall tumor consistency
              grade was 0.87 (SE 0.06, 95\% CI 0.76-0.99), with 90\% user
              agreement. Kappa analysis scores for minimum and maximum grades
              of tumor regions were 0.69 (agreement 72\%) and 0.75 (agreement
              78\%), respectively. The kappa analysis score for tumor
              vascularity grading was 0.56 (agreement 76\%). Overall
              consistency did not correlate with patient age, tumor location,
              or tumor size. A higher tumor vascularity grade was associated
              with a larger tumor diameter (p = 0.045) and with skull base
              location (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed grading system
              provides a reliable, practical, and objective assessment of
              meningioma consistency and facilitates communication among
              providers. This system also accounts for heterogeneity in tumor
              consistency. With the proposed scale, meningioma consistency can
              be standardized as groundwork for future studies relating to
              surgical outcomes, predictability of consistency and vascularity
              using neuroimaging techniques, and effectiveness of various

              a previously validated intraoperative meningioma consistency
              grading scale and its association with extent of resection (EOR)
              and various surgical outcomes.METHODSThe previously validated
              grading system was prospectively assessed in 127 consecutive
              patients undergoing open craniotomy for meningioma by multiple
              neurosurgeons at two high-volume academic hospitals from 2013 to
              2016. Consistency grading scores ranging from 1 (soft) to 5
              (firm/calcified) were retrospectively analyzed to test for
              association with surgical outcomes and EOR, categorized as
              gross-total resection (GTR) or subtotal resection, defined by
              postoperative MRI.RESULTSOne hundred twenty-seven patients were
              included in the analysis with a tumor consistency distribution as
              follows: grade 1, 3.1\%; grade 2, 14.2\%; grade 3, 44.1\%; grade
              4, 32.3\%; and grade 5, 6.3\%. The mean tumor diameter was 3.6
              $\pm$ 1.7 cm. Tumor consistency grades were grouped into soft
              (grades 1 and 2), average (grade 3), and firm (grades 4 and 5)
              groups for statistical analysis with distributions of 17.3\%,
              44.1\%, and 38.6\%, respectively. There was no association
              between meningioma consistency and maximal tumor diameter, or
              location. Mean duration of surgery was longer for tumors with
              higher consistency: grades 1 and 2, 186 minutes; grade 3, 219
              minutes; and grades 4 and 5, 299 minutes (p = 0.000028). There
              was a trend toward higher perioperative complication rates for
              tumors of increased consistency: grades 1 and 2, 4.5\%; grade 3,
              7.0\%; and grades 4 and 5, 20.8\% (p = 0.047). The proportion of
              GTR for each consistency group was as follows: grades 1 and 2,
              77\%; grade 3, 68\%; and grades 4 and 5, 43\% (p =
              0.0062).CONCLUSIONSIn addition to other important meningioma
              characteristics such as invasiveness, tumor consistency is a key
              determinant of surgical outcomes, including operative duration
              and EOR. Future studies predicting tumor consistency based on

               surgical goal in transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma.
               Existing classifications are effective at predicting GTR but are
               often hampered by limited discriminatory ability in moderate
               cases and by poor interrater agreement. Deep learning, a subset
               of machine learning, has recently established itself as highly
               effective in forecasting medical outcomes. In this pilot study,
               the authors aimed to evaluate the utility of using deep learning
               to predict GTR after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary
               adenoma.METHODSData from a prospective registry were used. The
               authors trained a deep neural network to predict GTR from 16
               preoperatively available radiological and procedural variables.
               Class imbalance adjustment, cross-validation, and random dropout
               were applied to prevent overfitting and ensure robustness of the
               predictive model. The authors subsequently compared the deep
               learning model to a conventional logistic regression model and
               to the Knosp classification as a gold standard.RESULTSOverall,
               140 patients who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery
               were included. GTR was achieved in 95 patients (68\%), with a
               mean extent of resection of 96.8\% $\pm$ 10.6\%. Intraoperative
               high-field MRI was used in 116 (83\%) procedures. The deep
               learning model achieved excellent area under the curve (AUC;
               0.96), accuracy (91\%), sensitivity (94\%), and specificity
               (89\%). This represents an improvement in comparison with the
               Knosp classification (AUC: 0.87, accuracy: 81\%, sensitivity:
               92\%, specificity: 70\%) and a statistically significant
               improvement in comparison with logistic regression (AUC: 0.86,

               the utility of applying deep learning to preoperatively predict

              prospective multicenter cohort of patients that accurately and
              reliably predicts the likelihood of gross total resection (GTR)
              after transsphenoidal NFPA surgery. METHODS: Extent-of-resection
              (EOR) data from a prospective multicenter study in
              transsphenoidal NFPA surgery were analyzed (TRANSSPHER study;
              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02357498). Sixteen preoperative
              radiographic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tumor
              characteristics (eg, tumor size, invasion measures, tumor signal
              characteristics, and parameters impacting surgical access) were
              evaluated to determine EOR predictors, to calculate
              receiver-operating characteristic curves, and to develop a
              grading scale. A separate validation cohort (n = 165) was
              examined to assess the scale's performance and inter-rater
              reliability. RESULTS: Data for 222 patients from 7 centers
              treated by 15 surgeons were analyzed. Approximately one-fifth of
              patients (18.5\%; 41 of 222) underwent subtotal resection (STR).

              fossa, or ventricle; and Knosp grades 3 to 4 were identified as
              independent STR predictors. A grading scale (TRANSSPHER grade)
              based on a combination of these 3 features outperformed
              individual variables in predicting GTR (AUC, 0.732). In a
              validation cohort, the scale exhibited high sensitivity and
              specificity (AUC, 0.779) and strong inter-rater reliability
              (kappa coefficient, 0.617). CONCLUSION: This simple, reliable
              grading scale based on preoperative MRI characteristics can be
              used to better characterize NFPAs for clinical and research
              purposes and to predict the likelihood of achieving GTR.",

              and intrarater reliability of the Knosp grading scale for
              predicting pituitary adenoma cavernous sinus (CS) involvement.
              METHODS Six independent raters (3 neurosurgery residents, 2
              pituitary surgeons, and 1 neuroradiologist) participated in the
              study. Each rater scored 50 unique pituitary MRI scans (with
              contrast) of biopsy-proven pituitary adenoma. Reliabilities for
              the full scale were determined 3 ways: 1) using all 50 scans, 2)
              using scans with midrange scores versus end scores, and 3) using
              a dichotomized scale that reflects common clinical practice. The
              performance of resident raters was compared with that of faculty
              raters to assess the influence of training level on reliability.
              RESULTS Overall, the interrater reliability of the Knosp scale
              was ``strong'' (0.73, 95\% CI 0.56-0.84). However, the percent
              agreement for all 6 reviewers was only 10\% (26\% for faculty
              members, 30\% for residents). The reliability of the middle
              scores (i.e., average rated Knosp Grades 1 and 2) was ``very
              weak'' (0.18, 95\% CI -0.27 to 0.56) and the percent agreement
              for all reviewers was only 5\%. When the scale was dichotomized
              into tumors unlikely to have intraoperative CS involvement
              (Grades 0, 1, and 2) and those likely to have CS involvement
              (Grades 3 and 4), the reliability was ``strong'' (0.60, 95\% CI
              0.39-0.75) and the percent agreement for all raters improved to
              60\%. There was no significant difference in reliability between
              residents and faculty (residents 0.72, 95\% CI 0.55-0.83 vs
              faculty 0.73, 95\% CI 0.56-0.84). Intrarater reliability was
              moderate to strong and increased with the level of experience.
              CONCLUSIONS Although these findings suggest that the Knosp
              grading scale has acceptable interrater reliability overall, it
              raises important questions about the ``very weak'' reliability of
              the scale's middle grades. By dichotomizing the scale into
              clinically useful groups, the authors were able to address the
              poor reliability and percent agreement of the intermediate grades
              and to isolate the most important grades for use in surgical
              decision making (Grades 3 and 4). Authors of future pituitary
              surgery studies should consider reporting Knosp grades as
              dichotomized results rather than as the full scale to optimize
              the reliability of the scale.",

              grading the extent of meningioma resection and its role as a
              predictor of the recurrence of World Health Organization (WHO)
              Grade I meningiomas have been questioned in the past, echoing
              changes in meningioma surgery over the years. The authors
              reviewed their experience in resecting WHO Grade I meningiomas
              and assessed the association between extent of resection, as
              evaluated using the Simpson classification, and recurrence-free
              survival (RFS) of patients after meningioma surgery. METHODS
              Clinical and radiological information for patients with WHO Grade
              I meningiomas who had undergone resective surgery over the past
              20 years was retrospectively reviewed. Simpson and Shinshu
              grading scales were used to evaluate the extent of resection.
              Statistical analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and
              Cox proportional-hazards regression. RESULTS Four hundred
              fifty-eight patients were eligible for analysis. Overall tumor
              recurrence rates for Simpson resection Grades I, II, III, and IV
              were 5\%, 22\%, 31\%, and 35\%, respectively. After Cox
              regression analysis, Simpson Grade I (extensive resection) was
              revealed as a significant predictor of RFS (p = 0.003). Patients
              undergoing Simpson Grade I and II resections showed significant
              improvement in RFS compared with patients undergoing Grade III
              and IV resections (p = 0.005). Extent of resection had a
              significant effect on recurrence rates for both skull base (p =
              0.047) and convexity (p = 0.012) meningiomas. Female sex and a
              Karnofsky Performance Scale score > 70 were also identified as
              independent predictors of RFS after resection of WHO Grade I
              meningioma. CONCLUSIONS In this patient cohort, a significant
              association was noted between extent of resection and rates of
              tumor recurrence. In the authors' experience the Simpson grading
              system maintains its relevance and prognostic value and can serve
              an important role for patient education. Even though complete
              tumor resection is the goal, surgery should be tailored to each

              risk factors for recurrence following surgical treatment of
              intracranial meningiomas. Given that Simpson's study was
              published more than 50 years ago, preceding image guidance
              technology and MR imaging, the authors reviewed their own
              experience with surgical treatment of Grade I meningiomas to
              determine if Simpson's grading scale is still relevant to modern
              neurosurgical practice. METHODS: From this cohort, the authors
              evaluated all patients undergoing craniotomy for resection of a
              histologically proven WHO Grade I meningioma as their initial
              therapy. Clinical information was retrospectively reconstructed
              using patient medical records and radiological data. Recurrence
              analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:
              The 5-year recurrence/progression-free survival for all patients
              receiving a Simpson Grade I, II, III, or IV resection was 95, 85,
              88, and 81\%, respectively (p = not significant, log-rank test).
              Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in
              recurrence-free survival between patients receiving a Simpson
              Grade I, II, III, or IV resection. Analysis limited to
              meningiomas arising from the skull base (excluding the cavernous
              sinus) similarly found no significant benefit to Simpson Grade I
              or II resection, and the survival curves were nearly
              superimposed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of a cohort of patients
              undergoing surgery for WHO Grade I meningiomas, the authors
              demonstrate that the benefit of more aggressive attempts to
              resect the tumor with dura and underlying bone was negligible
              compared with simply removing the entire tumor, or even leaving
              small amounts of tumor attached to critical structures. The
              authors believe that these data reflect an evolution in the
              nature of meningioma surgery over the past 2 decades, and bring
              into question the relevance of using Simpson's grading system as

              prognostic factor for recurrence of WHO Grade I meningiomas was
              challenged, contradicting many previous scientific reports and
              traditional neurosurgical teaching. The objective of this study
              was to determine whether the predictive value of Simpson
              resection grade is outdated or remains valid with respect to
              meningioma recurrence and overall survival. METHODS: All patients
              at least 16 years old who underwent primary craniotomies for
              convexity meningiomas at Oslo University-affiliated hospitals
              (Rikshospitalet and Ullev{\aa}l University Hospitals) in the

              included. Overall survival and retreatment-free survival rates
              were correlated with patient- and surgery-specific factors.
              RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one consecutive patients were
              included in the study. The median patient age was 60.1 years
              (range 19-92 years). The female-to-male ratio was 2.1:1. The WHO
              grades were Grade I in 353 (90.3\%), Grade II in 22 (5.6\%), and
              Grade III in 16 (4.1\%). The follow-up rate was 100\%. Median
              follow-up time was 7.1 years (range 0.0-20.9 years) and total
              observation time was 3147 patient-years. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year
              overall survival rates were 96\%, 89\%, and 78\%, respectively.
              Age, sex, WHO grade, and Simpson grade were significantly

              retreatment-free survival rates were 99\%, 94\%, and 90\%,
              respectively. Simpson resection grade and WHO grade were
              significantly associated with retreatment-free survival. The
              hazard ratios for retreatment after combined Simpson resection
              Grades II+III and IV+V were 4.9- and 13.2-times higher than after
              Simpson Grade I resection, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Simpson

              classifies cranial base meningiomas based on predicted surgical
              resection and patient outcomes. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-two
              consecutive patients with cranial base meningiomas were
              surgically treated by the two senior authors between April 1993
              and August 1997. Using standard statistical tests, a large number
              of preoperative, intraoperative, and follow-up findings were
              analyzed for correlation with the extent of resection. These
              included the presence of previous radiotherapy, Cranial Nerve
              III, V, and VI palsies, multiple fossa involvement, and vessel
              encasement. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that each variable tested
              was independently and inversely correlated with total tumor
              resection (P < 0.002). We were able to construct a grading system
              based on these variables; when more variables are present, the
              grade is higher. With the grading system, lower-grade tumors were
              correlated with increased probabilities of total resection (r2 =
              0.9947) and better patient outcomes, as measured by Karnofsky
              performance scale scores (r = 0.9291). We also found that, as a
              group, patients who underwent subtotal resection exhibited worse
              Karnofsky performance scale scores and had longer hospital stays.
              CONCLUSION: The current system of classifying cranial base
              meningiomas provides no information regarding the tumor except
              location and no information concerning patient prognosis. We
              present a more useful system to categorize these tumors. Our
              scheme must be tested at other centers to corroborate our
              findings. This new grading system should serve to guide surgical

              likelihood of WHO Grade I (85.3\% vs 69.1\%, p = 0.003), and
              younger patient age (55.2 vs 58.3 years, p = 0.01). Meningiomas
              in all locations demonstrated an average recurrence rate of 30\%
              at 100 months of follow-up. Subsequently, the recurrence of skull
              base meningiomas plateaued whereas non-skull base lesions had an
              80\% recurrence rate at 230 months follow-up (p = 0.02). On
              univariate analysis, a prior history of recurrence (p < 0.001),
              initial WHO grade following resection (p < 0.001), and the
              inability to obtain GTR (p < 0.001) were predictors of future
              recurrence. On multivariate analysis a prior history of
              recurrence (p = 0.02) and an STR (p < 0.01) were independent
              predictors of a recurrence. Assessing only patients with primary
              presentations, STR and WHO Grades II and III were independent
              predictors of recurrence (p < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS
              Patients with skull base meningiomas present at a younger age and
              have less aggressive lesions overall. Extent of resection is a
              key predictor of recurrence and long-term follow-up of
              meningiomas is necessary, especially for non-skull base tumors.
              In skull base meningiomas, recurrence risk plateaus approximately
              100 months after surgery, suggesting that for this specific
              cohort, follow-up after 100 months can be less frequent.",

              were compared with tumor regrowth to determine the presence of a
              correlation between this proliferative index and postoperative
              tumor regrowth. Study Design Seventeen adult patients (7 male, 10
              female) were retrospectively reviewed. Nine (52.9\%) and eight
              (47.1\%) patients underwent NTR and STR, respectively.
              Postoperative clinical and radiological data associated with
              vestibular schwannoma growth were compared with the Ki-67
              immunohistochemical analysis results. Results Evidence of
              clinically significant regrowth was observed in four (23.5\%)
              patients. Patients who underwent NTR had a lower rate/incidence
              of tumor regrowth than did patients who underwent STR. Patients
              with a higher Ki-67 index had the highest tumor regrowth rates.
              Conclusions Our study indicates that assessment of the Ki-67

              prediction model has been applied clinically. Thus, the authors
              aim to derive and validate a prognostic nomogram to predict
              progression-free survival (PFS) of chordoma. METHODS: A total of
              201 patients were randomly divided into a derivation group (151
              cases) and a validation group (50 cases). The expression levels
              of biomarkers were quantified using tissue microarray analysis. A
              nomogram was established via univariate and multivariate Cox
              regression analysis in the derivation group. The predictive
              performance of the nomogram was then tested in the validation
              group. RESULTS: The mean follow-up interval was 57 months (range
              26-107 months). One clinical factor and 3 biomarkers were
              confirmed to be associated with PFS, including degree of
              resection, E-cadherin, Ki-67, and VEGFA. The nomogram with these
              prognostic factors had areas under the receiver operating
              characteristic curve of 0.87 and 0.95 in the derivation group at
              3 years and 5 years, respectively, compared with 0.87 and 0.84 in
              the validation group. Calibration and score-stratified survival

               anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve
               healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models
               typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables
               from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that
               discards the vast majority of information in each patient's
               record. We propose a representation of patients' entire raw EHR
               records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
               (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using
               this representation are capable of accurately predicting
               multiple medical events from multiple centers without
               site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach
               using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical
               centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24
               h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data
               unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including
               clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for
               tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the
               receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93--0.94), 30-day
               unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75--0.76), prolonged length of
               stay (AUROC 0.85--0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge
               diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models
               outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in
               all cases. We believe that this approach can be used to create
               accurate and scalable predictions for a variety of clinical
               scenarios. In a case study of a particular prediction, we
               demonstrate that neural networks can be used to identify
               relevant information from the patient's chart. Artificial
               intelligence outperforms traditional statistical models at
               predicting a range of clinical outcomes from a patient's entire
               raw electronic health record (EHR). A team led by Alvin Rajkomar

               models to data from 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at
               least 24 h each at two academic medical centers, and showed that
               their algorithm could accurately predict risk of mortality,
               hospital readmission, prolonged hospital stay and discharge
               diagnosis. In all cases, the method proved more accurate than
               previously published models. The authors provide a case study to
               serve as a proof-of-concept of how such an algorithm could be

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Suprasellar pituitary adenomas (SPAs) are a special
              type of pituitary adenoma. Although dozens of SPA cases have been
              reported, the exact definition and the characteristics of SPA
              have not been exhaustively discussed before. METHODS: In a
              retrospective electronic medical records review, 13 patients with
              SPA were identified in our hospital between January 2010 and
              December 2019. A literature review was performed by searching the
              online database PubMed, and 39 cases conformed to the criteria
              based on the previous literature. Data regarding clinical
              symptoms, imaging manifestations, surgical information and
              follow-ups were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of
              52 patients with SPA was 36.73 years, and most of the patients
              were female (61.5\%). The most common hormone-secreting subtypes
              of SPA were nonfunctioning (36.5\%) and ACTH-secreting (34.6\%)
              SPA. Macroadenomas (68.9\%) were more common than microadenomas
              (31.1\%). The origins of the SPAs included the intrasellar
              pituitary gland (type I), the subdiaphragmatic (type IIa) and
              supradiaphragmatic (type IIb) part of the pituitary stalk, and
              the suprasellar peri-infundibular region (type III). The most
              common anatomic subtype of SPA was type III, and type IIb was
              also common. The most common presentations of SPA were visual
              symptoms, especially for type III SPA. In addition, 64.7\% and
              73.1\% of type IIb and III SPAs, respectively, were suspected to
              be of suprasellar origin based on presurgical imaging
              examination. Patients with tumors of suspected suprasellar origin
              were more likely to receive transcranial surgery (TCS) initially
              than those with tumors of suspected intrasellar origin (70.6\%
              vs. 22.2\%, p = 0.0013). The intact rate for the pituitary stalk
              after surgery for type II SPA was lower than that for type I and
              III SPA (52.6\% vs. 92.6\%, p = 0.0036). More patients with type
              II SPA experienced postoperative central diabetes insipidus (CDI)
              than those with type I and III SPA (57.9\% vs. 11.1\%, p =
              0.0011). There was no significant difference in the incidence of
              postoperative CDI between transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) and TCS
              (p = 0.1304). Nine patients in our hospital received extended
              endoscopic TSS; only one experienced tumor recurrence, and no
              severe complications occurred after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: SPAs
              could be defined as pituitary adenomas completely or partially
              located in the suprasellar region. There were both similarities
              and differences among the different anatomic subtypes of SPA. For
              patients who were suspected of having SPAs, visual field tests,
              pituitary hormone evaluation and MRI were necessary. Because
              imaging examination is not a reliable method, surgery is the only
              way to confirm the tumor origin. Extended endoscopic TSS might be
              a safe and efficient approach to remove these tumors, but more
              studies are needed to verify this conclusion. For type II SPA,
              the pituitary stalk should be carefully protected during surgery,
              and postoperative CDI should be monitored.",

              modern therapeutics are predominantly specific to the primary

              transcriptomics to identify the origin of a tumour4-9. However,

              penetration in low-resource settings. Here, to overcome these
              challenges, we present a deep-learning-based algorithm-Tumour
              Origin Assessment via Deep Learning (TOAD)-that can provide a
              differential diagnosis for the origin of the primary tumour using
              routinely acquired histology slides. We used whole-slide images
              of tumours with known primary origins to train a model that
              simultaneously identifies the tumour as primary or metastatic and
              predicts its site of origin. On our held-out test set of tumours
              with known primary origins, the model achieved a top-1 accuracy
              of 0.83 and a top-3 accuracy of 0.96, whereas on our external
              test set it achieved top-1 and top-3 accuracies of 0.80 and 0.93,

              for which a differential diagnosis was assigned. Our model
              predictions resulted in concordance for 61\% of cases and a top-3
              agreement of 82\%. TOAD can be used as an assistive tool to
              assign a differential diagnosis to complicated cases of
              metastatic tumours and CUPs and could be used in conjunction with
              or in lieu of ancillary tests and extensive diagnostic work-ups

              largely unknown. To investigate this, we carried out genome-wide
              association studies of 3,144 functional and structural brain
              imaging phenotypes from UK Biobank (discovery dataset 8,428
              subjects). Here we show that many of these phenotypes are
              heritable. We identify 148 clusters of associations between
              single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that
              replicate at P < 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by
              chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include:
              iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic
              susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix
              and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter

                   with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks.
                   A successful approach to SSL is to learn embeddings which
                   are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a
                   recurring issue with this approach is the existence of
                   trivial constant solutions. Most current methods avoid such
                   solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an
                   objective function that naturally avoids collapse by
                   measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs
                   of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a
                   sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as
                   possible. This causes the embedding vectors of distorted
                   versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the
                   redundancy between the components of these vectors. The
                   method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H.
                   Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of
                   identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large
                   batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a
                   predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on
                   the weight updates. Intriguingly it benefits from very
                   high-dimensional output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms
                   previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised
                   classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with

              adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care
              for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the
              extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial
              we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus
              temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in
              terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS: Patients with newly
              diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly
              assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal
              irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for
              6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous
              daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area
              per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of
              radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide
              (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day
              cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A
              total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization.
              The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had
              undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months,
              the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus
              temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The
              unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the
              radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent
              confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test).
              The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy
              plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone.
              Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide
              resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects in 7 percent
              of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of temozolomide to

              published four updates. Update 1 clarified the use of the term
              NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) and proposed use of the additional
              term NEC (Not Elsewhere Classified). Update 2 issued
              clarifications regarding two diagnoses: Diffuse Midline Glioma,
              H3 K27M-mutant and Diffuse Astrocytoma/Anaplastic Astrocytoma,
              IDH-mutant. Update 3 proposed molecular criteria that could be
              used in the setting of an IDH-wildtype diffuse or anaplastic
              astrocytic glioma without histological features of glioblastoma
              to infer that the tumor would behave similarly to a grade IV
              glioblastoma. Update 4 suggested that, in children and young
              adults, subtypes of IDH-wildtype/H3-wildtype diffuse gliomas may
              have distinct clinical features in the setting of a BRAFV600E

                   self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised

                   great success in single-label image classification, it is
                   important to note that real world images generally contain
                   multiple labels, which could correspond to different
                   objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image.
                   Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification
                   learn independent classifiers for each category and employ
                   ranking or thresholding on the classification results. These
                   techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly
                   exploit the label dependencies in an image. In this paper,
                   we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this
                   problem. Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN framework

              is a valuable means of determining the appropriate management for
              patients. Application of Frozen Section in CNS surgeries might
              face challenges due to friability of brain tissue and its
              relative inaccessibility. Various studies have evaluated the
              diagnostic acuity of frozen section compared to gold standard but
              results have been quite inconsistent. We conducted the present
              study to evaluate the accuracy of cryostat in diagnosing central
              nervous system tumors compared to the Gold Standard method.
              Methods: In this descriptive retrospective study, patients with
              definite diagnosis of central nervous system tumors made through
              histopathological evaluations were identified by reviewing the
              archives of pathology reports during 1996-2013. Demographic data,
              clinical history, radiologic findings and results of pathologic
              evaluations were extracted from the medical records and entered
              into SPSS statistical software v.22 for analysis. Results: A
              total of 405 patients diagnosed with CNS tumors were identified,
              of which 16 patients were not eligible and eventually 389
              patients were included in the study. Regarding tumor category,
              subtype and grade, the results of the two methods were totally
              compatible in 303 patients (77.9\%) and discrepant in 22.1\% of
              cases. The tumors located in the middle fossa (p=0.031; OR=2.27;
              95\% CI: 1.08-4.79) and the posterior fossa (p=0.021; OR=2.46;
              95\% CI: 1.15-5.26) and the tumors biopsied using the
              stereotactic method (p=0.050; OR=2.42; 95\% CI: 1.001-5.83) were
              associated with an increased chance of discrepant results between
              the two methods. Conclusion: Frozen section can correctly
              diagnose and affect the management of CNS lesions in 77.9\% of
              cases. Finding ways to increase the sensitivity and specificity
              of this method and providing surgeons with more definite and
              exact intra-operative diagnosis can improve management of central
              nervous system lesions to a considerable degree.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Brain and CNS cancers (collectively referred to as
              CNS cancers) are a source of mortality and morbidity for which
              diagnosis and treatment require extensive resource allocation and
              sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic technology. Previous
              epidemiological studies are limited to specific geographical
              regions or time periods, making them difficult to compare on a
              global scale. In this analysis, we aimed to provide a comparable
              and comprehensive estimation of the global burden of brain cancer
              between 1990 and 2016. METHODS: We report means and 95\%
              uncertainty intervals (UIs) for incidence, mortality, and
              disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) estimates for CNS cancers
              (according to the International Classification of Diseases tenth
              revision: malignant neoplasm of meninges, malignant neoplasm of
              brain, and malignant neoplasm of spinal cord, cranial nerves, and
              other parts of CNS) from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries,
              and Risk Factors Study 2016. Data sources include vital
              registration and cancer registry data. Mortality was modelled
              using an ensemble model approach. Incidence was estimated by
              dividing the final mortality estimates by mortality to incidence
              ratios. DALYs were estimated by summing years of life lost and
              years lived with disability. Locations were grouped into
              quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary
              indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total
              fertility rate. FINDINGS: In 2016, there were 330 000 (95\% UI
              299 000 to 349 000) incident cases of CNS cancer and 227 000 (205
              000 to 241 000) deaths globally, and age-standardised incidence
              rates of CNS cancer increased globally by 17·3\% (95\% UI 11·4 to
              26·9) between 1990 and 2016 (2016 age-standardised incidence rate
              4·63 per 100 000 person-years [4·17 to 4·90]). The highest
              age-standardised incidence rate was in the highest quintile of
              SDI (6·91 [5·71 to 7·53]). Age-standardised incidence rates
              increased with each SDI quintile. East Asia was the region with
              the most incident cases of CNS cancer for both sexes in 2016 (108
              000 [95\% UI 98 000 to 122 000]), followed by western Europe (49
              000 [37 000 to 54 000]), and south Asia (31 000 [29 000 to 37
              000]). The top three countries with the highest number of
              incident cases were China, the USA, and India. CNS cancer was
              responsible for 7·7 million (95\% UI 6·9 to 8·3) DALYs globally,
              a non-significant change in age-standardised DALY rate of -10·0\%
              (-16·4 to 2·6) between 1990 and 2016. The age-standardised DALY
              rate decreased in the high SDI quintile (-10·0\% [-27·1 to -0·1])
              and high-middle SDI quintile (-10·5\% [-18·4 to -1·4]) over time
              but increased in the low SDI quintile (22·5\% [11·2 to 50·5]).
              INTERPRETATION: CNS cancer is responsible for substantial
              morbidity and mortality worldwide, and incidence increased
              between 1990 and 2016. Significant geographical and regional
              variation in the incidence of CNS cancer might be reflective of
              differences in diagnoses and reporting practices or unknown
              environmental and genetic risk factors. Future efforts are needed
              to analyse CNS cancer burden by subtype. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda

              (incidence and mortality) are age-adjusted using the 2000 US
              standard population and presented per 100,000 population. The
              average annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAAIR) of all
              malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors was 23.79
              (Malignant AAAIR=7.08, non-Malignant AAAIR=16.71). This rate was
              higher in females compared to males (26.31 versus 21.09), Blacks
              compared to Whites (23.88 versus 23.83), and non-Hispanics
              compared to Hispanics (24.23 versus 21.48). The most commonly
              occurring malignant brain and other CNS tumor was glioblastoma
              (14.5\% of all tumors), and the most common non-malignant tumor
              was meningioma (38.3\% of all tumors). Glioblastoma was more
              common in males, and meningioma was more common in females. In
              children and adolescents (age 0-19 years), the incidence rate of
              all primary brain and other CNS tumors was 6.14. An estimated
              83,830 new cases of malignant and non-malignant brain and other
              CNS tumors are expected to be diagnosed in the US in 2020 (24,970
              malignant and 58,860 non-malignant). There were 81,246 deaths
              attributed to malignant brain and other CNS tumors between 2013
              and 2017. This represents an average annual mortality rate of
              4.42. The 5-year relative survival rate following diagnosis of a

              crucial high-level actions that are needed to deliver universal
              health coverage. First, nations need national strategic
              laboratory plans; second, these plans require adequate financing
              for implementation; and last, pathologists themselves need to
              take on leadership roles to advocate for the centrality of PALM
              to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for health. The
              national strategic laboratory plan should deliver a tiered,
              networked laboratory system as a central element. Appropriate
              financing should be provided, at a level of at least 4\% of
              health expenditure. Financing of new technologies such as
              molecular diagnostics is challenging for LMICs, even though many
              of these tests are cost-effective. Point-of-care testing can
              substantially reduce test-reporting time, but this benefit must
              be balanced with higher costs. Our research analysis highlights a
              considerable deficiency in advocacy for PALM; pathologists have
              been invisible in national and international health discourse and
              leadership. Embedding PALM in LMICs can only be achieved if
              pathologists advocate for these services, and undertake
              leadership roles, both nationally and internationally. We

              otolaryngology-head and neck surgeons and neurosurgeons to
              provide care for these challenging conditions. As the field has

              evidence-based review (EBR) was created and then underwent an
              iterative review process until consensus was achieved. This
              Executive Summary recapitulates these findings. RESULTS: This
              summary complies the EBR and EBRR from the ICAR:SB document in
              the management of numerous skull-base pathologies including
              cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, intradural tumors, sinonasal
              malignancies, and clival tumors, as well as the key issues of
              reconstruction after and the complications associated with ESBS.
              CONCLUSION: The ICAR:SB Executive Summary recaps the
              evidenced-based recommendations concerning the advantages,
              limitations and challenges of ESBS in the management of diverse
              skull-base pathologies. Although multifactorial in nature, the
              overall level of evidence in ESBS is modest. This represents an

              diffuse infiltrative glioma guides the decision to pursue
              definitive neurosurgical resection. Establishing the
              intraoperative diagnosis by histologic analysis can be difficult
              in low-cellularity infiltrative gliomas. Therefore, we developed
              a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay to detect somatic
              single-nucleotide variants in the telomerase reverse
              transcriptase (TERT) promoter and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
              (IDH1). OBSERVATIONS: This assay was applied to tissue samples
              from 190 patients with diffuse gliomas, including archived fixed
              and frozen specimens and tissue obtained intraoperatively.
              Results demonstrated 96\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 90\%-99\%) and
              100\% specificity (95\% CI, 95\%-100\%) for World Health
              Organization grades II and III gliomas. In a series of live
              cases, glioma-defining mutations could be identified within 60
              minutes, which could facilitate the diagnosis in an
              intraoperative timeframe. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The
              genotyping method described herein can establish the diagnosis of

              and now contributes to disease classification, yet the
              relationship between molecular profile and disease progression
              and treatment response remain poorly understood.Experimental
              Design: We integrated prospective clinical sequencing of 1,004
              primary and recurrent tumors from 923 glioma patients with
              clinical and treatment phenotypes. RESULTS: Thirteen percent of
              glioma patients harbored a pathogenic germline variant, including
              a subset associated with heritable genetic syndromes and variants
              mediating DNA repair dysfunctions (29\% of the total) that were
              associated with somatic biallelic inactivation and
              mechanism-specific somatic phenotypes. In astrocytomas, genomic
              alterations in effectors of cell-cycle progression correlated
              with aggressive disease independent of IDH mutation status, arose
              preferentially in enhancing tumors (44\% vs. 8\%, P < 0.001),
              were associated with rapid disease progression following tumor
              recurrence (HR = 2.6, P = 0.02), and likely preceded the
              acquisition of alkylating therapy-associated somatic
              hypermutation. Thirty-two percent of patients harbored a
              potentially therapeutically actionable lesion, of whom 11\%
              received targeted therapies. In BRAF-mutant gliomas, response to
              agents targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis was influenced by
              the type of mutation, its clonality, and its cellular and genomic
              context. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal genomic correlates of
              disease progression and treatment response in diverse types of
              glioma and highlight the potential utility of incorporating

              categorical, discrete, and mostly through manual process. In this
              work, we explore the idea of gene embedding, distributed
              representation of genes, in the spirit of word embedding.
              RESULTS: From a pure data-driven fashion, we trained a
              200-dimension vector representation of all human genes, using
              gene co-expression patterns in 984 data sets from the GEO
              databases. These vectors capture functional relatedness of genes
              in terms of recovering known pathways - the average inner product
              (similarity) of genes within a pathway is 1.52X greater than that
              of random genes. Using t-SNE, we produced a gene co-expression
              map that shows local concentrations of tissue specific genes. We
              also illustrated the usefulness of the embedded gene vectors,
              laden with rich information on gene co-expression patterns, in
              tasks such as gene-gene interaction prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We
              proposed a machine learning method that utilizes
              transcriptome-wide gene co-expression to generate a distributed
              representation of genes. We further demonstrated the utility of
              our distribution by predicting gene-gene interaction based solely
              on gene names. The distributed representation of genes could be

              classification of brain tumors proposed not to perform sequencing
              for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in glioblastoma patients
              $\geq$55 years old. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis to
              estimate the financial impact of these guidelines. Methods: From
              2010 to 2015 we performed 1023 IDH tests in gliomas, amounting to
              ~$1.09 million in direct laboratory test costs. Samples were
              tested using R132H-specific immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing
              validated for detection of noncanonical IDH1/2 mutations, or both
              methods. Results: In cases tested by DNA sequencing, the fraction
              of non-R132H mutations was 5.4\%, which included only 2
              high-grade gliomas in patients \geq{}55 years (0.9\%). When
              remodeling the optimal age cutoff in our patient population using
              5-year age-binning, we found a 10-times higher pretest
              probability for the presence of a noncanonical IDH1 mutation in
              the setting of a negative IDH1-R132H immunohistochemistry result
              in patients <55 years. Applying the independently confirmed age
              cutoff of 55 years to glioblastoma patients (64\%) would result
              in $403200 saved (43\%). By not performing sequencing in patients
              $\geq$55 years, the turn-around time to final integrated
              neuropathological diagnosis is reduced by 53\%, allowing these
              patients to gain earlier benefits from personalized genomic
              medicine. Conclusion: The negligible prevalence of noncanonical
              IDH mutations in glioblastoma patients $\geq$55 years argues
              against universal IDH sequencing in this population. We predict
              that adoption of this age-based sequencing cutoff recommendation
              from the 2016 WHO guidelines will result in significant cost and
              time savings throughout the global health care system.",

               robustness gains are typically not uniform across corruption
               types. Indeed increasing performance in the presence of random
               noise is often met with reduced performance on other corruptions
               such as contrast change. Understanding when and why these sorts
               of trade-offs occur is a crucial step towards mitigating them.
               Towards this end, we investigate recently observed tradeoffs
               caused by Gaussian data augmentation and adversarial training.
               We find that both methods improve robustness to corruptions that
               are concentrated in the high frequency domain while reducing
               robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the low
               frequency domain. This suggests that one way to mitigate these
               trade-offs via data augmentation is to use a more diverse set of
               augmentations. Towards this end we observe that AutoAugment [6],
               a recently proposed data augmentation policy optimized for clean
               accuracy, achieves state-of-the-art robustness on the CIFAR-10-C
               [17] benchmark.",

               focusing on mean-field or other simple structured
               approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the
               quality of inferences made using variational methods. We
               introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily
               complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our
               approximations are distributions constructed through a
               normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is
               transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of
               invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity
               is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop
               categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a
               unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior
               approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages

              Surgery remains the first-line choice for head and neck cancer
              patients. Limited resectable tissue mass and complicated anatomy
              structures in the head and neck region put the surgeons in a

              challenging due to the lack of accurate techniques for
              intraoperative margin assessment. This study evaluates the use of
              hyperspectral imaging for margin assessment by reporting its use
              in fresh human breast specimens. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
              Hyperspectral data were first acquired on tissue slices from 18
              patients after gross sectioning of the resected breast specimen.
              This dataset, which contained over 22,000 spectra, was well
              correlated with histopathology and was used to develop a support
              vector machine classification algorithm and test the
              classification performance. In addition, we evaluated
              hyperspectral imaging in clinical practice by imaging the
              resection surface of six lumpectomy specimens. With the developed
              classification algorithm, we determined if hyperspectral imaging
              could detect malignancies in the resection surface. RESULTS: The
              diagnostic performance of hyperspectral imaging on the tissue
              slices was high; invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ,
              connective tissue, and adipose tissue were correctly classified
              as tumor or healthy tissue with accuracies of 93\%, 84\%, 70\%,
              and 99\%, respectively. These accuracies increased with the size
              of the area, consisting of one tissue type. The entire resection
              surface was imaged within 10 minutes, and data analysis was
              performed fast, without the need of an experienced operator. On
              the resection surface, hyperspectral imaging detected 19 of 20
              malignancies that, according to the available histopathology
              information, were located within 2 mm of the resection surface.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the potential of using
              hyperspectral imaging for margin assessment during
              breast-conserving surgery to improve surgical outcome.",

  abstract = "CONTEXT: The main challenge in radical prostatectomy is complete
              excision of malignant tissue, while preserving continence and
              erectile function. Positive surgical margins (PSMs) occur in up
              to 38\% of cases, are associated with tumour recurrences, and may
              result in debilitating additional therapies. Despite surgical
              developments for prostate cancer (PCa), no technology is yet
              implemented to assess surgical margins of the entire prostatic
              surface intraoperatively. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic
              review is to provide an overview of novel imaging methods
              developed for intraoperative margin assessment in PCa surgery,
              which are compared with standard postoperative histopathology.
              EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search of the last 10 yr was
              conducted in the Scopus, PubMed, and Embase (Ovid) databases.
              Eligible articles had to report the PSM rate according to their
              intraoperative margin assessment technology in comparison with
              standard histopathology. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The search resulted
              in 616 original articles, of which 11 were included for full-text
              review. The main technical developments in PCa margin assessment
              included optical coherence tomography, photodynamic diagnosis
              with 5-aminolevulinic acid, spectroscopy, and enhanced
              microscopy. These techniques are described and their main
              advantages, limitations, and applications in the clinical setting
              are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Several imaging methods are suggested
              in literature for the detection of positive margins during PCa
              surgery. Despite promising qualifications of the mentioned
              technologies, many struggle to find implementation in the clinic.
              Surgical conditions hampering the signal, long imaging times, and
              comparison with histopathology are mutual challenges. The next
              step towards reduction of PSMs in PCa surgery includes evaluation
              of these technologies in large clinical trials. PATIENT SUMMARY:
              In this review, new technologies are reported that can assist the
              surgeon by detecting insufficient removal of all tumorous tissue
              during surgery, instead of the standard postoperative
              histopathological assessment. Currently, it is not clear whether
              these technologies improve the patient outcome directly; however,
              the review shows potential future implementations.",

              increasing number of cores may undermine the accuracy of models
              predicting the presence of prostate cancer at initial biopsy in
              patients submitted to 20-core initial biopsy. METHODS: A total of
              232 consecutive patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
              between 4 and 20 ng/mL and/or abnormal digital rectal examination
              (DRE) underwent 12-core prostate biopsy protocol (group 1) or
              20-core prostate biopsy protocol (group 2). The patients were
              divided into subgroups according to the results of their serum
              PSA and prostate volume. We evaluated the cancer detection rate
              overall and in each subgroup. Clinical data were analyzed using
              chi-square analysis and the unpaired t-test or 1-way ANOVA with
              significance considered at 0.05. RESULTS: The 2 groups of
              patients were not significantly different with regard to
              parameters (age, abnormal DRE and serum PSA), although median
              prostate volume in group 1 (57.76 +/- 26.94 cc) were slighter
              greater than in group 2. Cancer detection rate for patients
              submitted to 20 prostate biopsy was higher than patients
              submitted to 12 prostate biopsy (35.2\% vs. 25\%, p = 0.095).
              Breakdown to PSA level showed a benefit to 20 prostate biopsy for
              PSA <6 ng/mL (37.1\% vs. 12.9\%, p = 0.005). Stratifying results
              by prostate volume, we found that the improvement of cancer
              detection rate with 20 prostate biopsy was significant in
              patients with a prostate volume greater than 60 cc (55\% in 20
              prostate biopsy vs. 11.3\% p < 0.05). Morbidity rates were
              identical in groups 1 and 2 with no statistically significant
              difference. There appeared to be no greater risk of infection and
              bleeding with 20 prostate biopsy protocol. CONCLUSION: The
              20-core biopsy protocol was more efficient than the 12-core
              biopsy protocol, especially in patients with prostate specific
              antigen <6 ng/mL and prostate volume greater than 60 cc.",

  abstract      = "Deep CNNs are known to exhibit the following peculiarity: on
                   the one hand they generalize extremely well to a test set,
                   while on the other hand they are extremely sensitive to
                   so-called adversarial perturbations. The extreme sensitivity
                   of high performance CNNs to adversarial examples casts
                   serious doubt that these networks are learning high level
                   abstractions in the dataset. We are concerned with the
                   following question: How can a deep CNN that does not learn
                   any high level semantics of the dataset manage to generalize
                   so well? The goal of this article is to measure the tendency
                   of CNNs to learn surface statistical regularities of the
                   dataset. To this end, we use Fourier filtering to construct
                   datasets which share the exact same high level abstractions
                   but exhibit qualitatively different surface statistical
                   regularities. For the SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets, we present
                   two Fourier filtered variants: a low frequency variant and a
                   randomly filtered variant. Each of the Fourier filtering
                   schemes is tuned to preserve the recognizability of the
                   objects. Our main finding is that CNNs exhibit a tendency to
                   latch onto the Fourier image statistics of the training
                   dataset, sometimes exhibiting up to a 28\% generalization
                   gap across the various test sets. Moreover, we observe that
                   significantly increasing the depth of a network has a very
                   marginal impact on closing the aforementioned generalization
                   gap. Thus we provide quantitative evidence supporting the
                   hypothesis that deep CNNs tend to learn surface statistical
                   regularities in the dataset rather than higher-level
                   abstract concepts.",

                     Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors
                     extracted from the convolutional neural networks are very
                     powerful. This paper adds to the mounting evidence that
                     this is indeed the case. We report on a series of
                     experiments conducted for different recognition tasks
                     using the publicly available code and model of the
                     OverFeat network which was trained to perform object
                     classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from
                     the OverFeat network as a generic image representation to
                     tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object
                     image classification, scene recognition, fine grained
                     recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval
                     applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these
                     tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away
                     from the original task and data the OverFeat network was
                     trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent
                     superior results compared to the highly tuned
                     state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification
                     tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it
                     consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods
                     except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved
                     using a linear SVM classifier (or L2 distance in case of
                     retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size
                     4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The
                     representations are further modified using simple
                     augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results

                   equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when

                   is \emph{not} the case for adaptive gradient
                   algorithms, such as Adam. While common implementations of
                   these algorithms employ L$_2$ regularization (often calling
                   it ``weight decay'' in what may be misleading due to the

                   weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the

                   challenging endeavor for artificial intelligence. In this

                   to extract useful representations from high-dimensional
                   data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key
                   insight of our model is to learn such representations by
                   predicting the future in latent space by using powerful

              patients were generated and analyzed by using a Raman imaging
              system (Invenio Imaging Inc.). We aimed at establishing a

              diagnostic, research, and quality control tool in the

              process optimization regarding tissue collection, preparation,
              and imaging. The Raman imaging system was rapidly integrated into

              Intraoperative SRH can easily be integrated into the workflow of

              optimizations that can be implemented rapidly, high-quality

                   introduce prototypes as latent variables to help find the
                   maximum-likelihood estimation of the network parameters in
                   an Expectation-Maximization framework. We iteratively

               pathology. Whole slide imaging (WSI), which refers to scanning
               of conventional glass slides in order to produce digital slides,
               is the most recent imaging modality being employed by pathology

               pathologists for diagnostic, educational, and research purposes.
               This article provides a technologic review of WSI platforms and
               covers clinical and nonclinical pathology applications of these
               imaging systems. Barriers to adoption of WSI include limiting

              algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient
              based learning technique. Given an appropriate network
              architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to
              synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify
              high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with
              minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied
              to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a
              standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural
              networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the
              variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other
              techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed
              of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation
              recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm,
              called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule
              systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as
              to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for
              online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments
              demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility
              of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for
              reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional
              neural network character recognizers combined with global
              training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and
              personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several

              presurgical evaluation is warranted or how to proceed when
              lesions are not surgically accessible. We conducted a review of
              the literature on CNS lymphoma diagnosis (1966 to October 2011)
              to determine whether a common diagnostic algorithm can be
              generated. We extracted data regarding the usefulness of brain
              and body imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies,
              ophthalmologic examination, and tissue biopsy in the diagnosis of
              CNS lymphoma. Contrast enhancement on imaging is highly sensitive
              at the time of diagnosis: 98.9\% in immunocompetent lymphoma and
              96.1\% in human immunodeficiency virus-related CNS lymphoma. The
              sensitivity of CSF cytology is low (2\%-32\%) but increases when

              analysis have more than 95\% specificity in the diagnosis of CNS
              lymphoma. Positive CSF cytology, vitreous biopsy, or
              brain/leptomeningeal biopsy remain the current standard for

  abstract = "Importance: Application of deep learning algorithms to
              whole-slide pathology images can potentially improve diagnostic
              accuracy and efficiency. Objective: Assess the performance of
              automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in
              hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of
              women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists'
              diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. Design, Setting, and
              Participants: Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to
              develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases
              (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide
              images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and
              without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by
              immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge
              participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was
              evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images
              (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of
              corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11
              pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to
              ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a
              flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow,
              and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). Exposures:
              Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge
              competition or pathologist interpretation. Main Outcomes and
              Measures: The presence of specific metastatic foci and the
              absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image
              using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11
              pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their
              diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal,
              equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. Results: The area
              under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the
              algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing
              algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction
              comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4\% [95\% CI,
              64.3\%-80.4\%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal
              whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task,
              the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95\% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed
              significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic
              simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P < .001). The
              top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the
              pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time
              constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5
              algorithms vs 0.966 [95\% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist
              WOTC). Conclusions and Relevance: In the setting of a challenge
              competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better
              diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists
              participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine
              pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an
              expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time
              constraints. Whether this approach has clinical utility will
              require evaluation in a clinical setting.",

                   learning applications to medical imaging. However, there are
                   fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task
                   specifications between natural image classification and the
                   target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of
                   the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore
                   properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A
                   performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging
                   tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little
                   benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can
                   perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating
                   the learned representations and features, we find that some
                   of the differences from transfer learning are due to the
                   over-parametrization of standard models rather than
                   sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature
                   reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more

              weakly supervised classification in whole slide image (WSI) based
              pathology diagnosis. However, the current MIL methods are usually
              based on independent and identical distribution hypothesis, thus
              neglect the correlation among different instances. To address
              this problem, we proposed a new framework, called correlated MIL,
              and provided a proof for convergence. Based on this framework, we
              devised a Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), which explored both

               the Bernoulli distribution of the bag label where the bag label

               Furthermore, we propose a neural network-based

               the attention mechanism. Notably, an application of the proposed

               of each instance to the bag label. We show empirically that our

              with glioblastoma (GBM) despite increasing scientific
              understanding of the disease. While factors such as intrinsic
              tumor biology and drug delivery are challenges to developing
              efficacious therapies, it is unclear whether the current clinical
              trial landscape is optimally evaluating new therapies and
              biomarkers. Methods: We queried ClinicalTrials.gov for
              interventional clinical trials for patients with GBM initiated
              between January 2005 and December 2016 and abstracted data
              regarding phase, status, start and end dates, testing locations,
              endpoints, experimental interventions, sample size, clinical
              presentation/indication, and design to better understand the
              clinical trials landscape. Results: Only approximately 8\%-11\%
              of patients with newly diagnosed GBM enroll on clinical trials
              with a similar estimate for all patients with GBM. Trial duration
              was similar across phases with median time to completion between
              3 and 4 years. While 93\% of clinical trials were in phases I-II,
              26\% of the overall clinical trial patient population was
              enrolled on phase III studies. Of the 8 completed phase III
              trials, only 1 reported positive results. Although 58\% of the
              phase III trials were supported by phase II data with a similar
              endpoint, only 25\% of these phase II trials were randomized.
              Conclusions: The clinical trials landscape for GBM is
              characterized by long development times, inadequate dissemination
              of information, suboptimal go/no-go decision making, and low

                   on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image
                   generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language
                   models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are
                   surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis:
                   increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts
                   both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than
                   increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen
                   achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the

              status and, if IDH-mutant, assessing 1p19q codeletion are an
              important component of diagnosis of World Health Organization
              grades II/III or lower-grade gliomas. This has led to research
              into noninvasively correlating imaging features (``radiomics'')
              with genetic status. PURPOSE: Our aim was to perform a diagnostic
              test accuracy systematic review for classifying IDH and 1p19q
              status using MR imaging radiomics, to provide future directions
              for integration into clinical radiology. DATA SOURCES: Ovid
              (MEDLINE), Scopus, and the Web of Science were searched in
              accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
              Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy
              guidelines. STUDY SELECTION: Fourteen journal articles were
              selected that included 1655 lower-grade gliomas classified by
              their IDH and/or 1p19q status from MR imaging radiomic features.
              DATA ANALYSIS: For each article, the classification of IDH and/or
              1p19q status using MR imaging radiomics was evaluated using the
              area under curve or descriptive statistics. Quality assessment
              was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
              Studies 2 tool and the radiomics quality score. DATA SYNTHESIS:
              The best classifier of IDH status was with conventional radiomics
              in combination with convolutional neural network-derived features
              (area under the curve = 0.95, 94.4\% sensitivity, 86.7\%
              specificity). Optimal classification of 1p19q status occurred
              with texture-based radiomics (area under the curve = 0.96, 90\%
              sensitivity, 89\% specificity). LIMITATIONS: A meta-analysis
              showed high heterogeneity due to the uniqueness of radiomic
              pipelines. CONCLUSIONS: Radiogenomics is a potential alternative
              to standard invasive biopsy techniques for determination of IDH
              and 1p19q status in lower-grade gliomas but requires

              especially when an R132H IDH1 immunostain is negative. METHODS: A
              cohort of 89 patients was used to build IDH1/2 mutation
              prediction models in World Health Organization grades II-IV
              gliomas, and an external cohort of 100 patients was used for
              validation. Logistic regression and backward model selection with
              the Akaike information criterion were used to develop prediction
              models. RESULTS: A multivariable model, incorporating patient
              age, glioblastoma multiforme diagnosis, and prior history of
              grade II or III glioma, was developed to predict IDH1/2 mutation
              probability. This model generated an area under the curve (AUC)
              of 0.934 (95\% CI: 0.878, 0.978) in the external validation
              cohort and 0.941 (95\% CI: 0.918, 0.962) in the cohort of The
              Cancer Genome Atlas. When R132H IDH1 immunostain information was
              added, AUC increased to 0.986 (95\% CI: 0.967, 0.998). This model
              had an AUC of 0.947 (95\% CI: 0.891, 0.995) in predicting whether
              an R132H IDH1 immunonegative case harbored a less common IDH1 or
              IDH2 mutation. The models were also 94\% accurate in predicting

              An interactive web-based application for calculating the

              published in 2021. Although the previous edition of this
              classification was published just 5 years earlier, in 2016, rapid
              advances in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of
              CNS tumours, including the diversity of clinically relevant
              molecular types and subtypes, necessitated a new classification
              system. Compared with the 2016 scheme, the new classification
              incorporates even more molecular alterations into the diagnosis
              of many tumours and reorganizes gliomas into adult-type diffuse
              gliomas, paediatric-type diffuse low-grade and high-grade
              gliomas, circumscribed astrocytic gliomas, and ependymal tumours.
              A number of new entities are incorporated into the 2021
              classification, especially tumours that preferentially or
              exclusively arise in the paediatric population. Such a
              substantial revision of the WHO scheme will have major
              implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CNS
              tumours. In this Perspective, we summarize the main changes in
              the classification of diffuse and circumscribed gliomas,
              ependymomas, embryonal tumours and meningiomas, and discuss how
              each change will influence post-surgical treatment, clinical
              trial enrolment and cooperative studies. Although the 2021 WHO
              classification of CNS tumours is a major conceptual advance, its
              implementation on a routine clinical basis presents some
              challenges that will require innovative solutions.",

                   usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify
                   any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text
                   about images is a promising alternative which leverages a
                   much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the
                   simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes
                   with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn
                   SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400
                   million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet.
                   After pre-training, natural language is used to reference
                   learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling
                   zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We
                   study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on
                   over 30 different existing computer vision datasets,
                   spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos,
                   geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object
                   classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most
                   tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised
                   baseline without the need for any dataset specific training.
                   For instance, we match the accuracy of the original

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis traditionally
              involves frozen section histopathology, which may be labor and
              time intensive. Indeed, a technique that streamlines the
              acquisition and evaluation of intraoperative histologic data may
              expedite surgical decision-making and shorten operative time.
              Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is an emerging technology that
              allows for more rapid acquisition and interpretation of
              intraoperative histopathologic data. METHODS: A blinded,
              prospective cohort study was performed for 82 patients undergoing
              resection for a central nervous system tumor. Of these, 21
              patients were diagnosed with glioma either intraoperatively or
              postoperatively on permanent section histology and included in
              this study. Time to diagnosis (TTD) and diagnostic accuracy
              relative to permanent section (the gold standard) were compared
              between SRH-based diagnosis and conventional frozen section
              histology. Diagnostic concordance with permanent section was also
              compared between frozen histopathology and SRH diagnosis.
              RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy was not significantly different
              between methods (P = 1.00). Diagnostic concordance was not
              significantly different between methods when comparing 95\%
              confidence intervals for kappa values ($\kappa$ = 0.215; $\kappa$
              = 0.297; $\kappa$ = 0.369). Lastly, mean TTD was significantly
              shorter with SRH-based diagnosis compared with frozen section (43
              vs. 9.7 minutes, P < 0.0001). SRH was able to identify key
              features associated with varying glioma types. CONCLUSIONS: SRH
              allows for rapid intraoperative diagnosis without sacrificing
              diagnostic accuracy. SRH may serve as a promising adjuvant to
              conventional histopathology to expedite intraoperative pathology

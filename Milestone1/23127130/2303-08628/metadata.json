    "abstract": "By treating the multiple argument identity of the logarithm of the Gamma function as a functional equation, we obtain a curious infinite product representation of the $sinc$ function in terms of the cotangent function. This result is believed to be new. It is then shown how to convert the infinite product to a finite product, which turns out to be a simple telescoping of the double angle $sin$ function. In general, this result unifies known infinite product identities involving various trigonometric functions when the product term index appears as an exponent. In one unusual case, what appears to be a straightforward limit, suggests a counterexample to Weierstrass' factor theorem. A resolution is offered. An Appendix presents the general solution to a simple functional equation. This work is motivated by its educational interest.",

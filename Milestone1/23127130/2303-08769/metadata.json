    "abstract": "This paper outlines a systematic approach to using the Socratic method in developing prompt templates that effectively interact with large language models, including GPT-3. We examine various methods and identify those that yield precise answers and justifications while simultaneously fostering creativity and imagination to enhance creative writing. Specifically, we discuss how techniques such as definition, elenchus, dialectic, maieutics, generalization, and counterfactual reasoning can be applied in engineering prompt templates, and provide practical examples that demonstrate their effectiveness in performing inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning.",

    "abstract": "We model fission at barrier-top energies in a simplified model space that permits comparison of different components of the residual nucleon-nucleon interaction. The model space is built on particle-hole excitations of reference configurations. These are Slater determinants of uniformly spaced orbitals characterized only by their quantum numbers and orbital energies. The residual interaction in the Hamiltonian includes the diabatic interaction connecting similar orbitals at different deformations, the pairing interaction between like nucleons, and a schematic off-diagonal neutron-proton interaction. We find that the fission reaction probability is sensitive to the off-diagonal neutron-proton interaction much more than to the pairing and the diabatic interactions. In particular, the transmission coefficients become insensitive to th e strength of the pairing interaction when the neutron-proton interaction is large. We also find that the branching ratio is insensitive to the final-state scission dynamics, as is assumed in the well-known Bohr-Wheeler theory.",

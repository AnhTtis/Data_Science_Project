\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusions}

We introduced a spatial constraint model to characterize the spatial positions and spatial changes of visual objects.
The spatial constraints are translated into forces that guide the convergence of control point positions as users manipulate visual objects, coordinate axes, and constraints.
Leveraging the spatial constraint model, we developed a prototype system that seamlessly integrates intuitive interactions into preexisting visualizations.
This system facilitates direct manipulation of visual objects, coordinate axes, and constraints, resulting in novel visualization layouts following convergence, thus accommodating diverse interaction tasks.
We demonstrated the capabilities of the model through multiple usage scenarios and a user study.
The findings indicate that the optimization process is intuitive and that the interactions yield effective layouts for various tasks.

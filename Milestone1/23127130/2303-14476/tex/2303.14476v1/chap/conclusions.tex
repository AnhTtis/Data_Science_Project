\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusions}
In this work, we presented a \method{} model that leverages spatial constraints to model the spatial positions and spatial changes of visual objects.
These constraints are transformed into forces that steer the convergence of control points' positions when the user manipulates visual markers, axes, and constraints.
Using the \method{} model, we created a prototype system that automatically adds intuitive interactions to static visualizations.
The system supports direct manipulation of visual objects, axes, and constraints, resulting in a new visualization layout that supports various interaction tasks.
We demonstrated the capabilities of the model through several usage scenarios and a user study. 
The results of the study indicate that the optimization process is intuitive and that the interactions provide effective layouts for various tasks.

    "abstract": "We propose a spatial-constraint approach for modeling spatial-based interactions and enabling interactive visualizations, which involves the manipulation of visualizations through selection, filtering, navigation, arrangement, and aggregation. We proposes a system that activates static visualizations by adding intelligent interactions, which is achieved by associating static visual objects with forces. Our force-directed technique facilitates smooth animated transitions of the visualizations between different interaction states. We showcase the effectiveness of our technique through usage scenarios that involve activating visualizations in real-world settings.",

The zero forcing number is the minimum size of a zero forcing set of vertices and bounds the maximum nullity from above. The spread of a graph parameter at a vertex v or edge e of G is the difference between the value of the parameter on G and on G-v or G-e. Rank spread (at a vertex) was introduced in [4]. This paper introduces vertex spread of the zero forcing number and edge spreads for minimum rank/maximum nullity and zero forcing number. Properties of the spreads are established and used to determine values of the minimum rank/maximum nullity and zero forcing number for various types of grids with a vertex or edge deleted.}

abstract = {An islanded microgrid supplied by multiple distributed energy resources (DERs) often
employs droop-control mechanisms for power sharing. Because microgrids do not include
inertial elements, and low pass filtering of noisy measurements introduces lags in
control, droop-like controllers may pose significant stability concerns. This paper
aims to understand the effects of droop-control on the small-signal stability and
transient response of the microgrid. Towards this goal, we present a compendium of
results on the small-signal stability of droop-controlled inverter-based microgrids
with heterogeneous loads, which distinguishes: (1) lossless vs. lossy networks; (2)
droop mechanisms with and without filters, and (3) mesh vs. radial network topologies.
Small-signal and transient characteristics are also studied using multiple simulation
studies on IEEE test systems.},

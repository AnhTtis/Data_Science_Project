    "abstract": "Taking local anisotropy into consideration, in this paper, some new analytical models of relativistic anisotropic charged quark stars in linear and quadratic regime have been developed. The Einstein-Maxwell field equations have been solved with a particular form of metric potential and electric field intensity. The plots generated show that physical variables such as metric potentials, radial pressure, energy density, charge density, anisotropy, radial speed sound are consistent with realistic stellar models. We obtained some models consistent with stellar objects as 4U 1538-52, Cyg X-2, OGLE-TR-122b and red dwarf Proxima Centauri.",

abstract = {In the design of industrial products ranging from hearing aids to automobiles and aeroplanes, material is distributed so as to maximize the performance and minimize the cost. Historically, human intuition and insight have driven the evolution of mechanical design, recently assisted by computer-aided design approaches. The computer-aided approach known as topology optimization enables unrestricted design freedom and shows great promise with regard to weight savings, but its applicability has so far been limited to the design of single components or simple structures, owing to the resolution limits of current optimization methods1,2. Here we report a computational morphogenesis tool, implemented on a supercomputer, that produces designs with giga-voxel resolution- more than two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. Such resolution provides insights into the optimal distribution of material within a structure that were hitherto unachievable owing to the challenges of scaling up existing modelling and optimization frameworks. As an example, we apply the tool to the design of the internal structure of a full-scale aeroplane wing. The optimized full-wing design has unprecedented structural detail at length scales ranging from tens of metres to millimetres and, intriguingly, shows remarkable similarity to naturally occurring bone structures in, for example, bird beaks. We estimate that our optimized design corresponds to a reduction in mass of 2-5 per cent compared to currently used aeroplane wing designs, which translates into a reduction in fuel consumption of about 40-200 tonnes per year per aeroplane. Our morphogenesis process is generally applicable, not only to mechanical design, but also to flow systems3, antennas4, nano-optics5 and micro-systems.},

@article{bacciaglia2021surface,
abstract = {The topology optimization methodology is widely applied in industrial engineering to design lightweight and efficient components. Despite that, many techniques based on structural optimization return a digital model that is far from being directly manufactured, mainly because of surface noise given by spikes and peaks on the component. For this reason, mesh post-processing is needed. Surface smoothing is one of the numerical procedures that can be applied to a triangulated mesh file to return a more appealing geometry. In literature, there are many smoothing algorithms available, but especially those based on the modification of vertex position suffer from high mesh shrinkage and loss of important geometry features like holes and surface planarity. For these reasons, an improved vertex-based algorithm based on Vollmer's surface smoothing has been developed and introduced in this work along with two case studies included to evaluate its performances compared with existent algorithms. The innovative approach herein developed contains some sub-routines to mitigate the issues of common algorithms, and confirms to be efficient and useful in a real-life industrial context. Thanks to the developed functions able to recognize the geometry feature to be frozen during the smoothing process, the user's intervention is not required to guide the procedure to get proper results.},

Moreover, the combination of topology optimization (TO) with ALM has brought mutual advantages. However, the transition between TO and ALM is a nontrivial step that requires a robust methodology. Thus, the purpose of this work is to evaluate the capabilities of adopting the commonly used Laplacian smoothing methodology as the bridging tool between TO and ALM. Several algorithms are presented and compared in terms of efficiency and performance. Most importantly, a different concept of Laplacian smoothing is presented as well as a set of metrics to evaluate the performance of the algorithms, with the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm being discussed. In the end, the proposed mutable diffusion Laplacian algorithm is presented and exhibits less volume shrinkage and shows better preservation of some geometrical features such as thin members and edges. Moreover, a new volume constraint is presented, decreasing the resulting structural changes in the presented geometry and improving the final mesh quality.},

@article{bendsoe1989optimal,
abstract = {Shape optimization in a general setting requires the determination of the optimal spatial material distribution for given loads and boundary conditions. Every point in space is thus a material point or a void and the optimization problem is a discrete variable one. This paper describes various ways of removing this discrete nature of the problem by the introduction of a density function that is a continuous design variable. Domains of high density then define the shape of the mechanical element. For intermediate densities, material parameters given by an artificial material law can be used. Alternatively, the density can arise naturally through the introduction of periodically distributed, microscopic voids, so that effective material parameters for intermediate density values can be computed through homogenization. Several examples in two-dimensional elasticity illustrate that these methods allow a determination of the topology of a mechanical element, as required for a boundary variations shape optimization technique. {\textcopyright} 1989 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{bi2020topology,
abstract = {The potential of additive manufacturing (AM) in fabricating structurally efficient yet geometrically complicated designs generated from topology optimization is widely recognised. However, various constraints presented in the additive manufacturing process are not directly considered in conventional topology optimization frameworks, potentially impairing the manufacturability of the generated topology. A most noteworthy example is the presence of overhangs, which are downward-facing regions that are not self-supporting. In such areas, traditional AM processes utilise sacrificial supports to act as scaffoldings, which result in additional time, effort and the corresponding cost. Here we present a novel method that can effectively address overhanging features in the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization framework, creating self-supporting yet structurally efficient designs. By using a simple expression, the overhang problem is formulated as a layer-wise relationship, and elements whose modification does not create overhang are selected as candidates for the element updating scheme. To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, numerical examples under different design conditions are presented. A comparison of the self-supporting designs against their non-self-supporting counterparts obtained by conventional topology optimization demonstrates their competitiveness in structural performance. Subsequently, physical 3D prints of the examples further prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in creating self-supporting designs.},

This data can then go through processes of error removal, mesh creation, smoothing, conversion, morphing, and more. The authors detail techniques for those processes using triangle meshes.

The geometrically nonlinear behaviour of the structures are modelled using a total Lagrangian finite element formulation and the equilibrium is found using a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The sensitivities of the objective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. A filtering scheme is used to obtain checkerboard-free and mesh-independent designs and a continuation approach improves convergence to efficient designs. Different objective functions are tested. Minimizing compliance for a fixed load results in degenerated topologies which are very inefficient for smaller or larger loads. The problem of obtaining degenerated `optimal' topologies which only can support the design load is even more pronounced than for structures with linear response. The problem is circumvented by optimizing the structures for multiple loading conditions or by minimizing the complementary elastic work. Examples show that differences in stiffnesses of structures optimized using linear and nonlinear modelling are generally small but they can be large in certain cases involving buckling or snap-through effects.},

Broadly, there are two types of length-scale control in TO: \emph {exact} and \emph {approximate}. While the former is desirable, its implementation can be difficult, and is computationally expensive. Approximate length scale control is therefore preferred, and is often sufficient for early stages of design. In this paper we propose an approximate length scale control strategy for TO, by extending a recently proposed density-based TO formulation using neural networks (TOuNN). Specifically, we enhance TOuNN with a Fourier space projection, to control the minimum and/or maximum length scales. The proposed method does not involve additional constraints, and the sensitivity computations are automated by expressing the computations in an end-end differentiable fashion using the neural net's library. The proposed method is illustrated through several numerical experiments for single and multi-material designs.},

In this paper, we seek to learn a continuous representation for images. Inspired by the recent progress in 3D reconstruction with implicit neural representation, we propose Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF), which takes an image coordinate and the 2D deep features around the coordinate as inputs, predicts the RGB value at a given coordinate as an output. Since the coordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in arbitrary resolution. To generate the continuous representation for images, we train an encoder with LIIF representation via a self-supervised task with super-resolution. The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to ×30 higher resolution, where the training tasks are not provided. We further show that LIIF representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous representation in 2D, it naturally supports the learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths and significantly outperforms the method with resizing the ground-truths.

Many prior works have focused on _latent-encoded_ neural implicits, where a latent vector encoding of a specific shape is also fed as input. While affording latent-space interpolation, this comes at the cost of reconstruction accuracy for any _single_ shape. Training a specific network for each 3D shape, a _weight-encoded_ neural implicit may forgo the latent vector and focus reconstruction accuracy on the details of a single shape. While previously considered as an intermediary representation for 3D scanning tasks or as a toy-problem leading up to latent-encoding tasks, weight-encoded neural implicits have not yet been taken seriously as a 3D shape representation. In this paper, we establish that weight-encoded neural implicits meet the criteria of a first-class 3D shape representation. We introduce a suite of technical contributions to improve reconstruction accuracy, convergence, and robustness when learning the signed distance field induced by a polygonal mesh -- the _de facto_ standard representation. Viewed as a lossy compression, our conversion outperforms standard techniques from geometry processing. Compared to previous latent- and weight-encoded neural implicits we demonstrate superior robustness, scalability, and performance.},

abstract = {Structural optimization is a popular method for designing objects such as bridge trusses, airplane wings, and optical devices. Unfortunately, the quality of solutions depends heavily on how the problem is parameterized. In this paper, we propose using the implicit bias over functions induced by neural networks to improve the parameterization of structural optimization. Rather than directly optimizing densities on a grid, we instead optimize the parameters of a neural network which outputs those densities. This reparameterization leads to different and often better solutions. On a selection of 116 structural optimization tasks, our approach produces the best design 50 percent more often than the best baseline method.},

@article{hu2019texture,
abstract = {A novel generative design approach is developed in this study, which produces a mechanically optimized topological design while simultaneously mimicking an input exemplar texture. The textures are believed embedding certain functional information intrinsic to these objects. Designing objects similar to these textures will not only maintain such functions within the design but also widely expand the design space to explore more design options. However, simple textural replications or reconstructions cannot produce expected designs as an ideal structure has to adapt to the variations of the complex stress distributions caused by external loadings. On the other hand, a simple topology optimization formulation under a single global similarity constraint may produce undesirable structures exhibiting geometric disconnections or boundary protrusions. Due to these considerations, the proposed approach carefully formulates the problem as a classical topological compliance minimization problem under block-wise similarity constraints between the target design and an input texture. In addition, a novel physics-adaptive regulator is also proposed, which fine-tunes the block similarity according to its per-element compliances. Ultimately, we can create a set of design options both physically optimized and geometrically smooth for generative design. Extensive numerical results were also tested to demonstrate the approach's performance.},

To further enhance the convergence of the optimization process, the accuracy of elemental sensitivity numbers is improved by its historical information.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

@article{li2020fourier,
abstract = {One of the main challenges in using deep learning-based methods for simulating physical systems and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is formulating physics-based data in the desired structure for neural networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in this area since graphs offer a natural way of modeling particle interactions and provide a clear way of discretizing the continuum models. However, the graphs constructed for approximating such tasks usually ignore long-range interactions due to unfavorable scaling of the computational complexity with respect to the number of nodes. The errors due to these approximations scale with the discretization of the system, thereby not allowing for generalization under mesh-refinement. Inspired by the classical multipole methods, we propose a novel multi-level graph neural network framework that captures interaction at all ranges with only linear complexity. Our multi-level formulation is equivalent to recursively adding inducing points to the kernel matrix, unifying GNNs with multi-resolution matrix factorization of the kernel. Experiments confirm our multi-graph network learns discretization-invariant solution operators to PDEs and can be evaluated in linear time.},

We present a novel computational framework for high-resolution topology optimization that delivers leaps in simulation capabilities, by two orders of magnitude, from the state-of-the-art approaches. Our technique accommodates computational domains with over one billion grid voxels on a single shared-memory multiprocessor platform, allowing automated emergence of structures with both rich geometric features and exceptional mechanical performance. To achieve this, we track the evolution of thin structures and simulate its elastic deformation in a dynamic narrow-band region around high-density sites to avoid wasted computational effort on large void regions. We have also designed a mixed-precision multigrid-preconditioned iterative solver that keeps the memory footprint of the simulation to a compact size while maintaining double-precision accuracy.

abstract = {Neural representations have emerged as a new paradigm for applications in rendering, imaging, geometric modeling, and simulation. Compared to traditional representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition, similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters, a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then, hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in scale of over 1000X compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an order of magnitude.},

The design problem is modeled within a coupled fluid-structure analysis framework to directly assess aerodynamic performance criteria while optimizing the overall mechanized system. The proposed methodology is illustrated through the design optimization of a quasi-three-dimensional section of an adaptive wing, where the approach is compared to a conventional two-step approach of first optimizing the aerodynamic shape for one or multiple flight conditions, and then finding the mechanism that leads to this shape. The comparison shows that the interactions between flow, structural deformation, mechanism, and actuator must be considered to find the optimal solution.

Recent works have significantly improved their ability to represent high-frequency content by using periodic activations or positional encodings. This often came at the expense of generalization: modern methods are typically optimized for a single signal. We present a new representation that generalizes to multiple instances and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity. We use a dual-MLP architecture to encode the signals. A synthesis network creates a functional mapping from a low-dimensional input (e.g. pixel-position) to the output domain (e.g. RGB color). A modulation network maps a latent code corresponding to the target signal to parameters that modulate the periodic activations of the synthesis network. We also propose a local-functional representation which enables generalization. The signal's domain is partitioned into a regular grid,with each tile represented by a latent code. At test time, the signal is encoded with high-fidelity by inferring (or directly optimizing) the latent code-book. Our approach produces generalizable functional representations of images, videos and shapes, and achieves higher reconstruction quality than prior works that are optimized for a single signal.},

While classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes.

abstract = {Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},

To overcome the inherent disadvantages of pure gradient-descent, RPROP performs a local adaptation of the weight-updates according to the behavior of the error function.

abstract = {Optimal analytical Michell frame structures have been extensively used as benchmark examples in topology optimization, including truss, frame, homogenization, density and level-set based approaches. However, as we will point out, partly the interpretation of Michell's structural continua as discrete frame structures is not accurate and partly, it turns out that limiting structural topology to frame-like structures is a rather severe design restriction and results in structures that are quite far from being stiffness optimal. The paper discusses the interpretation of Michell's theory in the context of numerical topology optimization and compares various topology optimization results obtained with the frame restriction to cases with no design restrictions. For all examples considered, the true stiffness optimal structures are composed of sheets (2D) or closed-walled shell structures (3D) with variable thickness. For optimization problems with one load case, numerical results in two and three dimensions indicate that stiffness can be increased by up to 80 percent when dropping the frame restriction. For simple loading situations, studies based on optimal microstructures reveal theoretical gains of +200 percent. It is also demonstrated how too coarse design discretizations in 3D can result in unintended restrictions on the design freedom and achievable compliance.},

However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail. They also fail to accurately model spatial and temporal derivatives, which is necessary to represent signals defined implicitly by differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or SIRENs, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze SIREN activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, three-dimensional shapes, and their derivatives. Further, we show how SIRENs can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine SIRENs with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of SIREN functions. Please see the project website for a video overview of the proposed method and all applications.},

abstract = {Unsupervised learning with generative models has the potential of discovering rich representations of 3D scenes. While geometric deep learning has explored 3D-structure-aware representations of scene geometry, these models typically require explicit 3D supervision. Emerging neural scene representations can be trained only with posed 2D images, but existing methods ignore the three-dimensional structure of scenes. We propose Scene Representation Networks (SRNs), a continuous, 3D-structure-aware scene representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. SRNs represent scenes as continuous functions that map world coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. By formulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm, SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses, without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes across scenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process. We demonstrate the potential of SRNs by evaluating them for novel view synthesis, few-shot reconstruction, joint shape and appearance interpolation, and unsupervised discovery of a non-rigid face model.1,.},

Although, employment of gyroscopes for automotive applications is reported, what is not discussed is the gyro topology design and optimization for these applications. This article reports parametric topology size optimization of a MEMS gyroscope proper for automotive applications. The structure optimization of a translational dual-mass Coriolis vibratory gyroscope (CVG) with electrostatically sense/excitation mechanism is presented for automotive applications. Fabrication considerations conform to the X-FAB procedures, and application uncertainty is inherent in the vehicle lateral model. The proposed design approach takes into account the inaccessible levels of application uncertainty to optimization, which provides results that are more reliable, compared with the ideal models. More than thirteen thousand virtual cases are studied, in which the gyroscope performance specifications including scale factor, linearity, etc. are calculated. The double-lane-change (DLC) maneuver based on ISO 3888-1 is performed on the optimal candidates in order to apply the vehicle application constrains. The suggested optimal solution is the one with the least yaw rate error with respect to the target yaw rate instructed by the maneuver, which suits best for the automotive application. The results show that the yaw rate error of DLC maneuver improved from about 40 percent to about 1.4 percent using the optimization algorithm, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

The proposed objective function methodology is implemented using the common solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method for topology optimization.

In these numerical studies, the proposed objective function worked well for reducing the response peak in both lower and upper excitation frequencies around the resonance.

In this paper we look at the filter design problem in more detail. We analyze the stability properties of the low-pass filter described in [7, 8], and show how to minimize its running time. We show that most classical techniques used to design finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters can also be used to design significantly faster surface smoothing filters.

This article provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of ML applications in a variety of AM domains. In the DfAM, ML can be leveraged to output new high-performance metamaterials and optimized topological designs. In AM processing, contemporary ML algorithms can help to optimize process parameters, and conduct examination of powder spreading and in-process defect monitoring. On the production of AM, ML is able to assist practitioners in pre-manufacturing planning, and product quality assessment and control. Moreover, there has been an increasing concern about data security in AM as data breaches could occur with the aid of ML techniques. Lastly, it concludes with a section summarizing the main findings from the literature and providing perspectives on some selected interesting applications of ML in research and development of AM.},

Printable overhang heights of samples under various overhang angles are investigated through experimental tests, and the maximum overhang heights are mathematically related to the corresponding critical overhang angle. Subsequently, this relationship is incorporated into the topology optimization formulation to realize the optimized self-supporting structures. The SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalization) method is used to conduct topology optimization. An effective filtering strategy with the overhang restrictions is developed to eliminate the material parts that cannot be supported from below. A typical beam structure to maximize the stiffness is used as a numerical example to demonstrate the proposed method. The numerical results show that the restrictions with both the overhang angles and heights can generate optimized structures with better performance than those only with the overhang angle constraint.

abstract = {The level set method for structural topology optimization has been proposed and studied recently, which is basically a steepest descent method by combining the shape sensitivity analysis with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for moving the level-set function, for doing topology design of structures. The paper considers the multi-material and multi-constraint problems, and investigates the topology optimization algorithm by using the different material representation models, and broadens its application from stiff structure designs and compliant mechanism designs to material designs by a number of benchmark examples. Meanwhile in order to further improve computational efficiency and overcome the difficulty that the level set method cannot generate new material interfaces during the optimization process, the multi-material topological derivative analysis is incorporated into the level set method for topological optimization. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent advances in implicit neural representations show great promise when it comes to generating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Compared to conventional alternatives, such representations employ parameterized neural networks to define, in a mesh-free manner, signals that are highly-detailed, continuous, and fully differentiable. Most prior works aim to exploit these benefits in order to solve PDE-governed forward problems, or associated inverse problems that are defined by a small number of parameters. In this work, we present a novel machine learning approach to tackle topology optimization (TO) problems. Topology optimization refers to an important class of inverse problems that typically feature very high-dimensional parameter spaces and objective landscapes which are highly non-linear. To effectively leverage neural representations in the context of TO problems, we use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize both density and displacement fields. Using sensitivity analysis with a moving mean squared error, we show that our formulation can be used to efficiently minimize traditional structural compliance objectives. As we show through our experiments, a major benefit of our approach is that it enables self-supervised learning of continuous solution spaces to topology optimization problems.},

@article{zhang2021editable,
abstract = {Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience, but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first approach for editable free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale view-dependent dynamic scenes using only 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity, including the environment itself, is formulated into a spatio-temporal coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such a layered representation supports manipulations of the dynamic scene while still supporting a wide free viewing experience. In our ST-NeRF, we represent the dynamic entity/layer as a continuous function, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality, photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic scenes.},

@article{zhang2020three,
abstract = {This paper studies additive manufacturing oriented structural topology optimization with SIMP approach and aims at 3D high-resolution printable structural topology design with overhang and horizontal minimum length control for minimum compliance. To start with, we construct a hyperplane in ℝ4 by fitting a local element density distribution in the 18 Elements Scheme, use its gradient to estimate the overhang angle, the directional-dependent overhang angle and formulate the corresponding constraints. Next, we propose a Horizontal Square Scheme and four support sets around the concerned element. The horizontal minimum length is controlled by forbidding the concerned element's density to be larger than the average density of the elements in one of the support sets. By combining these two constraints, the hanging feature is well suppressed. A new implementation scheme with an improved weight function is proposed to meet these element wise AM constraints well. To get high resolution structural boundaries with low computational efforts, this paper applies the multiresolution topology optimization (MTOP) method. The structural TO problem is solved by MMA. A number of numerical examples and AM experiments show the effectiveness of this method. The present approach works efficiently when the building direction is in slight misalignment with the vertical direction.},

@article{zhang2021tonr,
abstract = {The rapid development of deep learning has opened a new door to the exploration of topology optimization methods. The combination of deep learning and topology optimization has become one of the hottest research fields at the moment. Different from most existing work, this paper conducts an in-depth study on the method of directly using neural networks (NN) to carry out topology optimization. Inspired by the idea from the field of “Inverting Representation of Image” and “Physics-Informed Neural Network”, a topology optimization via neural reparameterization framework (TONR) that can solve various topology optimization problems is formed. The core idea of TONR is Reparameterization, which means the update of the design variables (pseudo-density) in the conventional topology optimization method is transformed into the update of the NN's parameters. The sensitivity analysis in the conventional topology optimization method is realized by automatic differentiation technology. With the update of NN's parameters, the density field is optimized. Some strategies for dealing with design constraints, determining NN's initial parameters, and accelerating training are proposed in the paper. In addition, the solution of the multi-constrained topology optimization problem is also embedded in the TONR framework. Numerical examples show that TONR can stably obtain optimized structures for different optimization problems, including the stress-constrained problem, structural natural frequency optimization problems, compliant mechanism design problems, heat conduction system design problems, and the optimization problem of hyperelastic structures. Compared with the existing methods that combine deep learning with topology optimization, TONR does not need to construct a dataset in advance and does not suffer from structural disconnection. The structures obtained by TONR can be comparable to the conventional methods.},

abstract = {In information theory, Fisher information and Shannon information (entropy) are respectively used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the distribution modeling and the uncertainty in specifying the outcome of given variables. These two quantities are complementary and are jointly applied to information behavior analysis in most cases. The uncertainty property in information asserts a fundamental trade-off between Fisher information and Shannon information, which enlightens us the relationship between the encoder and the decoder in variational auto-encoders (VAEs). In this paper, we investigate VAEs in the Fisher-Shannon plane, and demonstrate that the representation learning and the log-likelihood estimation are intrinsically related to these two information quantities. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we provide with a better comprehension of VAEs in tasks such as high-resolution reconstruction, and representation learning in the perspective of Fisher information and Shannon information. We further propose a variant of VAEs, termed as Fisher auto-encoder (FAE), for practical needs to balance Fisher information and Shannon information. Our experimental results have demonstrated its promise in improving the reconstruction accuracy and avoiding the non-informative latent code as occurred in previous works.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a novel two-scale framework to optimize the structure and the material distribution of an object given its functional specifications. Our approach utilizes multi-material microstructures as low-level building blocks of the object. We start by precomputing the material property gamut-the set of bulk material properties that can be achieved with all material microstructures of a given size. We represent the boundary of this material property gamut using a level set field. Next, we propose an efficient and general topology optimization algorithm that simultaneously computes an optimal object topology and spatially varying material properties constrained by the precomputed gamut. Finally, we map the optimal spatially varying material properties onto the microstructures with the corresponding properties to generate a high-resolution printable structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by designing, optimizing, and fabricating objects in different material property spaces on the level of a trillion voxels, that is, several orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with current systems.},

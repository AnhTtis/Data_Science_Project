\section{Conclusion}

We introduced \putouralg, a novel SSL learning approach targeted at the low-label regime. Our approach combines co-training, clustering and prototypical learning to improve pseudo-labels accuracy. We demonstrate that our method leads to significant gains on multiple SSL benchmarks and better convergence properties. We hope that our work helps to commodify deep learning in domains where human annotations are expensive to obtain.

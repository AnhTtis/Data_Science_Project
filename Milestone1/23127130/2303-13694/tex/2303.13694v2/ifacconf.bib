Recent advances in inducing point methods have sped up GP marginal likelihood and posterior mean computations, leaving posterior covariance estimation and sampling as the remaining computational bottlenecks. In this paper we address these shortcomings by using the Lanczos algorithm to rapidly approximate the predictive covariance matrix. Our approach, which we refer to as LOVE (LanczOs Variance Estimates), substantially improves time and space complexity. In our experiments, LOVE computes covariances up to 2,000 times faster and draws samples 18,000 times faster than existing methods, all without sacrificing accuracy.}

We develop a stochastic nonlinear model-predictive controller (SNMPC) that learns the tire–road friction relationship online using standard automotive-grade sensors. We learn the tire-friction function using a Bayesian approach, where the friction curve is modeled as a Gaussian process. The estimator outputs the estimate of the tire-friction model as well as the uncertainty function of the estimate, which expresses the conﬁdence in the model for different driving regimes. The SNMPC exploits the uncertainty estimate in its prediction model to take proper action. We validate the approach using the high-ﬁdelity vehicle simulator CarSim and compare against various nominal NMPC approaches. The results indicate more than six times better performance for the proposed adaptive SNMPC in closed-loop cost over the simulation time.},

Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive deﬁniteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be conﬁgured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the ﬁrst operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efﬁcient when solving parametrized problems arising in ﬁnance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.},

A fundamental challenge encountered in designing these software components lies in predicting the vehicle’s future state (e.g. position, orientation, and speed) with high accuracy. The root cause is the difficulty in identifying vehicle model parameters that capture the effects of lateral tire slip. We present a model-based planning and control framework for autonomous racing that significantly reduces the effort required in system identification and control design. Our approach alleviates the gap induced by simulation-based controller design by learning from on-board sensor measurements. A major focus of this work is empirical, thus, we demonstrate our contributions by experiments on validated 1:43 and 1:10 scale autonomous racing simulations.}

Specifically, we show how to exploit the differentiability of Gaussian Processes to create a state-dependent linearized approximation of the true continuous dynamics that can be integrated with model predictive control. Our approach is compatible with most Gaussian process approaches for system identification, and can learn an accurate model using modest amounts of training data. We validate our approach by learning the dynamics of an unstable system such as a segway with a 7-D state space and 2-D input space (using only one minute of data), and we show that the resulting controller is robust to unmodelled dynamics and disturbances, while state-of-the-art control methods based on nominal models can fail under small perturbations.

	abstract = {Data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC), where the system model is learned from data with machine learning, has recently gained increasing interests in the control community. Gaussian Processes (GP), as a type of statistical models, are particularly attractive due to their modeling flexibility and their ability to provide probabilistic estimates of prediction uncertainty. GP-based MPC has been developed and applied, however the optimization problem is typically non-convex and highly demanding, and scales poorly with model size. This causes unsatisfactory solving performance, even with state-of-the-art solvers, and makes the approach less suitable for real-time control. We develop a method based on a new concept, called linearized Gaussian Process, and Sequential Convex Programming, that can significantly improve the solving performance of GP-based MPC. Our method is not only faster but also much more scalable and predictable than other commonly used methods, as it is much less influenced by the model size. The efficiency and advantages of the algorithm are demonstrated clearly in a numerical example.},

    "abstract": "We study the almost periods of the eigenmodes of flat planar manifolds in the high energy limit. We prove in particular that the Gaussian Arithmetic Random Waves replicate almost identically at a scale at most ${\\ell}$n := n -- 1 2 exp (Nn), where Nn is the number of ways n can be written as a sum of two squares. It provides a qualitative interpretation of the full correlation phenomenon of the nodal length, which is known to happen at scales larger than ${\\ell}$ ' n := n --1/2 N A n. We provide also a heuristic with a toy model pleading that the minimal scale of replication should be closer to ${\\ell}$ ' n than ${\\ell}$n. Contents 1. Introduction 1 2.

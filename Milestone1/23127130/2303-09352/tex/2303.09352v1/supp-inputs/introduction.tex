Here we provide proofs for our theoretical results on the hyperspherical uniform and hubness;
the decomposition of the KL divergence;
and the minima of our methods' loss functions.
We also give additional details on the implementation and hyperparameters for \method and \methodS -- and include the complete tables of 1-shot and 5-shot results for all classifiers, datasets and feature extractors.
Finally, we briefly reflect on potential negative societal impacts of our work.

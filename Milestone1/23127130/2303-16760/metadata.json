    "abstract": "Swarm Intelligence algorithms have gained significant attention in recent years as a means of solving complex and non-deterministic problems. These algorithms are inspired by the collective behavior of natural creatures, and they simulate this behavior to develop intelligent agents for computational tasks. One such algorithm is Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants and their pheromone laying mechanism. ACO is used for solving difficult problems that are discrete and combinatorial in nature. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental task in natural language processing that aims to assign a part-of-speech role to each word in a sentence. In this research paper, proposed a high-performance POS-tagging method based on ACO called ACO-tagger. This method achieved a high accuracy rate of 96.867%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method is fast and efficient, making it a viable option for practical applications.",

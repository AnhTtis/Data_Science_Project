    "abstract": "We propose a half-day workshop at IEEE VIS 2023 on the topic of communication and collaboration around data. Specifically, we aim to gather researchers interested on multimodal, synchronous, and remote or hybrid forms of communication and collaboration within organizational and educational settings. This topic lies at the intersection of data visualization, human-computer interaction, and computer-supported collaborative work, and overlaps thematically with several prior seminars and workshops. Our intended outcomes for the workshop include assembling a corpus of inspiring examples and a design space, ideally consolidated into a survey paper, as well as the establishment of new collaborations and a shared research agenda. We anticipate a format comprised of short presentations and demos, an invited keynote or fireside chat, and a breakout group session organized around specific application domains.",

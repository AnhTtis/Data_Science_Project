    "abstract": "People with diabetes have to manage their blood glucose level to keep it within an appropriate range. Predicting whether future glucose values will be outside the healthy threshold is of vital importance in order to take corrective actions to avoid potential health damage. In this paper we describe our research with the aim of predicting the future behavior of blood glucose levels, so that hypoglycemic events may be anticipated. The approach of this work is the application of transformation functions on glucose time series, and their use in convolutional neural networks. We have tested our proposed method using real data from 4 different diabetes patients with promising results.",

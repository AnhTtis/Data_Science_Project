    "abstract": "I introduce a way of constructing a fiber bundle whose fibers are given by hypercomplex algebras and woven by appropriate structure group, and present that a novel gauge theory can be built on the hypercomplex fiber bundle. In this work, I aim to answer a question about how nature selects one preferred vacuum among degenerate physical vacua, called {\\it vacuum selection problem}. In the end, I found presence of the impenetrable domain wall that prohibits phase transition between the two vacua. To be specific, I found that in this theory, one particular vacuum between two degenerate physical vacua for Higgs-like scalar potential can be dynamically chosen with priority due to intrinsic even parity of both a scalar field and its vacuum under a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, even though its scalar potential is given to be $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric under both odd- and even-parity transformations of the scalar field. This means that the vacuum selection problem can be resolved in this gauge theory. I suggest that this work may be a gateway to addressing the theoretical origin of the true physical vacuum that nature takes.",

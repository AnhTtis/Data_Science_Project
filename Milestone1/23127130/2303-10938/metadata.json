    "abstract": "Under continuous light illumination, it is known that localized domains with segregated halide compositions form in semiconducting mixed-halide perovskites, thus severely limiting their optoelectronic applications due to the negative changes in bandgap energies and charge-carrier characteristics. Here we deposit mixed-halide perovskite CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals onto an indium tin oxide substrate, whose temperature can be rapidly changed by ~10 degree in a few seconds by applying or removing an external voltage. Such a sudden temperature change induces a temporary transition of CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals from the segregated phase to the mixed phase, the latter of which can be permanently maintained when the light illumination is coupled with periodic heating cycles. These findings mark the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase-segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental studies and practical devices using mixed-halide perovskites.",

abstract = {We have obtained 1087 NIR (JHKs) measurements of 21 SNe Ia using PAIRITEL, nearly doubling the number of well-sampled NIR SN Ia light curves. These data strengthen the evidence that SNe Ia are excellent standard candles in the NIR, even without correction for optical light-curve shape. We construct fiducial NIR templates for normal SNe Ia from our sample, excluding only the three known peculiar SNe Ia: SN 2005bl, SN 2005hk, and SN 2005ke. The H-band absolute magnitudes in this sample of 18 SNe Ia have an intrinsic rms of only 0.15 mag with no correction for light-curve shape. We found a relationship between the H-band extinction and optical color excess of AH=0.2E(B-V). This variation is as small as the scatter in distance modulus measurements currently used for cosmology based on optical light curves after corrections for light-curve shape. Combining the homogeneous PAIRITEL measurements with 23 SNe Ia from the literature, these 41 SNe Ia have standard H-band magnitudes with an rms scatter of 0.16 mag. The good match of our sample with the literature sample suggests there are few systematic problems with the photometry. We present a nearby NIR Hubble diagram that shows no correlation of the residuals from the Hubble line with light-curve properties. Future samples that account for optical and NIR light-curve shapes, absorption, spectroscopic variation, or host-galaxy properties may reveal effective ways to improve the use of SNe Ia as distance indicators. Since systematic errors due to dust absorption in optical bands remain the leading difficulty in the cosmological use of supernovae, the good behavior of SN Ia NIR light curves and their relative insensitivity to reddening make these objects attractive candidates for future cosmological work.},

abstract = {From observations of 7 Type Ia supernovae obtained during the last four years at the Las Campanas and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatories, along with previous published data for 9 supernovae, we present JHK Hubble diagrams and derive absolute magnitudes at maximum light of 16 objects out to a redshift of 0.038. On the scale of H_0 = 72 km/s/Mpc we find mean absolute magnitudes at maximum of -18.57, -18.24, and -18.42 for J, H, and K, respectively, with 1-sigma uncertainties of the distributions of values of +/- 0.14, 0.18, and 0.12 mag. The data indicate no significant decline rate relations for the infrared. Thus, Type Ia SNe at maximum brightness appear to be standard candles in the infrared at the +/- 0.20 mag level or better. The minimum requirements for obtaining the distance to a Type Ia SN are: reasonably accurate values of Delta m_15(B) and T(B_max), and one night of infrared data in the -12 to +10 d window with respect to T(B_max).},

We use one sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh) ejecta model with 1.04 M⊙ and one Chandrasekhar (MCh) ejecta model with 1.40 M⊙.We introduce clumping factors f = 0.33, 0.25, and 0.10, which are constant throughout the ejecta, and compare results to the unclumped f = 1.0 case. We find that clumping is a natural mechanism to reduce the ionization of the ejecta, reducing emission from [Fe III], [Ar III], and [S III] by a factor of a few. For decreasing values of the clumping factor f, the [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291,7324 doublet became a dominant cooling line for our MCh model but remained weak in our sub-MCh model. Strong [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291,7324 indicates non-thermal heating in that region and may constrain explosion modelling. Due to the low abundance of stable nickel, our sub-MCh model never showed the [Ni II] 1.939-$\mu$m diagnostic feature for all clumping values.},

abstract = {We explore the properties of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe) together with their red supergiant (RSG) star progenitors. Using MESA STAR, we modulate the parameters (e.g. mixing length, overshoot, rotation, metallicity) that control the evolution of a 15Mȯ mainsequence star to produce a variety of physical pre-SN models and SN II-P ejecta. We extend previous modelling of SN II-P radiation to include photospheric and nebular phases, as well as multiband light curves and spectra. Our treatment does not assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, is time dependent, treats explicitly the effects of line blanketing and incorporates non-thermal processes. We find that the colour properties of SNe II-P require large model atoms for Fe I and Fe II, much larger than previously adopted. The colour properties also imply RSG progenitors of limited extent ($\sim$500 Rȯ) -larger progenitor stars produce an SN II-P radiation that remains too blue for too long. This finding calls for a reduction of RSG radii, perhaps through a strengthening of convective energy transport in RSG envelopes. Increased overshoot and rotation reduce the ratio of ejecta to helium-core mass, similarly to an increase in main-sequence mass, and thus complicate the inference of progenitor masses. In contrast to the great sensitivity on progenitor radius, SN II-P colour evolution appears insensitive to variations in explosion energy. Finally, we document the numerous SN II-P signatures that vary with progenitor metallicity, revealing their potential for metallicity determinations in the nearby and distant Universe.},

Although subject to uncertainties in convection and stellar mass-loss rates, our initial conditions come from physically-consistent models that treat evolution from the main-sequence, the onset of the pair-production instability, and the explosion phase. With our set of input models characterized by large 56Ni and ejecta masses, and large kinetic energies, we recover qualitatively the Type II-Plateau, II-peculiar, and Ib/c light-curve morphologies, although they have larger peak bolometric luminosities ($\sim$10^9 to 10^10 Lsun) and a longer duration ($\sim$200d). We discuss the spectral properties for each model during the photospheric and nebular phases, including Balmer lines in II-P and II-pec at early times, the dominance of lines from intermediate-mass-elements (IMEs) near the bolometric maximum, and the strengthening of metal line blanketing thereafter. Having similar He-core properties, all models exhibit similar post-peak spectra that are strongly blanketed by FeII and FeI lines, characterized by red colors, and that arise from photospheres/ejecta with a temperature of <4000K. Combined with the modest line widths after bolometric peak, these properties contrast with those of known super-luminous SNe suggesting that PISNe are yet to be discovered. Being reddish, PISNe will be difficult to observe at high redshift except when they stem from RSG explosions, in which case they could be used as metallicity probes and distance indicators.},

The spectra were obtained with the HEROS {\'{e}}chelle spectrograph installed at the 1.2-m TIGRE telescope. We present a series of 33 spectra with a resolution of R ≈ 20 000, which covers the important bright phases in the evolution of SN 2014J during the period from 2014 January 24 to April 1. The spectral evolution of SN 2014J is derived empirically. The expansion velocities of the Si II P-Cygni features were measured and show the expected decreasing behaviour, beginning with a high velocity of 14 000 km s-1 on January 24. The Ca II infrared triplet feature shows a high-velocity component with expansion velocities of >20 000 km s-1 during the early evolution apart from the normal component showing similar velocities as Si II. Further broad P-Cygni profiles are exhibited by the principal lines of Ca II, Mg II and Fe II. The TIGRE SN 2014J spectra also resolve several very sharp Na I D doublet absorption components. Our analysis suggests interesting substructures in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy M82, as well as in our Milky Way, confirming other work on this SN. We were able to identify the interstellar absorption of M82 in the lines of Ca II H & K at 3933 and 3968 {\AA} as well as K I at 7664 and 7698 {\AA}. Furthermore, we confirm several diffuse interstellar bands, at wavelengths of 6196, 6283, 6376, 6379and 6613 {\AA} and give their measured equivalent widths.},

abstract = {We present nine near-infrared (NIR) spectra of supernova (SN) 2005cf at epochs from -10 to +42d with respect to B-band maximum, complementing the existing excellent data sets available for this prototypical Type Ia SN at other wavelengths. The spectra show a time evolution and spectral features characteristic of normal Type Ia SNe, as illustrated by a comparison with SNe 1999ee, 2002bo and 2003du. The broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of SN 2005cf is studied in combined ultraviolet (UV), optical and NIR spectra at five epochs between ∼8d before and ∼10d after maximum light. We also present synthetic spectra of the hydrodynamic explosion model W7, which reproduce the key properties of SN 2005cf not only at UV-optical as previously reported, but also at NIR wavelengths. From the radiative-transfer calculations we infer that fluorescence is the driving mechanism that shapes the SED of SNe Ia. In particular, the NIR part of the spectrum is almost devoid of absorption features, and instead dominated by fluorescent emission of both iron-group material and intermediate-mass elements at pre-maximum epochs, and pure iron-group material after maximum light. A single P-Cygni feature of Mgii at early epochs and a series of relatively unblended Coii lines at late phases allow us to constrain the regions of the ejecta in which the respective elements are abundant. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Aims. With our time-dependent model atmosphere code PHOENIX, our goal is to simulate light curves and spectra of hydrodynamical models of all types of supernovae. In this work, we simulate near-infrared light curves of SNe Ia and confirm the cause of the secondary maximum. Methods. We apply a simple energy solver to compute the evolution of an SN Ia envelope during the free expansion phase. Included in the solver are energy changes due to expansion, the energy deposition of $\gamma$-rays and interaction of radiation with the material. Results. We computed theoretical light curves of several SN Ia hydrodynamical models in the I, J, H, and K bands and compared them to the observed SN Ia light curves of SN 1999ee and SN 2002bo. By changing a line scattering parameter in time, we obtained quite reasonable fits to the observed near-infrared light curves. This is a strong hint that detailed NLTE effects in IR lines have to be modeled, which will be a future focus of our work. Conclusions. We found that IR line scattering is very important for the near-infrared SN Ia light curve modeling. In addition, the recombination of Fe III to Fe II and of Co III to Co II is responsible for the secondary maximum in the near-infrared bands. For future work the consideration of NLTE for all lines (including the IR subordinate lines) will be crucial. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We compute optical and infrared light curves of the pulsating class of delayed detonation models for Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia's) using an elaborate treatment of the Local Thermodynamic Equilbrium (LTE) radiation transport, equation of state and ionization balance, expansion opacity including the cooling by CO, Co(+), and SiO, and a Monte Carlo gamma-ray deposition scheme. The models have an amount of Ni-56 in the range from approximately or equal to 0.1 solar mass up to 0.7 solar mass depending on the density at which the transition from a deflagration to a detonation occurs. Models with a large nickel production give light curves comparable to those of typical Type Ia supernovae. Subluminous supernovae can be explained by models with a low nickel production. Multiband light curves are presented in comparison with the normally bright event SN 1992bc and the subluminous events Sn 1991bg and SN 1992bo to establish the principle that the delayed detonation paradigm in Chandrasekhar mass models may give a common explosion mechanism accounting for both normal and subluminous SN Ia's. Secondary IR-maxima are formed in the models of normal SN Ia's as a photospheric effect if the photospheric radius continues to increase well after maximum light. Secondary maxima appear later and stronger in models with moderate expansion velocities and with radioactive material closer to the surface. Model light curves for subluminous SN Ia's tend to show only one 'late' IR-maximum. In some delayed detonation models shell-like envelopes form, which consist of unburned carbon and oxygen. The formation of molecules in these envelopes is addressed. If the model retains a C/O-envelope and is subluminous, strong vibration bands of CO may appear, typically several weeks past maximum light. CO should be very weak or absent in normal Sn Ia's.},

abstract = {The radioactive decay energy (RDE) deposition in supernovae from the decay chain 56 Ni → 56 Co → 56 Fe usually directly powers the ultraviolet/optical/infrared (UVOIR) bolometric luminosity of supernovae in their quasi-steady state phase until very late times. The result for this phase is exponential/quasi-exponential UVOIR bolometric light curves and often exponential/quasi-exponential broad band light curves. A presentation is given of a simple, approximate, analytic treatment of RDE deposition that provides a straightforward understanding of the exponential/quasi-exponential behavior of the UVOIR bolometric luminosity and a partial understanding of the exponential/quasi-exponential behavior of the broad band light curves. The treatment reduces to using a normalized deposition function N * Ni (t) as an analysis tool. (The absolute deposition is determined by specifying the initial 56 Ni mass or fitting absolute supernova UVOIR bolometric luminosity.) The time evolution of N * Ni (t) is determined by three time scales: the half-lives of 56 Ni and 56 Co, and a fiducial time parameter t 0 that governs the time-varying $\gamma$-ray optical depth behavior of a supernova. The t 0 parameter can be extracted from a structural supernova model, or by fitting either the RDE deposition curve from a more detailed treatment of deposition or the observed UVOIR bolometric light curve from the quasi-steady state phase of a supernova. A t 0 parameter obtained from observations can provide a constraint on the important physical parameters of the supernova. The effective use of this constraint requires having an adequate parameterized structural supernova model. The N * Ni (t) function is used to analyze the preliminary UVOIR bolometric light curve of SN Ic 1998bw (the possible cause of $\gamma$-ray burst GRB980425). The SN 1998bw fiducial time t 0 is found to be 134.42 days and a prediction is made for the evolution of the SN 1998bw RDE deposition curve and quasi-steady state UVOIR bolometric light curve out to day 1000 after the explosion. A crude estimate (perhaps a factor of a few too small) of the SN 1998bw mass obtained from a parameterized core-collapse model and t 0 = 134.42 days is 4.26 M ⊙. As further examples of the simple analytic treatment, the RDE deposition and luminosity evolution of SN Ia 1992A and SN II 1987A have also been examined. The simple analytic treatment of RDE deposition has actually existed for 20 years at least without, apparently, being discussed at length. The main value of this paper is the explicit, detailed, general presentation of this analytic treatment.},

abstract = {We use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5 year catalogue of photometrically-classified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to identify 70 SNe Ia that have occurred within red-sequence selected clusters of galaxies. We compare the cluster SN light-curve properties and environmental properties to 1020 DES SNe Ia located in the field, the largest comparison of two such samples to date. We find an tentative indication (98.5 per cent confidence level) that, on average, SNe Ia located in galaxy clusters are faster declining compared to those located in the field. We find no evidence of a difference in SN Ia colour between the two samples. Additionally, there is strong evidence (99.98 per cent confidence level) that cluster SNe Ia occur on average in more massive host galaxies than field SNe. We calculate the rate of SNe Ia per stellar mass in galaxy clusters, and find the average rate in the high mass (10 ≤ log (M * /M) ≤ 11.25) cluster galaxies to be comparable to equivalent field mass galaxies, with an average difference of 1.3 ± 0.3. Considering the full mass ranges of both samples, we measure a decrease in the overall rate per unit mass in the clusters compared to the field. Differences in the two samples rates could be caused by an excess of white dwarfs in clusters due to a different initial mass function, cluster galaxy mergers re-igniting star formation, or a difference in metallicity between the two environments.},

abstract = {Optical spectropolarimetry of the normal thermonuclear supernova (SN) 2019np from −14.5 to +14.5 days relative to B-band maximum detected an intrinsic continuum polarization (pcont) of 0.21%±0.09% at the first epoch. Between days −11.5 and +0.5, pcont remained ∼0 and by day +14.5 was again significant at 0.19%±0.10%. Not considering the first epoch, the dominant axis of Si ii$\lambda$6355 was roughly constant staying close the continuum until both rotated in opposite directions on day +14.5. Detailed radiation-hydrodynamical simulations produce a very steep density slope in the outermost ejecta so that the low first-epoch pcont ≈ 0.2% nevertheless suggests a separate structure with an axis ratio ∼2 in the outer carbon-rich (3.5–4)× 10−3M⊙. Large-amplitude fluctuations in the polarization profiles and a flocculent appearance of the polar diagram for the Ca ii near-infrared triplet (NIR3) may be related by a common origin. The temporal evolution of the polarization spectra agrees with an off-center delayed detonation. The late-time increase in polarization and the possible change in position angle are also consistent with an aspherical 56Ni core. The pcont and the absorptions due to Si ii $\lambda$6355 and Ca ii NIR3 form in the same region of the extended photosphere, with an interplay between line occultation and thermalisation producing p. Small-scale polarization features may be due to small-scale structures, but many could be related to atomic patterns of the quasi-continuum; they hardly have an equivalent in the total-flux spectra. We compare SN 2019np to other SNe and develop future objectives and strategies for SN Ia spectropolarimetry.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are explosions of white dwarf stars that facilitate exquisite measurements of cosmological expansion history, but improvements in accuracy and precision are hindered by observational biases. Of particular concern is the apparent difference in the corrected brightnesses of SNe Ia in different host galaxy environments. SNe Ia in more massive, passive, older environments appear brighter after having been standardized by their light-curve properties. The luminosity difference commonly takes the form of a step function. Recent works imply that environmental characteristics that trace the age of the stellar population in the vicinity of SNe show the largest steps. Here we use simulations of SN Ia populations to test the impact of using different tracers and investigate promising new models of the step. We test models with a total-to-selective dust extinction ratio $R_V$ that changes between young and old SN Ia host galaxies, as well as an intrinsic luminosity difference between SNe from young and old progenitors. The data are well replicated by a model driven by a galaxy-age varying $R_V$ and no intrinsic SN luminosity difference, and we find that specific star-formation rate measured locally to the SN is a relatively pure tracer of this galaxy age difference. We cannot rule out an intrinsic difference causing part of the observed step and show that if luminosity differences are caused by multiple drivers then no single environmental measurement is able to accurately trace them. We encourage the use of multiple tracers in luminosity corrections to negate this issue.},

Here, we present high-quality NIR LCs for 83 SNe Ia ranging from $0.002 < z < 0.09$ as a part of the Dark Energy, H$_0$, and peculiar Velocities using Infrared Light from Supernovae (DEHVILS) survey. Observations are taken using UKIRT's WFCAM, where the median depth of the images is 20.7, 20.1, and 19.3 mag (Vega) for $Y$, $J$, and $H$-bands, respectively. The median number of epochs per SN Ia is 18 for all three bands ($YJH$) combined and 6 for each band individually. We fit 47 SN Ia LCs that pass strict quality cuts using three LC models, SALT3, SNooPy, and BayeSN and find scatter on the Hubble diagram to be comparable to or better than scatter from optical-only fits in the literature. Fitting NIR-only LCs, we obtain standard deviations ranging from 0.128-0.135 mag. Additionally, we present a refined calibration method for transforming 2MASS magnitudes to WFCAM magnitudes using HST CALSPEC stars that results in a 0.03 mag shift in the WFCAM $Y$-band magnitudes.},

Based on these properties, we find that fast-declining SN Ia separate into two categories based on their bolometric and NIR properties. The peak bolometric luminosity (Lmax), the phase of the first maximum relative to the optical, the NIR peak luminosity, and the occurrence of a second maximum in the NIR distinguish a group of very faint SN Ia. Fast-declining supernovae show a large range of peak bolometric luminosities (Lmax differing by up to a factor of $\sim$8). All fast-declining SN Ia with Lmax < 0.3× 1043 erg s-1 are spectroscopically classified as 91bg-like and show only a single NIR peak. SNe with Lmax > 0.5× 1043 erg s-1 appear to smoothly connect to normal SN Ia. The total ejecta mass (Mej) values for SNe with enough late time data are 1 M{\textperiodcentered}, indicating a sub-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor for these SNe.},

abstract = {We obtained optical photometry of SN 2003gs on 49 nights, from 2 to 494 days after T(B max). We also obtained near-IR photometry on 21 nights. SN 2003gs was the first fast declining Type Ia SN that has been well observed since SN 1999by. While it was subluminous in optical bands compared to more slowly declining Type Ia SNe, it was not subluminous at maximum light in the near-IR bands. There appears to be a bimodal distribution in the near-IR absolute magnitudes of Type Ia SNe at maximum light. Those that peak in the near-IR after T(B max) are subluminous in the all bands. Those that peak in the near-IR prior to T(B max), such as SN 2003gs, have effectively the same near-IR absolute magnitudes at maximum light regardless of the decline rate $\Delta$m 15(B). Near-IR spectral evidence suggests that opacities in the outer layers of SN 2003gs are reduced much earlier than for normal Type Ia SNe. That may allow $\gamma$rays that power the luminosity to escape more rapidly and accelerate the decline rate. This conclusion is consistent with the photometric behavior of SN2003gs in the IR, which indicates a faster than normal decline from approximately normal peak brightness. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.

Comparing the observations with theoretical models calculated with the time dependent extension of the PHOENIX code, we identify the feature that causes the secondary maximum in the I-band light curve. Fe II 3d 6 (3 D)4s-3d 6 (5 D)4p and similar high-excitation transitions produce a blended feature at ∼7500 {\AA}, which causes the rise of the light curve towards the secondary maximum. The series of observed spectra of SN 2014J and archival data of SN 2011fe confirm this conclusion. We further studied the plateau phase of the R-band light curve of SN 2014J and searched for features which contribute to the flux. The theoretical models do not clearly indicate a new feature that may cause the R-band plateau phase. However, Co II features in the range of 6500-7000 {\AA} and the Fe II feature of the I band are clearly seen in the theoretical spectra, but do not appear to provide all of the flux necessary for the R-band plateau.},

abstract = {We explore the physics of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves and spectra using the 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) time-dependent radiative-transfer code CMFGEN. Rather than adjusting ejecta properties to match observations, we select as input one 'standard' 1D Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation hydrodynamical model, and then explore the sensitivity of radiation and gas properties of the ejecta on radiative-transfermodelling assumptions. The correct computation of SN Ia radiation is not exclusively a solution to an 'opacity problem', characterized by the treatment of a large number of lines. We demonstrate that the key is to identify and treat important atomic processes consistently. This is not limited to treating line blanketing in non-LTE. We show that including forbidden-line transitions of metals, and in particular Co, is increasingly important for the temperature and ionization of the gas beyond maximum light. Non-thermal ionization and excitation are also critical since they affect the colour evolution and the $\Delta$M15 decline rate of our model. While impacting little the bolometric luminosity, a more complete treatment of decay routes leads to enhanced line blanketing, e.g. associated with 48Ti in the U and B bands. Overall, we find that SN Ia radiation properties are influenced in a complicated way by the atomic data we employ, so that obtaining converged results is a real challenge. Nonetheless, with our fully fledged CMFGEN model, we obtain good agreement with the golden standard Type Ia SN 2005cf in the optical and near-IR, from 5 to 60 d after explosion, suggesting that assuming spherical symmetry is not detrimental to SN Ia radiative-transfer modelling at these times. Multi-D effects no doubt matter, but they are perhaps less important than accurately treating the non-LTE processes that are crucial to obtain reliable temperature and ionization structures. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {A rare class of supernovae (SNe) is characterized by strong interaction between the ejecta and several solar masses of circumstellar matter (CSM) as evidenced by strong Balmer-line emission. Within the first few weeks after the explosion, they may display spectral features similar to overluminous Type Ia SNe, while at later phase their observation properties exhibit remarkable similarities with some extreme case of Type IIn SNe that show strong Balmer lines years after the explosion. We present polarimetric observations of SN 2018evt obtained by the ESO Very Large Telescope from 172 to 219 d after the estimated time of peak luminosity to study the geometry of the CSM. The non-zero continuum polarization decreases over time, suggesting that the mass-loss of the progenitor star is aspherical. The prominent H $\alpha$ emission can be decomposed into a broad, time-evolving component and an intermediate-width, static component. The former shows polarized signals, and it is likely to arise from a cold dense shell (CDS) within the region between the forward and reverse shocks. The latter is significantly unpolarized, and it is likely to arise from shocked, fragmented gas clouds in the H-rich CSM. We infer that SN 2018evt exploded inside a massive and aspherical circumstellar cloud. The symmetry axes of the CSM and the SN appear to be similar. SN 2018evt shows observational properties common to events that display strong interaction between the ejecta and CSM, implying that they share similar circumstellar configurations. Our preliminary estimate also suggests that the circumstellar environment of SN 2018evt has been significantly enriched at a rate of ∼0.1 M⊙ yr−1 over a period of >100 yr.},

In particular, building upon recent advances in the hydrodynamical simulation of helium-ignited double white dwarf binaries, we demonstrate that the detection of 44Ti in a nearby SN Ia or in a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) can discriminate between the double-detonation and double-degenerate channels of sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh) and near-Chandrasekhar (near-MCh) SNe Ia. In addition, we predict that the late-time light curves of calcium-rich transients are entirely dominated by 44Ti.},

We demonstrate, for the first time, that 91T- and 91bg-like subclasses of SNe Ia are distributed differently toward the plane of their host disc. The average height from the disc and its comparison with scales of thin/thick disc components gives a possibility to roughly estimate the SNe Ia progenitor ages: 91T-like events, being at the smallest heights, originate from relatively younger progenitors with ages of about several 100 Myr, 91bg-like SNe, having the highest distribution, arise from progenitors with significantly older ages ∼10 Gyr, and normal SNe Ia, which distributed between those of the two others, are from progenitors of about one up to ∼10 Gyr. We find a correlation between LC decline rates and SN Ia heights, which is explained by the vertical age gradient of the stellar population in discs and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf explosion models, where the $\Delta$m15 parameter is a progenitor age indicator.},

abstract = {We present 2603 spectra of 462 nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), including 2065 previously unpublished spectra, obtained during 1993-2008 through the Center for Astrophysics Supernova Program. There are on average eight spectra for each of the 313 SNe Ia with at least two spectra. Most of the spectra were obtained with the FAST spectrograph at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory 1.5 m telescope and reduced in a consistent manner, making this data set well suited for studies of SN Ia spectroscopic diversity. Using additional data from the literature, we study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia as a function of spectroscopic class using the classification schemes of Branch et al. and Wang et al. The width-luminosity relation appears to be steeper for SNe Ia with broader lines, although the result is not statistically significant with the present sample. Based on the evolution of the characteristic Si ii $\lambda$6355 line, we propose improved methods for measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previously suspected, from ∼0 to ∼400 km s −1 day −1 considering the instantaneous velocity decline rate at maximum light. We find a weaker and less significant correlation between Si ii velocity and intrinsic B − V color at maximum light than reported by Foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment of uncertainties and host galaxy dust. We study the extent of nuclear burning and the presence of unburnt carbon in the outermost layers of the ejecta and report new detections of C ii $\lambda$6580 in 23 early-time SN Ia spectra. The frequency of C ii detections is not higher in SNe Ia with bluer colors or narrower light curves, in conflict with the recent results of Thomas et al. Based on nebular spectra of 27 SNe Ia, we find no relation between the FWHM of the iron emission feature at ∼4700 {\AA} and $\Delta$m 15 (B) after removing the two low-luminosity SN 1986G and SN 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent on the kinetic energy of the explosion for most SNe Ia. Finally, we confirm the correlation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic B − V color of SNe Ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possible non-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts.},

abstract = {The high metal content and fast expansion of supernova (SN) Ia ejecta lead to considerable line overlap in their optical spectra. Uncertainties in composition and ionization further complicate the process of line identification. In this paper, we focus on the 5900 {\AA} emission feature seen in SN Ia spectra after bolometric maximum, a line which in the last two decades has been associated with [Co III] 5888 {\AA} or Na I D. Using non-LTE time-dependent radiative-transfer calculations based on Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation models, we find that Na I D line emission is extremely weak at all post-maximum epochs. Instead, we predict the presence of [Co III] 5888 {\AA} after maximum in all our SN Ia models, which cover a range from 0.12 to 0.87 M of 56 Ni. We also find that the [Co III] 5888 {\AA} forbidden line is present within days of bolometric maximum, and strengthens steadily for weeks thereafter. Both predictions are confirmed by observations. Rather than trivial taxonomy, these findings confirm that it is necessary to include forbidden-line transitions in radiative-transfer simulations of SNe Ia, both to obtain the correct ejecta cooling rate and to match observed optical spectra.},

abstract = {Observations of SN 2011fe at early times reveal an evolution analogous to a fireball model of constant colour. In contrast, our unmixed delayed detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (DDC series) exhibit a faster brightening concomitant with a shift in colour to the blue. In this paper, we study the origin of these discrepancies. We find that strong chemical mixing largely resolves the photometric mismatch at early times, but it leads to an enhanced line broadening that contrasts, for example, with the markedly narrow Si II 6355 {\AA} line of SN 2011fe. We also explore an alternative configuration with pulsational-delayed detonations (PDDEL model series). Because of the pulsation, PDDEL models retain more unburnt carbon, have little mass at high velocity, and have a much hotter outer ejecta after the explosion. The pulsation does not influence the inner ejecta, so PDDEL and DDC models exhibit similar radiative properties beyond maximum. However, at early times, PDDEL models show bluer optical colours and a higher luminosity, even for weak mixing. Their early-time radiation is derived primarily from the initial shock-deposited energy in the outer ejecta rather than radioactive-decay heating. Furthermore, PDDEL models show short-lived C II lines, reminiscent of SN 2013dy. They typically exhibit lines that are weaker, narrower, and of near-constant width, reminiscent of SN 2011fe. In addition to multidimensional effects, varying configurations for such 'pulsations' offer a source of spectral diversity amongst Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). PDDEL and DDC models also provide one explanation for low-and high-velocity-gradient SNe Ia.},

These observations follow earlier JWST observations of SN 2021aefx at +255 days after the time of maximum brightness, allowing us to probe the temporal evolution of the emission properties. We measure the fraction of flux emerging at different wavelengths and its temporal evolution. Additionally, the integrated 0.3 − 14 µm decay rate of ∆m 0.3−14 = 1.35 ± 0.05 mag/100 days is higher than the decline rate from the radioactive decay of 56 Co of ∼ 1.2 mag/100 days. The most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that flux is shifting to > 14 µm, and future JWST observations of SNe Ia will be able to directly test this hypothesis. However, models predicting non-radiative energy loss cannot be excluded with the present data. 2 Mayker Chen et al.},

abstract = {We present a JWST/MIRI low-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic observation of the normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2021aefx at +323 days past rest-frame B-band maximum light. The spectrum ranges from 4-14 um, and shows many unique qualities including a flat-topped [Ar III] 8.991 um profile, a strongly tilted [Co III] 11.888 um feature, and multiple stable Ni lines. These features provide critical information about the physics of the explosion. The observations are compared to synthetic spectra from detailed NLTE multi-dimensional models. The results of the best-fitting model are used to identify the components of the spectral blends and provide a quantitative comparison to the explosion physics. Emission line profiles and the presence of electron capture (EC) elements are used to constrain the mass of the exploding white dwarf (WD) and the chemical asymmetries in the ejecta. We show that the observations of SN 2021aefx are consistent with an off-center delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass (Mch) WD at a viewing angle of -30 degrees relative to the point of the deflagration-to-detonation transition. From the strength of the stable Ni lines we determine that there is little to no mixing in the central regions of the ejecta. Based on both the presence of stable Ni and the Ar velocity distributions, we obtain a strict lower limit of 1.2 Msun of the initial WD, implying that most sub-Mch explosions models are not viable models for SN 2021aefx. The analysis here shows the crucial importance of MIR spectra for distinguishing between explosion scenarios for SNe Ia.},

In this paper, we discuss how the detection of 44Ti, either through late-time light curves of SNe Ia, or directly via gamma-rays, can uniquely constrain the origin of SNe Ia. In particular, building upon recent advances in the hydrodynamical simulation of helium-ignited double white dwarf binaries, we demonstrate that the detection of 44Ti in a nearby SN Ia or in a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) can discriminate between the double-detonation and double-degenerate channels of sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh) and near-Chandrasekhar (near-MCh) SNe Ia.

abstract = {As one of the most useful cosmological distance indicators, type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play an important role in the study of cosmology. However, the progenitors of SNe Ia are still uncertain. It has been suggested that carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) + He subgiant systems could produce SNe Ia through the double-degenerate (DD) model, in which the He subgiant transfers He-rich matter to the primary CO WD and finally evolves to another CO WD. Recently, a CO WD + He star system (i.e., HD 265435) is discovered to be a new SNe Ia progenitor candidate based on the DD model. The orbital period of the system is about 0.0688 days, and the masses of the CO WD and the He star are 1.01^{+0.15}_{-0.15} Msun and 0.63^{+0.13}_{-0.12} Msun, respectively. In this work, we evolve a large number of primordial binaries to the formation of CO WD + He star systems and investigate the evolutionary history of HD 265435. We find that HD 265435 may originate from a primordial binary that has a 5.18 Msun primary and a 3.66 Msun secondary with an initial orbital period of 5200 days. The CO WD + He star system would be formed after the primordial binary experiences two common-envelope ejection processes. We also find that HD 265435 would evolve to a double WD system with a total mass of 1.58 Msun after a stable mass-transfer process, and the double WD system would merge driven by gravitational wave radiation. We estimate that it would take about 76 Myr for HD 265435 to form an SN Ia. In addition, HD 265435 would be a potential target of space-based gravitational wave observatories (e.g., LISA, Taiji and TianQin).},

abstract = {Cosmological analyses of samples of photometrically-identified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) depend on understanding the effects of ‘contamination' from core-collapse and peculiar SN Ia events. We employ a rigorous analysis using the photometric classifier SuperNNova on state-of-the-art simulations of SN samples to determine cosmological biases due to such ‘non-Ia' contamination in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year SN sample. Depending on the non-Ia SN models used in the SuperNNova training and testing samples, contamination ranges from 0.8–3.5 per cent, with a classification efficiency of 97.7–99.5 per cent. Using the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) framework and its extension BBC (‘BEAMS with Bias Correction'), we produce a redshift-binned Hubble diagram marginalised over contamination and corrected for selection effects, and use it to constrain the dark energy equation-of-state, w. Assuming a flat universe with Gaussian $\Omega$M prior of 0.311 ± 0.010, we show that biases on w are <0.008 when using SuperNNova, with systematic uncertainties associated with contamination around 10 per cent of the statistical uncertainty on w for the DES-SN sample. An alternative approach of discarding contaminants using outlier rejection techniques (e.g., Chauvenet's criterion) in place of SuperNNova leads to biases on w that are larger but still modest (0.015–0.03). Finally, we measure biases due to contamination on w0 and wa (assuming a flat universe), and find these to be <0.009 in w0 and <0.108 in wa, 5 to 10 times smaller than the statistical uncertainties for the DES-SN sample.},

abstract = {We present ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) observations and analysis of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2021fxy. Our observations include UV photometry from Swift/UVOT, UV spectroscopy from HST/STIS, and high-cadence optical photometry with the Swope 1-m telescope capturing intra-night rises during the early light curve. Early $B-V$ colours show SN 2021fxy is the first "shallow-silicon" (SS) SN Ia to follow a red-to-blue evolution, compared to other SS objects which show blue colours from the earliest observations. Comparisons to other spectroscopically normal SNe Ia with HST UV spectra reveal SN 2021fxy is one of several SNe Ia with flux suppression in the mid-UV. These SNe also show blue-shifted mid-UV spectral features and strong high-velocity Ca II features. One possible origin of this mid-UV suppression is the increased effective opacity in the UV due to increased line blanketing from high velocity material, but differences in the explosion mechanism cannot be ruled out. Among SNe Ia with mid-UV suppression, SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp show substantial similarities in their optical properties despite belonging to different Branch subgroups, and UV flux differences of the same order as those found between SNe 2011fe and 2011by. Differential comparisons to multiple sets of synthetic SN Ia UV spectra reveal this UV flux difference likely originates from a luminosity difference between SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp, and not differing progenitor metallicities as suggested for SNe 2011by and 2011fe. These comparisons illustrate the complicated nature of UV spectral formation, and the need for more UV spectra to determine the physical source of SNe Ia UV diversity.},

The average height from the disc and its comparison with scales of thin/thick disc components gives a possibility to roughly estimate the SNe Ia progenitor ages: 91T-like events, being at the smallest heights, originate from relatively younger progenitors with ages of about several 100 Myr, 91bg-like SNe, having the highest distribution, arise from progenitors with significantly older ages ∼10 Gyr, and normal SNe Ia, which distributed between those of the two others, are from progenitors of about one up to ∼10 Gyr.

We present an improved model framework, SALT3, which has several advantages over current models—including the leading SALT2 model (SALT2.4). While SALT3 has a similar philosophy, it differs from SALT2 by having improved estimation of uncertainties, better separation of color and light-curve stretch, and a publicly available training code. We present the application of our training method on a cross-calibrated compilation of 1083 SNe with 1207 spectra. Our compilation is 2.5× larger than the SALT2 training sample and has greatly reduced calibration uncertainties. The resulting trained SALT3.K21 model has an extended wavelength range 2000–11,000 {\AA} (1800 {\AA} redder) and reduced uncertainties compared to SALT2, enabling accurate use of low- z I and iz photometric bands. Including these previously discarded bands, SALT3.K21 reduces the Hubble scatter of the low- z Foundation and CfA3 samples by 15% and 10%, respectively. To check for potential systematic uncertainties, we compare distances of low (0.01 < z < 0.2) and high (0.4 < z < 0.6) redshift SNe in the training compilation, finding an insignificant 3 ± 14 mmag shift between SALT2.4 and SALT3.K21. While the SALT3.K21 model was trained on optical data, our method can be used to build a model for rest-frame NIR samples from the Roman Space Telescope. Our open-source training code, public training data, model, and documentation are available at https://saltshaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ , and the model is integrated into the sncosmo and SNANA software packages. },

FLAMINGOS-2 is also compatible with the Gemini Multi- Conjugate Adaptive Optics system, providing multi-object  spectroscopic capabilities over a 3x1-arcminute field with high spatial resolution (0.09-arcsec/pixel). We review the designs of optical, mechanical, electronics, software, and On-Instrument WaveFront Sensor subsystems. We also present the current status of the project and future plans, including on-sky delivery planned for late 2008.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the diversity of V-band light-curves of hydrogen-rich type II supernovae. Analyzing a sample of 116 supernovae, several magnitude measurements are defined, together with decline rates at different epochs, and time durations of different phases. It is found that magnitudes measured at maximum light correlate more strongly with decline rates than those measured at other epochs: brighter supernovae at maximum generally have faster declining light-curves at all epochs. We find a relation between the decline rate during the "plateau" phase and peak magnitudes, which has a dispersion of 0.56 mag, offering the prospect of using type II supernovae as purely photometric distance indicators. Our analysis suggests that the type II population spans a continuum from low-luminosity events which have flat light-curves during the "plateau" stage, through to the brightest events which decline much faster. A large range in optically thick phase durations is observed, implying a range in progenitor envelope masses at the epoch of explosion. During the radioactive tails, we find many supernovae with faster declining light-curves than expected from full trapping of radioactive emission, implying low mass ejecta. It is suggested that the main driver of light-curve diversity is the extent of hydrogen envelopes retained before explosion. Finally, a new classification scheme is introduced where hydrogen-rich events are typed as simply "SN II" with an "s 2" value giving the decline rate during the "plateau" phase, indicating its morphological type. {\textcopyright} 2014.

Our observations include UV photometry from Swift/UVOT, UV spectroscopy from HST/STIS, and high-cadence optical photometry with the Swope 1-m telescope capturing intra-night rises during the early light curve. Early {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°µ −{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± colours show SN 2021fxy is the first "shallow-silicon" (SS) SN Ia to follow a red-to-blue evolution, compared to other SS objects which show blue colours from the earliest observations. Comparisons to other spectroscopically normal SNe Ia with HST UV spectra reveal SN 2021fxy is one of several SNe Ia with flux suppression in the mid-UV. These SNe also show blue-shifted mid-UV spectral features and strong high-velocity Ca features. One possible origin of this mid-UV suppression is the increased effective opacity in the UV due to increased line blanketing from high velocity material, but differences in the explosion mechanism cannot be ruled out. Among SNe Ia with mid-UV suppression, SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp show substantial similarities in their optical properties despite belonging to different Branch subgroups, and UV flux differences of the same order as those found between SNe 2011fe and 2011by. Differential comparisons to multiple sets of synthetic SN Ia UV spectra reveal this UV flux difference likely originates from a luminosity difference between SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp, and not differing progenitor metallicities as suggested for SNe 2011by and 2011fe. These comparisons illustrate the complicated nature of UV spectral formation, and the need for more UV spectra to determine the physical source of SNe Ia UV diversity.},

abstract = {Late-time near-infrared and optical spectra are presented for the normal-bright SN2003du. At about 300 days after the explosion, the emission profiles of well isolated [FeII] lines (in particular that of the strong 1.644mu feature) trace out the global kinematic distribution of radioactive material in the expanding. In SN2003du, the 1.644 mu [FeII] line shows a flat-topped, profile, indicative of a thick but hollow-centered expanding shell, rather than a strongly-peaked profile that would be expected from a ``center-filled'' distribution.Based on detailed models for exploding Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, we show that the feature is consistent with spherical explosion models.Our model predicts central region of non-radioactive electron-capture elements up to 2500--3000km/s as a consequence of burning under high density, and an extended region of 56Ni up to 9,000--10,000km/s. Furthermore our analysis indicates that the 1.644mu [FeII] profile is not consistent with strong mixing between the regions of electron- capture isotopes and the 56Ni layers as is predicted by detailed 3D models for nuclear deflagration fronts. We discuss the possibility that the flat-topped profile could be produced as a result of an infrared catastrophe and conclude that such an explanation is unlikely. We put our results in context to other SNeIa and briefly discuss the implications of our result for the use of SNe Ia as cosmological standard candles.},

abstract = {Recent observational and theoretical progress has favored merging and helium-accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs) in the double-degenerate and the double-detonation channels, respectively, as the most promising progenitors of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Thus the fate of rapidly accreting Chandrasekhar mass WDs in the single-degenerate channel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature of ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically deriving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a transition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this criterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection and ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events within Chandrasekhar-mass WDs in the single-degenerate channel are buoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase. We thus infer that single-degenerate SNe Ia are generally expected to lead to overluminous 1991T-like SNe Ia events. We establish that the rates predicted from both the population of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) and binary population synthesis models of the single-degenerate channel are broadly consistent with the observed rates of overluminous SNe Ia, and suggest that the population of SSSs are the dominant stellar progenitors of SNe 1991T-like events. We further demonstrate that the single-degenerate channel contribution to the normal and failed 2002cx-like rates is not likely to exceed 1% of the total SNe Ia rate. We conclude with a range of observational tests of overluminous SNe Ia which will either support or strongly constrain the single-degenerate scenario.},

abstract = {Binary Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs accreting mass from non-degenerate stellar companions through the single-degenerate channel have reigned for decades as the leading explanation of Type Ia supernovae. Yet, a comprehensive theoretical explanation has not yet emerged to explain the expected properties of the canonical near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf model. A simmering phase within the convective core of the white dwarf leads to the ignition of one or more flame bubbles scattered across the core. Consequently, near-Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia are inherently stochastic, and are expected to lead to a range of outcomes, from subluminous SN 2002cx-like events, to overluminous SN 1991T-like events. However, all prior simulations of the single-degenerate channel carried through the detonation phase have set the ignition points as free parameters. In this work, for the first time, we place ignition points as predicted by {\it ab initio} models of the convective phase leading up to ignition, and follow through the detonation phase in fully three-dimensional simulations. Single-degenerates in this framework are characteristically overluminous. Using a statistical approach, we determine the $^{56}$Ni mass distribution arising from stochastic ignition. While there is a total spread of $\gtrsim 0.2 M_{\odot}$ for detonating models, the distribution is strongly left-skewed, and with a narrow standard deviation of $\simeq 0.03 M_{\odot}$. Conversely, if single-degenerates are not overluminous but primarily yield normal or failed events, then the models require fine-tuning of the ignition parameters, or otherwise require revised physics or progenitor models. We discuss implications of our findings for the modeling of single-degenerate SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Shifting the focus of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology to the near infrared (NIR) is a promising way to significantly reduce the systematic errors, as the strategy minimizes our reliance on the empirical width-luminosity relation and uncertain dust laws. Observations in the NIR are also crucial for our understanding of the origins and evolution of these events, further improving their cosmological utility. Any future experiments in the rest-frame NIR will require knowledge of the SN Ia NIR spectroscopic diversity, which is currently based on a small sample of observed spectra. Along with the accompanying paper, Phillips et al., we introduce the Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), to follow-up nearby SNe Ia in both the optical and the NIR. In particular, this paper focuses on the CSP-II NIR spectroscopy program, describing the survey strategy, instrumental setups, data reduction, sample characteristics, and future analyses on the data set. In collaboration with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Supernova Group, we obtained 661 NIR spectra of 157 SNe Ia. Within this sample, 451 NIR spectra of 90 SNe Ia have corresponding CSP-II follow-up light curves. Such a sample will allow detailed studies of the NIR spectroscopic properties of SNe Ia, providing a different perspective on the properties of the unburned material; the radioactive and stable nickel produced; progenitor magnetic fields; and searches for possible signatures of companion stars.},

abstract = {Technology has advanced to the point that it is possible to image the entire sky every night and process the data in real time. The sky is hardly static: many interesting phenomena occur, including variable stationary objects such as stars or QSOs, transient stationary objects such as supernovae or M dwarf flares, and moving objects such as asteroids and the stars themselves. Funded by NASA, we have designed and built a sky survey system for the purpose of finding dangerous near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This system, the “Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System” (ATLAS), has been optimized to produce the best survey capability per unit cost, and therefore is an efficient and competitive system for finding potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) but also for tracking variables and finding transients. While carrying out its NASA mission, ATLAS now discovers more bright (m<19) supernovae candidates than any ground based survey, frequently detecting very young explosions due to its 2 day cadence. ATLAS discovered the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst independent of the high energy trigger and has released a variable star catalog of 5×106 sources. This is the first of a series of articles describing ATLAS, devoted to the design and performance of the ATLAS system. Subsequent articles will describe in more detail the software, the survey strategy, ATLAS-derived NEA population statistics, transient detections, and the first data release of variable stars and transient light curves.},

abstract = {Stars that explode as supernovae come in two main classes. A type Ia supernova is recognized by the absence of hydrogen and the presence of elements such as silicon and sulphur in its spectrum; this class of supernova is thought to produce the majority of iron-peak elements in the Universe. They are also used as precise 'standard candles' to measure the distances to galaxies. While there is general agreement that a type Ia supernova is produced by an exploding white dwarf star, no progenitor system has ever been directly observed. Significant effort has gone into searching for circumstellar material to help discriminate between the possible kinds of progenitor systems, but no such material has hitherto been found associated with a type Ia supernova. Here we report the presence of strong hydrogen emission associated with the type Ia supernova SN2002ic, indicating the presence of large amounts of circumstellar material. We infer from this that the progenitor system contained a massive asymptotic-giant-branch star that lost several solar masses of hydrogen-rich gas before the supernova explosion.},

abstract = {Owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are perhaps the best-studied class of SNe, yet the progenitor systems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. A rare subclass of SNe Ia shows evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and in particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the first systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and here we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been well studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in depth for the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by H$\alpha$ emission (with widths of ∼2000 km s-1) and exhibit large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost complete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of H$\alpha$ 75-100 days past maximum brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) of SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 mag ≤ M R ≤ -19 mag, and they also seem to show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf irregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects come from a relatively young stellar population. This work represents the most detailed analysis of the SN Ia-CSM class to date. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

To this end, LCOGT is constructing a world-wide network of telescopes, including the two 2m Faulkes telescopes, as many as 17 x 1m telescopes, and as many as 23 x 40cm telescopes. These telescopes initially will be outfitted for imaging and (excepting the 40cm telescopes) spectroscopy at wavelengths between the atmospheric UV cutoff and the roughly 1-micron limit of silicon detectors. Since the first of LCOGT's 1m telescopes are now being deployed, we lay out here LCOGT's scientific goals and the requirements that these goals place on network architecture and performance, we summarize the network's present and projected level of development, and we describe our expected schedule for completing it. In the bulk of the paper, we describe in detail the technical approaches that we have adopted to attain the desired performance. In particular, we discuss our choices for the number and location of network sites, for the number and sizes of telescopes, for the specifications of the first generation of instruments, for the software that will schedule and control the network's telescopes and reduce and archive its data, and for the structure of the scientific and educational programs for which the network will provide observations.},

abstract = {Context. The Public European Southern Observatory Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) began as a public spectroscopic survey in April 2012. PESSTO classifies transients from publicly available sources and wide-field surveys, and selects science targets for detailed spectroscopic and photometric follow-up. PESSTO runs for nine months of the year, January - April and August - December inclusive, and typically has allocations of 10 nights per month. Aims. We describe the data reduction strategy and data products that are publicly available through the ESO archive as the Spectroscopic Survey data release 1 (SSDR1). Methods. PESSTO uses the New Technology Telescope with the instruments EFOSC2 and SOFI to provide optical and NIR spectroscopy and imaging. We target supernovae and optical transients brighter than 20.5m for classification. Science targets are selected for follow-up based on the PESSTO science goal of extending knowledge of the extremes of the supernova population. We use standard EFOSC2 set-ups providing spectra with resolutions of 13-18 {\AA} between 3345-9995 {\AA}. A subset of the brighter science targets are selected for SOFI spectroscopy with the blue and red grisms (0.935-2.53 $\mu$m and resolutions 23-33 {\AA}) and imaging with broadband JHKs filters. Results. This first data release (SSDR1) contains flux calibrated spectra from the first year (April 2012-2013). A total of 221 confirmed supernovae were classified, and we released calibrated optical spectra and classifications publicly within 24 h of the data being taken (via WISeREP). The data in SSDR1 replace those released spectra. They have more reliable and quantifiable flux calibrations, correction for telluric absorption, and are made available in standard ESO Phase 3 formats. We estimate the absolute accuracy of the flux calibrations for EFOSC2 across the whole survey in SSDR1 to be typically ∼15%, although a number of spectra will have less reliable absolute flux calibration because of weather and slit losses. Acquisition images for each spectrum are available which, in principle, can allow the user to refine the absolute flux calibration. The standard NIR reduction process does not produce high accuracy absolute spectrophotometry but synthetic photometry with accompanying JHKs imaging can improve this. Whenever possible, reduced SOFI images are provided to allow this. Conclusions. Future data releases will focus on improving the automated flux calibration of the data products. The rapid turnaround between discovery and classification and access to reliable pipeline processed data products has allowed early science papers in the first few months of the survey.},

abstract = {The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) is designed to measure the luminosity distance for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a function of redshift, and to set observational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energy content of the universe. The CSP differs from other projects to date in its goal of providing an I-band rest-frame Hubble diagram. Here, we present the first results from near-infrared observations obtained using the Magellan Baade telescope for SNe Ia with 0.1 <z < 0.7. We combine these results with those from the low-redshift CSP at z < 0.1. In this paper, we describe the overall goals of this long-term program, the observing strategy, data reduction procedures, and treatment of systematic uncertainties. We present light curves and an I-band Hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 SNe Ia, and we compare these data to 21 new SNe Ia at low redshift. These data support the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. When combined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations, these data yield $\Omega$m = 0.27 0.02(statistical) and $\Omega$DE = 0.76 0.13(statistical) 0.09(systematic), for the matter and dark energy densities, respectively. If we parameterize the data in terms of an equation of state, w (with no time dependence), assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryon acoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 ± 0.13(statistical) 0.09(systematic). The largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises from uncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance of securing more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmology programs. Finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminosities of SNe Ia has a different extinction law (RV = 1.8) than that in the Milky Way (where RV = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term with luminosity for SNe Ia, independent of the decline rate. Understanding and disentangling these effects is critical for minimizing the systematic uncertainties in future SN Ia cosmology studies. {\textcopyright} 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

Calibrator peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances are used to estimate the average absolute magnitude in each band, while Hubble-flow SNe are used to constrain the zero-point intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our baseline result of $H_0$ is $72.3\pm1.4$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $J$ band and $72.3\pm1.3$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $H$ band, where the systematic uncertainties include the standard deviation of up to 21 variations of the analysis, the 0.7\% distance scale systematic from SHOES Cepheid anchors, a photometric zeropoint systematic, and a cosmic variance systematic. Our final measurement represents a measurement with a precision of 2.8\% in both bands. The variant with the largest change in $H_0$ is when limiting the sample to SNe from CSP and CfA programmes, noteworthy because these are the best calibrated, yielding $H_0\sim75$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in both bands. We demonstrate stretch and reddening corrections are still useful in the NIR to standardize SN Ia NIR peak magnitudes. Based on our results, in order to improve the precision of the $H_0$ measurement with SNe Ia in the NIR in the future, we would need to increase the number of calibrator SNe Ia, be able to extend the Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram to higher-z, and include standardization procedures to help reducing the NIR intrinsic scatter.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe more than two decades ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical. However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in J and/or H band, plus good gr-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in the J (Jmax) and H (Hmax) bands. The use of a single NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of 0.05 mag for epochs around the time of B-band peak magnitude (Tmax). We also tested the effect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of Tmax and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained the introduced scatter of each to ≮0.02 mag in Jmax and ≮0.01 in Hmax. However, these effects are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe (z2; 0.1). The effect of S/N in the NIR was tested as well. For SNe Ia at 0.08≮z2;0.1, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a minimum (2;0.05 mag). These results provide confidence for our FLOWS project that is aimed at using SNe Ia with public ZTF optical light curves and few NIR epochs to map out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will allow us to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own supercluster, Laniakea, and to test the standard cosmological model by measuring the growth rate of structures, parameterised by fD, and the Hubble-Lemaitre constant, H0.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the Hubble diagram for 12 normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed in the near-infrared (NIR) J and H bands. We select SNe exclusively from the redshift range 0.03 < z < 0.09 to reduce uncertainties coming from peculiar velocities while remaining in a cosmologically well-understood region. All of the SNe in our sample exhibit no spectral or B-band light-curve peculiarities and lie in the B-band stretch range of 0.8-1.15. Our results suggest that SNe Ia observed in the NIR are the best known standard candles. We fit previously determined NIR light-curve templates to new high-precision data to derive peak magnitudes and to determine the scatter about the Hubble line. Photometry of the 12 SNe is presented in the natural system. Using a standard cosmology of (H0, $\Omega$m, $\Omega$$\Lambda$) = (70, 0.27, 0.73), we find a median J-band absolute magnitude of MJ = -18.39 with a scatter of $\sigma$J = 0.116 and a median H-band absolute magnitude of MH = -18.36 with a scatter of $\sigma$H = 0.085. The scatter in the H band is the smallest yet measured. We search for correlations between residuals in the J- and H-band Hubble diagrams and SN properties, such as SN colour, B-band stretch and the projected distance from the centre of the host galaxy. The only significant correlation is between the J-band Hubble residual and the J - H pseudo-colour. We also examine how the scatter changes when fewer points in the NIR are used to constrain the light curve. With a single point in the H band taken anywhere from 10d before to 15d after B-band maximum light and a prior on the date of H-band maximum set from the date of B-band maximum, we find that we can measure distances to an accuracy of 6 per cent. The precision of SNe Ia in the NIR provides new opportunities for precision measurements of both the expansion history of the universe and peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We present the largest and most homogeneous collection of near-infrared (NIR) spectra of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia): 339 spectra of 98 individual SNe obtained as part of the Carnegie Supernova Project-II. These spectra, obtained with the FIRE spectrograph on the 6.5 m Magellan Baade telescope, have a spectral range of 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m. Using this sample, we explore the NIR spectral diversity of SNe Ia and construct a template of spectral time series as a function of the light-curve-shape parameter, color stretch sBV. Principal Component Analysis is applied to characterize the diversity of the spectral features and reduce data dimensionality to a smaller subspace. Gaussian process regression is then used to model the subspace dependence on phase and light-curve shape and the associated uncertainty. Our template is able to predict spectral variations that are correlated with sBV , such as the hallmark NIR features: Mg II at early times and the H-band break after peak. Using this template reduces the systematic uncertainties in K-corrections by $\sim$90% compared to those from the Hsiao template (Hsiao 2009). These uncertainties are on the level of 4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ mag on average. We have also explored a neural network approach using a conditional variational autoencoder that produces promising results for characterizing supernova spectra, though requires a larger data set to assemble comparable quality. This template can serve as the baseline spectral energy distribution for light-curve fitters and can identify peculiar spectral features that might point to compelling physics. The results presented here will substantially improve future SN Ia cosmological experiments, for both nearby and distant samples.},

Recent work has shown that low mass helium shell models reproduce observations of normal SNe Ia. We present 3D radiative transfer simulations for a suite of 3D simulations of the double detonation explosion scenario for a range of shell and core masses. We find light curves broadly able to reproduce the faint end of the width-luminosity relation shown by SNe Ia, however, we find that all of our models show extremely red colours, not observed in normal SNe Ia. This includes our lowest mass helium shell model. We find clear Ti absorption features in the model spectra, which would lead to classification as peculiar SNe Ia, as well as line blanketing in some lines of sight by singly ionised Cr and Fe-peak elements. Our radiative transfer simulations show that these explosion models remain promising to explain peculiar SNe Ia. Future full non-LTE simulations may improve the agreement of these explosion models with observations of normal SNe Ia.},

abstract = {The progenitor systems and explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae are still unknown. Currently favoured progenitors include double-degenerate systems consisting of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with thin helium shells. In the double-detonation scenario, violent accretion leads to a helium detonation on the more massive primary white dwarf that turns into a carbon detonation in its core and explodes it. We investigate the fate of the secondary white dwarf, focusing on changes of the ejecta and observables of the explosion if the secondary explodes as well rather than survives. We simulate a binary system of a $1.05\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ and a $0.7\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf with $0.03\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ helium shells each. We follow the system self-consistently from inspiral to ignition, through the explosion, to synthetic observables. We confirm that the primary white dwarf explodes self-consistently. The helium detonation around the secondary white dwarf, however, fails to ignite a carbon detonation. We restart the simulation igniting the carbon detonation in the secondary white dwarf by hand and compare the ejecta and observables of both explosions. We find that the outer ejecta at $v\sim\gt \sim15\, 000$ km s−1 are indistinguishable. Light curves and spectra are very similar until $\sim \sim40 \ \mathrm{d}$ after explosion and the ejecta are much more spherical than violent merger models. The inner ejecta differ significantly slowing down the decline rate of the bolometric light curve after maximum of the model with a secondary explosion by ∼20 per cent. We expect future synthetic 3D nebular spectra to confirm or rule out either model.},

abstract = {We use stacked spectra of the host galaxies of photometrically identified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to search for correlations between Hubble diagram residuals and the spectral properties of the host galaxies. Utilizing full spectrum fitting techniques on stacked spectra binned by Hubble residual, we find no evidence for trends between Hubble residuals and properties of the host galaxies that rely on spectral absorption features (<1.3$\sigma$), such as stellar population age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio. However, we find significant trends between the Hubble residuals and the strengths of [O ii] (4.4$\sigma$) and the Balmer emission lines (3$\sigma$). These trends are weaker than the well-known trend between Hubble residuals and host galaxy stellar mass (7.2$\sigma$) that is derived from broad-band photometry. After light-curve corrections, we see fainter SNe Ia residing in galaxies with larger line strengths. We also find a trend (3$\sigma$) between Hubble residual and the Balmer decrement (a measure of reddening by dust) using H $\beta$ and H $\gamma$. The trend, quantified by correlation coefficients, is slightly more significant in the redder SNe Ia, suggesting that the bluer SNe Ia are relatively unaffected by dust in the interstellar medium of the host and that dust contributes to current Hubble diagram scatter impacting the measurement of cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {The nearby, bright, almost completely unreddened Type Ia supernova 2011fe in M101 provides a unique opportunity to test both the precision and the accuracy of the extragalactic distances derived from SNe Ia light curve fitters. We apply the current, public versions of the independent light curve fitting codes MLCS2k2 and SALT2 to compute the distance modulus of SN 2011fe from high-precision, multi-color (BVRI) light curves. The results from the two fitting codes confirm that 2011fe is a "normal" (not peculiar) and only slightly reddened SN Ia. New unreddened distance moduli are derived as 29.21 +/- 0.07 mag (D $\sim$ 6.95 +/- 0.23$ Mpc, MLCS2k2), and 29.05 +/- 0.07 mag (6.46 +/- 0.21 Mpc, SALT2). Despite the very good fitting quality achieved with both light curve fitters, the resulting distance moduli are inconsistent by 2 sigma. Both are marginally consistent (at \sim1 sigma) with the HST Key Project distance modulus for M101. The SALT2 distance is in good agreement with the recently revised Cepheid- and TRGB-distance to M101. Averaging all SN- and Cepheid-based estimates, the absolute distance to M101 is \sim6.6 +/- 0.5 Mpc.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology, owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship between light-curve shape and peak brightness. The precision distance measurements enabled by SNe Ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe, now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of a mysterious "dark" energy. General consensus holds that Type Ia SNe result from thermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (WD) in a binary system; however, little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physical properties of the progenitor system. Here we make use of extensive historical imaging obtained at the location of SN 2011fe/PTF11kly, the closest SN Ia discovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-light luminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits on other SN Ia progenitors. This directly rules out luminous red giants and the vast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the exploding white dwarf. Any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than 3.5 times the mass of the Sun. These observations favour a scenario where the exploding WD of SN 2011fe/PTF11kly, accreted matter either from another WD, or by Roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.},

abstract = {Aims. We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples (z< 0.1), all three seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 <z< 0.4), and three years from SNLS (0.2 <z< 1), and it totals 740 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high-quality light curves. Methods. We followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS three-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 SNe); 2) intercalibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light curves. Results. We produce recalibrated SN Ia light curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\Omega$m =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8$\sigma$ (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS three-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 ± 0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements gives similar constraints: w =-1.027 ± 0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints to date on the nature of dark energy. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

Our ground-based optical observations show it is likely to be a Type IIb SN, the explosion of a yellow supergiant, and its infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) ≈200 days after explosion shows two distinct components, which we attribute to hot gas and warm dust in the SN ejecta. By fitting models of dust emission to the SED, we derive a lower limit on the dust mass of >2.8 × 10 −3 M , which is the highest yet observed in a Type IIb SN but consistent with other Type II SNe observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. We also find that the radius of the dust is consistent with the radius of the ejecta, as derived from spectroscopic velocities during the photospheric phase, which could imply that the dust formed inside the ejecta. However, we cannot rule out an infrared echo off of pre-existing dust in the progenitor environment. Our results show the power of JWST to address questions of dust formation in SNe, and therefore the presence of dust in the early Universe, with much larger samples than have been previously possible.},

abstract = { The current Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder measurement of H 0 is reported to be in tension with the values inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), assuming standard cosmology. However, some tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) estimates report H 0 in better agreement with the CMB. Hence, it is critical to reduce systematic uncertainties in local measurements to understand the Hubble tension. In this paper, we propose a uniform distance ladder between the second and third rungs, combining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with a TRGB calibration of their absolute luminosity. A large, volume-limited sample of both calibrator and Hubble flow SNe Ia from the same survey minimizes two of the largest sources of systematics: host-galaxy bias and nonuniform photometric calibration. We present results from a pilot study using the existing TRGB distance to the host galaxy of ZTF SN Ia SN 2021rhu (aka ZTF21abiuvdk) in NGC7814. Combining the ZTF calibrator with a volume-limited sample from the first data release of ZTF Hubble flow SNe Ia, we infer H 0 = 76.94 ± 6.4 km s −1 Mpc −1 , an 8.3% measurement. The error budget is dominated by the single object calibrating the SN Ia luminosity in this pilot study. However, the ZTF sample includes already five other SNe Ia within ∼20 Mpc for which TRGB distances can be obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Finally, we present the prospects of building this distance ladder out to 80 Mpc with James Webb Space Telescope observations of more than 100 ZTF SNe Ia. },

abstract = {We present Advanced Camera for Surveys, NICMOS, and Keck adaptive-optics-assisted photometry of 20TypeIa supernovae (SNeIa) from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cluster Supernova Survey. The SNeIa were discovered over the redshift interval 0.623 < z < 1.415. Of these SNeIa, 14 pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world's sample of SNeIa to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. Of our new SNeIa, 10 are beyond redshift z = 1, thereby nearly doubling the statistical weight of HST-discovered SNeIa beyond this redshift. Our detailed analysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between SNIa luminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the NICMOS zero point at the count rates appropriate for very distant SNeIa. Adding these SNe improves the best combined constraint on dark-energy density, $\rho$DE(z), at redshifts 1.0 < z < 1.6 by 18% (including systematic errors). For a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe, we find $\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.729±0.014 (68% confidence level (CL) including systematic errors). For a flat wCDM model, we measure a constant dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.013-0.073+0.068 (68% CL). Curvature is constrained to ∼0.7% in the owCDM model and to ∼2% in a model in which dark energy is allowed to vary with parameters w 0 and wa . Further tightening the constraints on the time evolution of dark energy will require several improvements, including high-quality multi-passband photometry of a sample of several dozen z > 1 SNeIa. We describe how such a sample could be efficiently obtained by targeting cluster fields with WFC3 on board HST.

After correcting for the luminosity vs. decline rate and the luminosity vs. colour relations, the peak <i>B<i/>-band and <i>H<i/>-band light curves provide distances that differ by $\sim$ 14% and $\sim$ 9%, respectively. These findings serve as a cautionary tale for the use of transitional SNe Ia located in early-type hosts in the quest to measure cosmological parameters. Interestingly, even though SN 2011iv is brighter and bluer at early times, by three weeks past maximum and extending over several months, its <i>B<i/> − <i>V<i/> colour is 0.12 mag redder than that of SN 2007on.

abstract = {<p>Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the assumption that the width–luminosity relation (WLR) and the colour–luminosity relation (CLR) in the type Ia SN luminosity standardization would not show absolute magnitude differences with progenitor age. Unlike this expectation, recent age datings of stellar populations in host galaxies have shown significant correlations between progenitor age and Hubble residual (HR). Here, we show that this correlation originates from a strong progenitor age dependence of the zero-points of the WLR and the CLR, in the sense that SNe from younger progenitors are fainter each at given light-curve parameters x1 and c. This 4.6$\sigma$ result is reminiscent of Baade's discovery of the zero-point variation of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation with age, and, as such, causes a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. Other host properties show substantially smaller and insignificant offsets in the WLR and CLR for the same data set. We illustrate that the differences between the high-$z$ and low-$z$ SNe in the WLR and CLR, and in HR after the standardization, are fully comparable to those between the correspondingly young and old SNe at intermediate redshift, indicating that the observed dimming of SNe with redshift may well be an artefact of overcorrection in the luminosity standardization. When this systematic bias with redshift is properly taken into account, there is little evidence left for an accelerating universe, in discordance with other probes, urging the follow-up investigations with larger samples at different redshift bins.</p>},

abstract = {The scaling of the specific Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate with host galaxy stellar mass $\dot{N}_\text{Ia} / M_\star \sim M_\star^{-0.3}$ as measured in ASAS-SN and DES strongly suggests that the number of SNe Ia produced by a stellar population depends inversely on its metallicity. We estimate the strength of the required metallicity dependence by combining the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass with the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies and common parametrizations for the SN Ia delay-time distribution. The differences in SFHs can account for only $\sim$30% of the increase in the specific SN Ia rate between stellar masses of $M_\star = 10^{10}$ and $10^{7.2} M_\odot$. We find that an additional metallicity dependence of approximately $\sim$Z$^{-0.5}$ is required to explain the observed scaling. This scaling matches the metallicity dependence of the close binary fraction observed in APOGEE, suggesting that the enhanced SN Ia rate in low-mass galaxies can be explained by a combination of their more extended SFHs and a higher binary fraction due to their lower metallicities. Due to the shape of the MZR, only galaxies below $M_\star \approx 3\times10^9 M_\odot$ are significantly affected by the metallicity-dependent SN Ia rates. The $\dot{N}_\text{Ia} / M_\star \sim M_\star^{-0.3}$ scaling becomes shallower with increasing redshift, dropping by factor of $\sim$2 at $10^{7.2} M_\odot$ between $z = 0$ and $1$ with our $\sim$$Z^{-0.5}$ scaling. With metallicity-independent rates, this decrease is a factor of $\sim$3. We discuss the implications of metallicity-dependent SN Ia rates for one-zone models of galactic chemical evolution.},

The velocity evolution of SN 2014J places it in the Low Velocity Gradient subclass, whereas the equivalent widths of Si II features near B-band maximum place it at the border of the core normal and Broad Line subclasses of SNe Ia. An analytic model fit to the bolometric light curve indicates that a total of ∼1.3M⊙ was ejected in the explosion, and the ejected 56Ni mass MNi ∼ 0.6M⊙. The low [Fe III] $\lambda$4701 to [Fe II] $\lambda$5200 ratio in the nebular spectra of SN 2014J hints towards clumpiness in the ejecta. Optical broad-band, linear polarimetric observations of SN 2014J obtained on four epochs indicate an almost constant polarization (PR ∼2.7 per cent; $\theta$ ∼ 37°), which suggests that the polarization signal is of interstellar origin.},

abstract = {We accurately determine a new Cepheid distance to M101 (NGC 5457) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys V and I time series photometry of two fields within the galaxy. We make a slight modification to the ISIS image subtraction package to obtain optimal differential light curves from HST data. We discovered 827 Cepheids with periods between 3 and 80 days, the largest extragalactic sample of Cepheids observed with HST by a factor of two. With this large Cepheid sample, we find that the relative distance of M101 from the Large Magellanic Cloud is $\Delta$$\mu$ LMC = 10.63 ± 0.04 (random) ± 0.06 (systematic) mag. If we use the geometrically determined maser distance to NGC 4258 as our distance anchor, the distance modulus of M101 is $\mu$ 0 = 29.04 ± 0.05 (random) ± 0.18 (systematic) mag or D = 6.4 ± 0.2 (random) ± 0.5 (systematic) Mpc. The uncertainty is dominated by the maser distance estimate (±0.15 mag), which should improve over the next few years. We determine a steep metallicity dependence, $\gamma$ , for our Cepheid sample through two methods, yielding $\gamma$ = −0.80 ± 0.21 (random) ± 0.06 (systematic) mag dex −1 and $\gamma$ = −0.72 +0.22 −0.25 (random) ± 0.06 (systematic) mag dex −1. We see marginal evidence for variations in the Wesenheit period-luminosity relation slope as a function of deprojected galactocentric radius. We also use the tip of the red giant branch method to independently determine the distance modulus to M101 of $\mu$ 0 = 29.05 ± 0.06 (random) ± 0.12 (systematic) mag.},

abstract = {Daniel Stern 30 [affiliations can be found after the references] Type Ia supernovae are thought to be carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that explode after accreting material from a companion star, but despite extensive studies the nature of the companion star is still poorly understood, as is the explosion mechanism. In the single degenerate scenario, the companion is a non-degenerate star that loses material through winds and/or binary interaction, and a few Type Ia supernovae have shown evidence for hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. We present here the study of SN 2020eyj, a unique Type Ia supernova showing delayed interaction with helium-rich, but hydrogen-poor, circumstellar material. This material surrounding SN 2020eyj is revealed by its unusual light curve and infrared emission, narrow helium emission lines and, for the first time ever in a Type Ia supernova, also a radio counterpart. The circumstellar material likely originates from the companion star, providing the first direct evidence for a, so far hypothesized, single degenerate progenitor system composed of a white dwarf and a helium donor star. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are attributed to thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf (WD) stars destabilized by mass accretion from a companion star 1. Despite the important application of SNe Ia as standardizable candles for cosmology 2, 3 , there remains considerable uncertainty about the nature of their progenitors, in particular if the binary companions are themselves degenerate WD stars or non-degenerate main sequence or red giant stars. A way to discern between the "double-degenerate" channel (DD; the result of the merger of two WDs), and the "single-degenerate" channel (SD; the WD accretes matter from a non-degenerate companion star), is through characterizing the circumstellar environment. The environment around evolved WDs in the merger scenario is expected to be clean, whereas in the accretion scenario, material originating from the non-degenerate 1},

abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) time-series spectroscopy, as well as complementary ultraviolet (UV), optical, and NIR data, of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) iPTF13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated time of explosion. The first NIR spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosion and may be the earliest NIR spectrum yet obtained of a SN Ia. The most striking features in the spectrum are several NIR C i lines, and the C i$\lambda$1.0693 $\mu$m line is the strongest ever observed in a SN Ia. Interestingly, no strong optical C ii counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopic time series began early and is densely cadenced. Except at the very early epochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strong NIR C i compared to the weaker optical C ii appears to be general in SNe Ia. iPTF13ebh is a fast decliner with $\Delta$m<inf>15</inf>(B) = 1.79 ± 0.01, and its absolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. It is therefore categorized as a "transitional" event, on the fast-declining end of normal SNe Ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iPTF13ebh shows NIR spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal and subluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the two classes. These NIR observations suggest that composition and density of the inner core are similar to that of 91bg-like events, and that it has a deep-reaching carbon burning layer that is not observed in more slowly declining SNe Ia. There is also a substantial difference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curve and the velocity evolution of the Si ii$\lambda$0.6355 $\mu$m line, implying a long dark phase of ∼4 days.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectra of the subluminous Type Ia SN1999by are presented which cover the time evolution from about 4 days before to 2 weeks after maximum. Analysis of these data was accomplished through the construction of an extended set of delayed detonation (DD) models. The explosion, light curves and spectra including their evolution with time are calculated consistently leaving the initial WD and the description of the nuclear burning front the free parameters. We cover the entire range of normal to subluminous SNeIa. From this model set, one was selected for SN99by by matching properties of the synthetic & observed optical light curves. We find DD models require a certain amount of burning during the deflagration phase setting a lower limit for the absolute brightness. For SN1999by, a model close to the minimum 56Ni production is required. Without tuning,good agreement has been found between synthetic and observed IR spectra. In contrast to 'normal' SNeIa and prior to maximum, the NIR spectra of SN1999by are dominated by products of explosive carbon burning. Spectra taken after maximum are dominated by products of incomplete Si burning. Pure deflagration scenarios or mergers are unlikely. However,problems for DD models still remain, as the data seem to be at odds with recent predictions from 3-D models which find significant mixing of the inner layers. Possible solutions include the effects of rapid rotation on the propagation of nuclear flames, or extensive burning of carbon just prior to the runaway.},

We also fit its late-time bolometric light curve and infer that it initially produced a 56 Ni mass of 5.7 +7.0 −3.0 × 10 −3 M. Using imaging from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope obtained 19 years before explosion, we aligned to a post-explosion Wide Field Camera 3 image and demonstrate that there is no detected counterpart to the SN to a limit of >24.53 mag in F814W, corresponding to an absolute magnitude limit of M F814W < −7.7 mag. Comparing to massive-star evolutionary tracks, we determine that the progenitor star had a maximum zero-age main sequence mass <17.5 M , consistent with other SN II-P progenitor stars. SN 2019mhm can be added to the growing population of SNe II-P with both direct constraints on the brightness of their progenitor stars and well-observed SN properties.},

In this paper we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations in the environment of the nearby FBOT AT2018cow based on ALMA, VLT/MUSE and HST/WFC3 observations. A prominent molecular concentration of 6 (± 1) × 10 6 {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± is found in the vicinity of AT2018cow, which has given rise to two active star-forming complexes with ages of 4 ± 1 Myr and 2.5 Myr, respectively.

AT2018cow is spatially coincident with one of the star-forming complexes; however, it is most likely to reside in its foreground since it has a much smaller extinction than the complex. Its progenitor could have been formed at an earlier epoch in this area; if it were from a major star-forming event, the non-detection of the associated stellar population constrains the progenitor's age to be 10 Myr and initial mass to be 20 {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±. We further find the late-time brightness of AT2018cow is unlikely to be a stellar object. Its brightness has slightly declined from 2 yr to 4 yr after explosion and is most likely to originate from AT2018cow itself due to some powering mechanism still working at such late times.},

abstract = {We use the {\it Gaia} EDR3 to explore the Galactic supernova remnant SNR G272.2-3.2, produced by the explosion of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), about 7,500 years ago, to search for a surviving companion. From the abundances in the SNR ejecta, G272.2-3.2 is a normal SNIa. The {\it Gaia} parallaxes allow to select the stars located within the estimated distance range of the SNR, and the {\it Gaia} proper motions to study their kinematics. From the {\it Gaia} EDR3 photometry, we construct the HR diagram of the selected sample, which we compare with the theoretical predictions for the evolution of possible star companions of SNIa. We can discard several proposed types of companions by combining kinematics and photometry. We focus our study on the kinematically most peculiar star, {\it Gaia} EDR3 5323900215411075328 (hereafter MV-G272), is a very clear outlier in the motion along the Galactic plane, both as compared with the sample and with the Besan\c{c}on model of the Galaxy. Its trajectory on the sky locates it at the center of the SNR, 6,000--8,000 years ago, which constitutes a unique characteristic among the 3,082 stars in the sample. Spectra have been obtained allowing a stellar parameters determination and a chemical abundance analysis. The star now appears as an M1-M2 dwarf. Its chemistry is consistent with that of a M dwarf companion, where a deep convective envelope could have diluted the material captured from the SN ejecta. We have also explored a wide area around the SNR, looking for a possible hypervelocity star ejected by the SN explosion. None has been found. In conclusion, we have a candidate to be the surviving companion of the SNIa that resulted in SNR G272.2-3.2. It is supported by all its kinematical characteristics and by its trajectory within the SNR. This opens the possibility for SNe Ia originating in binary systems with a M-dwarf mass donor.},

abstract = {We present extensive optical photometric and spectroscopic observations for the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2019ein, spanning the phases from $\sim 3$ days to $\sim 330$ days after the explosion. This SN Ia is characterized by extremely fast expansion at early times, with initial velocities of Si II and Ca II being above $\sim$ 25,000--30,000 km/s. After experiencing an unusually rapid velocity decay, the ejecta velocity dropped to $\sim$ 13,000 km/s around maximum light. Photometrically, SN 2019ein has a moderate post-peak decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.35 \pm 0.01$ mag), while being fainter than normal SNe Ia by about 40% (with $M^{\rm max}_{B} \approx -18.71 \pm 0.15$ mag). The nickel mass synthesized in the explosion is estimated to be 0.27--0.31 $M_{\odot}$ from the bolometric light curve. Given such a low nickel mass and a relatively high photospheric velocity, we propose that SN 2019ein likely had a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) progenitor, $M_{\rm WD} \lesssim 1.22 M_{\odot}$. In this case, the explosion could have been triggered by a double-detonation mechanism, for which 1- and 2-dimensional models with WD mass $M_{\rm WD} \approx 1 M_\odot$ and a helium shell of 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ can reasonably produce the observed bolometric light curve and spectra. The predicted asymmetry as a result of double detonation is also favored by the redshifted Fe II and Ni II lines observed in the nebular-phase spectrum. Possible diversity in origin of high velocity SNe Ia is also discussed.},

abstract = {A promising progenitor scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) is the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf in a close binary system with another white dwarf. After the primary star explodes, the surviving donor can be spontaneously released as a hypervelocity runaway. One such runaway donor candidate is LP 398-9, whose orbital trajectory traces back ≈ 10 5 years to a known supernova remnant. Here we report the discovery of carbon-rich circumstellar material around LP 398-9, revealed by a strong infrared excess and analyzed with follow-up spectroscopy. The circumstellar material is most plausibly composed of inflated layers from the star itself, mechanically and radioactively heated by the past companion's supernova. We also detect a 15.4 hr periodic signal in the UV and optical light curves of LP 398-9, which we interpret as surface rotation. The rotation rate is consistent with theoretical predictions from this supernova mechanism, and the brightness variations could originate from surface inhomogeneity deposited by the supernova itself. Our observations strengthen the case for this double-degenerate SNIa progenitor channel, and motivate the search for more runaway SNIa donors.},

abstract = {The nearby supernova SN 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail. Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models, which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN 2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) - realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most widely discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum, but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified. Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads to differences in the 55Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed sufficiently long to study this effect. {\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The absorption feature O I 7773 is an important spectral indicator for type Ia supernovae (SNe$\sim$Ia) that can be used to trace the unburned material at outer layers of the exploding white dwarf. In this work, we use a large sample of SNe$\sim$Ia to examine this absorption at early phases (i.e., -13 days <t <-7 days), and make comparisons with the absorption features of Si$\sim$II 6355 and Ca$\sim$II near-infrared (NIR) triplet. We show that for a subgroup of spectroscopically normal SNe with normal photospheric velocities (i.e., v_si < 12,500 km s^{-1} at optical maximum), the line strength of high velocity feature (HVF) of O$\sim$I is inversely correlated with that of Si$\sim$II (or Ca$\sim$II), and this feature also shows a negative correlation with the luminosity of SNe Ia. This finding, together with other features we find for the O$\sim$I HVF, reveal that for this subgroup of SNe$\sim$Ia explosive oxygen burning occurs at the outermost layer of supernova and difference in burning there could lead to the observed diversity, which are in remarkable agreement with the popular delayed-detonation model of Chandrasekhar mass WD.},

abstract = {As part of the cosmology analysis using Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present photometrically identified SN Ia samples using multiband light curves and host galaxy redshifts. For this analysis, we use the photometric classification framework SuperNNovatrained on realistic DES-like simulations. For reliable classification, we process the DES SN programme (DES-SN) data and introduce improvements to the classifier architecture, obtaining classification accuracies of more than 98 per cent on simulations. This is the first SN classification to make use of ensemble methods, resulting in more robust samples. Using photometry, host galaxy redshifts, and a classification probability requirement, we identify 1863 SNe Ia from which we select 1484 cosmology-grade SNe Ia spanning the redshift range of 0.07 < z < 1.14. We find good agreement between the light-curve properties of the photometrically selected sample and simulations. Additionally, we create similar SN Ia samples using two types of Bayesian Neural Network classifiers that provide uncertainties on the classification probabilities. We test the feasibility of using these uncertainties as indicators for out-of-distribution candidates and model confidence. Finally, we discuss the implications of photometric samples and classification methods for future surveys such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.},

abstract = {An analysis of the first set of low-redshift (z < 0.08) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) monitored by the Carnegie Supernova Project between 2004 and 2006 is presented. The data consist of well-sampled, high-precision optical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (NIR; YJHKs ) light curves in a well-understood photometric system. Methods are described for deriving light-curve parameters, and for building template light curves which are used to fit SN Ia data in the ugriBVYJH bands. The intrinsic colors at maximum light are calibrated using a subsample of supernovae (SNe) assumed to have suffered little or no reddening, enabling color excesses to be estimated for the full sample. The optical-NIR color excesses allow the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to be studied. A low average value of the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, RV ≈ 1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of SNe. However, when the two highly reddened SNe (SN 2005A and SN 2006X) in the sample are excluded, a value RV ≈ 3.2 is obtained, similar to the standard value for the Galaxy. The red colors of these two events are well matched by a model where multiple scattering of photons by circumstellar dust steepens the effective extinction law. The absolute peak magnitudes of the SNe are studied in all bands using a two-parameter linear fit to the decline rates and the colors at maximum light, or alternatively, the color excesses. In both cases, similar results are obtained with dispersions in absolute magnitudes of 0.12-0.16mag, depending on the specific filter-color combination. In contrast to the results obtained from the comparison of the color excesses, these fits of absolute magnitude give RV ≈ 1-2 when the dispersion is minimized, even when the two highly reddened SNe are excluded. This discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellar reddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion in the colors of SNe Ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of the decline rate. Finally, a Hubble diagram for the best-observed subsample of SNe is produced by combining the results of the fits of absolute magnitude versus decline rate and color excess for each filter. The resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to be limited by the peculiar velocities of the host galaxies as evidenced by the strong correlation between the distance-modulus residuals observed in the individual filters. The implication is that the actual precision of SNe Ia distances is 3%-4%. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There are two classes of viable progenitors for normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia): systems in which a white dwarf explodes at the Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{ch}$), and systems in which a white dwarf explodes below the Chandrasekhar mass (sub-$M_{ch}$). It is not clear which of these channels is dominant; observations and light curve modeling have provided evidence for both. Here we use an extensive grid of 4500 time-dependent, multiwavelength radiation transport simulations to show that the sub-$M_{ch}$ model can reproduce the entirety of the width-luminosity relation (WLR), while the $M_{ch}$ model can only produce the brighter events $(0.8 < \Delta M_{15}(B) < 1.55)$, implying that fast-declining SNe Ia come from sub-$M_{ch}$ explosions. We do not assume a particular theoretical paradigm for the progenitor or explosion mechanism, but instead construct parameterized models that vary the mass, kinetic energy, and compositional structure of the ejecta, thereby realizing a broad range of possible outcomes of white dwarf explosions. We provide fitting functions based on our large grid of detailed simulations that map observable properties of SNe Ia such as peak brightness and light curve width to physical parameters such as $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and total ejected mass. These can be used to estimate the physical properties of observed SNe Ia.},

We present observations of SN\,2020jgb, a peculiar SN\,Ia discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Near maximum light, SN\,2020jgb is slightly subluminous (ZTF $g$-band absolute magnitude $M_g$ between $-18.2$ and $-18.7$\,mag depending on the amount of host galaxy extinction) and shows an unusually red color ($g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ between 0.4 and 0.2\,mag) due to strong line-blanketing blueward of $\sim$5000\,\AA. These properties resemble those of SN\,2018byg, a peculiar SN\,Ia consistent with a thick He-shell double detonation (DDet) SN. Using detailed radiative transfer models, we show that the optical spectroscopic and photometric evolution of SN\,2020jgb are broadly consistent with a $\sim$0.95\,$\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (C/O core + He-shell; up to $\sim$1.00\,$\mathrm{M_\odot}$ depending on the total host extinction) progenitor ignited by a thick ($\sim$0.13\,$\mathrm{M_\odot}$) He-shell. We detect a prominent absorption feature at $\sim$1\,\micron\ in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of SN\,2020jgb, which could originate from unburnt helium in the outermost ejecta. While the sample size is limited, similar 1\,\micron\ features have been detected in all the thick He-shell DDet candidates with NIR spectra obtained to date. SN\,2020jgb is also the first subluminous, thick He-shell DDet SN discovered in a star-forming galaxy, indisputably showing that He-shell DDet objects occur in both star-forming and passive galaxies, consistent with the normal SN\,Ia population.},

abstract = {The modern time-domain photometric surveys collect a lot of observations of various astronomical objects, and the coming era of large-scale surveys will provide even more information. Most of the objects have never received a spectroscopic follow-up, which is especially crucial for transients e.g. supernovae. In such cases, observed light curves could present an affordable alternative. Time series are actively used for photometric classification and characterization, such as peak and luminosity decline estimation. However, the collected time series are multidimensional, irregularly sampled, contain outliers, and do not have well-defined systematic uncertainties. Machine learning methods help extract useful information from available data in the most efficient way. We consider several light curve approximation methods based on neural networks: Multilayer Perceptrons, Bayesian Neural Networks, and Normalizing Flows, to approximate observations of a single light curve. Tests using both the simulated PLAsTiCC and real Zwicky Transient Facility data samples demonstrate that even few observations are enough to fit networks and achieve better approximation quality than other state-of-the-art methods. We show that the methods described in this work have better computational complexity and work faster than Gaussian Processes. We analyze the performance of the approximation techniques aiming to fill the gaps in the observations of the light curves, and show that the use of appropriate technique increases the accuracy of peak finding and supernova classification. In addition, the study results are organized in a Fulu Python library available on GitHub, which can be easily used by the community.},

The two leading progenitor scenarios are the single-degenerate (SD) scenario and the double-degenerate scenario. In the SD scenario, the collision of the SN Ia ejecta with its companion star is expected to produce detectable ultraviolet (UV) emission in the first few days after the SN explosion within certain viewing angles. A strong UV flash has recently been detected in an SN 2002eslike peculiar SN Ia iPTF14atg by Cao et al., which is interpreted as evidence of an early-time UV signature due to SN ejecta interacting with its companion star, supporting the SD scenario. In this paper, we present the expected luminosity distributions of early-time UV emission arising from SN Ia ejecta-companion interaction by performing binary population synthesis calculations for different progenitor systems in the SD scenario. Our theoretical predictions will be helpful for future early-time observations of SNe Ia to constrain their possible progenitors. Assuming the observed strong UV pulse of iPTF14atg was indeed produced by the SN ejecta-companion interaction, our population synthesis model suggests that the progenitor system of iPTF14atg is most likely a red-giant donor binary system, and it is unlikely to have been a main-sequence or helium-star donor system.},

abstract = {To empirically calibrate the IR surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale and probe the properties of unresolved stellar populations, we measured fluctuations in 65 galaxies using NICMOS on the Hubble Space Telescope. The early-type galaxies in this sample include elliptical and S0 galaxies and spiral bulges in a variety of environments. Absolute fluctuation magnitudes in the F160W (1.6 micron) filter were derived for each galaxy using previously-measured I-band SBF and Cepheid variable star distances. F160W SBFs can be used to measure distances to early-type galaxies with a relative accuracy of $\sim$10% provided that the galaxy color is known to $\sim$0.035 mag or better. Near-IR fluctuations can also reveal the properties of the most luminous stellar populations in galaxies. Comparison of F160W fluctuation magnitudes and optical colors to stellar population model predictions suggests that bluer elliptical and S0 galaxies have significantly younger populations than redder ones, and may also be more metal-rich. There are no galaxies in this sample with fluctuation magnitudes consistent with old, metal-poor (t>5 Gyr, [Fe/H]<-0.7) stellar population models. Composite stellar population models imply that bright fluctuations in the bluer galaxies may be the result of an episode of recent star formation in a fraction of the total mass of a galaxy. Age estimates from the F160W fluctuation magnitudes are consistent with those measured using the H-beta Balmer line index. The two types of measurements make use of completely different techniques and are sensitive to stars in different evolutionary phases. Both techniques reveal the presence of intermediate-age stars in the early-type galaxies of this sample.},

The Survey contains E, S0 and early-type spiral galaxies in the proportions of 49:42:9, and is essentially complete for E galaxies to Hubble velocities of 2000 km/s, with a substantial sampling of E galaxies out to 4000 km/s. The median error in distance modulus is 0.22 mag. We also present two new results from the Survey. (1) We compare the mean peculiar flow velocity (bulk flow) implied by our distances with predictions of typical cold dark matter transfer functions as a function of scale, and find very good agreement with cold, dark matter cosmologies if the transfer function scale parameter $\Gamma$, and the power spectrum normalization $\sigma_8$ are related by $\sigma_8 \Gamma^{-0.5} \approx 2\pm0.5$. Derived directly from velocities, this result is independent of the distribution of galaxies or models for biasing. The modest bulk flow contradicts reports of large-scale, large-amplitude flows in the $\sim200$ Mpc diameter volume surrounding our Survey volume. (2) We present a distance-independent measure of absolute galaxy luminosity, \Nbar, and show how it correlates with galaxy properties such as color and velocity dispersion, demonstrating its utility for measuring galaxy distances through large and unknown extinction.},

abstract = {We present early-time photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx. The early-time u -band light curve shows an excess flux when compared to normal SNe Ia. We suggest that the early excess blue flux may be due to a rapid change in spectral velocity in the first few days post explosion, produced by the emission of the Ca ii H&K feature passing from the u to the B bands on the timescale of a few days. This effect could be dominant for all SNe Ia that have broad absorption features and early-time velocities over 25,000 km s −1 . It is likely to be one of the main causes of early excess u -band flux in SNe Ia that have early-time high velocities. This effect may also be dominant in the UV filters, as well as in places where the SN spectral energy distribution is quickly rising to longer wavelengths. The rapid change in velocity can only produce a monotonic change (in flux-space) in the u band. For objects that explode at lower velocities, and have a more structured shape in the early excess emission, there must also be an additional parameter producing the early-time diversity. More early-time observations, in particular early spectra, are required to determine how prominent this effect is within SNe Ia.},

We validate our method with a variety of tests including comparing our synthetic nebular spectra for the well-known one-dimensional W7 model with the results of other studies. As an illustrative application of the code, we present synthetic nebular spectra for the detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf (WD) in which the possible effects of gravitational settling of 22Ne prior to explosion have been explored. Specifically, we compare synthetic nebular spectra for a 1.06 M☉ WD model obtained when 5.5 Gyr of very efficient settling is assumed to a similar model without settling. We find that this degree of 22Ne settling has only a modest effect on the resulting nebular spectra due to increased 58Ni abundance. Due to the high ionization in sub-Chandrasekhar models, the nebular [Ni II] emission remains negligible, while the [Ni III] line strengths are increased and the overall ionization balance is slightly lowered in the model with 22Ne settling. In common with previous studies of sub-Chandrasekhar models at nebular epochs, these models overproduce [Fe III] emission relative to [Fe II] in comparison to observations of normal SNe Ia.},

We model the nebular [O I] 6300, 6364 lines and find their strength to suggest a progenitor main-sequence mass of 13-15 Msun. SN 2012ec is unique among hydrogen-rich SNe in showing a distinct and unblended line of stable nickel [Ni II] 7378. This line is produced by 58Ni, a nuclear burning ash whose abundance is a sensitive tracer of explosive burning conditions. Using spectral synthesis modelling, we use the relative strengths of [Ni II] 7378 and [Fe II] 7155 (the progenitor of which is 56Ni) to derive a Ni/Fe production ratio of 0.20pm0.07 (by mass), which is a factor 3.4pm1.2 times the solar value. High production of stable nickel is confirmed by a strong [Ni II] 1.939 micron line. This is the third reported case of a core-collapse supernova producing a Ni/Fe ratio far above the solar value, which has implications for core-collapse explosion theory and galactic chemical evolution models.},

abstract = {If Type Ia supernovae (SNe$\sim$Ia) result from a white dwarf being ignited by Roche lobe overflow from a nondegenerate companion, then as the supernova explosion runs into the companion star its ejecta will be shocked, causing an early blue excess in the lightcurve. A handful of these excesses have been found in single-object studies, but inferences about the population of SNe$\sim$Ia as a whole have been limited because of the rarity of multiwavelength followup within days of explosion. Here we present a three-year investigation yielding an unbiased sample of nine nearby ($z<0.01$) SNe$\sim$Ia with exemplary early data. The data are truly multiwavelength, covering $UBVgri$ and Swift bandpasses, and also early, with an average first epoch 16.0 days before maximum light. Of the nine objects, three show early blue excesses. We do not find enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that SNe$\sim$Ia predominantly arise from Roche-lobe-overflowing single-degenerate systems ($p=0.94$). When looking at the objects' colors, we find the objects are almost uniformly near-UV-blue, in contrast to earlier literature samples which found that only a third of SNe$\sim$Ia are near-UV-blue, and we find a seemingly continuous range of $B-V$ colors in the days after explosion, again in contrast with earlier claims in the literature. This study highlights the importance of early, truly multiwavelength, high-cadence data in determining the progenitor systems of SNe$\sim$Ia and in revealing their diverse early behavior.},

This excess would only be observable for events with favorable viewing angles, $\sim$10\% of the time. We model the 2018 ZTF sample of 127 SNe Ia using companion shocking models, and recover an observed early excess rate of $12.0\pm3.6\%$, consistent both with several other rates calculated throughout the literature, and with the expectation that SNe Ia predominantly occur in single-degenerate systems. We observe early excesses only in spectroscopically normal SNe Ia, in contradiction to the claim that such excesses occur more frequently in overluminous SNe Ia. We also show that the detection of early excesses can be methodology-dependent. We encourage the observation of large samples of SNe Ia with high-cadence multiwavelength early data in order to test the statistical predictions of SN Ia progenitor models, and we also encourage the refinement of existing models.},

We also predict significant He I line emission at optical and near-infrared wavelengths for both hydrogen-rich or helium-rich material, providing an additional observational probe of stripped ejecta.

New simulations presented at the meeting did not achieve an explosion of CCSNe. I critically examine other arguments that where presented in support of the neutrino-driven model, and present counter arguments that support the jet-driven explosion mechanism. The jets operate via a negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). The negative feedback mechanism explains the explosion energy being several times the binding energy of the core in most CCSNe. At the present time when we do not know yet what mechanism explodes massive stars and we do not know yet what evolutionary route leads white dwarfs to explode as SN Ia, we must be open to different ideas and critically examine old notions.},

abstract = {Context. With a rapidly rising number of transients detected in astronomy, classification methods based on machine learning are increasingly being employed. Their goals are typically to obtain a definitive classification of transients, and for good performance they usually require the presence of a large set of observations. However, well-designed, targeted models can reach their classification goals with fewer computing resources. Aims. The aim of this study is to assist in the observational astronomy task of deciding whether a newly detected transient warrants follow-up observations. Methods. This paper presents SNGuess, a model designed to find young extragalactic nearby transients with high purity. SNGuess works with a set of features that can be efficiently calculated from astronomical alert data. Some of these features are static and associated with the alert metadata, while others must be calculated from the photometric observations contained in the alert. Most of the features are simple enough to be obtained or to be calculated already at the early stages in the lifetime of a transient after its detection. We calculate these features for a set of labeled public alert data obtained over a time span of 15 months from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The core model of SNGuess consists of an ensemble of decision trees, which are trained via gradient boosting. Results. Approximately 88% of the candidates suggested by SNGuess from a set of alerts from ZTF spanning from April 2020 to August 2021 were found to be true relevant supernovae (SNe). For alerts with bright detections, this number ranges between 92% and 98%. Since April 2020, transients identified by SNGuess as potential young SNe in the ZTF alert stream are being published to the Transient Name Server (TNS) under the AMPEL_ZTF_NEW group identifier. SNGuess scores for any transient observed by ZTF can be accessed via a web service. The source code of SNGuess is publicly available. Conclusions. SNGuess is a lightweight, portable, and easily re-trainable model that can effectively suggest transients for follow-up. These properties make it a useful tool for optimizing follow-up observation strategies and for assisting humans in the process of selecting candidate transients.},

abstract = {We present the earliest ultraviolet (UV) observations of the bright Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe/PTF11kly in the nearby galaxy M101 at a distance of only 6.4 Mpc. It was discovered shortly after explosion by the Palomar Transient Factory and first observed by Swift/UVOT about a day after explosion. The early UV light is well-defined, with $\sim$20 data points per filter in the five days after explosion. These early and well-sampled UV observations form new template light curves for comparison with observations of other SNe Ia at low and high redshift. We report fits from semi-empirical models of the explosion and find the time evolution of the early UV flux to be well fit by the superposition of two parabolic curves. Finally, we use the early UV flux measurements to examine a possible shock interaction with a non-degenerate companion. From models predicting the measurable shock emission, we find that even a solar mass companion at a distance of a few solar radii is unlikely at more than 95% confidence.},

abstract = {Many aspects of the progenitor systems, environments, and explosion dynamics of the various subtypes of supernovae are difficult to investigate at extragalactic distances where they are observed as unresolved sources. Alternatively, young supernova remnants in our own galaxy and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds offer opportunities to resolve, measure , and track expanding stellar ejecta in fine detail, but the handful that are known exhibit widely different properties that reflect the diversity of their parent explosions and local circumstellar and interstellar environments. A way of complementing both supernova and supernova remnant research is to establish strong empirical links between the two separate stages of stellar explosions. Here we briefly review recent progress in the development of supernova-supernova remnant connections, paying special attention to connections made through the study of "middle-aged" (∼ 10−100 yr) supernovae and young (< 1000 yr) supernova remnants. We highlight how this approach can uniquely inform several key areas of supernova research, including the origins of explosive mixing, high-velocity jets, and the formation of dust in the ejecta.},

The shock produced by a supernova event acts as a type of time machine , probing the mass loss history of the progenitor system back to ages of ∼ 10 000 years before the explosion, whereas supernova remnants probe a much earlier stage of stellar evolution, interacting with material expelled during the progenitor's much earlier evolution. In this chapter we will review how observations of super-nova remnants allow us to infer fundamental properties of the progenitor system. We will provide detailed examples of how bulk characteristics of a remnant, such as its chemical composition and dynamics, allow us to infer properties of the progenitor evolution. In the latter half of this chapter, we will show how this exercise may be extended from individual objects to SNR as classes of objects, and how there are clear bifurcations in the dynamics and spectral characteristics of core collapse and thermonuclear supernova remnants. We will finish the chapter by touching on recent advances in the modeling of massive stars, and the implications for observable properties of supernovae and their remnants.},

abstract = {<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon–oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive. Recently, Sharon & Kushnir used The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey to construct a synthesized 56Ni mass, MNi56, distribution of SNe Ia. They found that the rate of low-luminosity ($M_\text{Ni56}\approx 0.15\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) SNe Ia is lower by a factor of ∼10 than the more common $M_\text{Ni56}\approx 0.7\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ events. We here show that in order for the double-detonation model (DDM, in which a propagating thermonuclear detonation wave, TNDW, within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core triggers a TNDW within the core) to explain this low-luminosity suppression, the probability of a low-mass ($\approx 0.85\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD explosion should be ∼100-fold lower than that of a high-mass ($\approx 1.05\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD. One possible explanation is that the ignition of low-mass CO cores is somehow suppressed. We use accurate one-dimensional numerical simulations to show that if a TNDW is able to propagate within the helium shell, then the ignition within the CO core is guaranteed (resolved here for the first time in a full-star simulation), even for $0.7\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ WDs, providing no natural explanation for the low-luminosity suppression. DDM could explain the low-luminosity suppression if the mass distribution of primary WDs in close binaries is dramatically different from the field distribution; if the Helium shell ignition probability is suppressed for low-mass WDs; or if multidimensional perturbations significantly change our results.</p>},

While this magnitude-limited survey has an unprecedented number of objects, it suffers from large distance uncertainties and lacks an estimation of host extinction. We bypass these issues by calculating the intrinsic luminosities from the shape parameters of the light curve's and bands, with the luminosities calibrated from the well observed SNe Ia sample of the Carnegie Supernova Project, allowing us to construct, for the first time, the intrinsic LF of SNe Ia. We then use a novel tight relation between the color stretch and the synthesized 56 Ni mass, Ni56 , to determine the Ni56 distribution of SNe Ia. We find that the LFs are unimodal, with their peaks in line with previous results, but have a much lower rate of dim events and luminous events. We show that the features on top of the unimodal LF-derived distributions are all compatible with statistical noise, consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions. We further derive, for the first time, the SNe Ia distribution of host galaxy extinction, and find a mean selective extinction of (−) ≈ 0.1 and a non-negligible fraction with large, > 1 mag, extinction in the optical bands. The high extinction is typical for luminous SNe, supporting their young population origin.},

abstract = {A series of optical and one near-infrared nebular spectra covering the first year of the Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe are presented and modelled. The density profile that proved best for the early optical/ultraviolet spectra, '$\rho$-11fe', was extended to lower velocities to include the regions that emit at nebular epochs.Model $\rho$-11fe is intermediate between the fast deflagration modelW7and a low-energy delayed-detonation. Good fits to the nebular spectra are obtained if the innermost ejecta are dominated by neutron-rich, stable Fe-group species, which contribute to cooling but not to heating. The correct thermal balance can thus be reached for the strongest [Fe II] and [Fe III] lines to be reproduced with the observed ratio. The 56Ni mass thus obtained is 0.47 ± 0.05M⊙. The bulk of 56Ni has an outermost velocity of 8500 km s-1. Themass of stable iron is 0.23±0.03M⊙. Stable Ni has low abundance,10-2M⊙. This is sufficient to reproduce an observed emission line near 7400 {\AA}. A sub-Chandrasekhar explosion model with mass 1.02M⊙ and no central stable Fe does not reproduce the observed line ratios. A mock model where neutron-rich Fe-group species are located above 56Ni following recent suggestions is also shown to yield spectra that are less compatible with the observations. The densities and abundances in the inner layers obtained from the nebular analysis, combined with those of the outer layers previously obtained, are used to compute a synthetic bolometric light curve, which compares favourably with the light curve of SN 2011fe.},

abstract = {We present a radiative transfer code to model the nebular phase spectra of supernovae (SNe) in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE). We apply it to a systematic study of Type Ia SNe using parameterized 1D models and show how nebular spectral features depend on key physical parameters, such as the time since explosion, total ejecta mass, kinetic energy, radial density profile, and the masses of 56Ni, intermediate mass elements (IMEs), and stable iron-group elements (IGEs). We also quantify the impact of uncertainties in atomic data inputs. Among the results of the study are: (1) The main features of SNe Ia nebular spectra are relatively insensitive to most physical parameters. Degeneracy among parameters precludes a unique determination of the ejecta properties from spectral fitting. In particular, features can be equally well fit with generic Chandrasekhar mass (M_ch), sub-M_Ch, and super-M_Ch models; (2) A sizable ($\sim$0.1 Msun) central region of stable IGEs, often claimed as evidence for M_Ch models, is not essential to fit the optical spectra and may produce an unusual flat-top [CoIII] profile; (3) The strength of [SIII] emission near 9500A can provide a useful diagnostic of explosion nucleosynthesis; (4) Substantial amounts ($\sim$0.1 Msun) of unburned C/O mixed throughout the ejecta produce [OIII] emission not seen in observations; (5) Shifts in the wavelength of line peaks, sometimes used to infer ejecta geometry, can also arise from line blending effects; (6) The steepness of the ejecta density profile affects the line shapes, with flatter slopes providing better fits to the observations of SN 2011fe, offering a constraint on explosion models; (7) Uncertainties in atomic data affect spectral line ratios by $\sim$30%, a level similar to the effect of varying physical parameters.},

abstract = {Aims. This study aims at constraining the origin of the nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe), 2011fe and 2014J. The two most favoured scenarios for triggering the explosion of the white dwarf supernova progenitor is either mass loss from a non-degenerate companion or merger with another white dwarf. In the former, there could be a significant amount of leftover material from the companion at the centre of the supernova. Detecting such material would therefore favour the single-degenerate scenario. Methods. The left-over material from a possible non-degenerate companion can reveal itself after about one year, and in this study such material was searched for in the spectra of SN 2011fe (at 294 days after the explosion) using the Large Binocular Telescope and for SN 2014J using the Nordic Optical Telescope (315 days past explosion). The observations were interpreted using numerical models simulating the expected line emission from ablated material from the companion star. The spectral lines sought for are H$\alpha$, [O I] $\lambda$6300, and [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291,7324, and the expected width of these lines is -1000 km s-1, which in the case of the [Ca II] lines blend to a broader feature. Results. No signs of H$\alpha$, [O I] $\lambda$6300, or [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291, 7324 could be traced for in any of the two supernovae. When systematic uncertainties are included, the limits on hydrogen-rich ablated gas are 0.003 M⊙ in SN 2011fe and 0.0085 M⊙ in SN 2014J, where the limit for SN 2014J is the second lowest ever, and the limit for SN 2011fe is a revision of a previous limit. Limits are also put on helium-rich ablated gas, and here limits from [O I] $\lambda$6300 provide the upper mass limits 0.002 M⊙ and 0.005 M⊙ for SNe 2011fe and 2014J, respectively. These numbers are used in conjunction with other data to argue that these supernovae can stem from double-degenerate systems or from single-degenerate systems with a spun-up/spun-down super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. For SN 2011fe, other types of hydrogen-rich donors can very likely be ruled out, whereas a main-sequence donor system with large intrinsic separation is still possible for SN 2014J. Helium-rich donor systems cannot be ruled out for any of the two supernovae, but the expected short delay time for such progenitors makes this possibility less likely, especially for SN 2011fe. Published data for SNe 1998bu, 2000cx, 2001el, 2005am, and 2005cf are used to constrain their origin. We emphasise that the results of this study depend on the sought-after lines emerging unattenuated from the central regions of the nebula. Detailed radiative transfer calculations with longer line lists than are presently used are needed to confirm that this is, in fact, true. Finally, the broad lines of SNe 2011fe and 2014J are discussed, and it is found that the [Ni II] $\lambda$7378 emission is redshifted by -+1300 kms-1, as opposed to the known blueshift of - 1100 kms-1 for SN 2011fe. [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 is also redshifted in SN 2014J. SN 2014J belongs to a minority of SNe Ia that both have a nebular redshift of [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 and [Ni II] $\lambda$7378, and a slow decline of the Si II $\lambda$6355 absorption trough just after B-band maximum.},

ESO/VLT optical echelle spectra of the SN Ia 2000cx were taken before and up to 70 days after maximum. We detect no hydrogen and helium lines, and place an upper limit on the mass loss rate for the putative wind of less than 1.3EE{-5} solar masses per year, assuming a speed of 10 km/s and solar abundances for the wind. In a helium-enriched case, the best line to constrain the mass loss would be He I 10,830 A. We confirm the details of interstellar Na I and Ca II absorption towards SN 2000cx as discussed by Patat et al., but also find evidence for 6613.56 A Diffuse Interstellar Band (DIB) absorption in the Milky Way. We discuss measurements of the X-ray emission from the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the wind and we re-evaluate observations of SN 1992A obtained 16 days after maximum by Schlegel & Petre. We find an upper limit of 1.3EE{-5} solar masses per year. These results, together with the previous observational work on the normal SNe Ia 1994D and 2001el, disfavour a symbiotic star in the upper mass loss rate regime from being the likely progenitor scenario for these SNe. To constrain hydrogen in late time spectra, we present ESO/VLT and ESO/NTT optical and infrared observations of SNe Ia 1998bu and 2000cx 251-388 days after maximum. We see no hydrogen line emission in SNe 1998bu and 2000cx at these epochs, and we argue from modeling that the mass of such hydrogen-rich gas must be less than 0.03 solar masses for both supernovae. Comparing similar upper limits with recent models of Pan et al., it seems hydrogen-rich donors with a separation of less than 5 times the radius of the donor may be ruled out for the five SNe Ia 1998bu, 2000cx, 2001el, 2005am and 2005cf.},

abstract = {A generic prediction of the single-degenerate model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is that a significant amount of material will be stripped from the donor star ($\sim$0.5 Msun for a giant donor and $\sim$0.15 Msun for a main sequence donor) by the supernova ejecta. This material, excited by gamma-rays from radioactive decay, would then produce relatively narrow (1000 km s-1) emission features observable once the supernova enters the nebular phase. Such emission has never been detected, which already provides strong constraints on Type Ia progenitor models. In this Letter we report the deepest limit yet on the presence of H-alpha emission originating from the stripped hydrogen in the nebular spectrum of a Type Ia supernova obtained using a high signal-to-noise spectrum of the nearby normal SN Ia 2011fe 274 days after B-band maximum light with the Large Binocular Telescope's Multi-Object Double Spectrograph. We put a conservative upper limit on the H-alpha flux of 3.14 x 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2, which corresponds to a luminosity of 1.57 x 10^35 erg s-1. By scaling models from the literature, our flux limit translates into an upper limit of 0.001 Msun of stripped material. This is an order of magnitude stronger than previous limits. SN 2011fe was a typical Type Ia supernova, special only in its proximity, and we argue that lack of hydrogen emission in its nebular spectrum adds yet another strong constraint on the single degenerate class of models for SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Despite intense scrutiny, the progenitor system(s) that gives rise to Type Ia supernovae remains unknown. The favored theory invokes a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting hydrogen-rich material from a close companion until a thermonuclear runaway ensues that incinerates the white dwarf. However, simulations resulting from this single-degenerate, binary channel demand the presence of low-velocity H-alpha emission in spectra taken during the late nebular phase, since a portion of the companion's envelope becomes entrained in the ejecta. This hydrogen has never been detected, but has only rarely been sought. Here we present results from a campaign to obtain deep, nebular-phase spectroscopy of nearby Type Ia supernovae, and include multi-epoch observations of two events: SN 2005am (slightly subluminous) and SN 2005cf (normally bright). No H-alpha emission is detected in the spectra of either object. An upper limit of 0.01 M_Sun of solar abundance material in the ejecta is established from the models of Mattila et al. which, when coupled with the mass-stripping simulations of Marietta et al. and Meng et al. effectively rules out progenitor systems for these supernovae with secondaries close enough to the white dwarf to be experiencing Roche lobe overflow at the time of explosion. Alternative explanations for the absence of H-alpha emission, along with suggestions for future investigations necessary to confidently exclude them as possibilities, are critically evaluated.},

abstract = {We present early time high-resolution (VLT/UVES) and late time low-resolution (VLT/FORS) optical spectra of the normal type la supernova, SN 2001el. The high-resolution spectra were obtained 9 and 2 days before (B-band) maximum light. This was in order to allow the detection of narrow hydrogen and/or helium emission lines from the circumstellar medium of the supernova. No such lines were detected in our data. We therefore use these spectra together with photoionisation models to derive upper limits of 9 × 10-6 M⊙ yr-1 and 5 × 10-5 M ⊙ yr-1 for the mass loss rate from the progenitor system of SN 2001el assuming velocities of 10 km s-1 and 50 km s -1, respectively, for a wind extending to outside at least a few ×1015 cm away from the supernova explosion site. So far, these are the best Ha based upper limits obtained for a type la supernova, and exclude a symbiotic star in the upper mass loss rate regime (so called Mira type stars) from being the progenitor of SN 2001el. The low-resolution spectrum was obtained in the nebular phase of the supernova, ∼400 days after the maximum light, to search for any hydrogen rich gas originating from the supernova progenitor system. However, we see no signs of Balmer lines in our spectrum. Therefore, we model the late time spectra to derive an upper limit of ∼0.03 M⊙ for solar abundance material present at velocities lower than 1000 km s-1 within the supernova explosion site. According to numerical simulations of Marietta et al. (2000) this is less than the expected mass lost by a subgiant, red giant or a main-sequence secondary star at a small binary separation as a result of the SN explosion. Our data therefore exclude these scenarios as the progenitor of SN 2001el. Finally, we discuss the origin of high velocity Ca II lines previously observed in a few type la supernovae before the maximum light. We see both the Ca II IR triplet and the H&K lines in our earliest (-9 days) spectrum at a very high velocity of up to ∼34 000 km s-1. The spectrum also shows a flat-bottomed Si II "6150 {\AA}" feature similar to the one previously observed in SN 1990N (Leibundgut et al. 1991, ApJ, 371, L23) at 14 days before maximum light. We compare these spectral features in SN 2001el to those observed in SN 1984A and SN 1990N at even higher velocities. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {In the new era of time-domain surveys, Type Ia supernovae are being caught sooner after explosion, which has exposed significant variation in their early light curves. Two driving factors for early-time evolution are the distribution of 56Ni in the ejecta and the presence of flux excesses of various causes. We perform an analysis of the largest young SN Ia sample to date. We compare 115 SN Ia light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility to the turtls model grid containing light curves of Chandrasekhar mass explosions with a range of 56Ni masses, 56Ni distributions, and explosion energies. We find that the majority of our observed light curves are well reproduced by Chandrasekhar mass explosion models with a preference for highly extended 56Ni distributions. We identify six SNe Ia with an early-time flux excess in our gr-band data (four 'blue' and two 'red' flux excesses). We find an intrinsic rate of 18 ± 11 per cent of early flux excesses in SNe Ia at z < 0.07, based on three detected flux excesses out of 30 (10 per cent) observed SNe Ia with a simulated efficiency of 57 per cent. This is comparable to rates of flux excesses in the literature but also accounts for detection efficiencies. Two of these events are mostly consistent with circumstellar material interaction, while the other four have longer lifetimes in agreement with companion interaction and 56Ni-clump models. We find a higher frequency of flux excesses in 91T/99aa-like events (44 ± 13 per cent).},

@article{Graur2016a,
abstract = {Seitenzahl et al. (2009) have predicted that roughly three years after its explosion, the light we receive from a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) will come mostly from reprocessing of electrons and X-rays emitted by the radioactive decay chain $^{57}{\rm Co}\sim\to\sim^{57}{\rm Fe}$, instead of positrons from the decay chain $^{56}{\rm Co}\sim\to\sim^{56}{\rm Fe}$ that dominates the SN light at earlier times. Using the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, we followed the light curve of the SN Ia SN 2012cg out to $1055$ days after maximum light. Our measurements are consistent with the light curves predicted by the contribution of energy from the reprocessing of electrons and X-rays emitted by the decay of $^{57}$Co, offering evidence that $^{57}$Co is produced in SN Ia explosions. However, the data are also consistent with a light echo $\sim14$ mag fainter than SN 2012cg at peak. Assuming no light-echo contamination, the mass ratio of $^{57}$Ni and $^{56}$Ni produced by the explosion, a strong constraint on any SN Ia explosion model, is $0.043^{+0.012}_{-0.011}$, roughly twice Solar. In the context of current explosion models, this value favors a progenitor white dwarf with a mass near the Chandrasekhar limit.},

abstract = {The late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observed $>900$ days after explosion, present the possibility of a new diagnostic for SN Ia progenitor and explosion models. First, however, we must discover what physical process (or combination of processes) leads to the slow-down of the late-time light curve relative to a pure $^{56}$Co decay, as observed in SNe 2011fe, 2012cg, and 2014J. We present Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2015F, taken $\approx 600-1040$ days past maximum light. Unlike those of the three other SNe Ia, the light curve of SN 2015F remains consistent with being powered solely by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Co. We fit the light curves of these four SNe Ia in a consistent manner and measure possible correlations between the light curve stretch - a proxy for the intrinsic luminosity of the SN - and the parameters of the physical model used in the fit (e.g., the mass ratio of $^{56}$Co and $^{57}$Co produced in the explosion, or the time at which freeze-out sets in). We propose a new, late-time Phillips-like correlation between the stretch of the SNe and the shape of their late-time light curves, which we parametrize as the difference between their pseudo-bolometric luminosities at 600 and 900 days: $\Delta L_{900} = {\rm log}(L_{600}/L_{900})$. This model-independent correlation provides a new way to test which physical process lies behind the slow-down of SN Ia light curves $>900$ days after explosion, and, ultimately, fresh constraints on the various SN Ia progenitor and explosion models.},

abstract = {Late-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), >900 days after explosion, have shown that this type of SN does not suffer an "IR catastrophe" at 500 days as previously predicted. Instead, several groups have observed a slow-down in the optical light curves of these SNe. A few reasons have been suggested for this slow-down, from a changing fraction of positrons reprocessed by the expanding ejecta, through a boost of energy from slow radioactive decay chains such as 57Co --> 57Fe, to atomic "freeze-out." Discovering which of these (or some other) heating mechanisms is behind the slow-down will directly impact studies of SN Ia progenitors, explosion models, and nebular-stage physics. Recently, Graur et al. (2018) suggested a possible correlation between the shape of the late-time light curves of four SNe Ia and their stretch values, which are proxies for their intrinsic luminosities. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope observations of the SN Ia ASASSN-14lp at $\sim$850-960 days past maximum light. With a stretch of s = 1.15 +/- 0.05, it is the most luminous normal SN Ia observed so far at these late times. We rule out contamination by light echoes and show that the late-time, optical light curve of ASASSN-14lp is flatter than that of previous SNe Ia observed at late times. This result is in line with-and strengthens-the Graur et al. (2018) correlation, but additional SNe are needed to verify it.},

abstract = {Recent works have studied the late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) when these were older than 500 days past B-band maximum light. Of these, SN 2014J, which exploded in the nearby galaxy M82, was studied with the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) by Yang et al. Here, I report complementary photometry of SN 2014J taken with the HST Wide Field Camera 3 when it was $\sim$360-1300 days old. My F555W measurements are consistent with the F606W measurements of Yang et al., but the F438W measurements are $\sim$1 mag fainter than their F475W measurements. I corroborate their finding that even though SN 2014J has spatially resolved light echoes, its photometry is not contaminated by an unresolved echo. Finally, I compare the F438W and F555W light curves of SN 2014J to those of the other late-time SNe Ia observed to date and show that more intrinsically luminous SNe have slower light-curve decline rates. This is consistent with the correlation claimed by Graur et al., which was based on a comparison of pseudo-bolometric light curves. By conducting a direct comparison of the late-time light curves in the same filters, I remove any systematic uncertainties introduced by the assumptions that go into constructing the pseudo-bolometric light curves, thus strengthening the Graur et al. claim.},

The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of the prototypical SN 1992A, and the luminosity at maximum (M_B = -19.08) is close to the average for a SN Ia. However, the ejected 56Ni mass derived by modelling the bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limit of the 56Ni mass distribution observed in normal SNe Ia. Accordingly, SN 2004eo shows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (Delta m_(B) = 1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio Si II 5972 / Si II 6355 similar to that of SN 1992A. The physical properties of SN 2004eo cause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocity gradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by Benetti et al. (2005). Similar behaviour is seen in a few other SNe Ia. Thus, there may in fact exist a few SNe Ia with intermediate physical properties.},

The data represent one of the best sets of optical and infrared photometry ever obtained for a Type Ia supernova. Based on synthetic photometry using optical spectra of SN 2001el and optical and infrared spectra of SN 1999ee, we were able to devise filter corrections for the BVJHK photometry of SN 2001el which to some extent resolve systematic differences between SN 2001el datasets obtained with different telescope/filter/instrument combinations. We also calculated V minus infrared color curves on the basis of a delayed detonation model and showed that the theoretical color curves match the unreddened loci for Type Ia SNe with mid-range decline rates to within 0.2 mag. Given the completeness of the light curves and the elimination of filter-oriented systematic errors to some degree, the data presented here will be useful for the construction of photometric templates, especially in the infrared. On the whole the photometric behavior of SN 2001el was quite normal. The second H-band maximum being brighter than the first H-band maximum is in accord with the prediction of Krisciunas et al. (2000) for Type Ia SNe with mid-range decline rates. The photometry exhibits non-zero host extinction, with total A_V = 0.57 +/- 0.05 mag along the line of sight. NGC 1448, the host of SN 2001el, would be an excellent target for a distance determination using Cepheids.},

abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared light curves of SN 2001el from 310 to 445 days past maximum light, obtained with the Very Large Telescope. The late-time optical (UBVRI) light curves decay in a nearly linear fashion with decay time scales of 1.43\pm0.14, 1.43\pm0.06, 1.48\pm0.06, 1.45\pm0.07, and 1.03\pm0.07 magnitudes (per hundred days) in the U, B, V, R and I bands, respectively. In contrast, in the near-infrared (JHKs) bands the time evolution of the flux appears to be nearly constant at these epochs. We measure decline rates (per hundred days) of 0.19\pm0.10 and 0.17\pm0.11 magnitudes in the J and H bands, respectively. We construct a UVOIR light curve, and find that the late-time luminosity has a decay time scale nearly consistent with complete depostion of positron kinetic energy. The late-time light curves of the normal type Ia SN 2001el demonstrate the increased importance of the near-infrared contribution. This was previously observed in the peculiar SN 2000cx, and the results for SN 2001el thus ensure that the conclusions previously based on a single peculiar event are applicable to normal type Ia supernovae. The measured late-time UVOIR decline rate suggests that a majority of the positrons are trapped within the ejecta. This results does not favor the predictions of a weak and/or radially combed magnetic field configuration.},

The data represent one of the best sets of optical and infrared photometry ever obtained for a Type Ia supernova (SN). Based on synthetic photometry using optical spectra of SN 2001el and optical and infrared spectra of SN 1999ee, we were able to devise filter corrections for the BVJHK photometry of SN 2001el, which to some extent resolve systematic differences between SN 2001el data sets obtained with different telescope/filter/ instrument combinations. We also calculated V-minus-infrared color curves on the basis of a delayed detonation model and show that the theoretical color curves match the unreddened loci for Type Ia SNe with midrange decline rates to within 0.2 mag. Given the completeness of the light curves and the elimination of filter oriented systematic errors to some degree, the data presented here will be useful for the construction of photometric templates, especially in the infrared. On the whole the photometric behavior of SN 2001el was quite normal. The second H-band maximum being brighter than the first H-band maximum is in accord with the prediction of Krisciunas et al. for Type Ia SNe with midrange decline rates. The photometry exhibits non-zero host extinction, with total A V = 0.57 AE 0.05 mag along the line of sight. NGC 1448, the host of SN 2001el, would be an excellent target for a distance determination using Cepheids.},

abstract = {The abundance distribution in the ejecta of the peculiar slowly declining Type Ia super-nova (SN Ia) SN 1999aa is obtained by modelling a time series of optical spectra. Similar to SN 1991T, SN 1999aa was characterised by early-time spectra dominated by Fe III features and a weak Si II 6355{\AA}6355˚6355{\AA} line, but it exhibited a high-velocity Ca II H&K line and morphed into a spectroscopically normal SN Ia earlier. Three explosion models are investigated, yielding comparable fits. The innermost layers are dominated by ∼ 0.3 M of neutron-rich stable Fe-group elements, mostly stable iron. Above that central region lies a 56 Ni-dominated shell, extending to v ≈ 11, 000-12, 000 km s −1 , with mass ∼ 0.65 M. These inner layers are therefore similar to those of normal SNe Ia. However, the outer layers exhibit composition peculiarities similar to those of SN 1991T: the intermediate-mass elements shell is very thin, containing only ∼ 0.2 M , and is sharply separated from an outer oxygen-dominated shell, which includes ∼ 0.22 M. These results imply that burning suddenly stopped in SN 1999aa. This is a feature SN 1999aa shares with SN 1991T, and explain the peculiarities of both SNe, which are quite similar in nature apart from the different luminosities. The spectroscopic path from normal to SN 1991T-like SNe Ia cannot be explained solely by a temperature sequence. It also involves composition layering differences, suggesting variations in the progenitor density structure or in the explosion parameters.},

Supernova (SN) type is defined by spectroscopic emission lines, but obtaining spectroscopy is often logistically unfeasible. Thus, the ability to identify SNe by type using time-series image data alone is crucial, especially in light of the increasing breadth and depth of upcoming telescopes. We present a convo-lutional neural network method for fast supernova time-series classification, with observed brightness data smoothed in both the wavelength and time directions with Gaussian process regression. We apply this method to full duration and truncated SN time-series, to simulate retrospective as well as real-time classification performance. Retrospective classification is used to differentiate cosmo-logically useful Type Ia SNe from other SN types, and this method achieves > 99% accuracy on this task. We are also able to differentiate between 6 SN types with 60% accuracy given only two nights of data and 98% accuracy retrospectively.},

abstract = {We present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 micron and 240 micron data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution. To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden- Dwingeloo map of H_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no significant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 \pm 13 nW/m^2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 \pm 4 nW/m^2/sr at 240 micron (95% confidence). This integrated flux is $\sim$2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates CMBR experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption.},

This effort is one part of a series of works that perform an extensive review of redshifts, peculiar velocities, photometric calibration, and intrinsic-scatter models of SNe Ia. The total number of light curves, which are compiled across 18 different surveys, is a significant increase from the first Pantheon analysis (1048 SNe), particularly at low redshift ($z$). Furthermore, unlike in the Pantheon analysis, we include light curves for SNe with $z<0.01$ such that SN systematic covariance can be included in a joint measurement of the Hubble constant (H$_0$) and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter ($w$). We use the large sample to compare properties of 151 SNe Ia observed by multiple surveys and 12 pairs/triplets of "SN siblings" - SNe found in the same host galaxy. Distance measurements, application of bias corrections, and inference of cosmological parameters are discussed in the companion paper by Brout et al. (2022b), and the determination of H$_0$ is discussed by Riess et al. (2022). These analyses will measure w with $\sim3\%$ precision and H$_0$ with 1 km/s/Mpc precision.},

abstract = {We present optical and near infrared (NIR) observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2014J. Seventeen optical and 23 NIR spectra were obtained from 10 days before (-10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum B-band brightness. The relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns of development can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of this period. Carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify C I $\lambda$1.0693 in the NIR spectra. Mg II lines with high oscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other Mg II lines.We show that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in optical depths due to oscillator strengths. The spectra of SN 2014J show that it is a normal SN Ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal and high-velocity subclasses. The velocities for O I, Mg II, Si II, S II, Ca II, and Fe II suggest that SN 2014J has a layered structure with little or no mixing. That result is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models.We also report photometric observations, obtained from -10d to +29d, in the UBVRIJH and Ks bands. The template fitting package SNooPy is used to interpret the light curves and to derive photometric parameters. Using RV = 1.46, which is consistent with previous studies, SNooPy finds that AV = 1.80 for E (B - V)host = 1.23 ± 0.06 mag. The maximum B-band brightness of -19.19 ± 0.10 mag was reached on February 1.74 UT ± 0.13 days and the supernova has a decline parameter, $\Delta$m15, of 1.12 ± 0.02 mag.},

As a result of the newly modified strategy employed by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search, a sequence of filtered images was obtained starting 161 s after discovery. Utilizing recent models describing the interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta with a companion star, we rule out a ∼1 M companion for half of all viewing angles and a red-giant companion for nearly all orientations. SN 2012cg reached a B-band maximum of 12.09 ± 0.02 mag on 2012 June 2.0 and took ∼17.3 days from explosion to reach this, typical for SNe Ia. Our pre-maximum-brightness photometry shows a narrower-than-average B-band light curve for SN 2012cg, though slightly overluminous at maximum brightness and with normal color evolution (including some of the earliest SN Ia filtered photometry ever obtained). Spectral fits to SN 2012cg reveal ions typically found in SNe Ia at early times, with expansion velocities 14,000 km s −1 at 2.5 days past explosion. Absorption from C ii is detected early, as well as high-velocity components of both Si ii $\lambda$6355 and Ca ii. Our last spectrum (13.5 days past explosion) resembles that of the somewhat peculiar SN Ia 1999aa. This suggests that SN 2012cg will have a slower-than-average declining light curve, which may be surprising given the faster-than-average rising light curve.},

abstract = {With the advent of large dedicated Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) surveys, K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially important in the determination of cosmological parameters. While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broad-band colors, it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broad-band colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features. Finally, we present a template spectroscopic sequence near maximum light for further improvement on the K-correction estimate. A library of $\sim$600 observed spectra of $\sim$100 SNe Ia from heterogeneous sources is used for the analysis.},

The formalism between ejecta morphology and line profile shapes is derived, including effects of scattering and absorption. Line luminosity expressions are derived in various physical limits, with examples of applications from the literature. The physical processes at work in the supernova ejecta, including gamma-ray deposition, non-thermal electron degradation, ionization and excitation, and radiative transfer are described and linked to the computation and application of advanced spectral models.

This hydrogen-rich matter might leave its trace in the light curves and/or spectra. In this paper, we perform radiation hydrodynamical simulations of this collision for three binary systems. As a result, we find that the emission from the shock-heated region is not as strong as in previous studies. This weak emission, however, may be a result of our underestimation of the coupling between the gas and radiation in the shock interaction. Therefore, though our results suggest that the observed early light curves of SNeIa cannot rule out a binary system with a short separation as the progenitor system, more elaborate numerical studies will be needed to reach a fair conclusion. Alternatively, our results indicate that the feature observed in the early phase of a recent type Ia SN2014J might result from interaction of the ejecta with a red giant companion star. We also discuss the dependence of spectral features of H$\alpha$ and Siii absorption lines on viewing angles and investigate whether they can constrain the event rate of the SD progenitor.},

abstract = {We use the Gaia EDR3 to explore the Galactic supernova remnant SNR G272.2-3.2, produced by the explosion of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), about 7,500 years ago, to search for a surviving companion. From the abundances in the SNR ejecta, G272.2-3.2 is a normal SNIa. The Gaia parallaxes allow to select the stars located within the estimated distance range of the SNR, and the Gaia proper motions to study their kinematics. From the Gaia EDR3 photometry, we construct the HR diagram of the selected sample, which we compare with the theoretical predictions for the evolution of possible star companions of SNIa. We can discard several proposed types of companions by combining kinematics and photometry. We focus our study on the kinematically most peculiar star, Gaia EDR3 5323900215411075328 (hereafter MV-G272), is a very clear outlier in the motion along the Galactic plane, both as compared with the sample and with the Besan{\c{c}}on model of the Galaxy. Its trajectory on the sky locates it at the center of the SNR, 6,000-8,000 years ago, which constitutes a unique characteristic among the 3,082 stars in the sample. Spectra have been obtained allowing a stellar parameters determination and a chemical abundance analysis. The star now appears as an M1-M2 dwarf. Its 2 chemistry is consistent with that of a M dwarf companion, where a deep convective envelope could have diluted the material captured from the SN ejecta. We have also explored a wide area around the SNR, looking for a possible hyperve-locity star ejected by the SN explosion. None has been found. In conclusion, we have a candidate to be the surviving companion of the SNIa that resulted in SNR G272.2-3.2. It is supported by all its kinematical characteristics and by its trajectory within the SNR. This opens the possibility of a single-degenerate (SD) scenario for a SNIa with a M-type dwarf companion.},

abstract = {Cosmological analyses with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) often assume a single empirical relation between color and luminosity ($\beta$) and do not account for varying host-galaxy dust properties. However, from studies of dust in large samples of galaxies, it is known that dust attenuation can vary significantly. Here we take advantage of state-of-the-art modeling of galaxy properties to characterize dust parameters (dust attenuation A V , and a parameter describing the dust law slope R V) for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SN Ia host galaxies using the publicly available BAGPIPES code. Utilizing optical and infrared data of the hosts alone, we find three key aspects of host dust that impact SN Ia cosmology: 1) there exists a large range (∼ 1 − 6) of host R V 2) high stellar mass hosts have R V on average ∼ 0.7 lower than that of low-mass hosts 3) there is a significant (> 3$\sigma$) correlation between the Hubble diagram residuals of red SNe Ia that when corrected for reduces scatter by ∼ 13% and the significance of the "mass step" to ∼ 1$\sigma$. These represent independent confirmations of recent predictions based on dust that attempted to explain the puzzling "mass step" and intrinsic scatter ($\sigma$ int) in SN Ia analyses. We also find that red-sequence galaxies have both lower and more peaked dust law slope distributions on average in comparison to non red-sequence galaxies. We find that the SN Ia $\beta$ and $\sigma$ int both differ by > 3$\sigma$ when determined separately for red-sequence galaxy and all other galaxy hosts. The agreement between fitted host-R V and SN Ia $\beta$ & $\sigma$ int suggests that host dust properties play a major role in SN Ia color-luminosity standardization and supports the claim that SN Ia intrinsic scatter is driven by R V variation.},

abstract = {We use stacked spectra of the host galaxies of photometrically identified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to search for correlations between Hubble diagram residuals and the spectral properties of the host galaxies. Utilising full spectrum fitting techniques on stacked spectra binned by Hubble residual, we find no evidence for trends between Hubble residuals and properties of the host galaxies that rely on spectral absorption features (< 1.3$\sigma$), such as stellar population age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio. However, we find significant trends between the Hubble residuals and the strengths of [OII] (4.4$\sigma$) and the Balmer emission lines (3$\sigma$). These trends are weaker than the well known trend between Hubble residuals and host galaxy stellar mass (7.2$\sigma$) that is derived from broad band photometry. After light curve corrections, we see fainter SNe Ia residing in galaxies with larger line strengths. We also find a trend (3$\sigma$) between Hubble residual and the Balmer decrement (a measure of reddening by dust) using H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$. The trend is only present in the redder SNe Ia, suggesting that bluer SNe Ia are relatively unaffected by dust in the interstellar medium of the host and that dust contributes to current Hubble diagram scatter impacting the measurement of cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical for several decades. However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in $J$ and/or $H$ band, plus good $gr$-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in $J$ ($J_{max}$) and $H$ ($H_{max}$) bands. The use of a single NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of $\sim0.05$ mag for epochs around the time of $B$-band peak magnitude ($T_{max}$). We also tested the effect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of $T_{max}$ and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained the introduced scatter of each to $<0.02$ mag in $J_{max}$ and $<0.01$ in $H_{max}$. However, these effects are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe ($z\lesssim0.1$). The effect of S/N in the NIR was tested as well. For SNe Ia at $0.08<z\lesssim0.1$, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a minimum ($\lesssim0.05$ mag). These results provide confidence for our FLOWS project that aims in using SNe Ia with public ZTF optical light curves and few NIR epochs to map out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will allow us to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own supercluster, Laniakea, and test the standard cosmological model by measuring the growth rate of structures, parameterised by $fD$, and the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant, $H_0$.},

abstract = {We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in Chandrasekhar mass models for Type Ia Supernovae(SNe Ia) to obtain new constraints on the rate of matter accretion onto the progenitor white dwarf and on the ignition density of central carbon deflagration. The calculated abundance of the Fe-group neutron-rich nuclei is highly sensitive to the electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields obtained from a slow central deflagration, and from a fast deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. We found that (1) to avoid too large ratios of $^{54}$Cr/$^{56}$Fe and $^{50}$Ti/$^{56}$Fe, the ignition density should be as low as \ltsim 2 \e9 \gmc, and that (2) to avoid the overproduction of $^{58}$Ni and $^{54}$Fe, either the flame speed should not exceed a few % of the sound speed in the central low $Y_e$ layers, or the progenitor star has to be metal-poor compared with solar. Such low central densities can be realized by a rapid accretion as fast as $\dot M$ \gtsim 1 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In order to reproduce the solar abundance of $^{48}$Ca, one also needs progenitor systems that undergo ignition at higher densities. We also found that the total amount of $^{56}$Ni, the Si-Ca/Fe ratio, and the abundance of elements like Mn and Cr (incomplete Si-burning ashes), depend on the density of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed detonations. Our nucleosynthesis results favor transition densities slightly below 2.2$\times 10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$.},

abstract = {We report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2012ht from $-15.8$ days to $+49.1$ days after $B$-band maximum. The decline rate of the light curve is $\Delta m_{15}$($B$)$=1.39\sim\pm\sim0.05$ mag, which is intermediate between normal and subluminous SNe Ia, and similar to that of the `transitional' Type Ia SN 2004eo. The spectral line profiles also closely resemble those of SN 2004eo. We were able to observe SN 2012ht at very early phase, when it was still rising and was about three magnitudes fainter than at the peak. The rise time to the $B$-band maximum is estimated to be $17.6 \pm 0.5$ days and the time of the explosion is MJD $56277.98 \pm 0.13$. SN 2012ht is the first transitional SN Ia whose rise time is directly measured without using light curve templates, and the fifth SN Ia overall. This rise time is consistent with those of the other four SNe within the measurement error, even including the extremely early detection of SN 2013dy. The rising part of the light curve can be fitted by a quadratic function, and shows no sign of a shock-heating component due to the interaction of the ejecta with a companion star. The rise time is significantly longer than that inferred for subluminous SNe such as SN 1991bg, which suggests that a progenitor and/or explosion mechanism of transitional SNe Ia are more similar to normal SNe Ia rather than subluminous SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Extensive optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2012fr are presented in this paper. It has a relatively high luminosity, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of about -19.5 mag and a smaller post-maximum decline rate than normal SNe Ia (e.g., $\Delta$m 15(B) =0.85 ± 0.05 mag). Based on the UV and optical light curves, we derived that a 56Ni mass of about 0.88 M⊙ was synthesized in the explosion. The earlier spectra are characterized by noticeable high-velocity features of Si II $\lambda$6355 and Ca II with velocities in the range of ∼22, 000-25, 000 km s-1. At around the maximum light, these spectral features are dominated by the photospheric components which are noticeably narrower than normal SNe Ia. The post-maximum velocity of the photosphere remains almost constant at ∼12,000 km s -1 for about one month, reminiscent of the behavior of some luminous SNe Ia like SN 1991T. We propose that SN 2012fr may represent a subset of the SN 1991T-like SNe Ia viewed in a direction with a clumpy or shell-like structure of ejecta, in terms of a significant level of polarization reported in Maund et al. in 2013. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the possibility that isolated carbon-oxygen-WDs (white dwarfs) with mass smaller than the Chandrasekhar limit may undergo nuclear runaway and supernova (SNa) explosion, triggered by the energy produced by underbarrier pycnonuclear reactions between carbon and light elements. Such reactions would be due to left over impurities of the light elements, which would remain inactive until the WDs transit from the liquid to the solid state. We devise a simple formulation for the Coulombian potential and the local density in an ionic lattice affected by impurities and introduce it in the known rates of pycnonuclear reactions for multicomponent plasmas. Our semi-analytical results indicate that the energy generated by these pycnonuclear reactions exceeds the WD luminosity and provides enough energy to elementary cells of matter to balance the energy cost for C-ignition at much younger ages than the age of the Universe, even for WDs with masses as low as 0.85 M. A thermonuclear runaway may thus be triggered in isolated WDs. The explosion would occur from few hundred thousand to a few million years after the WD formation in the mass interval 0.85-1.2 M .},

abstract = {Machine learning has become widely used in astronomy. Gaussian Process (GP) regression in particular has been employed a number of times to fit or re-sample supernova (SN) light-curves, however by their nature typical GP models are not suited to fit SN photometric data and they will be prone to over-fitting. Recently GP re-sampling was used in the context of studying the morphologies of type II and IIb SNe and they were found to be clearly distinct with respect to four parameters: the rise time (t$_{\rm rise}$), the magnitude difference between 40 and 30 days post explosion ($\Delta m_{\rm 40-30}$), and the earliest maxima of the first and second derivative of the light curve (dm1 and dm2). Here we take a close look at Gaussian process regression and its limitations in the context of SNe light-curves in general, and we also discuss the uncertainties on these specific parameters, finding that dm1 and dm2 cannot give reliable astrophysical information. We do reproduce the clustering in t$_{\rm rise}$--$\Delta m_{\rm 40-30}$ space although it is not as clear cut as previously presented. The best strategy to accurately populate the t$_{\rm rise}$-- $\Delta m_{\rm 40-30}$ space will be to use an expanded sample of high quality light-curves (such as those in the ATLAS transient survey) and analytical fitting methods. Finally, using the BPASS fiducial models, we predict that future photometric studies will reveal clear clustering of the type IIb and II light curve morphologies with a distinct continuum of transitional events.},

In this paper, we study the effects of the underlying mean function and the hyperparameter selection on the reconstruction of the distance moduli from type Ia supernovae. We show that the choice of an arbitrary mean function affects the reconstruction: a zero mean function leads to unphysical distance moduli and the best-fit LCDM to biased reconstructions. We propose to marginalize over a family of mean functions and over the hyperparameters to effectively remove their impact on the reconstructions. We further explore the validity and consistency of the results considering different kernel functions and show that our method is unbiased.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role as standardizable candles in measurements of the Hubble constant and dark energy. Increasing evidence points towards multiple possible explosion channels as the origin of normal SNe Ia, with possible systematic effects on the determination of cosmological parameters. We present, for the first time, a comprehensive comparison of publicly-available SN Ia model nucleosynthetic data with observations of late-time light curve observations of SN Ia events. These models span a wide range of white dwarf (WD) progenitor masses, metallicities, explosion channels, and numerical methodologies. We focus on the influence of 57 Ni and its isobaric decay product 57 Co in powering the late-time ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±¡ > 1000 d) light curves of SNe Ia. 57 Ni and 57 Co are neutron-rich relative to the more abundant radioisotope 56 Ni, and are consequently a sensitive probe of neutronization at the higher densities of near-Chandrashekhar (near-{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± Ch) progenitor WDs.

abstract = {Cosmological analyses with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) often assume a single empirical relation between color and luminosity ($\beta$) and do not account for varying host-galaxy dust properties. However, from studies of dust in large samples of galaxies, it is known that dust attenuation can vary significantly. Here we take advantage of state-of-the-art modeling of galaxy properties to characterize dust parameters (dust attenuation A V , and a parameter describing the dust law slope R V) for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SN Ia host galaxies using the publicly available BAGPIPES code. Utilizing optical and infrared data of the hosts alone, we find three key aspects of host dust that impact SN Ia cosmology: 1) there exists a large range (∼ 1 − 6) of host R V 2) high stellar mass hosts have R V on average ∼ 0.7 lower than that of low-mass hosts 3) there is a significant (> 3$\sigma$) correlation between the Hubble diagram residuals of red SNe Ia that when corrected for reduces scatter by ∼ 13% and the significance of the "mass step" to ∼ 1$\sigma$. These represent independent confirmations of recent predictions based on dust that attempted to explain the puzzling "mass step" and intrinsic scatter ($\sigma$ int) in SN Ia analyses. We also find that red-sequence galaxies have both lower and more peaked dust law slope distributions on average in comparison to non red-sequence galaxies. We find that the SN Ia $\beta$ and $\sigma$ int both differ by > 3$\sigma$ when determined separately for red-sequence galaxy and all other galaxy hosts. The agreement between fitted host-R V and SN Ia $\beta$ & $\sigma$ int suggests that host dust properties play a major role in SN Ia color-luminosity standardization and supports the claim that SN Ia intrinsic scatter is driven by R V variation.},

abstract = {I study the possibility that within the frame of the core degenerate (CD) scenario for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) the merger process of the core of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and the white dwarf (WD) maintains an envelope mass of ≈ 0.03M ⊙ that causes a later helium shell flash. I estimate the number of pre-explosion helium shell flash events to be less than few per cents of all CD scenario SNe Ia. A helium shell flash while the star moves to the left on the HR diagram as a post-AGB star (late thermal pulse-LTP) or along the WD cooling track (very-LTP) causes the star to expand and become a 'born again' AGB star. Merger remnants exploding while still on the AGB form peculiar SNe Ia or peculiar SNe II (if hydrogen is detected), while an explosion inside an inflated born-again star results in an early flux excess in the light curve of the SN Ia. The fraction of systems that might show an early flux excess due to LTP/VLTP is < few × 10 −4 of all SNe Ia, much below the observed fraction. In the frame of the CD scenario SNe Ia with early flux excess result from SN ejecta collision with planetary nebula fallback gas, or from mixing of 56 Ni to the outer regions of the SN ejecta. Ongoing sky surveys might find about one case per year where LTP/VLTP influences the SN light curve.},

We study the time of the second peak in the J band, t 2 , as an alternative standardization parameter of SNIa peak optical brightness, as measured by the standard SALT2 parameter m B. We use BAHAMAS, a Bayesian hierarchical model for SNIa cosmology, to estimate the residual scatter in the Hubble diagram. We find that in the absence of a colour correction, t 2 is a better standardization parameter compared to stretch: t 2 has a 1$\sigma$ posterior interval for the Hubble residual scatter of $\sigma$ $\mu$ = {0.250, 0.257} mag, compared to $\sigma$ $\mu$ = {0.280, 0.287} mag when stretch (x 1) alone is used. We demonstrate that when employed together with a colour correction, t 2 and stretch lead to similar residual scatter. Using colour, stretch and t 2 jointly as standardization parameters does not result in any further reduction in scatter, suggesting that t 2 carries redundant information with respect to stretch and colour. With a much larger SNIa NIR sample at higher redshift in the future, t 2 could be a useful quantity to perform robustness checks of the standardization procedure.},

abstract = {Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide a better understanding of nearly every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to modern time-domain optical surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric monitoring (on the order of seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum light, using the fast imagers available on the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2 m telescope at Kryoneri Observatory in Greece. We applied differential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and we present reconstructed light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA, Kov{\'{a}}cs et al. 2005, MNRAS, 356, 557). TFA yielded the best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01 and 0.04 mag. We did not detect significant bumps with amplitudes greater than 0.05 mag in any of the SNe targets in the VR-, R-, and I-bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light curve, which ranges between −0.37−0.36 mag day −1 in broadband VR, −0.19−0.31 mag day −1 in R band, and −0.13−0.10 mag day −1 in I band. We used SNe light curve fitting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn to photometrically classify the light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order polynomial fit and SN 2018hhn for the first time. We conclude that optimal aperture photometry in combination with TFA provides the highest-precision light curves for SNe that are relatively well separated from the centers of their host galaxies. This work aims to inspire the use of ground-based, high-cadence and high-precision photometry to study SNe with the purpose of revealing clues and properties of the explosion environment of both core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, the explosion mechanisms, binary star interaction and progenitor channels. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence of hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor stars.},

The decline slope was measured as steeper in the B-band than in the V-band, and to steadily decrease in both bands from 0.15 mag day −1 (night 1) to 0.04 mag day −1 (night 4) in V, and from 0.19 mag day −1 (night 1) to 0.06 mag day −1 (night 4) in B, corresponding to the onset of the secondary maximum. We propose that rapid variability could be due to one or a combination of the following scenarios: the clumpiness of the ejecta, their interaction with circumstellar material, the asymmetry of the explosion, or the mechanism causing the secondary maximum in the near-infrared light curve. We encourage the community to undertake high-cadence monitoring of future, nearby and bright supernovae to investigate the intraday behaviour of their light curves.},

Here, we present photometry and spectroscopy of the SN in the nebular phase. A comparison of the early time data with a sample of SNe Ia shows distinct features, differing from normal SNe Ia at early phases but similar to normal SNe Ia at a few weeks after maximum light (i.e. the transitional phase) and well into the nebular phase. The transparency timescales (t 0) for this sample of SNe Ia range between ∼ 25 and 41 days indicating a diversity in the ejecta masses. t 0 also weakly correlates with the peak bolometric luminosity, consistent with the interpretation that SNe with higher ejecta masses would produce more 56 Ni. Comparing the t 0 and the maximum luminosity, L max distribution of a sample of SNe Ia to predictions from a wide range of explosion models we find an indication that the sub-Chandrasekhar mass models span the range of observed values. However, the bright end of the distribution can be better explained by Chandrasekhar mass delayed detonation models, hinting at multiple progenitor channels to explain the observed bolometric properties of SNe Ia. iPTF16abc appears to be consistent with the predictions from the M ch models.},

There is an apparent asymmetry in the B-band peak, in which the premaximum brightening is relatively fast (similar to that of the normal SN 1994D), but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow (similar to that of the overluminous SN 1991T). The color evolution of SN 2000cx is also peculiar: the (BV) 0 color has a unique plateau phase and the (VR) 0 and (VI) 0 colors are very blue. Although the premaximum spectra of SN 2000cx are similar to those of SN 1991T-like objects (with weak Si ii lines), its overall spectral evolution is quite different. The Si ii lines that emerged near maximum B-band brightness stay strong in SN 2000cx until about 3 weeks past maximum. The change in the excitation stages of iron-peak elements is slow. Both the iron-peak and the intermediate-mass elements are found to be moving at very high expansion velocities in the ejecta of SN 2000cx. We discuss theoretical models for SN 2000cx.

Critical information about the interaction of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is encoded in the early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of SN 2018gv with the ESO Very Large Telescope at −13.6 days relative to the B-band maximum light, or ∼5 days after the estimated explosion-the earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date of any SN Ia. These early observations still show a low continuum polarization (0.2%) and moderate line polarization (0.30%±0.04% for the prominent Si II $\lambda$6355 feature and 0.85%±0.04% for the high-velocity Ca component). The high degree of spherical symmetry implied by the low-line and continuum polarization at this early epoch is consistent with explosion models of delayed detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. The dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first ∼100 days after the maximum light indicate that SN 2018gv is a normal SN Ia with similar spectrophotometric behavior to SN 2011fe.

abstract = {We present space-based ultraviolet/optical photometry and spectroscopy with the Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), respectively, along with ground-based optical photometry and spectroscopy and near-infrared spectroscopy of supernova SN2017erp. The optical light curves and spectra are consistent with a normal SN Ia. Compared to previous photometric samples in the near-ultraviolet (NUV), SN2017erp has UV colors that are redder than NUV-blue SNe Ia corrected to similar optical colors. The chromatic difference between SNe 2011fe and 2017erp is dominated by the intrinsic differences in the UV rather than the expected dust reddening. This chromatic difference is similar to the SALT2 color law, derived from rest-frame ultraviolet photometry of higher redshift SNe Ia. Differentiating between intrinsic UV diversity and dust reddening can have important consequences for determining cosmological distances with rest-frame ultraviolet photometry. This ultraviolet spectroscopic series is the first from HST of a normal, albeit reddened, NUV-red SN Ia and is important for analyzing SNe Ia with intrinsically redder NUV colors. We show model comparisons suggesting that metallicity could be the physical difference between NUV-blue and NUV-red SNe Ia, with emission peaks from reverse fluorescence near 3000 {\AA}implying a factor of ∼10 higher metallicity in the upper layers of SN2017erp compared to SN2011fe. Metallicity estimates are very model dependent, however, and there are multiple effects in the UV. Further models and UV spectra of SNe Ia are needed to explore the diversity of SNe Ia, which show seemingly independent differences in the near-UV peaks and mid-UV flux levels.},

abstract = {The variation in properties of Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, is caused by different nucleosynthetic outcomes of these explosions, which can be traced from the distribution of abundances in the ejecta. The composition stratification of the spectroscopically normal but rapidly declining SN 2004eo is studied by performing spectrum synthesis of a time-series of spectra obtained before and after maximum, and of one nebular spectrum obtained about eight months later. Early-time spectra indicate that the outer ejecta are dominated by oxygen and silicon, and contain other intermediate-mass elements, implying that the outer part of the star was subject only to partial burning. In the inner part, nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) material dominates, but the production of 56 Ni was limited to ∼0.43 ± 0.05 M ⊙. An innermost zone containing ∼0.25 M ⊙ of stable Fe-group material is also present. The relatively small amount of NSE material synthesized by SN 2004eo explains both the dimness and the rapidly evolving light curve of this supernova.},

abstract = {Early-time radiative signals from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can provide important constraints on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor system. We present observations and analysis of SN 2019np, a nearby SN Ia discovered within 1-2 days after the explosion. Follow-up observations were conducted in optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared bands, covering the phases from $\sim-$16.7 days to $\sim$+367.8 days relative to its $B-$band peak luminosity. The photometric and spectral evolutions of SN 2019np resembles the average behavior of normal SNe Ia. The absolute B-band peak magnitude and the post-peak decline rate are $M_{\rm max}(B)=-19.52 \pm 0.47$mag and $\Delta m_{\rm15}(B) =1.04 \pm 0.04$mag, respectively. No Hydrogen line has been detected in the near-infrared and nebular-phase spectra of SN 2019np. Assuming that the $^{56}$Ni powering the light curve is centrally located, we find that the bolometric light curve of SN 2019np shows a flux excess up to 5.0% in the early phase compared to the radiative diffusion model. Such an extra radiation perhaps suggests the presence of an additional energy source beyond the radioactive decay of central nickel. Comparing the observed color evolution with that predicted by different models such as interactions of SN ejecta with circumstellar matter (CSM)/companion star, a double-detonation explosion from a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD), and surface $^{56}$Ni mixing, the latter one is favored.},

abstract = {A promising progenitor scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) is the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf in a close binary system with another white dwarf. After the primary star explodes, the surviving donor can be spontaneously released as a hypervelocity runaway. One such runaway donor candidate is LP 398-9, whose orbital trajectory traces back ≈105 yr to a known supernova remnant. Here, we report the discovery of carbon-rich circumstellar material around LP 398-9, revealed by a strong infrared excess and analysed with follow-up spectroscopy. The circumstellar material is most plausibly composed of inflated layers from the star itself, mechanically and radioactively heated by the past companion's supernova. We also detect a 15.4 h periodic signal in the UV and optical light curves of LP 398-9, which we interpret as surface rotation. The rotation rate is consistent with theoretical predictions from this supernova mechanism, and the brightness variations could originate from surface inhomogeneity deposited by the supernova itself. Our observations strengthen the case for this double-degenerate SNIa progenitor channel, and motivate the search for more runaway SNIa donors.},

We search for emission signatures of stripped material from a non-degenerate companion in the nebular spectrum and find no evidence for any unbound material. We place an upper limit of <0.006 M e on the amount of stripped/ablated H-rich material that could go undetected in our spectrum, effectively ruling out all hydrogen-rich donor stars. Additionally, we place a more tentative upper limit on He I emission in the observed spectrum of 0.02 M e which also rules out helium star companions. Our deep limits rule out a non-degenerate companion as the explanation for the early-time feature in ASASSN-18bt.},

abstract = {We present nebular phase optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2017cbv. The early light curves of SN$\sim$2017cbv showed a prominent blue bump in the $U$, $B$ and $g$ bands lasting for $\sim$5 d. One interpretation of the early light curve was that the excess blue light was due to shocking of the SN ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star -- a signature of the single degenerate scenario. If this is the correct interpretation, the interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star could result in significant H$\alpha$ (or helium) emission at late times, possibly along with other species, depending on the companion star and its orbital separation. A search for H$\alpha$ emission in our +302 d spectrum yields a nondetection, with a $L_{H\alpha}$$<$8.0$\times$10$^{35}$ erg/s (given an assumed distance of $D$=12.3 Mpc), which we have verified by implanting simulated H$\alpha$ emission into our data. We make a quantitative comparison to models of swept-up material stripped from a nondegenerate companion star, and limit the mass of hydrogen that might remain undetected to $M_{\rm H} < 1 \times 10^{-4}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. A similar analysis of helium star related lines yields a $M_{\rm He} < 5 \times 10^{-4}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. Taken at face value, these results argue against a nondegenerate H or He-rich companion in Roche lobe overflow as the progenitor of SN 2017cbv. Alternatively, there could be weaknesses in the envelope-stripping and radiative transfer models necessary to interpret the strong H and He flux limits.},

abstract = {We study supernova ejecta-companion interactions in a sample of realistic semidetached binary systems representative of Type Ia supernova progenitor binaries in a single-degenerate scenario.

We find that the ejecta hole has a half-opening angle of 40-50 • with the density by a factor of 2-4 lower, in good agreement with the previous studies. Quantitative differences from the past results in the amounts and kinematics of the stripped companion material and levels of contamination of the companion with the ejecta material can be explained by different model assumptions and effects due to numerical diffusion. We analyse and, for the first time, provide simulation-based estimates of the amounts and of the thermal characteristics of the shock-heated material responsible for producing a prompt, soft X-ray emission. Besides the shocked ejecta material, considered in the original model by Kasen, we also account for the stripped, shock-heated envelope material of stellar companions, which we predict partially contributes to the prompt emission. The amount of the energy deposited in the envelope is comparable to the energy stored in the ejecta. The total energy budget available for the prompt emission is by a factor of about 2-4 smaller than originally predicted by Kasen. Although the shocked envelope has a higher characteristic temperature than the shocked ejecta, the temperature estimates of the shocked material are in good agreement with the Kasen's model. The hottest shocked plasma is produced in the subgiant companion case.},

Here we report on the properties of a spectroscopic quadruple (SB4) found within a star cluster: the 2+2 hierarchical system HD 74438. Its membership in the open cluster IC 2391 makes it the youngest (43 My) SB4 discovered so far and among the quadruple systems with the shortest outer orbital period. The eccentricity of the 6 y outer period is 0.46 and the two inner orbits, with periods of 20.5 d and 4.4 d, and eccentricities of 0.36 and 0.15, are not coplanar. Using an innovative combination of ground-based high resolution spectroscopy and Gaia/Hipparcos astrometry, we show that this system is undergoing secular interaction that likely pumped the eccentricity of one of the inner orbits higher than expected for the spectral types of its components. We compute the future evolution of HD 74438 and show that this system is an excellent candidate progenitor of sub-Chandrasekhar SNIa through white dwarf (WD) mergers. Taking into account the contribution of this specific type of SNIa better accounts for the chemical evolution of iron-peak elements in the Galaxy than considering only near Chandrasekhar-mass SNIa.},

We investigate this tension considering the dataset from the Pantheon sample, a collection of 1048 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) with a redshift range $0<z<2.26$. We perform a binned analysis in redshift to study if the $H_0$ tension also occurs in SNe Ia data. Hence, we build equally populated subsamples in three and four bins, and we estimate $H_{0}$ in each bin considering the $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models. We perform a statistical analysis via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for each bin. We observe that $H_0$ evolves with the redshift, using a fit function $H_{0}(z)=\tilde{H}_{0} (1+z)^{-\alpha}$ with two fitting parameters $\alpha$ and $\tilde{H}_{0}$. Our results show a decreasing behavior of $H_0$ with $\alpha\sim 10^{-2}$ and a consistency with no evolution between 1.2 $\sigma$ and 2.0 $\sigma$. Considering the $H_0$ tension, we extrapolate $H_{0}(z)$ until the redshift of the last scattering surface, $z=1100$, obtaining values of $H_0$ consistent in 1 $\sigma$ with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements by Planck. Finally, we discuss possible $f(R)$ modified gravity models to explain a running Hubble constant with the redshift, and we infer the form of the scalar field potential in the dynamically equivalent Jordan frame.},

abstract = {In the single-degenerate scenario of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the interaction between high-speed ejected material and the donor star in a binary system is expected to lead to mass being stripped from the donor. A series of multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of ejecta-donor interaction have been performed in previous studies most of which adopt either a simplified analytical model or the W7 model to represent a normal SN Ia explosion. Whether different explosion mechanisms can significantly affect the results of ejecta-donor interaction is still unclear. In this work, we simulate hydrodynamical ejecta interactions with a main-sequence (MS) donor star in two dimensions for two near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models of SNe Ia, the W7 and N100 models. We find that about 0.30 and 0.37 Msun of hydrogen-rich material are stripped from a 2.5 Msun donor star in a 2 day orbit by the SN Ia explosion in simulations with the W7 deflagration and N100 delayed-detonation explosion model, respectively. The donor star receives a kick of about 74 and 86 km/s, respectively, in each case. The modal velocity, about 500 km/s, of stripped hydrogen-rich material in the N100 model is faster than the W7 model, with modal velocity of about 350km/s, by a factor 1.4. Based on our results, we conclude that the choice of near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion model for normal SNe Ia seems to not significantly alter the ejecta-donor interaction for a given main-sequence donor model, at least in 2D.},

abstract = {We present nebular phase optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2017cbv. The early light curves of SN2017cbv showed a prominent blue bump in the U, B, and g bands lasting for ∼5 days. One interpretation of the early light curve is that the excess blue light is due to shocking of the SN ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star-a signature of the single degenerate scenario. If this is the correct interpretation, the interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star could result in significant H$\alpha$ (or helium) emission at late times, possibly along with other species, depending on the companion star and its orbital separation. A search for H$\alpha$ emission in our +302 d spectrum yields a nondetection, with a L H$\alpha$ <8.0×10 35 erg s −1 (given an assumed distance of D=12.3 Mpc), which we verified by implanting simulated H$\alpha$ emission into our data. We make a quantitative comparison to models of swept-up material stripped from a nondegenerate companion star and limit the mass of hydrogen that might remain undetected to M H <1×10 −4 M e. A similar analysis of helium star related lines yields a M He <5×10 −4 M e. Taken at face value, these results argue against a nondegenerate H-or He-rich companion in Roche lobe overflow as the progenitor of SN 2017cbv. Alternatively, there could be weaknesses in the envelope-stripping and radiative transfer models necessary to interpret the strong H and He flux limits.},

abstract = {Samples of young type Ia supernovae have shown 'early excess' emission in a few cases. Similar excesses are predicted by some explosion and progenitor scenarios and hence can provide important clues regarding the origin of thermonuclear supernovae. They are however, only predicted to last up to the first few days following explosion. It is therefore unclear whether such scenarios are intrinsically rare or if the relatively small sample size simply reflects the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently early detections. To that end, we perform toy simulations covering a range of survey depths and cadences, and investigate the efficiency with which young type Ia supernovae are recovered. As input for our simulations, we use models that broadly cover the range of predicted luminosities. Based on our simulations, we find that in a typical three day cadence survey, only ∼10% of type Ia supernovae would be detected early enough to rule out the presence of an excess. A two day cadence however, should see this increase to ∼15%. We find comparable results from more detailed simulations of the Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. Using the recovery efficiencies from these detailed simulations, we investigate the number of young type Ia supernovae expected to be discovered assuming some fraction of the population come from scenarios producing an excess at early times. Comparing the results of our simulations to observations, we find the intrinsic fraction of type Ia supernovae with early flux excesses is ∼ 28 +13 −11 %.},

abstract = {The detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf (WD) has been proposed as a possible explosion triggering mechanism for SNe Ia. Here, we report ZTF 18aaqeasu (SN 2018byg/ATLAS 18pqq), a peculiar Type I supernova, consistent with being a helium-shell double-detonation. With a rise time of ≈18 days from explosion, the transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of M R ≈−18.2 mag, exhibiting a light curve akin to sub-luminous SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia, albeit with an unusually steep increase in brightness within a week from explosion. Spectra taken near peak light exhibit prominent Si absorption features together with an unusually red color (g − r≈2 mag) arising from nearly complete line blanketing of flux blueward of 5000 {\AA}. This behavior is unlike any previously observed thermonuclear transient. Nebular phase spectra taken at and after ≈30 days from peak light reveal evidence of a thermonuclear detonation event dominated by Fe-group nucleosynthesis. We show that the peculiar properties of ZTF 18aaqeasu are consistent with the detonation of a massive (≈0.15 M ) helium shell on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (≈0.75 M ) WD after including mixing of ≈0.2 M  of material in the outer ejecta. These observations provide evidence of a likely rare class of thermonuclear supernovae arising from detonations of massive helium shells.},

abstract = {We address a phenomenon of a confined circumstellar (CS) dense shell and powerful presupernova emission of SN 2020tlf (type IIP). Modeling the H$\alpha$ line and the circumstellar interaction implies the CS shell radius of ∼10 15 cm and the mass of ∼0.2 M ⊙ lost during ∼6 yr prior to the explosion. Spectra and photometry of the supernova after the explosion do not show apparent signature of the material lost by the presupernova during its powerful luminosity. This material presumably resided in the inner zone of the CS shell. We present a hydrodynamic model of the outcome of a flash with the energy of 5×10 48 erg in the convective nuclear burning zone. The model predicts the ejection of outer layers of the presupernova (∼0.1 M ⊙) and the luminosity of 10 40 erg s −1 during several hundreds days in accord with observations. We propose the Lighthill mechanism of acoustic waves generation by the turbulence of the convective nuclear burning zone to account for the phenomenon of a compact CS shell of supernovae related to the core collapse.},

This bump may be a signature of interaction between the exploding white dwarf and a nondegenerate binary companion, or it may be intrinsic to the white dwarf explosion mechanism. In the case of the former, the short duration of the bump implies a relatively compact main-sequence companion star, although this conclusion is viewing-angle dependent. Our best-fit companion-shocking and double-detonation models both overpredict the UV luminosity during the bump, and existing nickel-shell models do not match the strength and timescale of the bump. We also present nebular spectra of SN 2021aefx, which do not show the hydrogen or helium emission expected from a nondegenerate companion, as well as a radio nondetection that rules out all symbiotic progenitor systems and most accretion disk winds. Our analysis places strong but conflicting constraints on the progenitor of SN 2021aefx; no current model can explain all of our observations.},

abstract = {We report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2012ht from −15.8 days to +49.1 days after B-band maximum. The decline rate of the light curve is $\Delta$m 15 (B) = 1.39 ± 0.05 mag, which is intermediate between normal and subluminous SNe Ia, and similar to that of the "transitional" Type Ia SN 2004eo. The spectral line profiles also closely resemble those of SN 2004eo. We were able to observe SN 2012ht at a very early phase, when it was still rising and was about three magnitudes fainter than at the peak. The rise time to the B-band maximum is estimated to be 17.6 ± 0.5 days and the time of the explosion is MJD 56277.98 ± 0.13. SN 2012ht is the first transitional SN Ia whose rise time is directly measured without using light curve templates, and the fifth SN Ia overall. This rise time is consistent with those of the other four SNe within the measurement error, even including the extremely early detection of SN 2013dy. The rising part of the light curve can be fitted by a quadratic function, and shows no sign of a shock-heating component due to the interaction of the ejecta with a companion star. The rise time is significantly longer than that inferred for subluminous SNe such as SN 1991bg, which suggests that a progenitor and/or explosion mechanism of transitional SNe Ia are more similar to normal SNe Ia rather than to subluminous SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Omega2000 is a prime focus near infrared (NIR) wide-field camera for the 3.5 meter telescope at Calar Alto/Spain. Having a large field of view and an excellent optical quality, the instrument is particularly designed for survey observations. A cryogenic four lens focal reducer delivers a 15.4 x 15.4 arcminute field of view (FOV) with a pixel scale of 0.45"/pixel. The lenses are made of various optical materials, including CaF2 and BaF2 with diameters of up to 150 mm. They must be specially mounted to survive cooling and to follow the tight tolerances (+/- 0.05 mm for lens centricity and +/- 30 arcsec for lens tilt) required by the optical design. For a wide range of observing applications, a filter mechanism can hold up to 17 filters of 3 inch diameter in 3 filter wheels. For exact and reproducible filter positions, a mechanical locking mechanism has been developed which also improves the cool-down performance of the filter wheels and filters. This mechanism allows a minimum distance of about 3 mm between the filter wheels. A Rockwell HAWAII-2 FPA is used to cover the wavelength range from 0.85 {\^{I}}¼m to 2.4 {\^{I}}¼m. Special care has been taken with regard to the thermal coupling of the detector. The thermal connection is made by gold layers on the fanout board and an additional spring-loaded mechanism. A warm mirror baffle system has been developed, in order to minimize the thermal background for K band observations. The camera is a focal reducer only and has no cold pupil stop. },

We discuss these problems in the context of building a wide field imaging camera for the 3.5m telescope at Calar Alto with the new 2K*2K HgCdTe HAWAII-2 focal plane array. Our final design is a prime focus camera with a 15' field-of-view, called Omega 2000. To achieve excellent optical quality over the whole field, we have had to dispense with the reimaging optics and cold Lyot stop. We show that creative baffling schemes, including the use of undersized baffles, can compensate for the lost K band sensitivity. A moving baffle will be employed in Omega 2000 to allow full transmission in the non-thermal J and H bands.},

It studied 50 nearby star-forming galaxies in 5 bands from the near-UV to the I-band, combining new Wide Field Camera 3 observations with archival Advanced Camera for Surveys data. LEGUS was designed to investigate how star formation occurs and develops on both small and large scales, and how it relates to the galactic environments. In this paper we present the photometric catalogs for all the apparently single stars identified in the 50 LEGUS galaxies. Photometric catalogs and mosaicked images for all filters are available for download. We present optical and near-UV color-magnitude diagrams for all the galaxies. For each galaxy we derived the distance from the tip of the red giant branch. We then used the NUV color-magnitude diagrams to identify stars more massive than 14 M e , and compared their number with the number of massive stars expected from the GALEX FUV luminosity. Our analysis shows that the fraction of massive stars forming in star clusters and stellar 1 associations is about constant with the star formation rate. This lack of a relation suggests that the timescale for evaporation of unbound structures is comparable or longer than 10 Myr. At low star formation rates this translates to an excess of mass in clustered environments as compared to model predictions of cluster evolution, suggesting that a significant fraction of stars form in unbound systems.},

abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant (H_0) from 3.3% to 2.4%. Improvements come from new, near-infrared observations of Cepheid variables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe$\sim$Ia, more than doubling the sample of SNe$\sim$Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage the magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe$\sim$Ia at z<0.15. All 19 hosts and the megamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258, more Cepheids and a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs, HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51, 72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc, respectively. Our best estimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258, MW, and LMC, and includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4%. This value is 3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3 neutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data, but reduces to 2.1 sigma relative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO, suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H_0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early Universe in the range of Delta N_eff=0.4-1. We anticipate significant improvements in H_0 from upcoming parallax measurements.},

An additional $\sim$400 galaxies from various other Spitzer surveys are also analysed. CFS complements the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies, that provides photometry for an additional 2352 galaxies, by extending observations to low galactic latitudes (|b| < 30°). Among these galaxies are calibrators, selected in the K band, of the Tully-Fisher relation. The addition of new calibrators demonstrates the robustness of the previously released calibration. Our estimate of the Hubble constant using supernova host galaxies is unchanged, H0 = 75.2 ± 3.3 km s-1 Mpc-1. Distance-derived radial peculiar velocities, for the 1935 galaxies with all the available parameters, will be incorporated into a new data release of the Cosmicflows project. The size of the previous catalogue will be increased by 20 per cent, including spatial regions close to the Zone of Avoidance.},

We analyze the light curves (LCs) using the publicly available LC-fitter SNooPy2 to derive distance and reddening information. The bolometric LCs are fit with a radiation-diffusion Arnett-model to get constraints on the physical parameters of the ejecta: the optical opacity, the ejected mass and the expansion velocity in particular. We also study the pre-maximum (B-V) color evolution by comparing our data with standard delayed detonation and pulsational delayed detonation models, and show that the Ni56 masses of the models that fit the (B-V) colors are consistent with those derived from the bolometric LC fitting. We find similar correlations between the ejecta parameters (e.g. ejecta mass, or Ni56 mass vs decline rate) as published recently by Scalzo et al. (2019).},

As an example of this application, we used the direct Tully-Fisher relation in three (JHK) bands in deriving distances to a large catalogue of 3126 spiral galaxies distributed through the whole sky and sampling the radial velocity range well between 0 and 8000 km s −1.

abstract = {Cosmicflows-2 is a compilation of distances and peculiar velocities for over 8000 galaxies. Numerically the largest contributions come from the luminosity-line width correlation for spirals, the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR), and the related fundamental plane relation for E/S0 systems, but over 1000 distances are contributed by methods that provide more accurate individual distances: Cepheid, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), surface brightness fluctuation, Type Ia supernova, and several miscellaneous but accurate procedures. Our collaboration is making important contributions to two of these inputs: TRGB and TFR. A large body of new distance material is presented. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that all the contributions, both our own and those from the literature, are on the same scale. Overall, the distances are found to be compatible with a Hubble constant H 0 = 74.4 ± 3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1. The great interest going forward with this data set will be with velocity field studies. Cosmicflows-2 is characterized by a great density and high accuracy of distance measures locally, falling to sparse and coarse sampling extending to z = 0.1. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope observations and photometric measurements of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2013aa 1500 days after explosion. At this epoch, the luminosity is primarily dictated by the amounts of radioactive ${}^{57}\textrm{Co}$ and ${}^{55}\textrm{Fe}$, while at earlier epochs, the luminosity depends on the amount of radioactive ${}^{56}\textrm{Co}$. The ratio of odd-numbered to even-numbered isotopes depends significantly on the density of the progenitor white dwarf during the SN explosion, which, in turn, depends on the details of the progenitor system at the time of ignition. From a comprehensive analysis of the entire light curve of SN 2013aa, we measure a $M({}^{57}\textrm{Co})/M({}^{56}\textrm{Co})$ ratio of $0.02^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, which indicates a relatively low central density for the progenitor white dwarf at the time of explosion, consistent with double-degenerate progenitor channels. We estimate $M({}^{56}\textrm{Ni}) = 0.732 \pm 0.151\:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and place an upper limit on the abundance of ${}^{55}\textrm{Fe}$. A recent study reported a possible correlation between $M({}^{57}\textrm{Co})/M({}^{56}\textrm{Co})$ and stretch for four SNe Ia. SN 2013aa, however, does not fit this trend, indicating either SN 2013aa is an extreme outlier or the correlation does not hold up with a larger sample. The $M({}^{57}\textrm{Co})/M({}^{56}\textrm{Co})$ measured for the expanded sample of SNe Ia with photometry at extremely late times has a much larger range than that of explosion models, perhaps limiting conclusions about SN Ia progenitors drawn from extremely late-time photometry.},

abstract = {Extensive optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2012fr are presented in this paper. It has a relatively high luminosity, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of about −19.5 mag and a smaller post-maximum decline rate than normal SNe Ia (e.g., $\Delta$m 15 (B) = 0.85 ± 0.05 mag). Based on the UV and optical light curves, we derived that a 56 Ni mass of about 0.88 M was synthesized in the explosion. The earlier spectra are characterized by noticeable high-velocity features of Si ii $\lambda$6355 and Ca ii with velocities in the range of ∼22,000-25,000 km s −1. At around the maximum light, these spectral features are dominated by the photospheric components which are noticeably narrower than normal SNe Ia. The post-maximum velocity of the photosphere remains almost constant at ∼12,000 km s −1 for about one month, reminiscent of the behavior of some luminous SNe Ia like SN 1991T. We propose that SN 2012fr may represent a subset of the SN 1991T-like SNe Ia viewed in a direction with a clumpy or shell-like structure of ejecta, in terms of a significant level of polarization reported in Maund et al. in 2013.},

We present late-phase observations of the SC SN 2009dc. We find that the optical luminosity a year after maximum is much fainter than that expected from its early luminosity. We attempt to fit the analytic light curve model to the observations using Arnett's rule. The model successfully explains the light curves until 120 days. This suggests that the extremely high luminosity originates from the 56Ni decay. We suggest that the late-phase decline would be caused by dust formation. The existence of strong carbon features in early-phase spectra would support this scenario. We also find a blend of [Ca II] and [Ni II] in its late-phase spectrum. This indicates that the calcium is distributed in the inner layer along with nickel and iron. We conclude that the mixing may occur in the inner parts of the ejecta.

The decline rate of the light curve is $\Delta$m15(B) = 0.65 0.03, which is one of the slowest among SNe Ia. The peak V-band absolute magnitude is estimated to be MV = -19.90 0.15mag if no host extinction is assumed. It reaches MV = -20.19 0.19mag if we assume the host extinction of AV = 0.29mag. SN 2009dc belongs to the most luminous class of SNe Ia, like SNe 2003fg and 2006gz. Our JHKs -band photometry shows that this SN is also one of the most luminous SNe Ia in near-infrared wavelengths. We estimate the ejected 56Ni mass of 1.2 0.3 M⊙ for the no host extinction case (and of 1.6 0.4 M⊙ for the host extinction of AV = 0.29mag). The C II $\lambda$6580 absorption line remains visible until a week after the maximum brightness, in contrast to its early disappearance in SN 2006gz. The line velocity of Si II $\lambda$6355 is about 8000kms-1 around the maximum, being considerably slower than that of SN 2006gz. The velocity of the C II line is similar to or slightly less than that of the Si II line around the maximum. The presence of the carbon line suggests that the thick unburned C+O layer remains after the explosion. Spectropolarimetric observations by Tanaka etal. indicate that the explosion is nearly spherical. These observational facts suggest that SN 2009dc is a super-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.},

The NIR light curves and color evolutions up to 35 days after the B-band maximum provided an excellent match with those of another SC SN 2009dc, providing further support to the nature of SN 2012dn as an SC SN. We found that SN 2012dn exhibited strong excesses in the NIR wavelengths from 30 d after the B-band maximum. The H- and Ks-band light curves exhibited much later maximum dates at 40 and 70 d after the B-band maximum, respectively, compared with those of normal SNe Ia. The H- and Ks-band light curves subtracted by those of SN 2009dc displayed plateaued evolutions, indicating an NIR echo from the surrounding dust. The distance to the inner boundary of the dust shell is limited to 4.8-6.4 × 10-2 pc. No emission lines were found in its early phase spectra, suggesting that the ejecta-circumstellar material interaction could not occur. On the other hand, we found no signature that strongly supports the scenario of dust formation. The mass-loss rate of the pre-explosion system is estimated to be 10-6-10-5 M⊙ yr-1, assuming that the wind velocity of the system is 10-100 km s-1, which suggests that the progenitor of SN 2012dn could be a recurrent nova system. We conclude that the progenitor of this SC SN could be explained by the single-degenerate scenario.},

The relative contributions of these stellar feedback processes are not well understood, particularly on scales greater than a single star forming cloud. We focus predominantly on how they affect the interstellar medium. We re-simulate a 500 pc 2 region from previous work that included photoionization and add supernovae. Over the course of 10 Myr more than 500 supernovae occur in the region. The supernovae remnants cool very quickly in the absence of earlier photoionization, but form much larger and more spherical hot bubbles when photoionization is present. Overall, the photoionization has a significantly greater effect on gas morphology and the sites of star formation. However, the two processes are comparable when looking at their effect on velocity dispersion. When combined, the two feedback processes increase the velocity dispersions by more than the sum of their parts, particularly on scales above 5 pc.},

abstract = {We compare infrared surface brightness fluctuation (IR SBF) distances measured in galaxies that have hosted type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to distances estimated from SNe Ia light curve fits. We show that the properties of SNe Ia found in IR-SBF hosts are very different from those exploding in Cepheid calibrators, therefore, this is a direct test of systematic uncertainties on estimation of the Hubble-LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre constant (H 0) using supernovae. The IR SBF results from Jensen et al. (2021) provide a large and uniformly measured sample of IR SBF distances which we directly compare with distances to 25 SNe Ia host galaxies. We divide the Hubble flow SNe Ia into sub-samples that best match the divergent supernova properties seen in the IR SBF hosts and Cepheid hosts. We further divide the SNe Ia into a sample with light curve widths and host masses that are congruent to those found in the SBF-calibrated hosts. We refit the light curve stretch and color correlations with luminosity, and use these revised parameters to calibrate the Hubble flow SNe Ia with IR SBF calibrators. Relative to the Hubble flow, the average calibrator distance moduli vary by 0.03 mag depending on the SNe Ia subsamples examined and this adds a 1.8% systematic uncertainty to our Hubble-LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre constant estimate. Based on the IR SBF calibrators, H 0 = 74.6 ± 0.9(stat)±2.7(syst) km s −1 Mpc −1 , which is consistent with the Hubble-LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre constant derived from SNe Ia calibrated from Cepheid variables. We conclude that IR SBF provides reliable calibration of SNe Ia with a precision comparable to Cepheid calibrators, and with a significant saving in telescope time.},

abstract = {A millisecond magnetar engine has been widely suggested to exist in gamma-ray burst (GRB) phenomena , in view of its substantial influences on the GRB afterglow emission. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the magnetar engine on the supernova (SN) emission which is associated with long GRBs and, specifically, confront the model with the observational data of SN 2006aj/GRB 060218. SN 2006aj is featured by its remarkable double-peaked ultraviolet-optical (UV-opt) light curves. By fitting these light curves, we demonstrate that the first peak can be well accounted for by the breakout emission of the shock driven by the magnetar wind, while the primary supernova emission is also partly powered by the energy injection from the magnetar. The magnetic field strength of the magnetar is constrained to be ∼ 10 15 G, which is in good agreement with the common results inferred from the afterglow emission of long GRBs. In more detail, it is further suggested that the UV excess in the late emission of the supernova could also be due to the leakage of the non-thermal emission of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN), if some special conditions can be satisfied. The consistency between the model and the SN 2006aj observation indicates that the magnetar engine is likely to be ubiquitous in the GRB phenomena and even further intensify their connection with the phenomena of superluminous supernovae.},

abstract = {The three rung distance ladder, which calibrates Type Ia supernovae through stellar distances linked to geometric measurements, provides the highest precision direct measurement of the Hubble constant. In light of the Hubble tension, it is important to test the individual components of the distance ladder. For this purpose, we report a measurement of the Hubble constant from 35 extragalactic Cepheid hosts measured by the SH0ES team, using their distances and redshifts at cz ≤ 3300 km s −1 , instead of any, more distant Type Ia supernovae, to measure the Hubble flow. The Cepheid distances are calibrated geometrically in the Milky Way, NGC 4258, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Peculiar velocities are a significant source of systematic uncertainty at z ∼ 0.01, and we present a formalism for both mitigating and quantifying their effects, making use of external reconstructions of the density and velocity fields in the nearby universe. We identify a significant source of uncertainty originating from different assumptions about the selection criteria of this sample, whether distance or redshift limited, as it was assembled over three decades. Modeling these assumptions yields central values ranging from H 0 = 71.8 to 77.0 km s −1 Mpc −1. Combining the four best fitting selection models yields H 0 = 73.1 +2.6 −2.3 as a fiducial result, at 2.6$\sigma$ tension with Planck. While Type Ia supernovae are essential for a precise measurement of H 0 , unknown systematics in these supernovae are unlikely to be the source of the Hubble tension.},

abstract = {Cosmological fine-tuning has traditionally been associated with the nar-rowness of the intervals in which the parameters of the physical models must be located to make life possible. A more thorough approach focuses on the probability of the interval, not on its size. Most attempts to measure the probability of the life-permitting interval for a given parameter rely on a Bayesian statistical approach for which the prior distribution of the parameter is uniform. However, the parameters in these models often take values in spaces of infinite size, so that a uniformity assumption is not possible. This is known as the normalization problem. This paper explains a framework to measure tuning that, among others, deals with normalization, assuming that the prior distribution belongs to a class of maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. By analyzing an upper bound of the tuning probability for this class of distributions the method solves the so-called weak anthropic principle, and offer a solution, at least in this context, to the well-known lack of invariance of maxent distributions. The implication of this approach is that, since all mathematical models need parameters, tuning is not only a question of natural science, but also a problem of mathematical modeling. Cosmological tuning is thus a particular instantiation of a more general scenario. Therefore, whenever a mathematical model is used to describe nature, not only in physics but 1 Springer Nature 2021 L A T E X template 2 Size does not matter in all of science, tuning is present. And the question of whether the tuning is fine or coarse for a given parameter-if the interval in which the parameter is located has low or high probability, respectively-depends crucially not only on the interval but also on the assumed class of prior distributions. Novel upper bounds for tuning probabilities are presented.},

abstract = {Type II supernovae (SNe II) show strong hydrogen features in their spectra throughout their whole evolution, while type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) spectra evolve from dominant hydrogen lines at early times to increasingly strong helium features later on. However, it is currently unclear whether the progenitors of these SN types form a continuum in pre-SN hydrogen mass or whether they are physically distinct. SN light-curve morphology directly relates to progenitor and explosion properties such as the amount of hydrogen in the envelope, the pre-SN radius, the explosion energy, and the synthesized mass of radioactive material. In this work, we study the morphology of the optical-wavelength light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe II and hydrogen-poor SNe IIb to test whether an observational continuum exists between the two. Using a sample of 95 SNe (73 SNe II and 22 SNe IIb), we define a range of key observational parameters and present a comparative analysis between both types. We find a lack of events that bridge the observed properties of SNe II and IIb. Light-curve parameters such as rise times and post-maximum decline rates and curvatures clearly separate both SN types and we therefore conclude that there is no continuum, with the two SN types forming two observationally distinct families. In the V band a rise time of 17 d (SNe II lower and SNe IIb higher), and a magnitude difference between 30 and 40 d post-explosion of 0.4 mag (SNe II lower and SNe IIb higher) serve as approximate thresholds to differentiate both types.},

The B -band light curve exhibits a fast postpeak decline with $\Delta$ m 15 ( B ) = 1.86 ± 0.05 mag. All the R - and I / i -band light curves show a weak secondary peak/shoulder feature at about 3 weeks after the peak, like some transitional subclass of SNe Ia, which could result from an incomplete merger of near-infrared (NIR) double peaks. The spectra are characterized by Ti ii and strong Si ii $\lambda$ 5972 absorption features that are usually seen in low-luminosity objects like SN 1999by. The NIR spectrum before maximum light reveals weak carbon absorption features, implying the existence of unburned materials. We compare the observed properties of SN 2012ij with those predicted by the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass and the Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation models and find that both optical and NIR spectral properties can be explained to some extent by these two models. By comparing the secondary maximum features in the I and i bands, we suggest that SN 2012ij is a transitional object linking normal SNe Ia to typical 91bg-like ones. From the published sample of SNe Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project II, we estimate that the fraction of SN 2012ij–like SNe Ia is not lower than ∼2%. },

abstract = {We present late-time near-infrared (NIR) spectral evolution, at 200-400 days, for the Type Ia supernova SN 2005df. The spectra show numerous strong emission features of [Co ii], [Co iii], and [Fe ii] throughout the 0.8-1.8 $\mu$m region. As the spectrum ages, the cobalt features fade as would be expected from the decay of 56Co to 56Fe. We show that the strong and isolated [Fe ii] emission line at provides a unique tool to analyze NIR spectra of SNe Ia. Normalization of spectra to this line allows the separation of features produced by stable versus unstable isotopes of iron group elements. We develop a new method of determining the initial central density, , and the magnetic field, B, of the white dwarf (WD) using the width of the line. The line width (LW) is sensitive because of electron capture in the early stages of burning, which increases as a function of density. The sensitivity of the LW to B increases with time, and the effects of the magnetic field shift toward later times with decreasing . Through comparison with spherical models, the initial central density for SN 2005df is measured as , which corresponds to a WD close to the Chandrasekhar mass, with and systematic error less than . This error estimate is based on spherical models. We discuss the potential uncertainties due to multi-dimensional effects, mixing, and rotation. The latter two effects would increase the estimate of the WD mass. Within explosions, however, the central density found for SN 2005df is very low for a H-accretor, possibly suggesting a helium star companion or a tidally disrupted WD companion. As an alternative, we suggest mixing of the central region. We find some support for high initial magnetic fields of strength for SN 2005df, however, cannot be ruled out because of noise in the spectra combined with low . We discuss our findings in the context of mixing by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities during deflagration burning and a wide variety of explosion scenarios. Observations strongly support a very limited amount of mixing during a deflagration phase and high central densities characteristic of a WD.},

abstract = {The observed diversity in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) – the thermonuclear explosions of carbon–oxygen white dwarf stars used as cosmological standard candles – is currently met with a variety of explosion models and progenitor scenarios. To help improve our understanding of whether and how often different models contribute to the occurrence of SNe Ia and their assorted properties, we present a comprehensive analysis of seven nearby SNe Ia. We obtained one to two epochs of optical spectra with Gemini Observatory during the nebular phase (>200 d past peak) for each of these events, all of which had time series of photometry and spectroscopy at early times (the first ∼8 weeks after explosion). We use the combination of early- and late-time observations to assess the predictions of various models for the explosion (e.g. double-detonation, off-centre detonation, stellar collisions), progenitor star (e.g. ejecta mass, metallicity), and binary companion (e.g. another white dwarf or a non-degenerate star). Overall, we find general consistency in our observations with spherically symmetric models for SN Ia explosions, and with scenarios in which the binary companion is another degenerate star. We also present an in-depth analysis of SN 2017fzw, a member of the subgroup of SNe Ia which appear to be transitional between the subluminous ‘91bg-like' events and normal SNe Ia, and for which nebular-phase spectra are rare.},

The early $B-V$ colors of such a sample tends to show a continuous distribution. For objects with normal ejecta velocity (NV), the C$\sim$II $\lambda$6580 feature is always visible in the early spectra while it is absent or very weak in the high-velocity (HV) counterpart. Moreover, the velocities of the detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Ca$\sim$II NIR triplet (CaIR3) above the photosphere are found to be much higher in HV objects than in NV objects, with typical values exceeding 30,000 km$\sim$s$^{-1}$ at 2 $-$ 3 days. We further analyze the relation between %velocities of Si$\sim$II$\sim$$\lambda$6355 at maximum, $v_{\rm Si,max}$, the velocity shift of late-time [Fe$\sim$II] lines ($v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$) and host galaxy mass. We find that all HV objects have redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ while NV objects have both blue- and redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$. It is interesting to point out that the objects with redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ are all located in massive galaxies, implying that HV and a portion of NV objects may have similar progenitor metallicities and explosion mechanisms. We propose that, with a geometric/projected effect, the He-detonation model may account for the similarity in birthplace environment and the differences seen in some SNe Ia, including $B-V$ colors, C$\sim$II feature, CaIR3 HVFs at early time and $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ in the nebular phase. Nevertheless, some features predicted by He-detonation simulation, such as the rapidly decreasing light curve, deviate from the observations, and some NV objects with blueshifted nebular $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ may involve other explosion mechanisms.},

We conclude that the majority (85 per cent) of normal SNe Ia have a Ni/Fe abundance that is in agreement with predictions of sub-MCh explosion simulations of ∼Z⊙ progenitors.

We show that the dust extinction of the objects where the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 {\AA} is detected is consistent with the visual extinction derived from the supernova colors. This strongly suggests that the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in the interstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar material associated with the progenitor system. One quarter of the supernovae display anomalously large Na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their colors. Remarkably, all of the cases of unusually strong Na i D absorption correspond to "Blueshifted" profiles in the classification scheme of Sternberg et al. This coincidence suggests that outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the cases of anomalously large Na i column densities. Two supernovae with unusually strong Na i D absorption showed essentially normal K i column densities for the dust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be a universal characteristic. Overall, we find the most accurate predictor of individual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 {\AA}, and provide an empirical relation for its use. Finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the Na abundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate and double-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.},

abstract = {Timmes et al. found that metallicity variations could theoretically account for a 25% variation in the mass of 56 Ni synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter in observed SN Ia luminosities. Higher-metallicity progenitors are more neutron rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive 56 Ni. We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56 Ni yield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova Legacy Survey. We find that the average 56 Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from high-metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%-10% of the dispersion in SN Ia 56 Ni mass, and thus luminosity. This is because the effect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we find that SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar metallicities. We also show that allowing for changes in O/Fe with the metallicity [Fe/H] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction of Timmes et al., so long as one is using the O/H as the independent variable. Age may have a greater effect than metallicity-we find that the luminosity-weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56 Ni yield, and thus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. This is hard to understand if most SNe Ia explode when the primaries reach the Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we test the findings of Gallagher et al. that the residuals of SNe Ia from the Hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxy metallicity, and we find no such correlation.},

SN 2012ec is unique among hydrogen-rich SNe in showing a distinct line of stable nickel [Ni II] $\lambda$7378. This line is produced by 58 Ni, a nuclear burning ash whose abundance is a sensitive tracer of explosive burning conditions. Using spectral synthesis modelling, we use the relative strengths of [Ni II] $\lambda$7378 and [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 (the progenitor of which is 56 Ni) to derive a Ni/Fe production ratio of 0.20 ± 0.07 (by mass), which is a factor 3.4 ± 1.2 times the solar value. High production of stable nickel is confirmed by a strong [Ni II] 1.939 µm line. This is the third reported case of a core-collapse SN producing a Ni/Fe ratio far above the solar value, which has implications for core-collapse explosion theory and galactic chemical evolution models.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) come in a large range of luminosities, as determined mostly by the amount of 56 Ni produced in the explosion. Nevertheless, they can be normalized and used as standard candles, which suggests that they share a similar origin. The thermonuclear explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass (M Ch) white dwarf accreting mass from a main sequence or red giant companion (the single degenerate scenario) is a favourite configuration, but the presence of SNe Ia that result from the merging of two white dwarfs of total mass exceeding M Ch is supported by rate studies. SNe of the spectroscopically peculiar 1991bg class are the least luminous SNe Ia. They produce ∼0.1 M of 56 Ni, which is difficult to reconcile with hydrodynamic explosion models. Here, the properties of the inner ejecta of SN 1991bg are investigated by means of synthetic nebular spectroscopy. In order to reproduce the transformation of the spectra from broader, [Fe II]+[Fe III] lines at day ∼120 to narrow, [Fe III] lines at day 210, the innermost region must deviate significantly in density from the prediction of M Ch models. In particular, a substantially lower density is required in the innermost ≈3000 km s −1 in order to provide the needed increase of ionization with time. This leads to a mass deficit of ∼0.15 M in the region inside ≈3000 km s −1 with respect to M Ch models, and points to a different type of explosion. Early-time studies require a low explosion kinetic energy and lack of burning products in the outer layers. When combined with the results from this paper, the merger scenario may be a viable candidate for 1991bg-like SNe.},

To better understand the physical processes behind this increased uniformity, we have studied the Y, J and H-filter light curves of 91 SNe Ia from the literature. We show that the phases and luminosities of the first maximum in the NIR light curves are extremely uniform for our sample. The phase of the second maximum, the late-phase NIR luminosity and the optical light-curve shape are found to be strongly correlated, in particular more luminous SNe Ia reach the second maximum in the NIR filters at a later phase compared to fainter objects. We also find a strong correlation between the phase of the second maximum and the epoch at which the SN enters the Lira law phase in its optical colour curve (epochs ∼ 15 to 30 d after B-band maximum). The decline rate after the second maximum is very uniform in all NIR filters. We suggest that these observational parameters are linked to the nickel and iron mass in the explosion, providing evidence that the amount of nickel synthesized in the explosion is the dominating factor shaping the optical and NIR appearance of SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Brighter Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have broader, more slowly declining B-band light curves than dimmer SNe Ia. We study the physical origin of this width-luminosity relation (WLR) using detailed radiative transfer calculations of Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia models. We find that the luminosity dependence of the diffusion time (emphasized in previous studies) is in fact of secondary relevance in understanding the model WLR. Instead, the essential physics involves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of SNe Ia. Following maximum-light, the SN colors are increasingly affected by the development of numerous Fe II/Co II lines which blanket the B-band and, at the same time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. Because dimmer SNe Ia are generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of Fe III to Fe II recombination in the iron-group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a more rapid evolution of the SN colors to the red. The faster B-band decline rate of dimmer SNe Ia thus reflects their faster ionization evolution.},

abstract = {Type II supernovae (SNe II) show strong hydrogen features in their spectra throughout their whole evolution, while type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) spectra evolve from dominant hydrogen lines at early times to increasingly strong helium features later on. However, it is currently unclear whether the progenitors of these SN types form a continuum in pre-SN hydrogen mass or whether they are physically distinct. SN light-curve morphology directly relates to progenitor and explosion properties such as the amount of hydrogen in the envelope, the pre-SN radius, the explosion energy, and the synthesized mass of radioactive material. In this work, we study the morphology of the optical-wavelength light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe II and hydrogen-poor SNe IIb to test whether an observational continuum exists between the two. Using a sample of 95 SNe (73 SNe II and 22 SNe IIb), we define a range of key observational parameters and present a comparative analysis between both types. We find a lack of events that bridge the observed properties of SNe II and IIb. Light-curve parameters such as rise times and post-maximum decline rates and curvatures clearly separate both SN types and we therefore conclude that there is no continuum, with the two SN types forming two observationally distinct families. In the V band a rise time of 17 d (SNe II lower and SNe IIb higher), and a magnitude difference between 30 and 40 d post-explosion of 0.4 mag (SNe II lower and SNe IIb higher) serve as approximate thresholds to differentiate both types.},

Properties of the SN local environment are characterized by means of single stellar population synthesis applied to IFS observations taken two years after the SN exploded. SN 2016hnk spectra are compared to other 1991bg-like SNe Ia, 2002es-like SNe Ia, and Ca-rich transients. In addition, abundance stratification modelling is used to identify the various spectral features in the early phase spectral sequence and the dataset is also compared to a modified non-LTE model previously produced for the sublumnious SN 1999by. SN 2016hnk is consistent with being a sub-luminous (M$_{\rm B}=-16.7$ mag, s$_{\rm BV}$=0.43$\pm$0.03), highly reddened object. IFS of its host galaxy reveals both a significant amount of dust at the SN location, as well as residual star formation and a high proportion of old stellar populations in the local environment compared to other locations in the galaxy, which favours an old progenitor for SN 2016hnk. Inspection of a nebular spectrum obtained one year after maximum contains two narrow emission lines attributed to the forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet with a Doppler shift of 700 km s$^{-1}$. Based on various observational diagnostics, we argue that the progenitor of SN 2016hnk was likely a near Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$) carbon-oxygen white dwarf that produced 0.108 $M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni. Our modeling suggests that the narrow [Ca II] features observed in the nebular spectrum are associated with $^{48}$Ca from electron capture during the explosion, which is expected to occur only in white dwarfs that explode near or at the $M_{\rm Ch}$ limit.},

abstract = {The nebular spectra of Type Ia supernovae ($\gtrapprox$ 100 days after explosion) consist mainly of emission lines from singly- and doubly-ionised Fe-group nuclei. However, theoretical models for many scenarios predict that non-thermal ionisation leads to multiply-ionised species whose recombination photons ionise and deplete Fe$^{+}$ , resulting in negligible [Fe II] emission. We investigate a method to determine the collisional excitation conditions from [Fe II] line ratios independently from the ionisation state and find that it cannot be applied to highly-ionised models due to the influence of recombination cascades on Fe$^{+}$ level populations. When the ionisation state is artificially lowered, the line ratios (and excitation conditions) are too similar to distinguish between explosion scenarios. We investigate changes to the treatment of non-thermal energy deposition as a way to reconcile over-ionised theoretical models with observations and find that a simple work function approximation provides closer agreement with the data for sub-Mch models than a detailed Spencer-Fano treatment with widely-used cross section data. To quantify the magnitude of additional heating processes that would be required to sufficiently reduce ionisation from fast leptons, we artificially boost the rate of energy loss to free electrons. We find that the equivalent of as much as an eight times increase to the plasma loss rate would be needed to reconcile the sub-Mch model with observed spectra. Future studies could distinguish between reductions in the non-thermal ionisation rates and increased recombination rates, such as by clumping.},

abstract = {The observed diversity in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) – the thermonuclear explosions of carbon–oxygen white dwarf stars used as cosmological standard candles – is currently met with a variety of explosion models and progenitor scenarios. To help improve our understanding of whether and how often different models contribute to the occurrence of SNe Ia and their assorted properties, we present a comprehensive analysis of seven nearby SNe Ia. We obtained one to two epochs of optical spectra with Gemini Observatory during the nebular phase (>200 d past peak) for each of these events, all of which had time series of photometry and spectroscopy at early times (the first ∼8 weeks after explosion). We use the combination of early- and late-time observations to assess the predictions of various models for the explosion (e.g. double-detonation, off-centre detonation, stellar collisions), progenitor star (e.g. ejecta mass, metallicity), and binary companion (e.g. another white dwarf or a non-degenerate star). Overall, we find general consistency in our observations with spherically symmetric models for SN Ia explosions, and with scenarios in which the binary companion is another degenerate star. We also present an in-depth analysis of SN 2017fzw, a member of the subgroup of SNe Ia which appear to be transitional between the subluminous ‘91bg-like' events and normal SNe Ia, and for which nebular-phase spectra are rare.},

abstract = {The photometric and spectroscopic data presented in Paper I are used, together with spectrum synthesis models and energetics considerations, to derive the properties of the peculiar type la supernova (SN) 1991bg. The analysis of the light curve shows that SN 1991bg was a subluminous SN Ia. Spectrum synthesis during the photospheric epoch independently confirms that this SN was intrinsically cool and faint. The red colour and the presence of a Ti II feature near 4000 {\AA} at early times are consequences of the low temperature. The possibility that SN 1991bg was a highly reddened but otherwise normal SN la is ruled out since model spectra are then too hot to reproduce the observed spectral features. The Fe-group elements were underabundant in the outer part of the ejecta, indicating that a large fraction of the mass of the progenitor was unburned. The observed behaviour of the O I 7774-{\AA} line, which does not evolve to lower velocities with time, suggests that an outer oxygen shell, containing unburned material from the progenitor, is observed directly for the first time in an SN Ia. The outer location of oxygen also rules out an He-shell white dwarf as a progenitor of SN 1991bg. The width of the nebular lines (the narrowest ever observed in SNe Ia) and the profile of the [Co III] 5890-{\AA} line, together with the light curve, imply that the mass of synthesized 56Ni was small (∼0.07 M⊙), the Ni distribution was centrally peaked, and the total ejecta mass was also small (0.4-1.0 M⊙). Models for the nebular spectra were also computed. They are consistent with a small mass of Fe-peak material and with its confinement to low velocities. A similarly low value for the Ni mass (0.07 Ṁ) was obtained from spectrum synthesis, by summing the Ni mass derived from the photospheric epoch models for the outer part and from the nebular models for the inner part. It appears that not all SNe la are the result of the explosion and complete disruption of white dwarfs at the Chandrasekhar mass limit. {\textcopyright} 1997 RAS.},

The broad--band light curves in the early months have a narrower peak and a luminosity decline faster than other SNIa while the R and I light curves do not show the secondary peak. The SN is intrinsically very red (\bv$_{max}=0.74$) and faint ($B_{max}=-16.54$). The $uvoir$ bolometric light curve of SN$\sim$1991bg is fainter with a steeper decline than that of the normal SNIa (e.g. 1992A). This object enhances the correlation which exists between the peak luminosity of SNIa, the decline rate and the kinetic energy. Although a number of spectral peculiarities are present the spectral evolution retains a general resemblance to that of other SNIa until the latest available observation (day 203). This work suggests that the explosion energy was probably a factor 3 to 5 lower than in normal SNIa.},

abstract = {The current Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder measurement of H 0 is reported to be in tension with the values inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), assuming standard model cosmology. However, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) reports an estimate of H 0 in better agreement with the CMB. Hence, it is critical to reduce systematic uncertainties in local measurements to understand the origin of the Hubble tension. In this paper, we propose a uniform distance ladder, combining SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with a TRGB calibration of their absolute luminosity. A large, volume-limited, sample of both calibrator and Hubble flow SNe Ia from the same survey minimizes two of the largest sources of systematics: host-galaxy bias and non-uniform photometric calibration. We present results from a pilot study using existing TRGB distance to the host galaxy of ZTF SN Ia SN 2021rhu (aka ZTF21abiuvdk). Combining the ZTF calibrator with a volume-limited sample from the first data release of ZTF Hubble flow SNe Ia, we infer H 0 = 76.94 ± 6.4 km s −1 Mpc −1 , an 8.3% measurement. The error budget is dominated by the single object calibrating the SN Ia luminosity in this pilot study. However, the ZTF sample includes already five other SNe Ia within ∼ 20 Mpc for which TRGB distances can be obtained with HST. Finally, we present the prospects of building this distance ladder out to 80 Mpc with JWST observations of more than one hundred SNe Ia.},

We are given a unique opportunity to see what an exploded star looks like inside. The line profiles and luminosities encode information about physical conditions, explosive and hydrostatic nucleosynthesis, and ejecta morphology, which link to the progenitor properties and the explosion mechanism. Here, the fundamental properties of spectral formation of supernovae in the nebular phase are reviewed. The formalism between ejecta morphology and line profile shapes is derived, including effects of scattering and absorption. Line luminosity expressions are derived in various physical limits, with examples of applications from the literature. The physical processes at work in the supernova ejecta, including gamma-ray deposition, non-thermal electron degradation, ionization and excitation, and radiative transfer are described and linked to the computation and application of advanced spectral models. Some of the results derived so far from nebular-phase supernova analysis are discussed.},

abstract = {The explosion energy of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is derived from the difference in nuclear binding energy liberated in the explosive fusion of light "fuel" nuclei, predominantly carbon and oxygen, into more tightly bound nuclear "ash" dominated by iron and silicon group elements. The very same explosive thermonuclear fusion event is also one of the major processes contributing to the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements, in particular the iron-group elements. For example, most of the iron and manganese in the Sun and its planetary system was produced in thermonuclear supernovae. Here, we review the physics of explosive thermonuclear burning in carbon-oxygen white dwarf material and the methodolo-gies utilized in calculating predicted nucleosynthesis from hydrodynamic explosion models. While the dominant explosion scenario remains unclear, many aspects of the nuclear combustion and nucleosynthesis are common to all models and must occur in some form in order to produce the observed yields. We summarize the predicted nucleosynthetic yields for existing explosions models, placing particular emphasis on characteristic differences in the nucleosynthetic signatures of the different suggested scenarios leading to Type Ia supernovae. Following this, we discuss how these signatures compare with observations of several individual supernovae, remnants, and the composition of material in our Galaxy and galaxy clusters.},

Many Type II SNe show signs of interaction with cir-cumstellar material (CSM) during the first few days after explosion, implying that their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors experience episodic or eruptive mass loss. However, because it is difficult to discover SNe early, the diversity of CSM configurations in RSGs has not been fully mapped. SN 2021yja, first detected within ≈5.4 hours of explosion, shows some signatures of CSM interaction (high UV lumi-nosity, radio and x-ray emission) but without the narrow emission lines or early light curve peak that can accompany CSM. Here we analyze the densely sampled early light curve and spectral series of this nearby SN to infer the properties of its progenitor and CSM. We find that the most likely progenitor was an RSG with an extended envelope, encompassed by low-density CSM. We also present archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the host galaxy of SN 2021yja, which allows us to place a stringent upper limit of 9 M on the progenitor mass. However, this is in tension with some aspects of the SN evolution, which point to a more massive progenitor. Our analysis highlights the need to consider progenitor structure when making inferences about CSM properties, and that a comprehensive view of CSM tracers should be made to give a fuller view of the last years of RSG evolution.},

We examine the evolution of the [Co III] $\lambda$5893 emission complex during the nebular phase for SNe Ia with multiple nebular spectra and show that the line flux follows the square of the mass of 56Co as a function of time. This result indicates both efficient local energy deposition from positrons produced in 56Co decay and long-term stability of the ionization state of the nebula. We compile SN Ia nebular spectra from the literature and present 21 new late-phase spectra of 7 SNe Ia, including SN 2014J. From these we measure the flux in the [Co III] $\lambda$5893 line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer the initial mass of 56Ni (MNi) produced in the explosion.We then examine 56Ni yields for different SN Ia ejected masses (Mej - calculated using the relation between light-curve width and ejected mass) and find that the 56Ni masses of SNe Ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (low stretch s $\sim$ 0.7-0.9),MNi is clustered near MNi ≈ 0.4 M⊙ and shows a shallow increase as Mej increases from $\sim$1 to 1.4 M⊙; at high stretch, Mej clusters at the Chandrasekhar mass (1.4 M⊙) while MNi spans a broad range from 0.6 to 1.2 M⊙.

We used non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) modelling of the first and second ionisation stages of iron, nickel, and cobalt to fit the spectra using a sampling algorithm allowing us to probe a broad parameter space. We derive velocity shifts, line widths, and abundance ratios for iron and cobalt. The measured line widths and velocity shifts of the singly ionised ions suggest a shared emitting region. Our data are fully compatible with radioactive 56 Ni decay as the origin for cobalt and iron. We compare the measured abundance ratios of iron and cobalt to theoretical predictions of various SN Ia explosion models. These models include, in addition to 56 Ni, different amounts of 57 Ni and stable 54,56 Fe. We can exclude models that produced only 54,56 Fe or only 57 Ni in addition to 56 Ni. If we consider a model that has 56 Ni, 57 Ni, and 54,56 Fe then our data imply that these ratios are 54,56 Fe / 56 Ni = 0.272 ± 0.086 and 57 Ni / 56 Ni = 0.032 ± 0.011.},

It has a very stable brightness between the two epochs and a very blue spectral energy distribution (SED) consistent with {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ ∝ {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ −4.1±0.1 , i.e. the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a hot blackbody with a very high temperature of log({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±/K) > 4.6 and luminosity of log({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°¿/{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°¿) > 7.0. This late-time source is unlikely to be an unrelated object in chance alignment, or due to a light echo of AT2018cow. Other possible scenarios also have some difficulties in explaining this late-time source, including companion star(s), star cluster, the survived progenitor star, interaction with circumstellar medium (CSM), magnetar, or delayed accretion in a tidal disruption event (TDE). Long-term and multi-wavelength monitoring will help to resolve its nature and finally reveal the origin of the "Cow".},

abstract = {Single-degenerate (SD) binary systems composed of a white dwarf and a non-degenerate helium (He)-star companion have been proposed as the potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The He-star companions are expected to survive the SN Ia explosion in this SD progenitor model. In the present work, we map the surviving He-star companion models computed from our previous three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of ejecta-companion interaction into the one-dimensional stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to follow their long-term evolution to make predictions on their post-impact observational properties, which can be helpful for searches of such surviving He-star companions in future observations. By comparing with the very late-epoch light curve of the best observed SN Ia, SN 2011fe, we find that our surviving He-star companions become significantly more luminous than SN 2011fe about 1000 d after the maximum light. This suggests that a He star is very unlikely to be a companion to the progenitor of SN 2011fe.},

abstract = {I use recent observations of circumstellar matter (CSM) around type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to estimate the fraction of SNe Ia that explode into a planetary nebula (PN) and to suggest a new delay time distribution from the common envelope evolution (CEE) to the SN Ia explosion for SNe Ia that occur shortly after the CEE. Under the assumption that the CSM rresults from a CEE, I crudely estimate that about 50 per cent of all SNe Ia are SNe Ia inside PNe (SNIPs), and that the explosions of most SNIPs occur within a CEE to explosion delay (CEED) time of less than about ten thousand years. I also estimate that the explosion rate of SNIPs, i.e., the CEED time distribution (CEEDTD), is roughly constant within this time scale of ten thousand years. The short CEED time suggests than a fraction of SNIPs come from the core-degenerate (CD) scenario where the merger of the core with the white dwarf takes place at the end of the CEE. I present my view that the majority of SNIPs come from the CD scenario. I list some further observations that might support or reject my claims, and the challenge to theoretical studies to find a process to explain a merger to explosion delay (MED) time of up to ten thousand years or so. A long MED will apply also to the double degenerate scenario.},

abstract = {We present the results of a three-dimensional numerical simulation of the evolution of a doubly degenerate binary system in which the primary is a 1.2 M⊙ white dwarf and the Roche lobe filling secondary a 0.9 M⊙ white dwarf. The beginning of our simulation corresponds to the time at which the secondary fills its Roche lobe and mass transfer starts. No attempts have been made to include further loss of angular momentum due to gravitational wave radiation. The hydrodynamical equations were solved with a smooth particle hydrodynamics code using 7000 particles. Since the evolution of the system is determined mostly by angular momentum transport, we first present some tests to demonstrate that no spurious angular momentum transport occurs on a time scale corresponding to the simulation. The results show that in a little more than two orbital periods the secondary is completely destroyed and transformed into a thick disk orbiting about the primary. Since only a very small fraction of the mass (0.0063 M⊙) escapes the system, the evolution of the binary results in the formation of a massive object. This object is, however, not in a state of collapse. We show that it is roughly composed of three parts, the initial white dwarf primary, a very hot pressure-supported spherical envelope, and a rotationally supported outer disk. However, temperatures in the outer parts of the initial primary and in the envelope are very high, in fact, above carbon burning threshold. This suggests that further improvements in the physics included in this model are necessary to draw final conclusions about the structure of the merged object. The evolution of the system can, however, be understood in terms of a simple analytical model where it is shown that the angular momentum carried by the mass during the transfer and stored in the disk is a very important component which cannot be neglected. In fact the amount stored in the disk determines for a large part the evolution of the system.},

abstract = {B-band light-curve rise times for eight unusually well-observed nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fitted by a newly developed template-building algorithm, using light-curve functions that are smooth, flexible, and free of potential bias from externally derived templates and other prior assumptions. From the available literature, photometric BVRI data collected over many months, including the earliest points, are reconciled, combined, and fitted to a unique time of explosion for each SN. On average, after they are corrected for light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18:81 AE 0:36 days, while five SNe rise in 16:64 AE 0:21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a single parent population (a hypothesis not favored by statistical tests), the rms intrinsic scatter of the decline rateYcorrected SN rise time is 0:96 þ0:52 {\`{A}}0:25 days, a first measurement of this dispersion. The corresponding global mean rise time is 17:44 AE 0:39 days, where the uncertainty is dominated by intrinsic variance. This value is %2 days shorter than two published averages that nominally are twice as precise, although also based on small samples. When comparing high-z to low-z SN lumi-nosities for determining cosmological parameters, bias can be introduced by use of a light-curve template with an un-realistic rise time. If the period over which light curves are sampled depends on z in a manner typical of current search and measurement strategies, a 2 day discrepancy in template rise time can bias the luminosity comparison by %0.03 mag.},

abstract = {We present improved photometric measurements for the host galaxies of 206 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae discovered by the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and used in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. For the DES-SN sample, when considering a 5D (z, x1, c, $\alpha$, $\beta$) bias correction, we find evidence of a Hubble residual 'mass step', where SNe Ia in high-mass galaxies (>1010M☉) are intrinsically more luminous (after correction) than their low-mass counterparts by $\gamma$ = 0.040 ± 0.019 mag. This value is larger by 0.031 mag than the value found in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. This difference is due to a combination of updated photometric measurements and improved star formation histories and is not from host-galaxy misidentification. When using a 1D (redshift-only) bias correction the inferred mass step is larger, with $\gamma$ = 0.066 ± 0.020 mag. The 1D−5D $\gamma$ difference for DES-SN is 0.026 ± 0.009 mag. We show that this difference is due to a strong correlation between host galaxy stellar mass and the x1 component of the 5D distance-bias correction. Including an intrinsic correlation between the observed properties of SNe Ia, stretch and colour, and stellar mass in simulated SN Ia samples, we show that a 5D fit recovers $\gamma$ with −9 mmag bias compared to a +2 mmag bias for a 1D fit. This difference can explain part of the discrepancy seen in the data. Improvements in modelling correlations between galaxy properties and SN is necessary to ensure unbiased precision estimates of the dark energy equation of state as we enter the era of LSST.},

Although the Chandrasekhar mass is a natural mass scale for the explosion of white dwarfs as SNe Ia, models allowing SNe Ia to explode at other masses have attracted much recent attention. Using an empirical relation between the ejected mass and the light-curve width, we derive ejected masses Mej and 56Ni masses MNi for a sample of 337 SNe Ia with redshifts z < 0.7 used in recent cosmological analyses. We use hierarchical Bayesian inference to reconstruct the joint Mej-MNi distribution, accounting for measurement errors. The inferred marginal distribution of Mej has a long tail towards sub-Chandrasekhar masses, but cuts off sharply above 1.4 M⊙. Our results imply that 25-50 per cent of normal SNe Ia are inconsistent with Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, with almost all of these being sub-Chandrasekhar mass; super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions make up no more than 1 per cent of all spectroscopically normal SNe Ia. We interpret the SN Ia width-luminosity relation as an underlying relation between Mej and MNi, and show that the inferred relation is not naturally explained by the predictions of any single known explosion mechanism.},

Using simple empirical models, we demonstrate the strong correlation between the risetime (i.e., the time between explosion and maximum), the post-rise light-curve shape, and the peak luminosity. Using a variety of light-curve shape methods, we find the risetime to B maximum for a SN Ia with Delta m15(B)=1.1 mag and peak M_V=-19.45 mag to be 19.5+/-0.2 days. We find that the peak brightness of SNe Ia is correlated with their risetime; SNe Ia which are 0.10 mag brighter at peak in the B-band require 0.80+/-0.05 days longer to reach maximum light. We determine the effects of several possible sources of systematic errors, but none of these significantly impacts the inferred risetime.

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0.},

abstract = {We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light curve shapes (MLCS) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCS and the luminosity is derived from a ``training set'' of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones which are slow and blue. By thirty-five days after maximum the intrinsic color variations become negligable. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes' theorem is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying MLCS to both light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set of twenty SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance accuracy of 5 % for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant on the Cepheid distance scale (Sandage et al 1994, 1996) of H_0=65 \pm 3 (statistical) km/s/Mpc ( \pm 6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 pm 0.0035 mag over the distance interval 32.2 < mu < 38.3 yields the most precise confirmation of the linearity of the Hubble law.},

abstract = {We present a new mechanism for Type Ia supernova explosions in massive white dwarfs. The proposed scenario follows from relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the model and involves a detonation created in an unconfined environment. The explosion begins with an essentially central ignition of stellar material initiating a deflagration. This deflagration results in the formation of a buoyantly-driven bubble of hot material that reaches the stellar surface at supersonic speeds. The bubble breakout forms a strong pressure wave that laterally accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This material, confined by gravity to the white dwarf, races along the stellar surface and is focused at the location opposite to the point of the bubble breakout. These streams of nuclear fuel carry enough mass and energy to trigger a detonation just above the stellar surface. The flow conditions at that moment support a detonation that will incinerate the white dwarf and result in an energetic explosion. The stellar expansion following the deflagration redistributes stellar mass in a way that ensures production of intermediate mass and iron group elements consistent with observations. The ejecta will have a strongly layered structure with a mild amount of asymmetry following from the early deflagration phase. This asymmetry, combined with the amount of stellar expansion determined by details of the evolution (principally the energetics of deflagration, timing of detonation, and structure of the progenitor), can be expected to create a family of mildly diverse Type Ia supernova explosions.},

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

We calculate both Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration models and sub-Chandrasekhar ``helium detonators.'' Gamma-ray deposition is handled in a simple, accurate manner. We have parameterized the storage of energy that arises from the time dependent deposition of radioactive decay energy in a reasonable manner, that spans the expected range. We find that the Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration model W7 of Nomoto etal shows good agreement with the observed spectra of SN 1992A and SN 1994D, particularly in the UV, where our models are expected to be most accurate. The sub-Chandrasekhar models do not reproduce the UV deficit observed in normal SNe Ia. They do bear some resemblance to sub-luminous SNe Ia, but the shape of the spectra (i.e. the colors) are opposite to that of the observed ones and the intermediate mass element lines such as Si II, and Ca II are extremely weak, which seems to be a generic difficulty of the models. Although the sub-Chandrasekhar models have a significant helium abundance (unlike Chandrasekhar-mass models), helium lines are not prominent in the spectra near maximum light and thus do not act as a spectral signature for the progenitor.},

abstract = {The late-time spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powerful probes of the underlying physics of their explosions. We investigate the late-time optical and near-infrared spectra of seven SNe Ia obtained at the VLT with XShooter at > 200 d after explosion. At these epochs, the inner Fe-rich ejecta can be studied. We use a line-fitting analysis to determine the relative line fluxes, velocity shifts, and line widths of prominent features contributing to the spectra ([Fe II], [Ni II], and [Co III]). By focusing on [Fe II] and [Ni II] emission lines in the $\sim$7000-7500 {\AA} region of the spectrum, we find that the ratio of stable [Ni II] to mainly radioactively produced [Fe II] for most SNe Ia in the sample is consistent with Chandrasekharmass delayed-detonation explosion models, as well as sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions that have metallicity values above solar. The mean measured Ni/Fe abundance of our sample is consistent with the solar value. The more highly ionized [Co III] emission lines are found to be more centrally located in the ejecta and have broader lines than the [Fe II] and [Ni II] features. Our analysis also strengthens previous results that SNe Ia with higher Si II velocities at maximum light preferentially display blueshifted [Fe II] 7155 {\AA} lines at late times. Our combined results lead us to speculate that the majority of normal SN Ia explosions produce ejecta distributions that deviate significantly from spherical symmetry.},

In particular, the origin of Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) has been obscure. Following our earlier work on the parameter dependence of SN Ia models, we focus on SNe Iax in the present study. For a model of SNe Iax, we adopt the currently leading model of pure turbulent deflagration (PTD) of near-Chandrasekhar mass C+O white dwarfs (WDs). We carry out 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the propagation of deflagration wave, which leaves a small WD remnant behind and eject nucleosynthesis materials. We show how the explosion properties, such as nucleosynthesis and explosion energy, depend on the model parameters such as central densities and compositions of the WDs (including the hybrid WDs), and turbulent flame prescription and initial flame geometry. We extract the associated observables in our models, and compare with the recently discovered low-mass WDs with unusual surface abundance patterns and the abundance patterns of some SN remnants. We provide the nucleosynthesis yield tables for applications to stellar archaeology and galactic chemical evolution. Our results are compared with the representative models in the literature.},

abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M⊙ and near 0.08 M⊙. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices $\alpha$ are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by $\Delta$$\alpha$ ≈ 0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M⊙ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'{e}}ndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

abstract = {We consider some of the spectral and polarimetric signatures of the gravitational confined detonation scenario for Type Ia supernova explosions. In this model, material produced by an off-center deflagration (which itself fails to produce the explosion) forms a metal-rich atmosphere above the white dwarf surface. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this atmosphere is compressed and accelerated during the subsequent interaction with the supernova ejecta. This leads ultimately to the formation of a high-velocity pancake of metal-rich material that is geometrically detached from the bulk of the ejecta. When observed at the epochs near maximum light, this absorbing pancake produces a highly blueshifted and polarized calcium IR triplet absorption feature similar to that observed in several Type$\sim$Ia supernovae. We discuss the orientation effects present in our model and contrast them to those expected in other supernova explosion models. We propose that a large sample of spectropolarimetric observations can be used to critically evaluate the different theoretical scenarios.},

abstract = {Early-phase Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), especially those with luminosity enhancement within the first few days of explosions ("early-excess SNe Ia"), play an irreplaceable role in addressing the long-standing progenitor and explosion issue of SNe Ia. In this paper, we systematically investigate 11 early-excess SNe Ia from subluminous to luminous subclasses. Eight of them are selected from 23 SNe Ia with extremely early-phase optical light curves ("golden" early-phase SNe Ia), and three of them are selected from 40 SNe Ia (including 14 golden samples) with early-phase UV/NUV light curves. We found that previously discovered early-excess SNe Ia show a clear preference for specific SN Ia subclasses. In particular, the early-excess feature shown in all six luminous (91T- and 99aa-like) SNe Ia is in conflict with the viewing angle dependence predicted by the companion-ejecta interaction scenario. Instead, such a high early-excess fraction is likely related to the explosion physics of luminous SNe Ia; i.e. a more efficient detonation happening in the progenitor of luminous SNe Ia may consequently account for the early-excess feature powered by the radiation from a $^{56}$Ni-abundant outer layer. The diversity of early-excess features shown in different SN Ia subclasses suggests multiple origins of the discovered early-excess SNe Ia, challenging their applicability as a robust progenitor indicator. Further understanding of the early-excess diversity relies not only on multiband photometry and prompt-response spectroscopy of individual early-excess SNe Ia but also on investigations of the general early-phase light-curve behavior of each SN Ia subclass, which can be realized through ongoing/forthcoming transient survey projects in the near future.},

abstract = {We study a Type Ia supernova explosion using large-scale three-dimensional numerical simulations based on reactive fluid dynamics with a simplified mechanism for nuclear reactions and energy release. The initial deflagration stage of the explosion involves a subsonic turbulent thermonuclear flame propagating in the gravitational field of an expanding white dwarf. The deflagration produces an inhomogeneous mixture of unburned carbon and oxygen with intermediate-mass and iron-group elements in central parts of the star. During the subsequent detonation stage, a supersonic detonation wave propagates through the material unburned by the deflagration. The total energy released in this delayed-detonation process, (1.3-1.6)x10^51 ergs, is consistent with a typical range of kinetic energies obtained from observations. In contrast to the deflagration model that releases only about 0.6x10^51 ergs, the delayed-detonation model does not leave carbon, oxygen, and intermediate-mass elements in central parts of a white dwarf. This removes the key disagreement between three-dimensional simulations and observations, and makes a delayed detonation the mostly likely mechanism for Type Ia supernova explosions.},

abstract = {PEGASE (Projet d' Etude des GAlaxies par Synth{\'{e}}se Evolutive, in French) is a new spectrophotometric evolution model for starbursts and evolved galaxies of the Hubble sequence. Its main originality is the extension to the near-infrared (NIR) of the atlas of synthetic spectra of Rocca-Volmerange & Guiderdoni (1988) with a revised stellar library including cold star parameters and stellar tracks extended to the thermally-pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) and the post-AGB (PAGB) phase. The NIR is coherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet (UV), so that the model is continuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220 {\AA} up to 5 $\mu$n. Moreover, a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary phases such as red supergiants or AGB crucial in the NIR. The nebular component is also computed in the NIR. The extinction correction is gas-dependent for spirals and ellipticals. A set of reference synthetic spectra at z = 0, to which apply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high-redshift galaxies, is built from fits of observational templates. Because of the lack of visible to NIR spectral templates for each Hubble type, we adopt statistical samples of colors, not fitted by previous models. A first application of this continuous model is to solve the problem of the slope of the bright galaxy counts from B = 15 to 19 and of the normalization parameter {\O}* of the Schechter luminosity function. Designed to be used currently and to take into account easily new observational and theoretical inputs, the model is built as a series of independent blocks. Any block is clearly identified and submitted to publication.

Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances, the nature of their progenitors remains mysterious. One of the leading progenitor models, called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion. Here we report observations with the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the supernova and a companion star, and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel.},

abstract = {Colors of Type Ia supernovae in the first few days after explosion provide a potential discriminant between different models. In this paper, we present $g-r$ colors of 65 Type Ia supernovae discovered within 5 days from first light by the Zwicky Transient Facility in 2018, a sample that is about three times larger than that in the literature. We find that $g-r$ colors are intrinsically rather homogeneous at early phases, with about half of the dispersion attributable to photometric uncertainties ($\sigma_\mathrm{noise}\sim\sigma_\mathrm{int}\sim$ 0.18 mag). Colors are nearly constant starting from 6 days after first light ($g-r\sim-0.15$ mag), while the time evolution at earlier epochs is characterized by a continuous range of slopes, from events rapidly transitioning from redder to bluer colors (slope of $\sim-0.25$ mag day$^{-1}$) to events with a flatter evolution. The continuum in the slope distribution is in good agreement both with models requiring some amount of $^{56}$Ni mixed in the outermost regions of the ejecta and with "double-detonation" models having thin helium layers ($M_\mathrm{He}=0.01\,M_\odot$) and varying carbon-oxygen core masses. At the same time, six events show evidence for a distinctive "red bump" signature predicted by "double-detonation" models with larger helium masses. We finally identify a significant correlation between the early-time $g-r$ slopes and supernova brightness, with brighter events associated to flatter color evolution (p-value=0.006). The distribution of slopes, however, is consistent with being drawn from a single population, with no evidence for two components as claimed in the literature based on $B-V$ colors.},

abstract = {We compare the observed correlations between the maximum brightness, postmaximum decline rate and color at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) with model predictions. The observations are based on a total of 40 SN Ia with 29 SN of the Calan Tololo Supernova Search and 11 local SN which cover a range of 2 mag in the absolute visual brightness. The observed correlations are not tight, one dimensional relations. Supernovae with the same postmaximum decline or the same color have a spread in visual magnitude of about 0.7 mag. The dispersion in the color-magnitude relation may result from uncertainties in the distance determinations or the interstellar reddening within the host galaxy. The dispersion in the decline rate-magnitude relation suggests that an intrinsic spread in the supernova properties exists that cannot be accounted for by any single relation between visual brightness and postmaximum decline. Theoretical correlations are derived from a grid of models which encompasses delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations, the merging scenario and helium detonations. We find that the observed correlations can be understood in terms of explosions of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. Our models show an intrinsic spread in the relations of about 0.5 mag in the maximum brightness and about 0.1 mag in the B-V color. Our study provides strong evidence against the mechanism of helium detonation for subluminous, red SN Ia.},

Our model spectra at 1000 days take non-local radiative transfer into account and find that this has a crucial impact on the spectral formation. Although rapid cooling of the ejecta to a few 100 K occurs also in these models, the late-time optical/NIR flux is brighter by 1-2 mag due to redistribution of UV emissivity, resulting from non-thermal excitation and ionization. This effect brings models into better agreement with late-time observations of SN 2011fe, and other SNe Ia, and offers a solution to the long-standing discrepancy between models and observations. The models show that spectral formation shifts from Fe ii and Fe iii at 300 days to Fe i at 1000 days, which explains the apparent wavelength shifts seen in SN 2011fe. We discuss the effects of time dependence and energy input from 57Co, finding both to be important at 1000 days.},

abstract = {One of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead to explosions that reproduce observations of normal events. Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of 0.9 M ⊙ and 1.1 M ⊙ combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color light curves of our merger, which produces about 0.62 M ⊙ of 56Ni, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia. Therefore, depending on the number of such massive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a small fraction to the observed population of normal SNe Ia. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {The progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are still unknown, despite significant progress during the past several years in theory and observations. Violent mergers of two carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are a candidate scenario suggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal SNe Ia. Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that allows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01 M ⊙) on top of the WDs at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the primary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell. This detonation propagates around the CO WD and sends a converging shock wave into its core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-known double-detonation scenario for He-accreting CO WDs. However, in contrast to that scenario where a massive He shell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the He detonation is ignited dynamically. Accordingly the required He-shell mass is significantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affect the optical display of the explosion. We show that this scenario, which works for CO primary WDs with CO- as well as He-WD companions, has the potential to explain the different brightness distributions, delay times, and relative rates of normal and fast declining SNe Ia. Finally, we discuss extensions to our unified merger model needed to obtain a comprehensive picture of the full observed diversity of SNe Ia. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {While a white dwarf (WD) is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausible primary star of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), many other candidates have not been formally ruled out. Shock energy deposited in the envelope of any exploding primary contributes to the early SN brightness and, since this radiation energy is degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity depends on the initial primary radius. We present a new non-detection limit of the nearby SN Ia 2011fe, obtained at a time that appears to be just 4hr after explosion, allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius (Rp ). Coupled with the non-detection of a quiescent X-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesized 56Ni mass, we show that Rp ≲ 0.02 R ⊙ (a factor of five smaller than previously inferred), that the average density of the primary must be $\rho$p > 104 g cm-3, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few × 105K. This rules out hydrogen-burning main-sequence stars and giants. Constructing the helium-burning and carbon-burning main sequences, we find that such objects are also excluded. By process of elimination, we find that only degeneracy-supported compact objects - WDs and neutron stars - are viable as the primary star of SN2011fe. With few caveats, we also restrict the companion (secondary) star radius to R c ≲ 0.1 R ⊙, excluding Roche-lobe overflowing red giant and main-sequence companions to high significance. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {The temperature and ionization of SN 1987A is modeled between 200 and 2000 days in its nebular phase, using a time-dependent model. We include all important elements, as well as the primary composition zones in the supernova. The energy input is provided by radioactive decay of Co-56, Co-57, and Ti-44. The thermalization of the resulting gamma-rays and positrons is calculated by solving the Spencer-Fano equation. Both the ionization and the individual level populations are calculated time-dependently. Adiabatic cooling is included in the energy equation. Charge transfer is important for determining the ionization and is included with available and estimated rates. Full, multilevel atoms are used for the observationally important ions. As input models to the calculations we use explosion models for SN 1987A calculated by Woosley et al and Nomoto et al. The most important result in this paper refers to the evolution of the temperature and ionization of the various abundance zones. The metal-rich core undergoes a thermal instability, often referred to as the IR-catastrophe, at 600 - 1000 days. The hydrogen-rich zones evolve adiabatically after 500 - 800 days, while in the helium region both adiabatic cooling and line cooling are of equal importance after $\sim$1000 days. Freeze-out of the recombination is important in the hydrogen and helium zones. Concomitant with the IR-catastrophe, the bulk of the emission shifts from optical and near-IR lines to the mid- and far-IR. After the IR-catastrophe, the cooling is mainly due to far-IR lines and adiabatic expansion. Dust cooling is likely to be important in the zones where dust forms. We find that the dust condensation temperatures occur later than $\sim$500 days in the oxygen-rich zones, and the most favorable zone for dust condensation is the iron core.},

abstract = {Using the temperature and ionization calculated in our previous paper, we model the spectral evolution of SN 1987A. The IR-catastrophe is seen in the metal lines as a transition from thermal to non-thermal excitation, most clearly in the [O I] 6300, 6364 lines. The distribution of the different zones, and therefore the gamma-ray deposition, is determined from the line profiles of the most important lines, where possible. We find the total mass of hydrogen-rich gas to be $\sim$7.7 Msun. The helium mass derived from the line fluxes is sensitive to assumptions about the degree of redistribution in the line. The mass of the helium dominated zone is consistent with $\sim$1.9 Msun, with a further $\sim$3.9 Msun of helium residing in the hydrogen component. Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the non-thermal excitation of the [O I] lines, the uncertainty in the oxygen mass is considerable. In addition, masses of nitrogen, neon, magnesium, iron and nickel are estimated. The dominant contribution to the line luminosity often originates in a different zone from where most of the newly synthesized material resides. This applies to e.g. carbon, calcium and iron. The [C I] lines, mainly arising in the helium zone, indicate a substantially lower abundance of carbon mixed with helium than stellar evolution models give, and a more extended zone with CNO processed gas is indicated. The [Fe II] lines have in most phases a strong contribution from primordial iron, and at t > 600 - 800 days this component dominates the [Fe II] lines. The wings of the [Fe II] lines may therefore come from primordial iron, rather than synthesized iron mixed to high velocity. Lines from ions with low ionization potential indicate that the UV field below at least 1600 AA is severely quenched by dust absorption and resonance scattering.},

abstract = {Massive stars live fast and die young. They shine furiously for a few million years, during which time they synthesize most of the heavy elements in the universe in their cores. They end by blowing themselves up in a powerful explosion known as a supernova. During this process, the core collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, while the outer layers are expelled with velocities of thousands of kilometers per second. The resulting fireworks often outshine the entire host galaxy for many weeks. The explosion energy is eventually radiated away, but powering of the newborn nebula continues by radioactive isotopes synthesized in the explosion. The ejecta are now quite transparent, and we can see the material produced in the deep interiors of the star. To interpret the observations, detailed spectral modeling is needed. This thesis aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art computational tools for interpreting and modeling supernova observations in the nebular phase. This requires calculation of the physical conditions throughout the nebula, including non-thermal processes from the radioactivity, thermal and statistical equilibrium, as well as radiative transport. The inclusion of multi-line radiative transfer, which we compute with a Monte Carlo technique, represents one of the major advancements presented in this thesis.},

We use one sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh) ejecta model with 1.04 M⊙ and one Chandrasekhar (MCh) ejecta model with 1.40 M⊙.We introduce clumping factors f = 0.33, 0.25, and 0.10, which are constant throughout the ejecta, and compare results to the unclumped f = 1.0 case. We find that clumping is a natural mechanism to reduce the ionization of the ejecta, reducing emission from [Fe III], [Ar III], and [S III] by a factor of a few. For decreasing values of the clumping factor f, the [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291,7324 doublet became a dominant cooling line for our MCh model but remained weak in our sub-MCh model. Strong [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291,7324 indicates non-thermal heating in that region and may constrain explosion modelling.

abstract = {Late time synthetic spectra of Type Ia supernovae, based on three-dimensional deflagration models, are presented. We mainly focus on one model,"c3_3d_256_10s", for which the hydrodynamics (Roepke 2005) and nucleosynthesis (Travaglio et al. 2004) was calculated up to the homologous phase of the explosion. Other models with different ignition conditions and different resolution are also briefly discussed. The synthetic spectra are compared to observed late time spectra. We find that while the model spectra after 300 to 500 days show a good agreement with the observed Fe II-III features, they also show too strong O I and C I lines compared to the observed late time spectra. The oxygen and carbon emission originates from the low-velocity unburned material in the central regions of these models. To get agreement between the models and observations we find that only a small mass of unburned material may be left in the center after the explosion. This may be a problem for pure deflagration models, although improved initial conditions, as well as higher resolution decrease the discrepancy. The relative intensity from the different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of the emitting iron-rich material. We find that clumping, with the presence of low density regions, is needed to reproduce the observed iron emission, especially in the range between 4000 and 6000 AA. Both temperature and ionization depend sensitively on density, abundances and radioactive content. This work therefore illustrates the importance of including the inhomogeneous nature of realistic three-dimensional explosion models. We briefly discuss the implications of the spectral modeling for the nature of the explosion.},

abstract = {We have assembled a data set of 165 low redshift, z < 0.06, publicly available Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We produce maximum light magnitude (MB and MV) distributions of SNe Ia to explore the diversity of parameter space that they can fill. Before correction for host galaxy extinction we find that the mean MB and MV of SNe Ia are -18.58 ± 0.07 and -18.72 ± 0.05 mag, respectively. Host galaxy extinction is corrected using a new method based on the SN spectrum. After correction, the mean values of MB and MV of SNe Ia are -19.10 ± 0.06 and -19.10 ± 0.05 mag, respectively. After correction for host galaxy extinction, 'normal' SNe Ia ($\Delta$m15(B) < 1.6 mag) fill a larger parameter space in the width-luminosity relation than previously suggested, and there is evidence for luminous SNe Ia with large $\Delta$m15(B). We find a bimodal distribution in $\Delta$m15(B), with a pronounced lack of transitional events at $\Delta$m15(B) = 1.6 mag. We confirm that faster, low-luminosity SNe tend to come from passive galaxies. Dividing the sample by host galaxy type, SNe Ia from star-forming (S-F) galaxies have a mean MB = -19.20 ± 0.05 mag, while SNe Ia from passive galaxies have a mean MB = -18.57 ± 0.24 mag. Even excluding fast declining SNe, 'normal' (MB < -18 mag) SNe Ia from S-F and passive galaxies are distinct. In the V band, there is a difference of 0.4 ± 0.13 mag between the median (MV) values of the 'normal' SN Ia population from passive and S-F galaxies. This is consistent with ($\sim$15 ± 10) per cent of 'normal' SNe Ia from S-F galaxies coming from an old stellar population.},

We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and $\gamma$-rays include both $\beta$ + decay of 56 Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WD) close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M Ch), He-triggered explosions of sub-M Ch WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 10 13 G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SN Ia. We find that this is dominated by normal-bright SNe Ia, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to the Galactic positrons of < 2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, < 6...20% for M Ch and sub-M Ch , respectively.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are believed to be caused by the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf (WD), but the nature of the progenitor system(s) is still unclear. Recent theoretical and observational developments have led to renewed interest in double degenerate models, in particular the "helium-ignited violent merger" or "dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D 6). In this paper we take the output of an existing D 6 SN model and carry it into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase up to 4000 years after the explosion, past the time when all the ejecta have been shocked. Assuming a uniform ambient medium, we reveal specific signatures of the explosion mechanism and spatial variations intrinsic to the ejecta. The first detonation produces an ejecta tail visible at early times, while the second detonation leaves a central density peak in the ejecta that is visible at late times. The SNR shell is off-centre at all times, because of an initial velocity shift due to binary motion. The companion WD produces a large conical shadow in the ejecta, visible in projection as a dark patch surrounded by a bright ring. This is a clear and long-lasting feature that is localized, and its impact on the observed morphology is dependent on the viewing angle of the SNR. These results offer a new way to diagnose the explosion mechanism and progenitor system using observations of a Type Ia SNR.},

Traditionally , ultra-massive white dwarfs are expected to harbour oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. However, new observations and recent theoretical studies suggest that the progenitors of some ultra-massive white dwarfs can avoid carbon burning, leading to the formation of ultra-massive white dwarfs harbouring carbon-oxygen (CO) cores. Here we present a set of ultra-massive white dwarf evolutionary sequences with CO cores for a wide range of metallicity and masses. We take into account the energy released by latent heat and phase separation during the crys-tallization process and by 22 Ne sedimentation. Realistic chemical profiles resulting from the full computation of progenitor evolution are considered. We compare our CO ultra-massive white dwarf models with ONe models. We conclude that CO ultra-massive white dwarfs evolve significantly slower than their ONe counterparts mainly for three reasons: their larger thermal content, the effect of crystallization, and the effect of 22 Ne sedimentation. We also provide colors in several photometric bands on the basis of new model atmospheres. These CO ultra-massive white dwarf models, together with the ONe ultra-massive white dwarf models, provide an appropriate theoretical framework to study the ultra-massive white dwarf population in our Galaxy.},

abstract = {Calcium-rich (Ca-rich) transients are a new class of supernovae (SNe) that are known for their comparatively rapid evolution, modest peak luminosities, and strong nebular calcium emission lines. Currently, the progenitor systems of Ca-rich transients remain unknown. Although they exhibit spectroscopic properties not unlike core-collapse Type Ib/c SNe, nearly half are found in the outskirts of their host galaxies that are predominantly elliptical, suggesting a closer connection to the older stellar populations of SNe Ia. In this paper, we present a compilation of publicly available multiwavelength observations of all known and/or suspected host galaxies of Ca-rich transients ranging from FUV to IR, and use these data to characterize their stellar populations with prospector. We estimate several galaxy parameters including integrated star formation rate, stellar mass, metallicity, and age. For nine host galaxies, the observations are sensitive enough to obtain nonparametric star formation histories, from which we recover SN rates and estimate probabilities that the Ca-rich transients in each of these host galaxies originated from a core-collapse vs. Type Ia-like explosion. Our work supports the notion that the population of Ca-rich transients do not come exclusively from core-collapse explosions, and must either be only from white dwarf stars or a mixed population of white dwarf stars with other channels, potentially including massive star explosions. Additional photometry and explosion site spectroscopy of larger samples of Ca-rich host galaxies will improve these estimates and better constrain the ratio of white dwarf vs. massive star progenitors of Ca-rich transients.},

We present extensive numerical simulations of the evolution of the neutron star in the transient low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0556-332. We model nearly twenty observations obtained during the quiescence phases after four different outbursts of the source in the past decade, considering the heating of the star during accretion by the deep crustal heating mechanism complemented by some shallow heating source. We show that cooling data are consistent with a single source of shallow heating acting during the last three outbursts, while a very different and powerful energy source is required to explain the extremely high effective temperature of the neutron star, ∼ 350 eV, when it exited the first observed outburst. We propose that a gigantic thermonuclear explosion, a "hyperburst" from unstable burning of neutron rich isotopes of oxygen or neon, occurred a few weeks before the end of the first outburst, releasing ∼ 10 44 ergs at densities of the order of 10 11 g cm −3. This would be the first observation of a hyperburst and these would be extremely rare events as the build up of the exploding layer requires about a millennium of accretion history. Despite its large energy output, the hyperburst did not produce, due to its depth, any noticeable increase in luminosity during the accretion phase and is only identifiable by its imprint on the later cooling of the neutron star.},

However, it showed a very unusual double-peaked [OI] $\lambda\lambda\,6300,6363$ emission at late times (Taubenberger et al. 2013). Modelling of the nebular spectrum suggests that a very small amount of oxygen ($\sim0.05$ M$_{\odot}$), expanding at very low speed ($\sim2000$ km/s) is sufficient to reproduce the observed emission. The rest of the nebula is not too dissimilar from SN 1991bg, except that SN 2010lp is slightly more luminous. The double-peaked [OI] emission suggests that SN 2010lp may be consistent with the merger or collision of two low-mass white dwarfs.

abstract = {We present a spectroscopic analysis of the most nearby Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), SN 2018bsz. The photometric evolution of SN 2018bsz has demonstrated several surprising features, including an unusual pre-peak plateau and evidence for rapid formation of dust. We show here that the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of SN 2018bsz are also unique. While its spectroscopic evolution closely resembles SLSNe-I, with early O ii absorption and C ii P-Cygni profiles followed by Ca, Mg, Fe and other O features, a multi-component H$\alpha$ profile appearing at ∼ 30 d post-maximum is the most atypical. The H$\alpha$ is at first characterised by two emission components, one at ∼ +3000 km/s and a second at ∼ −7500 km/s, with a third, near-zero velocity component appearing after a delay. The blue and central components can be described by Gaussian profiles of intermediate width (FWHM ∼ 2000-6000 km/s), but the red component is significantly broader (FWHM 10000 km/s) and Lorentzian. The blue H$\alpha$ component evolves towards lower velocity offset before abruptly fading at ∼ +100 d post-maximum brightness, concurrently with a light curve break. Multi-component profiles are observed in other hydrogen lines including Pa$\beta$, and in lines of Ca ii and He i. Spectropolarimetry obtained before (10.2 d) and after (38.4 d) the appearance of the H lines show a large shift on the Stokes Q-U plane consistent with SN 2018bsz undergoing radical changes in its projected geometry. Assuming the SN is almost unpolarised at 10.2 d, the continuum polarisation at 38.4 d reaches P ∼ 1.8% implying a highly asymmetric configuration. We propose that the observed evolution of SN 2018bsz can be explained by highly aspherical, possibly disk-like, CSM with several emitting regions. After the SN explosion, the CSM is quickly overtaken by the ejecta, but as the photosphere starts to recede, the different CSM regions re-emerge producing the peculiar line profiles. Based on the first appearance of H$\alpha$, we can constrain the distance of the CSM to be less than ∼ 6.5 × 10 15 cm (430 AU), or even lower (87 AU) if the pre-peak plateau is related to an eruption that created the CSM. The presence of CSM has been inferred previously for other SLSNe-I, both directly and indirectly. However, it is not clear whether the rare properties of SN 2018bsz can be generalised for SLSNe-I, for example in the context of pulsational pair instability, or whether they are the result of an uncommon evolutionary path, possibly involving a binary companion.},

abstract = {We report comprehensive multi-wavelength observations of a peculiar Type Ia-like supernova ("SN Ia-pec") ASASSN-15pz. ASASSN-15pz is a spectroscopic "twin" of SN 2009dc, a so-called "Super-Chandrasekhar-mass" SN, throughout its evolution, but it has a peak luminosity M_B,peak = -19.69 +/- 0.12 mag that is \approx 0.6 mag dimmer and comparable to the SN 1991T sub-class of SNe Ia at the luminous end of the normal width-luminosity relation. The synthesized Ni56 mass of M_Ni56 = 1.13 +/- 0.14 M_sun is also substantially less than that found for several 2009dc-like SNe. Previous well-studied 2009dc-like SNe have generally suffered from large and uncertain amounts of host-galaxy extinction, which is negligible for ASASSN-15pz. Based on the color of ASASSN-15pz, we estimate a host extinction for SN 2009dc of E(B-V)_host=0.12 mag and confirm its high luminosity (M_B, peak[2009dc] \approx -20.3 mag). The 2009dc-like SN population, which represents $\sim$1% of SNe Ia, exhibits a range of peak luminosities, and do not fit onto the tight width-luminosity relation. Their optical light curves also show significant diversity of late-time (>$\sim$ 50 days) decline rates. The nebular-phase spectra provide powerful diagnostics to identify the 2009dc-like events as a distinct class of SNe Ia. We suggest referring to these sources using the phenomenology-based "2009dc-like SN Ia-pec" instead of "Super-Chandrasekhar SN Ia," which is based on an uncertain theoretical interpretation.},

abstract = {SN 2019yvr is the second Type Ib supernova (SN) with a possible direct detection of its progenitor (system); however, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the pre-explosion source appears much cooler and overluminous than an expected helium-star progenitor. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and MUSE integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy, we find the SN environment contains three episodes of star formation; the low ejecta mass suggests the SN progenitor is most likely from the oldest population, corresponding to an initial mass of 10.4 +1.5 −1.3 {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±. The pre-explosion SED can be reproduced by two components, one for the hot and compact SN progenitor and one for a cool and inflated yellow hypergiant (YHG) companion that dominates the brightness. Thus, SN 2019yvr could possibly be the first Type Ib/c SN for which the progenitor's binary companion is directly detected on pre-explosion images. Both the low progenitor mass and the YHG companion suggest significant binary interaction during their evolution. Similar to SN 2014C, SN 2019yvr exhibits a metamorphosis from Type Ib to Type IIn, showing signatures of interaction with hydrogen-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at >150 days; our result supports enhanced pre-SN mass loss as an important process for hydrogen-poor stars at the lower-mass end of core-collapse SN progenitors.},

We have examined if they can be dominant origins of merging binary black holes (BHs) and extremely metal-poor stars. The abundance pattern of EMP stars is helpful to trace back the properties of Pop III stars. We have confirmed previous arguments that the observed BH merger rate needs Pop III star formation efficiency 10 times larger than theoretically predicted values, while the cosmic reionization history still permits such a high Pop III star formation efficiency. On the other hand, we have newly found that the elemental abundance pattern of EMP stars only allows the Pop III initial mass function with the minimum mass of ∼ 15 − 27 M. In other words, the minimum mass must not deviate largely from the critical mass below and above which Pop III stars leave behind neutron stars and BHs, respectively. Pop III stars may be still a dominant origin of merging binary BHs but our study has reduced the allowed parameter space under a hypothesis that EMP stars are formed from primordial gas mixed with Pop III supernova ejecta.},

abstract = {While conventional Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology analyses rely primarily on rest-frame optical light curves to determine distances, SNe Ia are excellent standard candles in near-infrared (NIR) light, which is significantly less sensitive to dust extinction. An SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model capable of fitting rest-frame NIR observations is necessary to fully leverage current and future SN Ia data sets from ground- and space-based telescopes including HST, LSST, JWST, and RST. We construct a hierarchical Bayesian model for SN Ia SEDs, continuous over time and wavelength, from the optical to NIR (B through H, or $0.35{-}1.8\, \mu$m). We model the SED as a combination of physically distinct host galaxy dust and intrinsic spectral components. The distribution of intrinsic SEDs over time and wavelength is modelled with probabilistic functional principal components and the covariance of residual functions. We train the model on a nearby sample of 79 SNe Ia with joint optical and NIR light curves by sampling the global posterior distribution over dust and intrinsic latent variables, SED components and population hyperparameters. Photometric distances of SNe Ia with NIR data near maximum obtain a total RMS error of 0.10 mag with our BayeSN model, compared to 0.13–0.14 mag with SALT2 and SNooPy for the same sample. Jointly fitting the optical and NIR data of the full sample up to moderate reddening (host E(B − V) < 0.4) for a global host dust law, we find RV = 2.9 ± 0.2, consistent with the Milky Way average.},

For this analysis, we use the photometric classification framework SSSSSNNNNN (SNN; M{\"{o}}ller & de Boissi{\`{e}}re 2019) trained on realistic DES-like simulations. For reliable classification, we process the DES SN programme (DES-SN) data and introduce improvements to the classifier architecture, obtaining classification accuracies of more than 98 per cent on simulations. This is the first SN classification to make use of ensemble methods, resulting in more robust samples. Using photometry, host galaxy redshifts, and a classification probability requirement, we identify 1,863 SNe Ia from which we select 1,484 cosmology-grade SNe Ia spanning the redshift range of 0.07 < {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\S} < 1.14. We find good agreement between the light-curve properties of the photometrically-selected sample and simulations. Additionally, we create similar SN Ia samples using two types of Bayesian Neural Network classifiers that provide uncertainties on the classification probabilities. We test the feasibility of using these uncertainties as indicators for out-of-distribution candidates and model confidence. Finally, we discuss the implications of photometric samples and classification methods for future surveys such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).},

The line profile and width of [O i] are employed to infer the ejecta geometry and the expansion velocity of the inner core; these two measurements are then compared with the SN sub types, and further with the [O i]/[Ca ii] ratio, which is used as an indicator of the progenitor CO core mass. Based on the best-fit results of the [O i] profile, the objects are classified into different morphological groups, and we conclude that the deviation from spherical symmetry is a common feature for all types of SESNe. There is a hint (at ∼ 1$\sigma$ level) that the distributions of the line profile fractions are different between canonical SESNe and broad-line SNe Ic. A correlation between [O i] width and [O i]/[Ca ii] is discerned, indicating that the oxygen-rich material tends to expand faster for objects with a more massive CO core. Such a correlation can be utilized to constrain the relation between the progenitor mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion. Further, when [O i]/[Ca ii] increases, the fraction of objects with Gaussian [O i] profile increases, while those with double-peaked profile decreases. This phenomenon connects ejecta geometry and the progenitor CO core mass.},

abstract = {For about half a century the radio pulsar population was observed to spin in the ∼ 0.002-12 s range, with different pulsar classes having spin-period evolution that differs substantially depending on their magnetic fields or past accretion history. The recent detection of several slowly rotating pulsars has reopened the long-standing question of the exact physics, and observational biases, driving the upper bound of the period range of the pulsar population. In this work, we study the spin-period evolution of pulsars interacting with supernova fallback matter and specifically look at the fallback accretion disk scenario using general assumption for the pulsar spin period and magnetic field at birth, as well as fallback accretion rates. We show that this evolution can differ substantially from the typical dipolar spin-down, and can be very dependent on the ranges of initial parameters at formation, resulting in pulsars that show spin periods longer than their coeval peers. In addition, we study the cases of two recently discovered periodic radio sources: the pulsar MTP0013 (P = 75.9 s) and the radio transient GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (P = 1091 s). Long-period isolated pulsars might be more common than expected, being the natural result of supernova fallback accretion, and necessarily having a strong magnetic field.},

The relation between the duration of the peak phase of a type Ia supernova's lightcurve and its luminosity (broader is brighter) forms the cornerstone of this measurement, yet it is a purely empirical relation. In this paper we show that the relation is a natural consequence of the radiation transport in type Ia supernovae and suggest constraints on the nature of the explosions which arise from our interpretation of the observed relation. The principle parameter underlying the relation is the mass of radioactive 56Ni produced in the explosion. The relation is shown to be relatively insensitive to most other parameters in Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. Cosmological results are thus unlikely to suffer from systematic effects stemming from evolution in the explosions' progenitors.},

abstract = { In this Letter we report a discovery of a prominent flash of a peculiar overluminous Type Ia supernova, SN 2020hvf, in about 5 hr of the supernova explosion by the first wide-field mosaic CMOS sensor imager, the Tomo-e Gozen Camera. The fast evolution of the early flash was captured by intensive intranight observations via the Tomo-e Gozen high-cadence survey. Numerical simulations show that such a prominent and fast early emission is most likely generated from an interaction between 0.01 M ⊙ circumstellar material (CSM) extending to a distance of ∼10 13 cm and supernova ejecta soon after the explosion, indicating a confined dense CSM formation at the final evolution stage of the progenitor of SN 2020hvf. Based on the CSM–ejecta interaction-induced early flash, the overluminous light curve, and the high ejecta velocity of SN 2020hvf, we suggest that the SN 2020hvf may originate from a thermonuclear explosion of a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (“super- M Ch WD”). Systematical investigations on explosion mechanisms and hydrodynamic simulations of the super- M Ch WD explosion are required to further test the suggested scenario and understand the progenitor of this peculiar supernova. },

abstract = {When planning a survey for astronomical transients, many factors such as cadence, filter choice, sky coverage, and depth of observations need to be balanced in order to optimize the scientific gain of the survey. Here we present a software package called simsurvey for simulating the supernova lightcurves that are expected based on a survey strategy, which can then be used to determine the potential for discoveries of each strategy in question. The code is set up in a modular fashion that allows easy modification of small details of the survey and enables the user to adapt it to any survey design and transient template that they wish to use in planning their survey. As an example of its utility, we use simsurvey to simulate the lightcurve of several types of supernovae that the recently started Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is expected to find and compare the results to the discoveries made during its early operations. We conclude that ZTF will find thousands of bright supernovae per year, of which about 10 could potentially be found with two days of explosion. Over the course of three years the survey will obtain lightcurves of about 1800 type Ia supernovae with z < 0.1 that can be used as distance indicators in cosmology if they are spectroscopically classified using additional telescopes. In a comparison to detections from the ZTF public survey, we found good agreement with the numbers of detections expected from the simulations.},

abstract = {While a white dwarf (WD) is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausible primary star of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), many other candidates have not been formally ruled out. Shock energy deposited in the envelope of any exploding primary contributes to the early SN brightness and, since this radiation energy is degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity depends on the initial primary radius. We present a new non-detection limit of the nearby SN Ia 2011fe, obtained at a time that appears to be just 4hr after explosion, allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius (Rp ). Coupled with the non-detection of a quiescent X-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesized 56Ni mass, we show that Rp ≲ 0.02 R ⊙ (a factor of five smaller than previously inferred), that the average density of the primary must be $\rho$p > 104 g cm-3, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few × 105K. This rules out hydrogen-burning main-sequence stars and giants. Constructing the helium-burning and carbon-burning main sequences, we find that such objects are also excluded. By process of elimination, we find that only degeneracy-supported compact objects - WDs and neutron stars - are viable as the primary star of SN2011fe. With few caveats, we also restrict the companion (secondary) star radius to R c ≲ 0.1 R ⊙, excluding Roche-lobe overflowing red giant and main-sequence companions to high significance. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are more precise standardizable candles when measured in the near-infrared (NIR) than in the optical. With this motivation, from 2012-2017 we embarked on the RAISIN program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain rest-frame NIR light curves for a cosmologically distant sample of 37 SN Ia ($0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$) discovered by Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey. By comparing higher-$z$ HST data with 42 SN Ia at $z<0.1$ observed in the NIR by the Carnegie Supernova Project, we construct a Hubble diagram from NIR observations (with only time of maximum light and some selection cuts from optical data) to pursue a unique avenue to constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. We analyze the dependence of the full set of Hubble residuals on the SN Ia host galaxy mass and find Hubble residual steps of size $\sim$0.06-0.1$\sim$mag with 1.5- to 2.5-$\sigma$ significance depending on the method and step location. Combining our NIR sample with CMB constraints, we find $1+w=-0.17\pm0.12$ (stat$+$syst). The largest systematic errors are the redshift-dependent SN selection biases and the properties of the NIR mass step. We also use these data to measure $H_0=75.9\pm 2.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ from stars with geometric distance calibration in the hosts of 8 SNe Ia observed in the NIR versus $H_0=71.2\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ using an inverse distance ladder approach tied to Planck. Using optical data we find $1+w=-0.10\pm0.09$ and with optical and NIR data combined, we find $1+w=-0.06\pm0.07$; these shifts of up to 0.11 in $w$ could point to inconsistency in optical versus NIR SN models. There will be many opportunities to improve this NIR measurement and better understand systematic uncertainties through larger low-$z$ samples, new light-curve models, calibration improvements, and by building high-$z$ samples from the Roman Space Telescope.},

abstract = {We present well-sampled optical observations of the bright Type Ia supernova (SN$\sim$Ia) SN 2011fe in M101. Our data, starting from $\sim16$ days before maximum light and extending to $\sim463$ days after maximum, provide an unprecedented time series of spectra and photometry for a normal SN$\sim$Ia. Fitting the early-time rising light curve, we find that the luminosity evolution of SN 2011fe follows a $t^n$ law, with the index $n$ being close to 2.0 in the $VRI$ bands but slightly larger in the $U$ and $B$ bands. Combining the published ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we derive the contribution of UV/NIR emission relative to the optical. SN 2011fe is found to have stronger UV emission and reaches its UV peak a few days earlier than other SNe$\sim$Ia with similar $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, suggestive of less trapping of high-energy photons in the ejecta. Moreover, the $U$-band light curve shows a notably faster decline at late phases ($t\approx 100$--300 days), which also suggests that the ejecta may be relatively transparent to UV photons. These results favor the notion that SN 2011fe might have a progenitor system with relatively lower metallicity. On the other hand, the early-phase spectra exhibit prominent high-velocity features (HVFs) of O$\sim$I $\lambda$7773 and the Ca$\sim$II$\sim$NIR triplet, but only barely detectable in Si$\sim$II$\sim$6355. This difference can be caused either by an ionization/temperature effect or an abundance enhancement scenario for the formation of HVFs; it suggests that the photospheric temperature of SN 2011fe is intrinsically low, perhaps owing to incomplete burning during the explosion of the white dwarf.},

abstract = {We present deepSIP (deep learning of Supernova Ia Parameters), a software package for measuring the phase and a- for the first time using deep learning a- the light-curve shape of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) from an optical spectrum. At its core, deepSIP consists of three convolutional neural networks trained on a substantial fraction of all publicly available low-redshift SN Ia optical spectra, on to which we have carefully coupled photometrically derived quantities. We describe the accumulation of our spectroscopic and photometric data sets, the cuts taken to ensure quality, and our standardized technique for fitting light curves. These considerations yield a compilation of 2754 spectra with photometrically characterized phases and light-curve shapes. Though such a sample is significant in the SN community, it is small by deep-learning standards where networks routinely have millions or even billions of free parameters. We therefore introduce a data-augmentation strategy that meaningfully increases the size of the subset we allocate for training while prioritizing model robustness and telescope agnosticism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models by deploying them on a sample unseen during training and hyperparameter selection, finding that Model I identifies spectra that have a phase between {\^{a}}'10 and 18 d and light-curve shape, parametrized by $\Delta$m15, between 0.85 and 1.55 mag with an accuracy of 94.6 per cent. For those spectra that do fall within the aforementioned region in phasea-$\Delta$m15space, Model II predicts phases with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.00 d and Model III predicts $\Delta$m15values with an RMSE of 0.068 mag.},

@article{Kausch2015,
abstract = {Context. Absorption by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere strongly affects ground-based astronomical observations. The resulting absorption line strength and shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e. pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved. Usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS) are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope time. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic transmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of the observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by means of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this way, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed without any additional calibration observations of TSS. Aims. We evaluate the quality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of archival ESO-VLT/X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra. Methods. Thanks to the wavelength coverage from the U to the K band, X-Shooter is well suited to investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect to the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the code, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles. These investigations are based on two figures of merit, Ioff and Ires, that describe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the corrections. We also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correction achieved with molecfit to the classical method based on a telluric standard star. Results. The evaluation of the telluric correction with molecfit shows a convincing removal of atmospheric absorption features. The comparison with the classical method reveals that molecfit performs better because it is not prone to the bad continuum reconstruction, noise, and intrinsic spectral features introduced by the telluric standard star. Conclusions. Fitted synthetic transmission spectra are an excellent alternative to the correction based on telluric standard stars. Moreover, molecfit offers wide flexibility for adaption to various instruments and observing sites.},

It is designed to maximize the sensitivity in this spectral range through dichroic splitting in three arms with optimized optics, coatings, dispersive elements and detectors. It operates at intermediate spectral resolution (R$\sim$4,000 - 17,000, depending on wavelength and slit width) with fixed echelle spectral format (prism cross-dispersers) in the three arms. It includes a 1.8"x4" Integral Field Unit as an alternative to the 11" long slits.

We construct mean light curve (LC) templates using a hierarchical Bayesian model. We explore both Gaussian process (GP) and template methods for fitting the LCs and estimating distances, while including peculiar-velocity and photometric uncertainties. For the 56 SNeIa with both optical and NIR observations near maximum light, the GP method yields a NIR-only Hubble-diagram with a root mean square (rms) of  0.117 0.014 mag when referenced to the NIR maxima. For each NIR band, a comparable GP method rms is obtained when referencing to NIR-max or B-max. Using NIR LC templates referenced to B-max yields a larger rms value of  0.138 0.014 mag. Fitting the corresponding optical data using standard LC fitters that use LC shape and color corrections yields larger rms values of 0.179±0.018mag with SALT2 and  0.174 0.021 mag with SNooPy. Applying our GP method to subsets of SNeIa NIR LCs at NIR maximum light, even without corrections for LC shape, color, or host-galaxy dust reddening, provides smaller rms in the inferred distances, at the ∼2.3-4.1$\sigma$ level, than standard optical methods that correct for those effects. Our ongoing RAISIN program on the Hubble Space Telescope will exploit this promising infrared approach to limit systematic errors when measuring the expansion history of the universe in order to constrain dark energy.},

abstract = {Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide a better understanding of nearly every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to modern time-domain optical surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric monitoring (on the order of seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum light, using the fast imagers available on the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2 m telescope at Kryoneri Observatory in Greece. We applied differential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and we present reconstructed light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA, Kov{\'{a}}cs et al. 2005, MNRAS, 356, 557). TFA yielded the best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01 and 0.04 mag. We did not detect significant bumps with amplitudes greater than 0.05 mag in any of the SNe targets in the VR-, R-, and I-bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light curve, which ranges between −0.37−0.36 mag day −1 in broadband VR, −0.19−0.31 mag day −1 in R band, and −0.13−0.10 mag day −1 in I band. We used SNe light curve fitting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn to photometrically classify the light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order polynomial fit and SN 2018hhn for the first time. We conclude that optimal aperture photometry in combination with TFA provides the highest-precision light curves for SNe that are relatively well separated from the centers of their host galaxies. This work aims to inspire the use of ground-based, high-cadence and high-precision photometry to study SNe with the purpose of revealing clues and properties of the explosion environment of both core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, the explosion mechanisms, binary star interaction and progenitor channels. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence of hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor stars.},

abstract = {Sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) with a surface helium (He) shell have been proposed as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). If true, the resulting thermonuclear explosions should be able to account for at least some of the range of SNe Ia observables. To study this, we conduct a parameter study based on 3D simulations of double detonations in CO WDs with a He shell, assuming different core and shell masses. An admixture of C to the shell and solar metallicity are included in the models. The hydrodynamic simulations are carried out using the AREPO code. This allows us to follow the He shell detonation with high numerical resolution, and improves the reliability of predicted nucleosynthetic shell detonation yields. The addition of C to the shell leads to a lower production of 56Ni while including solar metallicity increases the production of IMEs. The production of higher mass elements is further shifted to stable isotopes at solar metallicity. Moreover, we find different core detonation ignition mechanisms depending on the core and shell mass configuration. This has an influence on the ejecta structure. We present the bolometric light curves predicted from our explosion simulations using the radiative transfer code ARTIS, and make comparisons with SNe Ia data. The bolometric light curves of our models show a range of brightnesses, able to account for sub-luminous to normal SNe Ia. We show the model bolometric width-luminosity relation compared to data for a range of viewing angles. We find that, on average, our brighter models lie within the observed data. The ejecta asymmetries produce a wide distribution of observables, which might account for outliers in the data. However, the models overestimate the extent of this compared to data. We also find the bolometric decline rate over 40 days appears systematically faster than data. (abridged)},

abstract = {Context. When stripped from their hydrogen-rich envelopes, stars with initial masses between ∼7 and 11 M develop massive degenerate cores and collapse. Depending on the final structure and composition, the outcome can range from a thermonuclear explosion, to the formation of a neutron star in an electron-capture supernova (ECSN). It has been recently demonstrated that stars in this mass range may be more prone to disruption than previously thought: they may initiate explosive oxygen burning when their central densities are still below $\rho$ c 10 9.6 g cm −3. At the same time, their envelopes expand significantly, leading to the complete depletion of helium. This combination makes them interesting candidates for Type Ia Supernovae-which we call (C)ONe SNe Ia-and might have broader implications for the formation of neutron stars via ECSNe. Aims. To constrain the observational counterparts of (C)ONe SNe Ia and the key properties that enable them, it is crucial to constrain the evolution, composition, and pre-collapse structure of their progenitors, as well as the evolution of these quantities with cosmic time. In turn, this requires a detailed investigation of the final evolutionary stages preceding the collapse, and their sensitivity to input physics. Methods. Here, we model the evolution of 252 single, non-rotating helium-stars covering the initial mass range 0.8-3.5 M , metal-licities between Z = 10 −4 and 0.02, and overshoot efficiency factors from f OV = 0.0 to 0.016 across all convective boundaries. We use these models to constrain several properties of these stars, including their central densities, compositions and envelope masses at the time of explosive oxygen ignition, and the final outcome as a function of initial helium-star mass. We further investigate the sensitivity of these properties to mass-loss rate assumptions using an additional grid of 110 models with varying wind efficiencies. Results. We find that helium-star models with masses between ∼1.8 and 2.7 M are able to evolve onto 1.35-1.37 M (C)ONe cores that initiate explosive burning at central densities between log 10 ($\rho$ c /g cm −3) ∼ 9.3 and 9.6. We constrain the amount of residual carbon retained after core carbon burning as a function of initial conditions, and conclude that it plays a critical role in determining the final outcome: Chandrasekhar-mass cores with residual carbon mass fractions of X min (12 C) 0.004 result in (C)ONe SNe Ia, while those with lower carbon mass fractions become ECSNe. We find that (C)ONe SNe Ia are more likely to occur at high metallicities, whereas at low metallicities ECSNe dominate. We constrain the relative ratio between (C)ONe SNe Ia and SNe Ib/c to be 0.17-0.30 at Z = 0.02, and 0.03-0.13 at Z ≤ 10 −3. Conclusions. We conclude with a discussion on potential observational properties of (C)ONe SNe Ia and their progenitors. In the few thousand years leading to the explosion, at least some progenitors should be identifiable as luminous metal-rich supergiants, embedded in hydrogen-free circumstellar nebulae.},

abstract = {Type Ibn Supernovae (SNe Ibn) show signatures of strong interaction between the SN ejecta and hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Deriving the ejecta and CSM properties of SNe Ibn provides a great opportunity to study the final evolution of massive stars. In the present work, we present a light curve (LC) model for the ejecta-CSM interaction, taking into account the processes in which the high-energy photons originally created at the forward and reverse shocks are converted to the observed emission in the optical. The model is applied to a sample of SNe Ibn and 'SN Ibn' rapidly evolving transients. We show that the characteristic post-peak behavior commonly seen in the SN Ibn LCs, where a slow decay is followed by a rapid decay, is naturally explained by the transition of the forward-shock property from cooling to adiabatic regime without introducing a change in the CSM density distribution. The (commonly-found) slope in the rapid decay phase indicates a steep CSM density gradient ($\rho$ CSM ∝ r −3), inferring a rapid increase in the mass-loss rate toward the SN as a generic properties of the SN Ibn progenitors. From the derived ejecta and CSM properties, we argue that massive Wolf-Rayet stars with the initial mass of ∼ > 18M can be a potential class of the progenitors. The present work also indicates existence of currently missing population of UV-bright rapid transients for which the final mass-loss rate is lower than the optical SNe Ibn, which can be efficiently probed by future UV missions.},

abstract = {Seeing pristine material from the donor star in a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion can reveal the nature of the binary system. In this paper, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020esm, one of the best-studied SNe of the class of "super-Chandrasekhar" SNe Ia (SC SNe Ia), with data obtained −12 to +360 days relative to peak brightness, obtained from a variety of ground-and space-based telescopes. Initially misclassified as a Type II supernova, SN 2020esm peaked at M B = −19.9 mag, declined slowly (∆m 15 (B) = 0.92 mag), and had particularly blue UV and optical colors at early times. Photometrically and spectroscopically, SN 2020esm evolved similarly to other SC SNe Ia, showing the usual low ejecta velocities, weak intermediate mass elements (IMEs), and the enhanced fading at late times, but its early spectra 2 Dimitriadis et al. are unique. Our first few spectra (corresponding to a phase of 10 days before peak) reveal a nearly-pure carbon/oxygen atmosphere during the first days after explosion. This composition can only be produced by pristine material, relatively unaffected by nuclear burning. The lack of H and He may further indicate that SN 2020esm is the outcome of the merger of two carbon/oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). Modeling its bolometric light curve, we find a 56 Ni mass of 1.23 +0.14 −0.14 M and an ejecta mass of 1.75 +0.32 −0.20 M , in excess of the Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we discuss possible progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of SN 2020esm and, in general, the SC SNe Ia class.},

abstract = {Detailed spectropolarimetric studies may hold the key to probing the explosion mechanisms and the progenitor scenarios of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We present multi-epoch spectropolarimetry and imaging polarimetry of SN 2019ein, an SN Ia showing high expansion velocities at early phases. The spectropolarimetry sequence spans from ∼ −11 to +10 days relative to peak brightness in the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°µ-band. We find that the level of the continuum polarization of SN 2019ein, after subtracting estimated interstellar polarization, is in the range 0.0-0.3%, typical for SNe Ia. The polarization position angle remains roughly constant before and after the SN light-curve peak, implying that the inner regions share the same axisymmetry as the outer layers. We observe high polarization (∼ 1%) across both the Si {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6355 and Ca near-infrared triplet features. These two lines also display complex polarization modulations. The spectropolarimetric properties of SN 2019ein rule out a significant departure from spherical symmetry of the ejecta for up to a month after the explosion. These observations disfavour merger-induced and double-detonation models for SN 2019ein. The imaging polarimetry shows weak evidence for a modest increase in polarization after ∼ 20 days since the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°µ-band maximum. If this rise is real and is observed in other SNe Ia at similar phases, we may have seen, for the first time, an aspherical interior similar to what has been previously observed for SNe IIP. Future polarization observations of SNe Ia extending to post-peak epochs will help to examine the inner structure of the explosion.},

While this magnitude-limited survey has an unprecedented number of objects, it suffers from large distance uncertainties and lacks an estimation of host extinction. We bypass these issues by calculating the intrinsic luminosities from the shape parameters of the light curve's and bands, with the luminosities calibrated from the well observed SNe Ia sample of the Carnegie Supernova Project, allowing us to construct, for the first time, the intrinsic LF of SNe Ia. We then use a novel tight relation between the color stretch and the synthesized 56 Ni mass, Ni56 , to determine the Ni56 distribution of SNe Ia. We find that the LFs are unimodal, with their peaks in line with previous results, but have a much lower rate of dim events and luminous events. We show that the features on top of the unimodal LF-derived distributions are all compatible with statistical noise, consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions. We further derive, for the first time, the SNe Ia distribution of host galaxy extinction, and find a mean selective extinction of (−) ≈ 0.1 and a non-negligible fraction with large, > 1 mag, extinction in the optical bands. The high extinction is typical for luminous SNe, supporting their young population origin.},

Understanding the source of these properties could provide insight into the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. We aim to determine whether they are the result of the host galaxy's interstellar dust or circumstellar dust. This is accomplished by analysing the continuum polarization of 66 SNe Ia in dust-rich spiral galaxies and 13 SNe Ia in dust-poor elliptical galaxies as a function of normalised galactocentric distance. We find that there is a general trend of SNe Ia in spiral galaxies displaying increased polarization values when located closer to the host galaxies' centre, while SNe Ia in elliptical host galaxies display low polarization. Furthermore, all highly polarized SNe Ia in spiral host galaxies display polarization curves rising toward blue wavelengths, while no evidence of such polarization properties is shown in elliptical host galaxies. This indicates that the source of the peculiar polarization curves is likely the result of interstellar material as opposed to circumstellar material. The peculiar polarization and extinction properties observed toward some SNe Ia may be explained by the radiative torque disruption mechanism induced by the SN or the interstellar radiation field.},

We do not have a clean detection of Fe 55 , but find a limit of < Fe Co 0.22 55 57 with 99% confidence. These abundance ratios provide unique constraints on the progenitor system because the central density of the exploding white dwarf(s) dictates these nucleosynthetic yields. The observed ratios strongly prefer the lower central densities of double-degenerate models (= Fe Co 0.27 55 57) over the higher central densities of near-Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate models (= Fe Co 0.68 55 57).

abstract = {The mechanism for the blue and excessive early-phase emission reported within the first few days of several Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been suggested to be the interaction of the SN ejecta with either a non-degenerate companion star or circumstellar media (CSM). Recently, another mechanism has been suggested within the context of the He-detonation-triggered SN scenario (i.e., the double-detonation scenario or He-ignited violent merger), in which the radioactive isotopes in the outermost layer of the SN ejecta produce the early emission. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the excessive early-phase emission predicted by these different scenarios. The early flash in the He-detonation scenario shows behaviors different from those in the companion/CSM interaction scenarios. Especially clear diagnostics are provided once the behaviors in the UV and in the optical are combined. The spectra synthesized for the He-detonation scenario are characterized by absorptions due to He-detonation products, which develop in the decay phase. We further expect a relation between the properties of the early-phase flash and those of the maximum SN emission, in such a way that the brighter and slower initial flash is accompanied by a more substantial effect from the additional absorptions (and reddening). This relation, however, should be considered together with the maximum luminosity of the SN, since the larger luminosity suppresses the effect of the additional absorption. With these expected features, we address the possible origins of the excessive early-phase emission observed in several SNe.},

The SN2017cbv reached a B-band maximum of 11.710±0.006 mag, with a postmaximum magnitude decline of $\Delta$m 15 (B)=0.990±0.013 mag. The SN suffered no host reddening based on Phillips intrinsic color, the Lira-Phillips relation, and the CMAGIC diagram. By employing the CMAGIC distance modulus $\mu$=30.58±0.05 mag and assuming H 0 =72 km s −1 Mpc −1 , we found that 0.73 M e 56 Ni was synthesized during the explosion of SN2017cbv, which is consistent with estimates using reddening-and distance-free methods via the phases of the secondary maximum of the near-IR-(NIR-) band light curves. We also present 14 NIR spectra from −18 to +49days relative to the B-band maximum light, providing constraints on the amount of swept-up hydrogen from the companion star in the context of the single degenerate progenitor scenario. No Pa$\beta$ emission feature was detected from our postmaximum NIR spectra, placing a hydrogen mass upper limit of 0.1 M e. The overall optical/NIR photometric and NIR spectral evolution of SN2017cbv is similar to that of a normal SNIa, even though its early evolution is marked by a flux excess not seen in most other well-observed normal SNeIa.

The optical light curves and spectra are consistent with a normal SN Ia. Compared to previous photometric samples in the near-ultraviolet (NUV), SN2017erp has UV colors that are redder than NUV-blue SNe Ia corrected to similar optical colors. The chromatic difference between SNe 2011fe and 2017erp is dominated by the intrinsic differences in the UV rather than the expected dust reddening. This chromatic difference is similar to the SALT2 color law, derived from rest-frame ultraviolet photometry of higher redshift SNe Ia. Differentiating between intrinsic UV diversity and dust reddening can have important consequences for determining cosmological distances with rest-frame ultraviolet photometry. This ultraviolet spectroscopic series is the first from HST of a normal, albeit reddened, NUV-red SN Ia and is important for analyzing SNe Ia with intrinsically redder NUV colors. We show model comparisons suggesting that metallicity could be the physical difference between NUV-blue and NUV-red SNe Ia, with emission peaks from reverse fluorescence near 3000 {\AA}implying a factor of ∼10 higher metallicity in the upper layers of SN2017erp compared to SN2011fe. Metallicity estimates are very model dependent, however, and there are multiple effects in the UV.

abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2017cbv in NGC 5643 is one of a handful of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) reported to have excess blue emission at early times. This paper presents extensive BVRIYJHK s-band light curves of SN2017cbv, covering the phase from −16 to +125 days relative to B-band maximum light. The SN2017cbv reached a B-band maximum of 11.710±0.006 mag, with a postmaximum magnitude decline of $\Delta$m 15 (B)=0.990±0.013 mag. The SN suffered no host reddening based on Phillips intrinsic color, the Lira-Phillips relation, and the CMAGIC diagram. By employing the CMAGIC distance modulus $\mu$=30.58±0.05 mag and assuming H 0 =72 km s −1 Mpc −1 , we found that 0.73 M e 56 Ni was synthesized during the explosion of SN2017cbv, which is consistent with estimates using reddening-and distance-free methods via the phases of the secondary maximum of the near-IR-(NIR-) band light curves. We also present 14 NIR spectra from −18 to +49days relative to the B-band maximum light, providing constraints on the amount of swept-up hydrogen from the companion star in the context of the single degenerate progenitor scenario. No Pa$\beta$ emission feature was detected from our postmaximum NIR spectra, placing a hydrogen mass upper limit of 0.1 M e. The overall optical/NIR photometric and NIR spectral evolution of SN2017cbv is similar to that of a normal SNIa, even though its early evolution is marked by a flux excess not seen in most other well-observed normal SNeIa. We also compare the exquisite light curves of SN2017cbv with some M ch delayed detonation models and sub-M ch double detonation models.

abstract = {We present detailed ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared light curves of the TypeIa supernova (SN) 2012fr, which exploded in the Fornax cluster member NGC1365. These precise high-cadence light curves provide a dense coverage of the flux evolution from −12 to +140 days with respect to the epoch of B-band maximum (t B max). Supplementary imaging at the earliest epochs reveals an initial slow and nearly linear rise in luminosity with a duration of ∼2.5 days, followed by a faster rising phase that is well reproduced by an explosion model with a moderate amount of 56 Ni mixing in the ejecta. From our analysis of the light curves, we conclude that: (i) the explosion occurred <22 hr before the first detection of the supernova, (ii) the rise time to peak bolometric ($\lambda$>1800 {\AA}) luminosity was 16.5±0.6 days, (iii) the supernova suffered little or no host-galaxy dust reddening, (iv) the peak luminosity in both the optical and near-infrared was consistent with the bright end of normal TypeIa diversity, and (v) 0.60±0.15 M e of 56 Ni was synthesized in the explosion. Despite its normal luminosity, SN2012fr displayed unusually prevalent high-velocity Ca II and Si II absorption features, and a nearly constant photospheric velocity of the Si II $\lambda$6355 line at ∼12,000 km s 1-that began ∼5 days before t B max. We also highlight some of the other peculiarities in the early phase photometry and the spectral evolution. SN2012fr also adds to a growing number of TypeIa supernovae that are hosted by galaxies with direct Cepheid distance measurements.},

The observations range from −15 to +185 d for SN 2009ig and from −14 to 316 d for SN 2012cg, with respect to maximum light in B band. Both SN 2009ig and SN 2012cg exhibit similar properties. They have similar decline rate parameter (m 15 (B) true = 0.92 ± 0.04 for SN 2009ig and 0.93 ± 0.06 for SN 2012cg) and B band peak absolute magnitude (−19.45 ± 0.40 mag for SN 2009ig and −19.50 ± 0.31 mag for SN 2012cg). Their early spectra show high-velocity features in Si II and Ca II lines. The strong Fe III, Si III, and weak Si II $\lambda$5972 line during pre-maximum phase are indicative of hot photosphere. The post-maximum velocity evolution shows a plateau like phase with velocities ∼13 000 km s −1 for SN 2009ig and ∼10 000 km s −1 for SN 2012cg. Both events show spectral evolution similar to normal SNe Ia and fall in LVG and Core Normal subgroup. Both have smaller strength ratio [R(Si II) = 0.17 for SN 2009ig and 0.20 for SN 2012cg] consistent with smaller m 15 (B). Peak bolometric luminosities (log L max bol) of these events are estimated as 43.17 ± 0.16 and 43.24 ± 0.11 erg s −1 suggesting that 0.60 ± 0.20 M of 56 Ni was synthesized in the explosion of SN 2009ig and 0.72 ± 0.31 M in SN 2012cg.},

abstract = {We present a comparative study of absolute distances to a sample of very nearby, bright Type Ia supernovae (SNe) derived from high cadence, high signal-to-noise, multi-band photometric data. Our sample consists of four SNe: 2012cg, 2012ht, 2013dy and 2014J. We present new homogeneous, high-cadence photometric data in Johnson-Cousins BVRI and Sloan g′r′i′z′ bands taken from two sites (Piszkesteto and Baja, Hungary), and the light curves are analyzed with publicly available light curve fitters (MLCS2k2, SNooPy2 and SALT2.4). When comparing the best-fit parameters provided by the different codes, it is found that the distance moduli of moderately reddened SNe Ia agree within 0.2 mag, and the agreement is even better (0.1 mag) for the highest signal-to-noise BVRI data. For the highly reddened SN2014J the dispersion of the inferred distance moduli is slightly higher. These SN-based distances are in good agreement with the Cepheid distances to their host galaxies. We conclude that the current state-of-the-art light curve fitters for Type Ia SNe can provide consistent absolute distance moduli having less than ∼0.1-0.2 mag uncertainty for nearby SNe. Still, there is room for future improvements to reach the desired ∼0.05 mag accuracy in the absolute distance modulus.},

We rule out the popular mechanism of a circumstellar interaction suggested for the bump explanation. Instead we propose that the postmaximum bump is caused by the magnetar dipole field enhancement several months after the explosion. The modeling of SN 2019stc light curve based on the thin shell approximation implies that at the age of ∼ 90 days the initial dipole magnetic field should be amplified by a factor of 2.8 to account for the postmaximum bump. The specific mechanism for the field amplification of the newborn magnetar on the timescale of several months has yet to be identified.},

abstract = {The measurement of precise absolute fluxes for stellar sources has been pursued with increased vigor since the discovery of the dark energy and the realization that its detailed understanding requires accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of redshifted Ia supernovae in the rest frame. The flux distributions of spectrophotometric standard stars were initially derived from the comparison of stars to laboratory sources of known flux but are now mostly based on calculated model atmospheres. For example, pure hydrogen white dwarf (WD) models provide the basis for the HST CALSPEC archive of flux standards. The basic equations for quantitative spectrophotometry and photometry are explained in detail. Several historical lab based flux calibrations are reviewed; and the SEDs of stars in the major on-line astronomical databases are compared to the CALSPEC reference standard spectrophotometry. There is good evidence that relative fluxes from the visible to the near-IR wavelength of ∼2.5 µm are currently accurate to 1% for the primary reference standards; and new comparisons with lab flux standards show promise for improving that precision.},

abstract = {The observed magnifications and light curves of the quadruply-imaged iPTF16geu supernova (SN) offers a unique opportunity to study a lens system with a variety of independent constraints. The four observed positions can be used to constrain the macrolens model. The magnifications and light curves at the four SN positions are more useful to constrain microlensing models. We define the macrolens model as a combination of a baryonic component that traces the observed light distribution, and a dark matter halo component. We constrain the macrolens model using the positional constraints given by the 4 observed images, and compare it with the best model obtained when magnification constraints are included. We find that the magnification can not be explained by a macrolens model alone, and that contributions from substructures such as microlenses are needed to explain the observed magnifications. We consider microlens models based on the inferred stellar mass from the baryonic component of the macrolens model, and use the observed magnification and light curves to constrain the contribution from microlenses. We compute the likelihood of a variety of macro+micro lens models where we vary the dark matter halo, baryonic component, and microlens configurations. We use information about the position, magnification and, for the first time, the lightcurves of the four observed SN images. We combine macrolens and microlens models in order to reproduce the observations; the four SN positions, magnifications, and lack of fluctuations in the light curves. After marginalizing over the model parameters, we find that larger stellar surface mass densities are preferred. This result suggests that the mass of the baryonic component is dominated by its stellar component. We conclude that microlensing from the baryonic component suffices to explain the observed flux ratios and light curves.},

abstract = {We report observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of Cepheid variables in the host galaxies of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) used to calibrate the Hubble constant (H 0). These include the complete sample of all suitable SNe Ia discovered in the last four decades at z ≤ 0.01, collected and calibrated from ≥ 1000 HST orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of the direct determination of H 0. The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in NGC 4258 (here tripling that sample of Cepheids), and detached eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud. All Cepheids in these anchors and SN Ia hosts were measured with the same instrument (WFC3) and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) to negate zeropoint errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and six tests of background determinations that show Cepheid measurements are accurate in the presence of crowding. The SNe Ia in these hosts calibrate the magnitude-redshift relation from the revised Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SNe data and with host properties and SN surveys matched throughout to negate systematics. We decrease the uncertainty in the local determination of H 0 to 1 km s −1 Mpc −1 including systematics. We present results for a comprehensive set of nearly 70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H 0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, redshift ranges, the treatment of Cepheid dust, metallicity, form of the period-luminosity relation, SN color, peculiar-velocity corrections, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of the expansion history. Our baseline result from the Cepheid-SN Ia sample is H 0 = 73.04 ± 1.04 km s −1 Mpc −1 , which includes systematic uncertainties and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN Ia hosts and NGC 4258, and include them simultaneously to yield 72.53 ± 0.99 km s −1 Mpc −1. The inclusion of high-redshift SNe Ia yields H 0 = 73.30 ± 1.04 km s −1 Mpc −1 and q 0 = −0.51 ± 0.024. We find a 5$\sigma$ difference with the prediction of H 0 from Planck CMB observations under $\Lambda$CDM, with no indication that the discrepancy arises from measurement uncertainties or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining the Hubble constant remains unknown.},

In this paper, we show that WD mergers naturally produce highly-magnetized, uniformly-rotating WDs, including a substantial population within a narrow mass range close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M Ch). These near-M Ch WD mergers subsequently undergo rapid spin up and compression on a ∼ 10 2 yr timescale, either leading to central ignition and a normal SN Ia via the DDT mechanism, or alternatively to a failed detonation and SN Iax through pure deflagration. The resulting SNe Ia and SNe Iax will have spectra, light curves, polarimetry, and nucleosynthetic yields similar to those predicted to arise through the canoni-cal near-M Ch single degenerate (SD) channel, but with a t −1 delay time distribution characteristic of the double-degenerate (DD) channel. Furthermore, in contrast to the SD channel, WD merger near-M Ch SNe Ia and SNe Iax will not produce observable companion signatures. We discuss a range of implications of these findings, from SNe Ia explosion mechanisms, to galactic nucleosynthesis of iron peak elements including manganese.},

abstract = {The success of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) distance standardisation for cosmology relies on a single global linear relationship between their peak luminosity and colour, the $\beta$ parameter. However, there are several pieces of evidence and physical reasons to believe that this relation is not universal and may change within different subgroups, or even among individual objects. In this work, we allow $\beta$ to vary among subpopulations with different observed properties in the cosmological fits. Although the inferred cosmological parameters are consistent with previous studies that assume a single colour-luminosity relation, we find that the SN data favour nonuniversal distributions of $\beta$ when split according to SN colour and/or host-galaxy mass. For galaxy mass, we obtain a $\beta$-step relation in which low $\beta$ values occur in more massive galaxies, a trend that can be explained by differing dust reddening laws for two types of environments. For colour, we find that bluer/redder SNe Ia are consistent with a lower/larger $\beta$. This trend is explained with $\beta$ being a combination of a low intrinsic colour-luminosity relation dominant in bluer SNe and a higher extrinsic reddening relation dominant at redder colours. The host galaxy mass-step correction always provides better distance calibration, regardless of the multiple $\beta$ approaches, and we suggest that it may come from a difference in intrinsic colour-luminosity properties of SNe Ia in two types of environments. Additionally, we find that blue SNe in low-mass environments are better standard candles than the others.},

abstract = {We use type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II/SNe) in combination with the publicly available SDSS DR16 fiber spectroscopy of their host galaxies to correlate SNe Ia light-curve parameters and Hubble residuals to several host galaxy properties. Fixed-aperture fiber spectroscopy suffers from aperture effects: the fraction of the galaxy covered by the fiber varies depending on its projected size on the sky, thus measured properties are not representative of the whole galaxy. The advent of Integral Field Spectroscopy has provided a way for correcting the missing light, by studying how these galaxy parameters change with the aperture size. Here we study how the standard SN host galaxy relations change once global host galaxy parameters are corrected for aperture effects. We recover previous trends on SN Hubble residuals with host galaxy properties, but we find that discarding objects with poor fiber coverage instead of correcting for aperture loss introduces biases in the sample that affect SN host galaxy relations. The net effect of applying the commonly used g-band fraction criterion is discarding intrinsically faint SNe Ia in high-mass galaxies, thus artificially increasing the height of the mass step by 0.02 mag and its significance. Current and next generation of fixed-aperture fiber spectroscopy surveys, such as DES, DESI or TiDES in 4MOST, that aim at study SN and galaxy correlations must consider, and correct for, these effects.},

abstract = {In accreting WDs approaching the Chandrasekhar limit, hydrostatic carbon burning precedes the dynamical breakout. During this simmering phase, e-captures are energetically favored in the central region of the star, while $\beta$-decay are favored more outside, and the two zones are connected by a growing convective instability. We analyze the interplay between weak interactions and convection, the so-called convective URCA process, during the simmering phase of SNe Ia progenitors and its effects on the physical and chemical properties at the explosion epoch. At variance with previous studies, we find that the convective core powered by the carbon burning remains confined within the 21 (Ne,F) URCA shell. As a result, a much larger amount of carbon has to be consumed before the explosion which eventually occurs at larger density than previously estimated. In addition, we find that the extension of the convective core and its average neutronization depend on the the WD progenitor initial metallicity. For the average neutronization in the convective core at the explosion epoch we obtain $\eta$ exp = (1.094 ± 0.143) × 10 −3 + (9.168 ± 0.677) × 10 −2 × Z. Outside the convective core, the neutronization is instead determined by the initial amount of C+N+O in the progenitor star. Since S, Ca, Cr and Mn, the elements usually exploited to evaluate the pre-explosive neutronization, are mainly produced outside the heavily neutronized core, the problem of too high metallicity estimated for the progenitosr of the historical Tycho and Kepler SNe Ia remains unsolved.},

abstract = {We present detailed investigation of a specific i-band light-curve feature in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the rapid cadence and high signal-to-noise ratio light-curves obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project. The feature is present in most SNe Ia and emerges a few days after the i-band maximum. It is an abrupt change in curvature in the light-curve over a few days and appears as a flattening in mild cases and a strong downward concave shape, or a "kink", in the most extreme cases. We computed the second derivatives of Gaussian Process interpolations to study 54 rapid-cadence light-curves. From the second derivatives we measure: 1) the timing of the feature in days relative to i-band maximum; tdm 2 (i) and 2) the strength and direction of the concavity in mag d −2 ; dm 2 (i). 76% of the SNe Ia show a negative dm 2 (i), representing a downward concavity-either a mild flattening or a strong "kink." The tdm 2 (i) parameter is shown to correlate with the color-stretch parameter s BV , a SN Ia primary parameter. The dm 2 (i) parameter shows no correlation with s BV and therefore provides independent information. It is also largely independent of the spectroscopic and environmental properties. Dividing the sample based on the strength of the light-curve feature as measured by dm 2 (i), SNe Ia with strong features have a Hubble diagram dispersion of 0.107 mag, 0.075 mag smaller than the group with weak features. Although larger samples should be obtained to test this result, it potentially offers a new method for improving SN Ia distance determinations without shifting to more costly near-infrared or spectroscopic observations.},

abstract = {We present observations of SN 2021csp, the second example of a newly-identified type of supernova (Type Icn) hallmarked by strong, narrow, P Cygni carbon features at early times. The SN appears as a fast and luminous blue transient at early times, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of −20 within 3 days due to strong interaction between fast SN ejecta (v ≈ 30000 km s −1) and a massive, dense, fast-moving C/O wind shed by the WC-like progenitor months before explosion. The narrow line features disappear from the spectrum 10-20 days after explosion and are replaced by a blue continuum dominated by broad Fe features, reminiscent of Type Ibn and IIn supernovae and indicative of weaker interaction with more extended H/He-poor material. The transient then abruptly fades ∼ 60 days post-explosion when interaction ceases. Deep limits at later phases suggest minimal heavy-element nucleosynthesis, a low ejecta mass, or both, and imply an origin distinct from that of classical Type Ic supernovae. We place SN 2021csp in context with other fast-evolving interacting transients, and discuss various progenitor scenarios: an ultrastripped progenitor star, a pulsational pair-instability eruption, or a jet-driven fallback supernova from a Wolf-Rayet star. The fallback scenario would naturally explain the similarity between these events and radio-loud fast transients, and suggests a picture in which most stars massive enough to undergo a WR phase collapse directly to black holes at the end of their lives. d.a.perley@ljmu.ac.uk 2 Perley et al.},

abstract = {Recent observational evidence has demonstrated that white dwarf (WD) mergers are a highly efficient mechanism for mass accretion onto WDs in the galaxy. In this paper, we show that WD mergers naturally produce highly-magnetized, uniformly-rotating WDs, including a substantial population within a narrow mass range close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M Ch). These near-M Ch WD mergers subsequently undergo rapid spin up and compression on a ∼ 10 2 yr timescale, either leading to central ignition and a normal SN Ia via the DDT mechanism, or alternatively to a failed detonation and SN Iax through pure deflagration. The resulting SNe Ia and SNe Iax will have spectra, light curves, polarimetry, and nucleosynthetic yields similar to those predicted to arise through the canoni-cal near-M Ch single degenerate (SD) channel, but with a t −1 delay time distribution characteristic of the double-degenerate (DD) channel. Furthermore, in contrast to the SD channel, WD merger near-M Ch SNe Ia and SNe Iax will not produce observable companion signatures. We discuss a range of implications of these findings, from SNe Ia explosion mechanisms, to galactic nucleosynthesis of iron peak elements including manganese.},

Understanding the source of these properties could provide insight into the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. We aim to determine whether they are the result of the host galaxy's interstellar dust or circumstellar dust. This is accomplished by analysing the continuum polarization of 66 SNe Ia in dust-rich spiral galaxies and 13 SNe Ia in dust-poor elliptical galaxies as a function of normalised galactocentric distance. We find that there is a general trend of SNe Ia in spiral galaxies displaying increased polarization values when located closer to the host galaxies' centre, while SNe Ia in elliptical host galaxies display low polarization. Furthermore, all highly polarized SNe Ia in spiral host galaxies display polarization curves rising toward blue wavelengths, while no evidence of such polarization properties is shown in elliptical host galaxies. This indicates that the source of the peculiar polarization curves is likely the result of interstellar material as opposed to circumstellar material. The peculiar polarization and extinction properties observed toward some SNe Ia may be explained by the radiative torque disruption mechanism induced by the SN or the interstellar radiation field.},

New low polarisation measurements solidify the claim that most SN Ia explosions are globally spherically symmetric (clumps are possible). Explosions by dynamical processes, like explosions that take place during a merger process of two white dwarfs (WDs) in the double degenerate (DD) scenario, or during an accretion process in the double detonation (DDet) scenario and in the single degenerate (SD) scenario, lead to non-spherical explosions, in contradiction with observations of normal SNe Ia. I argue that these (DD, DDet, SD) scenarios account mainly for peculiar SNe Ia. The explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass (MCH) WD (deflagration to detonation process) has a global spherical structure that is compatible with observations. To reach spherical explosions, SN Ia scenarios should allow for a time delay between the formation of an MCh-WD and its explosion. As such, I split the DD scenario to a channel without merger to explosion delay (MED) time (that forms mainly peculiar SNe Ia), and a channel with a MED, the DD-MED channel (scenario). I speculate that the main contributors to normal SNe Ia are the core degenerate (CD) scenario, the DD-MED scenario, both have MCH spherical explosions, and the DD scenario that has sub-CCH non-spherical explosions.},

To investigate this tension, we estimate $H_{0}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models by dividing the Pantheon sample, the largest compilation of SNe Ia, into 3, 4, 20 and 40 bins. We fit the extracted $H_{0}$ values with a function mimicking the redshift evolution: $g(z)={H_0}(z)=\tilde{H}_0/(1+z)^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ indicates an evolutionary parameter and $\tilde{H}_0=H_0$ at $z=0$. We set the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia so that $H_0=73.5\,\, \textrm{km s}^{-1}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and we fix fiducial values for $\Omega_{0m}^{\Lambda CDM}=0.298$ and $\Omega_{0m}^{w_{0}w_{a}CDM}=0.308$. We find that $H_0$ evolves with redshift, showing a slowly decreasing trend, with $\alpha$ coefficients consistent with zero only from 1.2 to 2.0 $\sigma$. Although the $\alpha$ coefficients are compatible with 0 in 3 $\sigma$, this however may affect cosmological results. We measure locally a variation of $H_0(z=0)-H_0(z=1)=0.4\, \textrm{km s}^{-1}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in 3 and 4 bins. Extrapolating ${H_0}(z)$ to $z=1100$, the redshift of the last scattering surface, we obtain values of $H_0$ compatible in 1 $\sigma$ with Planck measurements independently of cosmological models and number of bins we investigated. Thus, we have reduced the $H_0$ tension from $54\%$ to $72\%$ for the $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models, respectively. If the decreasing trend of $H_0(z)$ is real, it could be due to astrophysical selection effects or to modified gravity.},

We find that an ejecta-DOM interaction can fit the early light curve of SN 2018oh better than an ejecta-companion interaction in the single degenerate scenario. By composing the DOM from two components that were ejected in the merger process with two different velocities, we show that the ejecta-DOM interaction can account for the linear rise in the light curve, while the ejecta-companion interaction predicts too steep a rise. In addition, the ejecta-DOM interaction does not predict the presence of hydrogen and helium lines in nebular spectra, and hence does not suffer from this major drawback of the ejecta-companion model. We consider the ejecta-DOM interaction to be the most likely explanation for the early excess emission in SN 2018oh.

abstract = {Context. There are now strong indications that white dwarf (WD) stars with masses well below the Chandrasekhar limit (M Ch ≈ 1.4 M) contribute a significant fraction of SN Ia progenitors. The relative fraction of stable iron-group elements synthesized in the explosion has been suggested as a possible discriminant between M Ch and sub-M Ch events. In particular, it is thought that the higher-density ejecta of M Ch WDs, which favours the synthesis of stable isotopes of nickel, results in prominent [Ni ii] lines in late-time spectra (150 d past explosion). Aims. We study the explosive nucleosynthesis of stable nickel in SNe Ia resulting from M Ch and sub-M Ch progenitors, and explore the potential for lines of [Ni ii] in the optical an near-infrared (at 7378 {\AA} and 1.94 µm) in late-time spectra to serve as a diagnostic of the exploding WD mass. Methods. We review stable Ni yields in a large variety of published SN Ia models. Using 1D M Ch delayed-detonation and sub-M Ch detonation models, we study the synthesis of stable Ni isotopes (in particular 58 Ni), and investigate the formation of [Ni ii] lines using nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations with the CMFGEN code. Results. We confirm that stable Ni production is in general more efficient in M Ch explosions at solar metallicity (typically 0.02-0.08 M for the 58 Ni isotope), but note that the 58 Ni yields in sub-M Ch events systematically exceed 0.01 M for WDs more massive than one solar mass. We find that the radiative proton-capture reaction 57 Co(p, $\gamma$) 58 Ni is the dominant production mode for 58 Ni in both M Ch and sub-M Ch models, while the $\alpha$-capture reaction on 54 Fe has a negligible impact on the final 58 Ni yield. More importantly, we demonstrate that the lack of [Ni ii] lines in late-time spectra of sub-M Ch events is not always due to an under-abundance of stable Ni, but results from the higher ionization of Ni in the inner ejecta. Conversely, the strong [Ni ii] lines predicted in our 1D M Ch models are completely suppressed when 56 Ni is sufficiently mixed with the innermost layers rich in stable iron-group elements. Conclusions. [Ni ii] lines in late-time SN Ia spectra have a complex dependency on the abundance of stable Ni, which limits their use alone in distinguishing between M Ch and sub-M Ch progenitors. However, we argue that a low-luminosity SN Ia displaying strong [Ni ii] lines would most likely result from a Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae are understood to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, yet the evolutionary mechanisms leading to such events remain unknown. Many proposed channels, including the classical single-degenerate scenario, invoke a hot, luminous evolutionary phase for the progenitor, in which it is a prodigious source of photoionizing emission. Here, we examine the environment of SN 2014J for evidence of a photoionized nebula in pre-and post-explosion [O III] $\lambda$5007 {\AA} and H $\beta$ images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. From the absence of any extended emission, we exclude a stable nuclear-burning white dwarf at the location of SN 2014J in the last ∼100 000 years, assuming a typical warm interstellar medium (ISM) particle density of 1 cm −3. These limits greatly exceed existing X-ray constraints at temperatures typical of known supersoft sources. Significant extreme-UV/soft X-ray emission prior to explosion remains plausible for lower ISM densities (e.g. n ISM ∼ 0.1 cm −3). In this case, however, any putative nebula would be even more extended, allowing deeper follow-up observations to resolve this ambiguity in the near future.},

abstract = {We present an optical nebular spectrum of the nearby Type Ia supernova 2011fe, obtained 981 d after explosion. SN 2011fe exhibits little evolution since the +593 d optical spectrum, but there are several curious aspects in this new extremely late-time regime. We suggest that the persistence of the ∼5800 {\AA} feature is due to Na I D, and that a new emission feature at ∼7300 {\AA} may be [Ca II]. Also, we discuss whether the new emission feature at ∼6400 {\AA} might be [Fe I] or the high-velocity hydrogen predicted by Mazzali et al. The nebular feature at 5200 {\AA} exhibits a linear velocity evolution of ∼350 km s −1 per 100 d from at least +220 to +980 d, but the line's shape also changes in this time, suggesting that line blending contributes to the evolution. At ∼1000 d after explosion, flux from the SN has declined to a point where contribution from a luminous secondary could be detected. In this work, we make the first observational tests for a post-impact remnant star and constrain its temperature and luminosity to T 10 4 K and L 10 4 L. Additionally, we do not see any evidence for narrow H $\alpha$ emission in our spectrum. We conclude that observations continue to strongly exclude many single-degenerate scenarios for SN 2011fe.},

abstract = {In this Letter we present an optical spectrum of SN 2011fe taken 1034 d after the explosion, several hundred days later than any other spectrum of a Type Ia supernova (disregarding light-echo spectra and Local Group remnants). The spectrum is still dominated by broad emission features, with no trace of a light echo or interaction of the supernova ejecta with surrounding interstellar material. Comparing this extremely late spectrum to an earlier one taken 331 d after the explosion, we find that the most prominent feature at 331 d-[Fe III] emission around 4700 {\AA}-has entirely faded away, suggesting a significant change in the ionization state. Instead, [Fe II] lines are probably responsible for most of the emission at 1034 d. An emission feature at 6300-6400 {\AA} has newly developed at 1034 d, which we tentatively identify with Fe I $\lambda$6359, [Fe I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6231, 6394 or [O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364. Interestingly, the features in the 1034 d spectrum seem to be collectively redshifted, a phenomenon that we currently have no convincing explanation for. We discuss the implications of our findings for explosion models, but conclude that sophisticated spectral modelling is required for any firm statement.},

abstract = {When a core-collapse supernova explodes in a binary star system, the ejecta might encounter an overdense shell, where the stellar winds of the two stars previously collided. In this work, we investigate effects of such interactions on supernova light curves on timescales from the early flash ionization signatures to approximately one year after the explosion. We construct a model of the colliding-wind shell in an orbiting binary star system and we provide an analytical expression for the shell thickness and density, which we calibrate with three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical simulations probing different ratios of wind momenta and different regimes of radiative cooling efficiency. We model the angle-dependent interaction of supernova ejecta with the circumstellar medium and estimate the shock radiative efficiency with a realistic cooling function. We find that the radiated shock power exceeds typical Type IIP supernova luminosity only for double red supergiant binaries with mass ratios {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± 0.9, wind mass-loss rates {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± 10 −4 M yr −1 , and separations between about 50 and 1500 au. The required {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± increases for binaries with smaller {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± or primaries with faster wind. We estimate that 1 per cent of all collapsing massive stars satisfy the conditions on binary mass ratio and separation. Recombination luminosities due to colliding wind shells are at most a factor of 10 higher than for an otherwise unperturbed constant-velocity wind, but higher densities associated with wind acceleration close to the star provide much stronger signal.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of massive white dwarfs (WDs). We present the first study of multidimensional effects during the final hours prior to the thermonuclear runaway that leads to the explosion. The calculations utilize an implicit, two-dimensional hydrodynamic code. Mixing and the ignition process are studied in detail. We find that the initial chemical structure of the WD is changed, but the material is not fully homogenized. In particular, the exploding WD sustains a central region with a low C/O ratio. This implies that the explosive nuclear burning will begin in a partially carbon-depleted environment. The thermonuclear runaway happens in a well-defined region close to the center. It is induced by compressional heat when matter is brought inward by convective flows. We find no evidence for multiple spot or strong off-center ignition. Convective velocities in the WD are on the order of 100 km s {\`{A}}1 , which is well above the effective burning speeds in SNe Ia previously expected right after the runaway. In our calculations , the ignition occurs near the center. Then, for % 0:5 1 s, the speed of the burning front will neither be determined by the laminar speed nor the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities but by convective flows produced prior to the runaway. The consequences are discussed for our understanding of the detailed physics of the flame propagation, the deflagration to detonation transition, and the nucleosynthesis in the central layers. Our results strongly suggest the preconditioning of the progenitor as a key factor for our understanding of the diversity in SNe Ia.},

The stacked PTF light curve provides densely sampled coverage down to R 22 mag over 200-620 d past explosion. Combining with literature data, we estimate the pseudo-bolometric light curve for this event from 200 to 1600 d after explosion, and constrain the likely near-infrared (Near-IR) contribution. This light curve shows a smooth decline consistent with radioactive decay, except over ∼450 to ∼600 d where the light curve appears to decrease faster than expected based on the radioactive isotopes presumed to be present, before flattening at around 600 d. We model the 200-1600 d pseudo-bolometric light curve with the luminosity generated by the radioactive decay chains of 56 Ni, 57 Ni and 55 Co, and find it is not consistent with models that have full positron trapping and no infrared catastrophe (IRC); some additional energy escape other than optical/near-IR photons is required. However, the light curve is consistent with models that allow for positron escape (reaching 75 per cent by day 500) and/or an IRC (with 85 per cent of the flux emerging in non-optical wavelengths by day 600). The presence of the 57 Ni decay chain is robustly detected, but the 55 Co decay chain is not formally required, with an upper mass limit estimated at 0.014 M. The measurement of the 57 Ni/ 56 Ni mass ratio is subject to significant systematic uncertainties, but all of our fits require a high ratio >0.031 (>1.3 in solar abundances).},

abstract = {SN 2019yvr is the second Type Ib supernova (SN) with a direct detection of its progenitor (system); however, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the pre-explosion source appears much cooler and overluminous than an expected helium-star progenitor. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and MUSE integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy, we find the SN environment contains three episodes of star formation; the low ejecta mass suggests the SN progenitor is most likely from the oldest population, corresponding to an initial mass of 10.4 +1.5 −1.3 {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±. The pre-explosion SED can be reproduced by two components, one for the hot and compact SN progenitor and one for a cool and inflated yellow hypergiant (YHG) companion that dominates the brightness. Thus, SN 2019yvr could possibly be the first Type Ib/c SN for which the progenitor's binary companion is directly detected on pre-explosion images. Both the low progenitor mass and the YHG companion suggest significant binary interaction during their evolution. Similar to SN 2014C, SN 2019yvr exhibits a metamorphosis from Type Ib to Type IIn, showing signatures of interaction with hydrogen-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at >150 days; our result supports enhanced pre-SN mass loss as an important process for hydrogen-poor stars at the low mass end of core-collapse SN progenitors.},

abstract = {The Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to process ∼10 6 transient detections per night. To use these transients for precision measurements of cosmological parameters and rates studies, it is critical to understand the detection efficiency, magnitude limits, artifact contamination levels, and biases in the selection and photometry. Here we rigorously test the LSST Difference Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline using simulated images from the Rubin Observatory LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge (DC2) simulation for the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey area. DC2 is the first large-scale (300 deg 2) image simulation of a transient survey that includes realistic cadence, variable observing conditions, and CCD image artifacts. We analyze ∼15 deg 2 of DC2 over a 5-year time-span in which artificial point-sources from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) light curves have been overlaid onto the images. We measure the detection efficiency as a function of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and find a 50% efficiency at SNR = 5.8 averaged over all bands. The corresponding magnitude limits for each filter are: u = 23.66, g = 24.69, r = 24.06, i = 23.45, z = 22.54, y = 21.62 mag. The artifact contamination levels is ∼ 90% of all detections, corresponding to ∼ 1000 artifacts/deg 2 n g band, and falling to 300/deg 2 n y band. The recovered photometry has biases < 1% for magnitudes 19.5 < m < 23. We show that our DIA performance on simulated images is similar to that of the Dark Energy Survey difference-imaging pipeline applied to real images. We also characterize DC2 image properties to produce catalog-level simulations needed for distance bias corrections. We find good agreement between DC2 data and simulations for distributions of SNR, redshift, and fitted light-curve properties. Applying a realistic SNIa-cosmology analysis for redshifts z < 1, we recover the input cosmology parameters to within statistical uncertainties. Finally, we discuss further applications of this dataset and analysis, and we suggest pipeline improvements before LSST operations begins.},

abstract = {In recent years, dust masses of a few tenths of a solar mass have been found in the expanding ejecta of a number of core-collapse supernovae. How dust forms in such quantities remains poorly understood; theories of dust formation predict lower total masses and much faster formation rates than observations imply. One suggestion to reconcile observations and theory was made by Dwek et al. (2019), who proposed that the dust forms very rapidly, and because of its optical depth, is not initially observationally detectable, only being gradually revealed as the ejecta expand. Observational dust masses at early times would then only be lower limits. Using a large grid of radiative transfer models covering dust masses from 10 −4 to 1 M to calculate both the spectral energy distribution and the emission line profiles from clumpy dust shells, we show that this cannot be the case. Some clump distributions allow dust masses of ∼0.01 M to be concealed in clumps and still predict an SED consistent with the observations. However, these geometries predict emission line profiles which are inconsistent with the observations. Similarly, clump geometries which reproduce the observed emission line profiles with dust masses >0.01 M do not reproduce the SED. However, models with ∼10 −3 M of amorphous carbon can reproduce both the SED and the emission line profiles. We conclude that no large masses of dust can be hidden from view in the ejecta of SN 1987A at early epochs, and that the majority of dust must thus have formed at epochs >1000 days.},

Parameters are derived from the light curves and spectra such as peak brightness, decline rate, photospheric velocity and the widths and velocities of the forbidden nebular emission lines. We discuss the physical interpretations of these parameters for the individual SNe Ia and the sample in general, including comparisons to well-observed SNe Ia from the literature.

A subset of our late-time spectra are uncontaminated by host emission, and we statistically evaluate our non-detections of H $\alpha$ emission to limit the amount of hydrogen in these systems.

Additionally, we place a more tentative upper limit on HeI emission in the observed spectrum of $\lesssim 0.02\simM_\odot$ which also rules out helium star companions.

abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 03fg-like type Ia supernova (SN Ia) ASASSN-15hy from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR). ASASSN-15hy shares many of the hallmark characteristics of 03fg-like SNe Ia, previously referred to as "super-Chandrasekhar" SNe Ia. It is bright in the UV and NIR, lacks a clear i-band secondary maximum, shows a strong and persistent C II feature, and has a low Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity. However, some of its properties are also extreme among the subgroup. ASASSN-15hy is under-luminous (M$_{B,peak}=-19.14^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$ mag), red ($(B-V)_{Bmax}=0.18^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$ mag), yet slowly declining ($\Delta{m_{15}}(B)=0.72 \pm 0.04$ mag). It has the most delayed onset of the i-band maximum of any 03fg-like SN. ASASSN-15hy lacks the prominent H-band break emission feature that is typically present during the first month past maximum in normal SNe Ia. Such events may be a potential problem for high-redshift SN Ia cosmology. ASASSN-15hy may be explained in the context of an explosion of a degenerate core inside a non-degenerate envelope. The explosion impacting the non-degenerate envelope with a large mass provides additional luminosity and low ejecta velocities. An initial deflagration burning phase is critical in reproducing the low $^{56}$Ni mass and luminosity, while the large core mass is essential in providing the large diffusion time scales required to produce the broad light curves. The model consists of a rapidly rotating 1.47 $M_{\odot}$ degenerate core and a 0.8 $M_{\odot}$ non-degenerate envelope. This "deflagration core-degenerate" scenario may result from the merger between a white dwarf and the degenerate core of an asymptotic giant branch star.},

We find no evidence of stripped companion emission in any of the nebular-phase spectra. Upper limits are placed on the amount of mass that could go undetected in each spectrum using recent hydrodynamic simulations. With these null detections, we place an observational 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the fraction of SNe Ia that are produced through the classical H-rich non-degenerate companion scenario of < 5.5 per cent. Additionally, we set a tentative 3$\sigma$ upper limit otan He star progenitor scenarios of < 6.4 per cent, although further theoretical modelling is required. These limits refer to our most representative sample including normal, 91bg-like, 91T-like, and 'super-Chandrasekhar' SNe Ia but excluding SNe Iax and SNe Ia-CSM.

abstract = {We present a novel technique to study Type Ia supernovae by constraining surviving companions of historical ex-tragalactic SN by combining archival photographic plates and Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We demonstrate this technique for Supernova 1972E, the nearest known SN Ia in 125 years. Some models of SNe Ia describe a white dwarf with a non-degenerate companion that donates enough mass to trigger thermonuclear detonation. Hydrodynamic simulations and stellar evolution models show that these donor stars will survive the explosion, and show increased luminosity for at least a thousand years. Thus, late-time observations of the exact location of a supernova can constrain the presence of a surviving donor star and progenitor models. We find the explosion site of SN 1972E by analyzing 17 digitized photographic plates taken with the European Southern Observatory 1m Schmidt and 1 plate taken with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5m telescope. Using the Gaia eDR3 catalog to determine Supernova 1972E's location yields: $\alpha$ = 13 h 39 m 52.708 s ± 0.004 s and $\delta$ = −31 • 40' 8. 97 ± 0. 04 (ICRS). In 2005, HST /ACS imaged the host galaxy of SN 1972E with the F 435W , F 555W , and F 814W filters covering the explosion site. The nearest detected source is offset by 3.1 times our positional precision, and is inconsistent with the colors expected of a surviving donor star. Thus, the HST observation rules out all Helium-star companion models and the most luminous main-sequence companion model currently in the literature. The remaining main-sequence companion models could be tested with deeper HST imaging.},

abstract = {The white dwarf (WD) + helium (He) star binary channel plays an important role in the single degenerate scenario for the progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Previous studies on the WD + main sequence star evolution have shown that the magnetic fields of WDs may significantly influence their accretion and nuclear burning processes. In this work we focus on the evolution of magnetized WD + He star binaries with detailed stellar evolution and binary population synthesis (BPS) calculations. In the case of magnetized WDs, the magnetic fields may disrupt the inner regions of the accretion disk, funnel the accretion flow onto the polar caps, and even confine helium burning within the caps. We find that, for WDs with sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the parameter space of the potential SN Ia progenitor systems shrinks toward shorter orbital periods and lower donor masses compared with that in the non-magnetized WD case. The reason is that the magnetic confinement usually works with relatively high mass transfer rates, which can trigger strong wind mass loss from the WD, thus limiting the He-rich mass accumulation efficiency. The surviving companion stars are likely of low-mass at the moment of the SN explosions, which can be regarded as a possible explanation for the non-detection of surviving companions after the SNe or inside the SN remnants. However, the corresponding birthrate of Galactic SNe Ia in our high-magnetic models is estimated to be ∼ (0.08 − 0.13) × 10 −3 yr −1 (∼ 0.17 − 0.28 × 10 −3 yr −1 for the non-magnetic models), significantly lower than the observed Galactic SN Ia birthrate. 2 Zhe Cui & X.-D.

By comparing the +1.4 day spectrum of SN 2020sck with synthetic spectrum generated using SYN++, we find absorption features due to C ii, C iii and O i. These are unburned materials in the explosion and indicate a CO white dwarf. One dimensional radiative transfer modeling of the spectra with TARDIS shows higher density in the ejecta near the photosphere and a steep decrease in the outer layers with an ejecta composition dominated mostly by C, O, Si, Fe, and Ni. The star formation rate of the host galaxy computed from the luminosity of the H$\alpha$ ($\lambda$6563) line is 0.09 M yr −1 indicating a relatively young stellar environment.},

abstract = {The success of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) distance standardisation for cosmology relies on a single global linear relationship between their peak luminosity and colour, the $\beta$ parameter. However, there are several pieces of evidence and physical reasons to believe that this relation is not universal and may change within different subgroups, or even among individual objects. In this work, we allow $\beta$ to vary among subpopulations with different observed properties in the cosmological fits. Although the inferred cosmological parameters are consistent with previous studies that assume a single colour-luminosity relation, we find that the SN data favour nonuniversal distributions of $\beta$ when split according to SN colour and/or host-galaxy mass. For galaxy mass, we obtain a $\beta$-step relation in which low $\beta$ values occur in more massive galaxies, a trend that can be explained by differing dust reddening laws for two types of environments. For colour, we find that bluer/redder SNe Ia are consistent with a lower/larger $\beta$. This trend is explained with $\beta$ being a combination of a low intrinsic colour-luminosity relation dominant in bluer SNe and a higher extrinsic reddening relation dominant at redder colours. The host galaxy mass-step correction always provides better distance calibration, regardless of the multiple $\beta$ approaches, and we suggest that it may come from a difference in intrinsic colour-luminosity properties of SNe Ia in two types of environments. Additionally, we find that blue SNe in low-mass environments are better standard candles than the others.},

abstract = {Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are of interest for time delay cosmology and SN physics. However, glSNe detections are rare, owing to the intrinsic rarity of SN explosions, the necessity of alignment with a foreground lens, and the relatively short window of detectability. We present the Las Cumbres Observatory Lensed Supernova Search, LCOLSS, a targeted survey designed for detecting glSNe in known strong-lensing systems. Using cadenced r-band imaging, LCOLSS targeted 112 galaxy-galaxy lensing systems with high expected SN rates, based on estimated star formation rates. No plausible glSN was detected by LCOLSS over two years of observing. The analysis performed here measures a detection efficiency for these observations and runs a Monte Carlo simulation using the predicted supernova rates to determine the expected number of glSN detections. The results of the simulation suggest an expected number of detections and 68% Poisson confidence intervals, N SN = 0.20, [0, 2.1], N Ia = 0.08, [0, 2.0], N CC = 0.12, [0, 2.0], for all SN, Type Ia, and core-collapse (CC) SNe respectively. These results are broadly consistent with the absence of a detection in our survey. Analysis of the survey strategy can provide insights for future efforts to develop targeted glSN discovery programs. We thereby forecast expected detection rates for the Rubin observatory for such a targeted survey, finding that a single visit depth of 24.7 mag with the Rubin observatory will detect 0.63 ± 0.38 SNe per year, with 0.47 ± 0.28 core collapse SNe per year and 0.16 ± 0.10 Type Ia SNe per year.},

abstract = {The mismatch between the locally measured expansion rate of the universe and the one inferred from the cosmic microwave background measurements by Planck in the context of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, known as the Hubble tension, has become one of the most pressing problems in cosmology. A large number of amendments to the $\Lambda$CDM model have been proposed in order to solve this tension. Many of them introduce new physics, such as early dark energy, modifications of the standard model neutrino sector, extra radiation, primordial magnetic fields or varying fundamental constants, with the aim of reducing the sound horizon at recombination r⋆. We demonstrate here that any model which only reduces r⋆ can never fully resolve the Hubble tension while remaining consistent with other cosmological datasets. We show explicitly that models which achieve a higher Hubble constant with lower values of matter density $\Omega$mh2 run into tension with the observations of baryon acoustic oscillations, while models with larger $\Omega$mh2 develop tension with galaxy weak lensing data.},

abstract = {Several authors (including myself) have made claims, none of which has been convincingly rebutted, that the flatness problem, as formulated by Dicke and Peebles, is not really a problem but rather a misunderstanding. In particular, we all agree that no fine-tuning in the early Universe is needed in order to explain the fact that there is no strong departure from flatness, neither in the early Universe nor now. Nevertheless, the flatness problem is still widely perceived to be real, since it is still routinely mentioned as an outstanding (in both senses) problem in cosmology in papers and books. Most of the arguments against the idea of a flatness problem are based on the change with time of the density parameter $\Omega$ and normalized cosmological constant $\lambda$ (often assumed to be zero before there was strong evidence that it has a non-negligible positive value) and, since the Hubble constant H is not considered, are independent of time scale. In addition, taking the time scale into account, it is sometimes claimed that fine-tuning is required in order to produce a Universe which neither collapsed after a short time nor expanded so quickly that no structure formation could take place. None of those claims is correct, whether or not the cosmological constant is assumed to be zero. I briefly review the literature disputing the existence of the flatness problem, which is not as well known as it should be, compare it with some similar persistent misunderstandings, and wonder about the source of confusion.},

We train a new version of BayeSN, continuous from 0.35 to 0.95 $\mu$m, which we use to model the properties of SNe Ia in the rest-frame z-band, study the properties of dust in their host galaxies, and construct a Hubble diagram of SN Ia distances determined from full griz light curves. Our griz Hubble diagram has a low total RMS of 0.13 mag using BayeSN, compared to 0.16 mag using SALT2. Additionally, we test the consistency of the dust law RV between low- and high-mass host galaxies by using our model to fit the full time- and wavelength-dependent SEDs of SNe Ia up to moderate reddening (peak apparent B − V ≲ 0.3). Splitting the population at the median host mass, we find RV = 2.84 ± 0.31 in low-mass hosts, and RV = 2.58 ± 0.23 in high-mass hosts, both consistent with the global value of RV = 2.61 ± 0.21 that we estimate for the full sample. For all choices of mass split we consider, RV is consistent across the step within ≲ 1.2$\sigma$. Modelling population distributions of dust laws in low- and high-mass hosts, we find that both subsamples are highly consistent with the full sample's population mean $\mu$(RV) = 2.70 ± 0.25 with a 95 per cent upper bound on the population $\sigma$(RV) < 0.61. The RV population means are consistent within ≲ 1.2$\sigma$.

abstract = {The direct detection of a stellar system that explodes as a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) has not yet been successful. Various indirect methods have been used to investigate SN Ia progenitor systems but none have produced conclusive results. A prediction of single-degenerate models is that H-(or He-) rich material from the envelope of the companion star should be swept up by the SN ejecta in the explosion. Seven SNe Ia have been analysed to date looking for signs of H-rich material in their late-time spectra and none were detected. We present results from new late-time spectra of 11 SNe Ia obtained at the Very Large Telescope using XShooter and FORS2. We present the tentative detection of H$\alpha$ emission for SN 2013ct, corresponding to ∼0.007 M of stripped/ablated companion star material (under the assumptions of the spectral modelling). This mass is significantly lower than expected for single-degenerate scenarios, suggesting that >0.1 M of H-rich is present but not observed. We do not detect H$\alpha$ emission in the other 10 SNe Ia. This brings the total sample of normal SNe Ia with non-detections (<0.001-0.058 M) of H-rich material to 17 events. The simplest explanation for these non-detections is that these objects did not result from the explosion of a CO white dwarf accreting matter from a H-rich companion star via Roche lobe overflow or symbiotic channels. However, further spectral modelling is needed to confirm this. We also find no evidence of He-emission features, but models with He-rich companion stars are not available to place mass limits.},

We discuss the physical interpretations of these parameters for the individual SNe Ia and the sample in general, including comparisons to well-observed SNe Ia from the literature. There are possible correlations between early-time and late-time spectral features that may indicate an asymmetric explosion, so we discuss our sample of SNe within the context of models for an offset ignition and/or white dwarf collisions. A subset of our late-time spectra are uncontaminated by host emission, and we statistically evaluate our non-detections of H $\alpha$ emission to limit the amount of hydrogen in these systems.

We estimate M M Ni 0.732 0.151 56 =   () , and place an upper limit on the abundance of Fe 55. A recent study reported a possible correlation between M M Co Co 57 56 () () and stretch for four SNeIa. SN 2013aa, however, does not fit this trend, indicating either SN 2013aa is an extreme outlier or the correlation does not hold up with a larger sample. The M M Co Co 57 56 () ()measured for the expanded sample of SNeIa with photometry at extremely late times has a much larger range than that of explosion models, perhaps limiting conclusions about SNIa progenitors drawn from extremely late-time photometry.},

@article{Lach2021,
abstract = {Context. Due to the ever increasing number of observations during the past decades Type Ia supernovae are nowadays regarded as a heterogeneous class of optical transients consisting of several sub-types. One of the largest of these subclasses is the class of Type Iax supernovae. They have been suggested to originate from pure deflagrations in carbon-oxygen Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs because the outcome of this explosion scenario is in general agreement with their sub-luminous nature. Aims. Although a few deflagration studies have already been carried out, the full diversity of the class is not captured yet. This, in particular, holds for the faint end of the subclass. We therefore present a parameter study of single-spot ignited deflagrations in Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs varying the location of the ignition spark, the central density, the metallicity and the composition of the white dwarf. We also explore a rigidly rotating progenitor to investigate whether the effect of rotation can spawn additional trends. Methods. We carry out three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations employing the leafs code. Subsequently, detailed nucleosyn-thesis results are obtained with the nuclear network code yann. In order to compare our results to observations we calculate synthetic spectra and light curves with the artis code. Results. The new set of models extends the range in brightness covered by previous studies to the lower end. Our single-spot ignited explosions produce 56 Ni masses from 5.8 × 10 −3 to 9.2 × 10 −2 M. In spite of the wide exploration of the parameter space the main characteristics of the models are primarily driven by the mass of 56 Ni and form a one-dimensional sequence. Secondary parameters seem to have too little impact to explain the observed trend in the faint part of the Type Iax supernova class. We report kick velocities of the gravitationally bound explosion remnants from 6.9 to 369.8 km s −1. The magnitude as well as the direction of the natal kick is found to depend on the strength of the deflagration. Conclusions. This work corroborates the results of previous studies of deflagrations in Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs. The wide exploration of the parameter space in initial conditions and viewing-angle effects in the radiative transfer lead to a significant spread in the synthetic observables. The trends in observational properties towards the faint end of the class are, however, not reproduced. This motivates a quantification of the systematic uncertainties in the modelling procedure and the influence of the 56 Ni-rich bound remnant to get to the bottom of these discrepancies. Moreover, while the pure deflagration scenario remains a favorable explanation for bright and intermediate luminosity Type Iax supernovae, the possibility that this subclass does not consist of only one explosion scenario needs to be taken into account.},

abstract = {As the closest Type Ia supernova in decades, SN 2014J provides a unique opportunity for detailed investigation into observational signatures of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism in addition to burning product distribution. We present a late-time near-infrared spectral series from Gemini-N at $307-466$ days after the explosion. Following the $H$-band evolution probes the distribution of radioactive iron group elements, the extent of mixing, and presence of magnetic fields in the expanding ejecta. Comparing the isolated $1.6440$ $\mu$m [Fe II] emission line with synthetic models shows consistency with a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf of $\rho_c=0.7\times10^9$ g cm${}^{-3}$ undergoing a delayed detonation. The ratio of the flux in the neighboring $1.54$ $\mu$m emission feature to the flux in the $1.6440$ $\mu$m feature shows evidence of some limited mixing of stable and radioactive iron group elements in the central regions. Additionally, the evolution of the $1.6440$ $\mu$m line shows an intriguing asymmetry. When measuring line-width of this feature, the data show an increase in line width not seen in the evolution of the synthetic spectra, corresponding to $\approx1{,}000$ km s${}^{-1}$, which could be caused by a localized transition to detonation producing asymmetric ionization in the ejecta. Using the difference in width between the different epochs, an asymmetric component in the central regions, corresponding to approximately the inner $2\times10^{-4}$ of white dwarf mass suggests an off-center ignition of the initial explosion and hence of the kinematic center from the chemical center. Several additional models investigated, including a He detonation and a merger, have difficulty reproducing the features seen these spectra.},

The flux excess observed in the light curves of SN 2015bq a few days after the explosion, especially seen in the UV bands, might be due to the radioactive decay of 56 Ni mixed into the surface. The radiation from the decay of the surface 56 Ni heats the outer layer of this SN. It produces blue U − B color followed by monotonically reddening in the early phase, dominated iron-group lines, and weak intermediate-mass elements absorption features in the early spectra. The scenario of enhanced 56 Ni in the surface is consistent with a large amount of 56 Ni (M56 Ni = 0.97 ±0.20 M) synthesized during the explosion. The properties of SN 2015bq are found to locate between SN 1991T and SN 1999aa, suggesting the latter two subclasses of SNe Ia may have a common origin.},

With a FoV of 47 sq.deg, ZTF discovered > 3000 SNe Ia in a little over 2.5 years. Here, we report on the sample of 761 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia from the first year of operations (DR1).

Our sample has a total of 934 spectra, of which 632 were obtained with the robotic SEDm on Palomar P60. We assess the potential for precision cosmology for a total of 305 SNe with redshifts from host galaxy spectra. The sample is already comparable in size to the entire combined literature low-z anchor sample. The median first detection is 13.5 days before maximum light, about 10 days earlier than the median in the literature. Furthermore, six SNe from our sample are at D L < 80 Mpc, for which host galaxy distances can be obtained in the JWST era, such that we have calibrator and Hubble flow SNe observed with the same instrument. In the entire duration of ZTF-I, we have observed nearly fifty SNe for which we can obtain calibrator distances, key for percent level distance scale measurements.},

SN 2013dy has a broad and slowly declining light curve (m 15 (B) = 0.92 mag), shallow Si II $\lambda$6355 absorption, and a low velocity gradient. We detect strong C II in our earliest spectra, probing unburned progenitor material in the outermost layers of the SN ejecta, but this feature fades within a few days. The UV continuum of SN 2013dy, which is strongly affected by the metal abundance of the progenitor star, suggests that SN 2013dy had a relatively high-metallicity progenitor. Examining one of the largest single set of high-resolution spectra for an SN Ia, we find no evidence of variable absorption from circumstellar material. Combining our UV spectra, NIR photometry, and high-cadence optical photometry, we construct a bolometric light curve, showing that SN 2013dy had a maximum luminosity of 10.0 +4.8 −3.8 × 10 42 erg s −1.

abstract = {We have conducted a systematic and comprehensive monitoring programme of the type Ia supernova 2000cx at late phases using the VLT and HST. The VLT observations cover phases 360 to 480 days past maximum brightness and include photometry in the BVRIJH bands, together with a single epoch in each of U and K s. While the optical bands decay by about 1.4 mag per 100 days, we find that the near-IR magnitudes stay virtually constant during the observed period. This means that the importance of the near-IR to the bolometric light curve increases with time. The finding is also in agreement with our detailed modeling of a type Ia supernova in the nebular phase. In these models, the increased importance of the near-IR is a temperature effect. We note that this complicates late-time studies where often only the V band is well monitored. In particular, it is not correct to assume that any optical band follows the bolometric light curve at these phases, and any conclusions based on such assumptions, e.g., regarding positron-escape, must be regarded as premature. A very simple model where all positrons are trapped can reasonably well account for the observations. The nickel mass deduced from the positron tail of this light curve is lower than found from the peak brightness, providing an estimate of the fraction of late-time emission that is outside of the observed wavelength range. Our detailed models show the signature of an infrared catastrophe at these epochs, which is not supported by the observations.},

Driven by radioactive decay of 56Ni, the light curves steadily decline over time, but after 150 d post-explosion the near-infrared portion is poorly characterized. We report a year-long plateau in the near-infrared light curve at 150–500 d, followed by a second decline phase accompanied by a possible appearance of [Fe i] emission lines. This near-infrared plateau contrasts sharply with type IIP plateaux and requires a new physical mechanism. We suggest a masking of the ‘near-infrared catastrophe'—a predicted, yet unobserved, sharp light-curve decline—by scattering of ultraviolet photons to longer wavelengths. The transition off the plateau could be due to a change in the dominant ionization state of the supernova ejecta. Our results help explain the complex radiative transfer processes that take place in type Ia supernovae and enhance their use as ‘standard candles'.},

abstract = {Aims. We study a thermonuclear supernova (SN), emphasizing very late phases. Methods. An extensive dataset for SN 2003hv that covers the flux evolution from maximum light to day +786 is presented. This includes 82 epochs of optical imaging, 24 epochs of near-infrared (NIR) imaging, and 10 epochs of optical spectroscopy. These data are combined with published nebular-phase IR spectra, and the observations are compared to model light curves and synthetic nebular spectra. Results. SN 2003hv is a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with its rarely observed B-band decline-rate parameter, $\Delta$m 15 (B) = 1.61 ± 0.02. The blueshift of the most isolated [Fe ii] lines in the nebular-phase optical spectrum appears consistent with those observed in the IR at similar epochs. At late times there is a prevalent color evolution from the optical toward the NIR bands. We present the latest-ever detection of a SN Ia in the NIR in Hubble Space Telescope images. The study of the ultraviolet/optical/infrared (UVOIR) light curve reveals that a substantial fraction of the flux is "missing" at late times. Between 300 and 700 days past maximum brightness, the UVOIR light curve declines linearly following the decay of radioactive 56 Co, assuming full and instantaneous positron trapping. At 700 days we detect a possible slowdown of the decline in optical-bands, mainly in the V-band. Conclusions. The data are incompatible with a dramatic infrared catastrophe (IRC). However, the idea that an IRC occurred in the densest regions before 350 days can explain the missing flux from the UVOIR wavelengths and the flat-topped profiles in the NIR. We argue that such a scenario is possible if the ejecta are clumpy. The observations suggest that positrons are most likely trapped in the ejecta.},

abstract = {An increase in the number of studied Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has demonstrated that this class of explosions has a greater diversity in its observables than was previously assumed. The reasons (e.g. the explosion mechanism, progenitor system) for such a diversity remain unknown. Here, we analyse a sample of r-band light curves of SNe Ia, focusing on their behaviour ∼2-4 weeks after maximum light, i.e. the second maximum. We characterize the second maximum by its timing (tr2) and the integrated flux (Fr2). We find that tr2 correlates with the 'colour-stretch' parameter sBV , which can be used as a proxy for 56Ni mass, and Fr2 correlates with the transparency time-scale, t0. Using Fr2 for a sample of 199 SNe from the Palomar Transient Factory and intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, we evaluate a distribution on t0 for a sample of SNe Ia found in an 'untargeted' survey. Comparing this distribution to the predictions of t0 ranges from models we find that the largest overlap in t0 values between models and observations is for the sub-Chandrasekhar double detonation models. We also compare our relations between t0 and Fr2 with that from the 1D explosion models of Goldstein & Kasen and confirm that Fr2 can be used as a diagnostic of the total ejecta mass.},

abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of the fast-declining Type Ia Supernova (SN) 2015bo. SN 2015bo is under-luminous (M B = −17.50 ± 0.13 mag) and has a fast-evolving light curve (∆m 15 (B) = 1.91 ± 0.01 mag and s BV = 0.48 ± 0.01). It has a unique morphology in the V − r color curve, where it is bluer than all other SNe in the comparison sample. A 56 Ni mass of 0.17 ± 0.03 M was derived from the peak bolometric luminosity, which is consistent with its location on the luminosity-width relation. Spectroscopically, SN 2015bo is a Cool SN in the Branch classification scheme. The velocity evolution measured from spectral features is consistent with 1991bg-like SNe. SN 2015bo has a SN twin (similar spectra) and sibling (same host galaxy), SN 1997cn. Distance modulii of µ = 34.36 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.13 (sys) mag and µ = 34.37 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.12 (sys) mag were derived for SN 2015bo and SN 1997cn, respectively. These distances are consistent at the 0.06−$\sigma$ level with each other, and are also consistent with distances derived using surface-brightness fluctuations and redshift-corrected cosmology. This suggests that fast-declining SNe could be accurate distance indicators which should not be excluded from future cosmological analyses.},

abstract = {Helium star-carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) binaries are potential single-degenerate progenitor systems of thermonuclear supernovae. Revisiting a set of binary evolution calculations using the stellar evolution code MESA, we refine our previous predictions about which systems can lead to a thermonuclear supernova and then characterize the properties of the helium star donor at the time of explosion. We convert these model properties to NUV/optical magnitudes assuming a blackbody spectrum and support this approach using a matched stellar atmosphere model. These models will be valuable to compare with pre-explosion imaging for future supernovae, though we emphasize the observational difficulty of detecting extremely blue companions. The pre-explosion source detected in association with SN 2012Z has been interpreted as a helium star binary containing an initially ultra-massive WD in a multi-day orbit. However, extending our binary models to initial CO WD masses of up to 1.2 M , we find that these systems undergo off-center carbon ignitions and thus are not expected to produce thermonuclear supernovae. This tension suggests that, if SN 2012Z is associated with a helium star-WD binary, then the pre-explosion optical light from the system must be significantly modified by the binary environment and/or the WD does not have a carbon-rich interior composition.},

We show that the dust extinction of the objects where the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 {\AA} is detected is consistent with the visual extinction derived from the supernova colors. This strongly suggests that the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in the interstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar material associated with the progenitor system. One quarter of the supernovae display anomalously large Na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their colors. Remarkably, all of the cases of unusually strong Na i D absorption correspond to "Blueshifted" profiles in the classification scheme of Sternberg et al. This coincidence suggests that outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the cases of anomalously large Na i column densities. Two supernovae with unusually strong Na i D absorption showed essentially normal K i column densities for the dust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be a universal characteristic. Overall, we find the most accurate predictor of individual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 {\AA}, and provide an empirical relation for its use. Finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the Na abundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate and double-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.},

abstract = {We present spectroscopy and photometry of SN 2018zd, a Type IIP core-collapse supernova with signatures of interaction with circumstantial material in its earliest spectra. High ionization lines, the earmark of shock breakout, are not seen in the earliest spectral epoch, and are only seen in a single spectrum at 4.9 d after explosion. The strength and brevity of these features imply a confined circumstellar material shell in the immediate vicinity of the progenitor. Once the narrow emission lines disappear, SN 2018zd evolves similarly to a Type IIP SN, although the blue colour and enhanced plateau magnitude of SN 2018zd suggests an additional source of luminosity throughout the plateau phase. While SN 2018zd has previously been proposed as an electron-capture SN, we suggest that it is an Fe core-collapse from a low mass red supergiant progenitor. Differences in interpretation for SN 2018zd arise in part due to the large uncertainty on the distance to the host-galaxy NGC 2146, which we re-derive here to be 15.6 +6.1 −3.0 Mpc. We find the ejected 56 Ni mass for SN 2018zd to be 0.017 M , significantly higher than models of ECSNe predict. We also find the Ni/Fe ratio in SN 2018zd to be much lower that would be expected for an ECSN.},

Pre-explosion emission was detected in {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\S}−bands at ∼ 130 days prior to SN 2020tlf and persisted at relatively constant flux until first light. Soon after discovery, "flash" spectroscopy of SN 2020tlf with Keck LRIS revealed prominent narrow symmetric emission lines ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\pounds} {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±¤ < 300 km s −1), broadened by electron scattering, that resulted from the photo-ionization of unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) shedded in progenitor mass loss episodes in the final weeks to months before explosion. Surprisingly, this novel display of pre-SN emission and associated mass loss occurred in a Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitor with ZAMS mass of only ∼10-12 M , as inferred from nebular spectra. Modeling of the light curve and multi-epoch spectra with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN and radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) code HERACLES suggests a dense CSM limited to {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ≈ 10 15 cm, and mass loss rate of 10 −2 M yr −1 for an assumed wind velocity {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\pounds} {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±¤ = 50 km s −1. The subsequent luminous light-curve plateau and persistent blue excess indicates an extended (inflated) progenitor, compatible with a RSG model with {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ★ = 1100 R at the time of explosion. Inferences from the limits on the shock-powered X-ray and radio luminosity are consistent with these model conclusions and suggest a CSM density of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ < 2 × 10 −16 g cm −3 for distances of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ≈ 5 × 10 15 cm, as well as a mass loss rate of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± < 1.3 × 10 −5 M yr −1 at larger distances {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ≈ 2 − 8 × 10 16 cm for a wind velocity {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\pounds} {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±¤ = 50 km s −1. A promising power source for the observed precursor emission is the ejection of stellar material following energy disposition ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°¸depµ{\'{i}}°¸dep 10 47 erg) into the stellar envelope as a result of gravity waves emitted during either neon/oxygen burning or a nuclear flash from silicon combustion.},

abstract = {Progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can shed significant mass to circumstellar material (CSM) in the months-years preceding core-collapse. The ensuing SN explosion launches ejecta that may subsequently collide with this CSM, producing shocks that can power emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work we explore the thermal signatures of dense CSM interaction, when the CSM density profile is truncated at some outer radius. CSM with optical depth > c/v (where v is the shock velocity) will produce primarily ∼blackbody optical/UV emission whereas lower optical-depth CSM will power bremsstrahlung X-ray emission. Focusing on the latter, we derive light-curves and spectra of the resulting X-ray transients, that include a detailed treatment of Comptonization. Due to strong photoelectric absorption, the X-ray light-curve is dominated by the 'post-interaction' phase that occurs after the shock reaches the CSM truncation radius. We treat this regime here for the first time. Using these results, we present the phase-space of optical, UV, and X-ray transients as a function of CSM properties, and discuss detectability prospects. We find that ROSAT would not have been sensitive to CSM X-ray transients but that eROSITA is expected to detect many such events. Future wide-field UV missions such as ULTRASAT will dramatically enhance sensitivity to large optical-depth CSM configurations. Finally, we present a framework within which CSM properties may be directly inferred from observable features of X-ray transients. This can serve as an important tool for studying stellar mass loss using SN X-ray detections.},

abstract = {The sub-Chandrasekhar mass double-detonation (DDet) scenario is a contemporary model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The donor star in the DDet scenario is expected to survive the explosion and to be ejected at the high orbital velocity of a compact binary system. For the first time, we consistently perform three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of SN ejecta with a helium (He) star companion within the DDet scenario. We map the outcomes of 3D impact simulations into one-dimensional stellar evolution codes and follow the long-term evolution of the surviving He-star companions. Our main goal is to provide the post-impact observable signatures of surviving He-star companions of DDet SNe Ia, which will support the search for such companions in future observations. Such surviving companions are ejected with high velocities of up to about 930 km s −1. We find that our surviving He-star companions become significantly overluminous for about 10 6 yr during the thermal re-equilibration phase. After the star re-establishes thermal equilibrium, its observational properties are not sensitive to the details of the ejecta-donor interaction. We apply our results to hypervelocity star US 708, which is the fastest unbound star in our Galaxy, travelling with a velocity of about 1,200 km s −1 , making it natural candidate for an ejected donor remnant of a DDet SN Ia. We find that a He-star donor with an initial mass of 0.5 M ⊙ is needed to explain the observed properties of US 708. Based on our detailed binary evolution calculations, however, the progenitor system with such a massive He-star donor cannot get close enough at the moment of SN explosion to explain the high velocity of US 708. Instead, if US 708 is indeed the surviving He-star donor of a DDet SN Ia, it would require the entire pre-SN progenitor binary to travel at a velocity of about 400 km s −1. It could, for example, have been ejected from a globular cluster in the direction of the current motion of the surviving donor star.},

All of the intrinsic dispersion is thereby removed from the data sample, leaving perfectly standardized candles insofar as one can measure with present techniques. The best-fit solution has a mysteriously low value for R (referred to the B-band) of about 2 and a value of b ≈ 0.5 which is smaller than previously reported without the color correction. These parameters lead, using pre-Hipparcos distances for Cepheid calibrations, to essentially the same value for the Hubble constant.

The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2% without accounting for the uncertainty in the Hubble Space Telescope Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w = -1.120+0.360-0.206(Stat)+0.2690.291(Sys). When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+H0, the analysis yields $\Omega$M = 0.280+0.0130.012 and w = -1.166+0.072-0.069 including all identified systematics. The value of w is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of -1 at the 2.3$\sigma$ level. Tension endures after removing either the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) or the H0 constraint, though it is strongest when including the H0 constraint. If we include WMAP9 cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w = -1.124+0.083-0.065, which diminishes the discord to <2$\sigma$. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\Lambda$CDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 SN sample with ∼three times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.},

abstract = {The light echo (LE) systems of historical supernovae in the Milky Way and local group galaxies provide an unprecedented opportunity to reveal the effects of asymmetry on observables, particularly optical spectra. Scattering dust at different locations on the LE ellipsoid witnesses the supernova from different perspectives, and the light consequently scattered toward Earth preserves the shape of line profile variations introduced by asymmetries in the supernova photosphere.

abstract = {We report the discovery of a supernova (SN) with the highest apparent energy output to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the Type IIn subclass. The SN, which was discovered behind the Large Magellanic Cloud at z = 0.289 by the SuperMACHO microlensing survey, peaked at M R = -21.5 mag and only declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. Over this period, SN2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 × 1051erg, more than any other SN to date. The radiated energy is close to the limit allowed by conventional core-collapse explosions. Optical spectra reveal that SN2003ma has persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature of interaction between the SN and a dense circumstellar medium. The light curves show further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateau with a shape very similar to the classic SN IIn 1988Z - however, SN2003ma is 10 times more luminous at all epochs. The fast velocity measured for the intermediate-width H$\alpha$ component (∼6000kms-1) points toward an extremely energetic explosion (>1052erg), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed to the post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than is observed in typical SNe IIn. Mid-infrared observations of SN2003ma suggest an infrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ∼ 0.5pc from the SN. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {To try to develop an intuitive understanding of why stars evolve in the way that they do, we compute sequences of snapshot stellar structure models. These models allow us to properly isolate the key internal properties that drive the evolution of stars in different phases. Our models can mimic the effects of a very wide range of physical processes including metallicity, internal mixing, binary interaction and mass loss. We focus on massive stars during the main sequence, the expansion across the HR diagram and core helium burning. With our novel approach, we isolate and quantify several important internal properties that set the surface properties at different evolutionary stages. For the main sequence, we find that models with the same mass and very similar surface properties can have different internal distributions of hydrogen and convective core masses. We discuss why stars expand after the main sequence and the fundamental reasons for why stars become red, blue or yellow supergiants. For the post-main sequence, we demonstrate that small changes in the abundance profile can have very large effects on the surface properties, discuss why stars with large envelope masses tend to be blue supergiants and study the cause of blue loops. We also show that massive stars with lower metallicity tend to be more compact for two reasons, lower CNO abundances in the burning regions and lower opacity in the envelope.},

abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardizable candles that allow us to measure the recent expansion rate of the Universe. Due to uncertainties in progenitor physics, potential astrophysical dependencies may bias cosmological measurements if not properly accounted for. The dependency of the intrinsic luminosity of SNe Ia with their host-galaxy environment is often used to standardize SNe Ia luminosity and is commonly parameterized as a step function. This functional form implicitly assumes two-populations of SNe Ia. In the literature, multiple environmental indicators have been considered, finding different, sometimes incompatible, step function amplitudes. We compare these indicators in the context of a two-populations model, based on their ability to distinguish the two populations. We show that local H$\alpha$-based specific star formation rate (lsSFR) and global stellar mass are better tracers than, for instance, host galaxy morphology. We show that tracer accuracy can explain the discrepancy between the observed SNe Ia step amplitudes found in the literature. Using lsSFR or global mass to distinguish the two populations can explain all other observations, though lsSFR is favoured. As lsSFR is strongly connected to age, our results favour a prompt and delayed population model. In any case, there exists two populations that differ in standardized magnitude by at least 0.121 ± 0.010 mag.},

The abundance tomography technique is used to determine the abundance distribution of the elements in the ejecta. SN 1986G was found to be a low energy Chandrasekhar mass explosion. Its kinetic energy was 70% of the standard W7 model (0.9×10 51 erg). Oxygen dominates the ejecta from the outermost layers down to ∼ 9000 kms −1 , intermediate mass elements (IME) dominate from ∼ 9000 kms −1 to ∼ 3500 kms −1 with Ni and Fe dominating the inner layers <∼ 3500 kms −1. The final masses of the main elements in the ejecta were found to be, O=0.33 M , IME=0.69 M , stable NSE=0.21 M , 56 Ni=0.14 M. An upper limit of the carbon mass is set at C=0.02 M. The spectra of SN 1986G consist of almost exclusively singly ionised species. SN 1986G can be thought of as a low luminosity extension of the main population of SN Ia, with a large deflagration phase that produced more IMEs than a standard SN Ia.},

abstract = {We test the adequacy of ultraviolet (UV) spectra for characterizing the outer structure of Type Ia supernova (SN) ejecta. For this purpose, we perform spectroscopic analysis for ASASSN-14lp, a normal SN Ia showing low continuum in the mid-UV regime. To explain the strong UV suppression, two possible origins have been investigated by mapping the chemical profiles over a significant part of their ejecta. We fit the spectral time series with mid-UV coverage obtained before and around maximum light by HST, supplemented with ground-based optical observations for the earliest epochs. The synthetic spectra are calculated with the one-dimensional MC radiative transfer code tardis from self-consistent ejecta models. Among several physical parameters, we constrain the abundance profiles of nine chemical elements. We find that a distribution of 56Ni (and other iron-group elements) that extends towards the highest velocities reproduces the observed UV flux well. The presence of radioactive material in the outer layers of the ejecta, if confirmed, implies strong constraints on the possible explosion scenarios. We investigate the impact of the inferred 56Ni distribution on the early light curves with the radiative transfer code turtls, and confront the results with the observed light curves of ASASSN-14lp. The inferred abundances are not in conflict with the observed photometry. We also test whether the UV suppression can be reproduced if the radiation at the photosphere is significantly lower in the UV regime than the pure Planck function. In this case, solar metallicity might be sufficient enough at the highest velocities to reproduce the UV suppression.},

abstract = {We study stellar binary evolution that leads to the formation of a white dwarf (WD) that explodes in a thermonuclear supernova at the termination of a common envelope evolution (CEE) shortly before the core of its companion explodes as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The CCSN explosion of the core, which is the remnant of a red supergiant (RSG) star, might take place few months to several years after the explosion of the WD as a thermonuclear supernova, i.e. a Type Ia peculiar supernova (peculiar SN Ia). Using the evolutionary code mesa-binary, we simulate the evolution of binary systems with stars of initial masses of $6\!-\!7.5\, {\rm M}_\odot$. The more massive star, the primary, transfers mass to the secondary star and leaves a CO WD remnant. The secondary becomes massive enough to end in a CCSN. As the secondary evolves to the RSG phase, it engulfs the WD and the system experiences a CEE that ends with a WD–core binary system at an orbital separation of af ≃ 1–5 R⊙. Our simulations show that the core explodes as a CCSN at $t_{\rm CEE-CCSN} \simeq 3000 \!-\! 10^5 {\sim\rm yr}$ after the CEE. We assume that if the WD accretes helium-rich gas from the core it might explode as an SN Ia in the frame of the double detonation scenario for SNe Ia and peculiar SNe Ia. We predict the very rare occurrence of a peculiar SN Ia followed within months to years by a CCSN.},

We recover the known correlation between SN Ia rate and galaxy stellar mass across a broad range of scales 8.5 ≤ log (M*/M⊙) ≤ 11.25. We find that the SN Ia rate increases with stellar mass as a power-law with index 0.63 ± 0.02, which is consistent with previous work. We use an empirical model of stellar mass assembly to estimate the average star-formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies across the stellar mass range of our measurement. Combining the modelled SFHs with the SN Ia rates to estimate constraints on the SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD), we find the data are fit well by a power-law DTD with slope index $\beta$ = −1.13 ± 0.05 and normalisation A = 2.11 ± 0.05 × 10−13SNeM⊙−1yr−1,, which corresponds to an overall SN Ia production efficiency $N_{\mathrm{Ia}}/M_* = 0.9 _{-0.7}^{+4.0} \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{SNe} \mathrm{M}_{\odot }^{-1}$,. Upon splitting the SN sample by properties of the light curves, we find a strong dependence on DTD slope with the SN decline rate, with slower-declining SNe exhibiting a steeper DTD slope. We interpret this as a result of a relationship between intrinsic luminosity and progenitor age, and explore the implications of the result in the context of SN Ia progenitors.},

abstract = {We investigate the contribution of sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae to the chemical enrichment of the Gaia Sausage galaxy, the progenitor of a significant merger event in the early life of the Milky Way. Using a combination of data from Nissen & Schuster, the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Data Release 3 [with 1D non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) abundance corrections], and the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 16, we fit analytic chemical evolution models to a nine-dimensional chemical abundance space (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn) in particular focusing on the iron-peak elements, Mn and Ni. We find that low [Mn/Fe] $\sim -0.15\, \mathrm{dex}$ and low [Ni/Fe] $\sim -0.3\, \mathrm{dex}$ Type Ia yields are required to explain the observed trends beyond the [$\alpha$/Fe] knee of the Gaia Sausage (approximately at [Fe/H] $=-1.4\, \mathrm{dex}$). Comparison to theoretical yield calculations indicates a significant contribution from sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae in this system (from ${\sim} 60\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ to $100\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ depending on the theoretical model with an additional ${\pm} 10\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ systematic from NLTE corrections). We compare to results from other Local Group environments including dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Milky Way's bulge, finding the Type Ia [Mn/Fe] yield must be metallicity dependent. Our results suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar mass channels are a significant, perhaps even dominant, contribution to Type Ia supernovae in metal-poor systems, whilst more metal-rich systems could be explained by metallicity-dependent sub-Chandrasekhar mass yields, possibly with additional progenitor mass variation related to star formation history, or an increased contribution from Chandrasekhar mass channels at higher metallicity.},

The rate at which mass is transferred in the merging process is at present unknown, except that it must be less than some appropriate Eddington limit. It is found that, unless mass transfer occurs at a rate less than one-fifth of the Eddington limit for an isolated dwarf, carbon is ignited off-center, and ignition does not lead immediately to a deflagration. If carbon continues to burn quiescently until it is exhausted throughout the star, a neon-oxygen-magnesium white dwarf will be formed. If a Type I supernova is to follow from merging white dwarfs, a thick disk must be formed as an intermediate stage in the merging process, with transfer from the disk onto the central degenerate dwarf occurring at a rate sufficiently less than Eddington that a deflagration induced by carbon burning occurs. Thus, the outcome of the merging of two massive carbon-oxygen degenerate dwarfs is not trivially a Type I supernova explosion.},

abstract = {We present a family of six BVI template light curves for SNe Ia for days -5 and +80, based on high-quality data gathered at CTIO. These templates display a wide range of light curve morphologies, with initial decline rates of their B light curves between m15(B)=0.87 mag and 1.93 mag. We use these templates to study the general morphology of SNe Ia light curves. We find that several of the main features of the BVI templates correlate tightly with m15(B). In particular, the V light curves, which are probably a reasonably good approximation of the bolometric light curves, display an orderly progression in shapes between the most-luminous, slowest-declining events and the least-luminous, fastest-declining SNe. This supports the idea that the observed spectroscopic and photometric sequences of SNe Ia are due primarily to one parameter. Nevertheless, SNe with very similar initial decline rates do show significant differences in their light curve properties when examined in detail, suggesting the influence of one or more secondary parameters.},

Of the 16 subluminous SNe Ia known, 10 are found in E/S0 galaxies, and the remainder are found in early-type spiral galaxies. The probability that this is a chance occurrence is only 0.2%. The finding that subluminous SNe Ia are associated with an older stellar population indicates that for a sufficiently large look-back time (already accessible in current high-redshift searches) they will not be found. Due to a scarcity in old populations, hydrogen and helium main-sequence stars and He red giant stars that undergo Roche lobe overflow are unlikely to be the progenitors of subluminous SNe Ia. Earlier findings that overluminous SNe Ia [$\Delta$m 15 (B) ≲ 0.95] come from a young progenitor population are confirmed. The fact that subluminous SNe Ia and overluminous SNe Ia come from different progenitor populations and also have different properties is a prediction of the CO white dwarf merger progenitor scenario.},

@article{Arcavi2017,
abstract = {Hydrogen-rich core collapse supernovae, known as "Type II" supernovae, are the most common type of stellar explosion realized in nature. They are defined by the presence of prominent hydrogen lines in their spectra. Type II supernovae are observed only in star-forming galaxies, and several events have been directly linked to massive star progenitors. Five main subclasses are identified: Type IIP (displaying a plateau in their light curve), Type IIL (displaying a light curve decline), Type IIn (displaying narrow emission lines), Type IIb (displaying increasingly strong He features with time) and 87A-likes (displaying long-rising light curves similar to that of SN 1987A). Type IIP supernovae have been robustly established as the explosions of red supergiants, while the progenitors of Type IIL's remain elusive. Type IIn's are likely linked to luminous blue variables, Type IIb progenitors may be interacting binary systems and the prototype of the 87A-like class was observed to be the explosion of a blue supergiant. The diversity in progenitor mass, metallicity, binarity and rotation is likely responsible for the diversity in observed explosion types, but the connection between progenitor parameters and supernova properties is not yet entirely understood theoretically nor fully mapped observationally. New observational methods for constraining this connection are currently being implemented, including the analyses of large samples of events, making use of very early data (obtained hours to days from explosion) and statistical studies of host-galaxy properties.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is a fundamental component in understanding the explosions. The recent progress in finding such stars is reviewed. The minimum initial mass that can produce a supernova (SN) has converged to 8 ± 1 M⊙ from direct detections of red supergiant progenitors of II-P SNe and the most massive white dwarf progenitors, although this value is model dependent. It appears that most type Ibc SNe arise from moderate mass interacting binaries. The highly energetic, broad-lined Ic SNe are likely produced by massive, Wolf-Rayet progenitors. There is some evidence to suggest that the majority of massive stars above ∼20 M ⊙ may collapse quietly to black holes and that the explosions remain undetected. The recent discovery of a class of ultrabright type II SNe and the direct detection of some progenitor stars bearing luminous blue variable characteristics suggest some very massive stars do produce highly energetic explosions. The physical mechanism is under debate, and these SNe pose a challenge to stellar evolutionary theory. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The optical and optical/near-infrared pseudo-bolometric light curves of 85 stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are constructed using a consistent method and a standard cosmology. The light curves are analysed to derive temporal characteristics and peak luminosity Lp, enabling the construction of a luminosity function. Subsequently, the mass of 56Ni synthesized in the explosion, along with the ratio of ejecta mass to ejecta kinetic energy, are found. Analysis shows that host-galaxy extinction is an important factor in accurately determining luminosity values as it is significantly greater than Galactic extinction in most cases. It is found that broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL) and gamma-ray burst SNe are the most luminous subtypes with a combined median Lp, in erg s-1, of log(Lp) = 43.00 compared to 42.51 for SNe Ic, 42.50 for SNe Ib, and 42.36 for SNe IIb. It is also found that SNe Ic-BL synthesize approximately twice the amount of 56Ni compared with SNe Ic, Ib, and IIb, with median MNi = 0.34, 0.16, 0.14, and 0.11 M⊙, respectively. SNe Ic-BL, and to a lesser extent SNe Ic, typically rise from Lp/2 to Lp more quickly than SNe Ib/IIb; consequently, their light curves are not as broad.},

This sample consists of five H/He-rich SNe, six H-poor/He-rich SNe, three narrow lined SNe Ic, and four broad lined SNe Ic. The peak luminosity and characteristic time-scales of the bolometric light curves are calculated, and the light curves modelled to derive 56 Ni and ejecta masses (M Ni and M ej ). Additionally, the temperature evolution and spectral line velocity curves of each SN are examined. Analysis of the [O I] line in the nebular phase of eight SNe suggests their progenitors had initial masses <20 M. The bolometric light curve properties are examined in combination with those of other SE events from the literature. The resulting data set gives the M ej distribution for 80 SE–SNe, the largest such sample in the literature to date, and shows that SNe Ib have the lowest median M ej , followed by narrow-lined SNe Ic, H/He-rich SNe, broad-lined SNe Ic, and finally gamma-ray burst SNe. SNe Ic-6/7 show the largest spread of M ej ranging from ∼1.2–11 M, considerably greater than any other subtype. For all SE–SNe <M ej > = 2.8 ± 1.5 M which further strengthens the evidence that SE–SNe arise from low-mass progenitors which are typically <5 M at the time of explosion, again suggesting M ZAMS <25 M. The low <M ej > and lack of clear bimodality in the distribution implies <30 M progenitors and that envelope stripping via binary interaction is the dominant evolutionary pathway of these SNe.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-poor core-collapse supernovae (SNe) signal the explosive death of stars more massive than the progenitors of hydrogen-rich core-collapse super-novae, i.e., approximately in the range 15-50 M ˇ in main sequence. Since hydrogen-poor core-collapse supernovae include those that accompany gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which were all rigorously identified with type Ic supernovae, their explosion energies cover almost two decades. The light curves and spectra are consequently very heterogeneous and often bear the signature of an asymmetric, i.e., aspherical, explosion. Asphericity is best traced by early-time (within days of the explosion) optical spectropolarimetry and by late-epoch (more than 100 days after explosion) low-resolution spectroscopy. While the relationship between hydrogen-poor core-collapse supernovae to hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae is not understood, a known case of association between an ultra-long gamma-ray burst and a very luminous hydrogen-poor supernova may help unraveling the connection. This is tantalizingly pointing to a magnetar powering source for both phenomena, although this scenario is still highly speculative. Host galaxies of hydrogen-poor supernovae are always star forming; in those of completely stripped supernovae and gamma-ray burst supernovae, the spatial distribution of the explosions follows the blue/ultraviolet light, with a correlation that is more than linear.},

abstract = {While a white dwarf (WD) is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausible primary star of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), many other candidates have not been formally ruled out. Shock energy deposited in the envelope of any exploding primary contributes to the early SN brightness and, since this radiation energy is degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity depends on the initial primary radius. We present a new non-detection limit of the nearby SN Ia 2011fe, obtained at a time that appears to be just 4hr after explosion, allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius (Rp ). Coupled with the non-detection of a quiescent X-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesized 56Ni mass, we show that Rp ≲ 0.02 R ⊙ (a factor of five smaller than previously inferred), that the average density of the primary must be $\rho$p > 104 g cm-3, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few × 105K. This rules out hydrogen-burning main-sequence stars and giants. Constructing the helium-burning and carbon-burning main sequences, we find that such objects are also excluded. By process of elimination, we find that only degeneracy-supported compact objects - WDs and neutron stars - are viable as the primary star of SN2011fe. With few caveats, we also restrict the companion (secondary) star radius to R c ≲ 0.1 R ⊙, excluding Roche-lobe overflowing red giant and main-sequence companions to high significance. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {When supernovae enter the nebular phase after a few months, they reveal spectral fingerprints of their deep interiors, glowing by radioactivity produced in the explosion. We are given a unique opportunity to see what an exploded star looks like inside. The line profiles and luminosities encode information about physical conditions, explosive and hydrostatic nucleosynthesis, and ejecta morphology, which link to the progenitor properties and the explosion mechanism. Here, the fundamental properties of spectral formation of supernovae in the nebular phase are reviewed. The formalism between ejecta morphology and line profile shapes is derived, including effects of scattering and absorption. Line luminosity expressions are derived in various physical limits, with examples of applications from the literature. The physical processes at work in the supernova ejecta, including gamma-ray deposition, non-thermal electron degradation, ionization and excitation, and radiative transfer are described and linked to the computation and application of advanced spectral models. Some of the results derived so far from nebular-phase supernova analysis are discussed.},

abstract = {The light curve of Type I supernovae (SNe I), i.e. the explosion of H-deficient stars, is mainly powered by radioactive decay. Despite their different physical origin, thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (SNe Ia) and core-collapse explosions of massive stars with H-free envelopes (SNe Ib/c) can be understood in the same framework. The overall morphology of the light curves is similar for all SNe I. The small radius of the progenitor is responsible for the rapid degrading of the shock energy, leading to a fast initial peak that is usually unobserved. Thereafter, the luminosity of the SN and the shape of its light curve are determined by the radioactive energy input (56Ni and 56Co are the primary radioactive isotopes that power the light curve) and by the mass of the ejecta and the energy of the explosion. The energy of the explosion sets the expansion velocity which then critically determines the density and opacity of the gas. Physical parameters of the progenitor star and the explosion itself can be estimated from the shape of the light curve or derived more accurately by modeling the evolution of the light curve and the spectra simultaneously.},

abstract = {The nature and role of the binary companion of carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that explode as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not yet fully understood. Past detections of circumstellar material (CSM) that contain hydrogen for a small number of SN Ia progenitor systems suggest that at least some have a nondegenerate companion. In order to constrain the prevalence, location, and quantity of CSM in SN Ia systems, we performed a near-ultraviolet (NUV) survey with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to look for the high-energy signature of SN Ia ejecta interacting with the CSM. Our survey revealed that SN 2015cp, an SN 1991T-like overluminous SN Ia, was experiencing late-onset interaction between its ejecta and the surrounding CSM 664 days after its light-curve peak. We present ground- and space-based follow-up observations of SN 2015cp that reveal optical emission lines of H and Ca, typical signatures of ejecta-CSM interaction. We show how SN 2015cp was likely similar to the well-studied SN Ia-CSM event PTF11kx, making it the second case in which an unambiguously classified SN Ia was observed to interact with a distant shell of CSM that contains hydrogen (R CSM ≳ 1016 cm). The remainder of our HST NUV images of SNe Ia were nondetections that we use to constrain the occurrence rate of observable late-onset CSM interaction. In conclusion, we apply theoretical models for the emission from ejecta-CSM interaction to our NUV nondetections and place upper limits on the mass and radial extent of CSM in SN Ia progenitor systems.},

abstract = {We construct spectra of supernovae (SNe) interacting strongly with a circumstellar medium (CSM) by adding SN templates, a black-body continuum, and an emission-line spectrum. In a Monte Carlo simulation we vary a large number of parameters, such as the SN type, brightness and phase, the strength of the CSM interaction, the extinction, and the signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the observed spectrum. We generate more than 800 spectra, distribute them to ten different human classifiers, and study how the different simulation parameters affect the appearance of the spectra and their classification. The SNe IIn showing some structure over the continuum were characterized as “SNe IInS” to allow for a better quantification. We demonstrate that the flux ratio of the underlying SN to the continuum <i>f<i/><sub><i>V<i/><sub/> is the single most important parameter determining whether a spectrum can be classified correctly. Other parameters, such as extinction, S/N, and the width and strength of the emission lines, do not play a significant role. Thermonuclear SNe get progressively classified as Ia-CSM, IInS, and IIn as <i>f<i/><sub><i>V<i/><sub/> decreases. The transition between Ia-CSM and IInS occurs at <i>f<i/><sub><i>V<i/><sub/> $\sim$ 0.2−0.3. It is therefore possible to determine that SNe Ia-CSM are found at the (un-extincted) magnitude range −19.5 ><i>M<i/>> −21.6, in very good agreement with observations, and that the faintest SN IIn that can hide a SN Ia has <i>M<i/> = −20.1. The literature sample of SNe Ia-CSM shows an association with 91T-like SNe Ia. Our experiment does not support that this association can be attributed to a luminosity bias (91T-like being brighter than normal events). We therefore conclude that this association has real physical origins and we propose that 91T-like explosions result from single degenerate progenitors that are responsible for the CSM. Despite the spectroscopic similarities between SNe Ibc and SNe Ia, the number of misclassifications between these types was very small in our simulation and mostly at low S/N. Combined with the SN luminosity function needed to reproduce the observed SN Ia-CSM luminosities, it is unlikely that SNe Ibc constitute an important contaminant within this sample. We show how Type II spectra transition to IIn and how the H<i>$\alpha$<i/> profiles vary with <i>f<i/><sub><i>V<i/><sub/>. SNe IIn fainter than <i>M<i/> = −17.2 are unable to mask SNe IIP brighter than <i>M<i/> = −15. A more advanced simulation, including radiative transfer, shows that our simplified model is a good first order approximation. The spectra obtained are in good agreement with real data.},

abstract = {PTF10ops is a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), whose light curve and spectral properties place it outside the current SN Ia subtype classifications. Its spectra display the characteristic lines of subluminous SNe Ia, but it has a normal-width light curve with a long rise time, typical of normal-luminosity SNe Ia. The early-time optical spectra of PTF10ops were modelled using a spectral fitting code and found to have all the lines typically seen in subluminous SNe Ia, without the need to invoke more uncommon elements. The host galaxy environment of PTF10ops is also unusual with no galaxy detected at the position of the SN down to an absolute limiting magnitude of r≥-12.0mag, but a very massive galaxy is present at a separation of ∼148kpc and at the same redshift as suggested by the SN spectral features. The progenitor of PTF10ops is most likely a very old star, possibly in a low-metallicity environment, which affects its explosion mechanism and observational characteristics. PTF10ops does not easily fit into any of the current models of either subluminous or normal SN Ia progenitor channels. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Type Iax supernovae represent the largest class of peculiar white-dwarf supernovae. The type Iax SN 2012Z in NGC 1309 is the only white dwarf supernova with a detected progenitor system in pre-explosion observations. Deep Hubble Space Telescope images taken before SN 2012Z show a luminous, blue source that we have interpreted as a helium-star companion (donor) to the exploding white dwarf. We present here late-time HST observations taken $\sim$1400 days after the explosion to test this model. We find the SN light curve can empirically be fit by an exponential decay model in magnitude units. The fitted asymptotic brightness is within 10% of our latest measurements and approximately twice the brightness of the pre-explosion source. The decline of the light curve is too slow to be powered by $^{56}$Co or $^{57}$Co decay. Interaction with circumstellar material may play a role, as may shock heating of the companion star. Companion-star models underpredict the observed flux in the optical, producing most of their flux in the UV at these epochs. A radioactively-heated bound remnant, left after only a partial disruption of the white dwarf, can produce the excess late-time flux, but no models we tested could explain both the early and late-time light curves of SN 2012Z. Our analysis suggests that the total ejecta + remnant mass is consistent with the Chandrasekhar mass for a range of type Iax supernovae.},

The synthetic spectra of the best-fit models are able to reproduce the flux continuum and the main absorption features in the whole sample. We find that the mass fractions of IGEs and IMEs show a decreasing trend toward the outer regions of the atmospheres using density profiles similar to those of deflagration models in the literature. Oxygen is the only element, which could be dominant at higher velocities. The stratified abundance structure contradicts the well-mixed chemical profiles predicted by pure deflagration models. Based on the derived densities and abundances, a template model atmosphere is created for the SN Iax class and compared to the observed spectra. Free parameters are the scaling of the density profile, the velocity shift of the abundance template, and the peak luminosity. The results of this test support the idea that all SNe Iax can be described by a similar internal structure, which argues for a common origin of this class of explosions.},

abstract = {We describe observed properties of the Type Iax class of supernovae (SNe Iax), consisting of SNe observationally similar to its prototypical member, SN 2002cx. The class currently has 25 members, and we present optical photometry and/or optical spectroscopy for most of them. SNe Iax are spectroscopically similar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 ≲ |v| ≲ 8000 km s-1), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 ≥ M V, peak ≳ -18.9 mag), and most have hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for their light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and light-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia and with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is highly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in elliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars are white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra, low (typically t0.5 M {\textperiodcentered}) ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray detections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN sites. However, two SNe Iax show strong He lines in their spectra. The progenitor system and explosion model that best fits all of the data is a binary system of a C/O WD that accretes matter from a He star and has a deflagration. At least some of the time, this explosion will not disrupt the WD. The small number of SNe in this class prohibit a detailed analysis of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the entire class. We estimate that in a given volume there are SNe Iax for every 100 SNe Ia, and for every 1 M {\textperiodcentered} of iron generated by SNe Ia at z = 0, SNe Iax generate t0.036 M{\textperiodcentered}. Being the largest class of peculiar SNe, thousands of SNe Iax will be discovered by LSST. Future detailed observations of SNe Iax should further our understanding of both their progenitor systems and explosions as well as those of SNe Ia. {\textcopyright} 2013.

In SNR Ia where there are two opposite protrusions, termed 'ears', such as Kepler's SNR and SNR G1.9+0.3, our scenario implies that the dense clumps, or iron bullets, were formed along an axis.

abstract = {Seitenzahl et al. (2009) have predicted that roughly three years after its explosion, the light we receive from a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) will come mostly from reprocessing of electrons and X-rays emitted by the radioactive decay chain $^{57}{\rm Co}\sim\to\sim^{57}{\rm Fe}$, instead of positrons from the decay chain $^{56}{\rm Co}\sim\to\sim^{56}{\rm Fe}$ that dominates the SN light at earlier times. Using the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, we followed the light curve of the SN Ia SN 2012cg out to $1055$ days after maximum light. Our measurements are consistent with the light curves predicted by the contribution of energy from the reprocessing of electrons and X-rays emitted by the decay of $^{57}$Co, offering evidence that $^{57}$Co is produced in SN Ia explosions. However, the data are also consistent with a light echo $\sim14$ mag fainter than SN 2012cg at peak. Assuming no light-echo contamination, the mass ratio of $^{57}$Ni and $^{56}$Ni produced by the explosion, a strong constraint on any SN Ia explosion model, is $0.043^{+0.012}_{-0.011}$, roughly twice Solar. In the context of current explosion models, this value favors a progenitor white dwarf with a mass near the Chandrasekhar limit.},

abstract = {Recent versions of the observed cosmic star-formation history (SFH) have resolved an inconsistency with the stellar mass density history. We show that the revised SFH also scales up the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as determined from the observed volumetric SN Ia rate history, aligning it with other field-galaxy SN Ia DTD measurements. The revised-SFH-based DTD has a $t^{-1.1 \pm 0.1}$ form and a Hubble-time-integrated production efficiency of $N/M_\star=1.3\pm0.1$ SNe Ia per $1000\sim{\rm M_\odot}$ of formed stellar mass. Using these revised histories and updated empirical iron yields of the various SN types, we re-derive the cosmic iron accumulation history. Core-collapse SNe and SNe Ia have contributed about equally to the total mass of iron in the Universe today. We find the track of the average cosmic gas element in the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance-ratio plane. The track is broadly similar to the observed main locus of Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky Way (MW) SFH similar in form to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple MW SFH that makes the track closely match this stellar locus. Galaxy clusters appear to have a higher-normalization DTD. This cluster DTD, combined with a short-burst MW SFH peaked at $z=3$, produces a track that matches remarkably well the observed "high-$\alpha$" locus of MW stars, suggesting the halo/thick-disk population has had a galaxy-cluster-like formation mode. Thus, a simple two-component SFH, combined with empirical DTDs and SN iron yields, suffices to closely reproduce the MW's stellar abundance patterns.},

abstract = {The late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observed $>900$ days after explosion, present the possibility of a new diagnostic for SN Ia progenitor and explosion models. First, however, we must discover what physical process (or combination of processes) leads to the slow-down of the late-time light curve relative to a pure $^{56}$Co decay, as observed in SNe 2011fe, 2012cg, and 2014J. We present Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2015F, taken $\approx 600-1040$ days past maximum light. Unlike those of the three other SNe Ia, the light curve of SN 2015F remains consistent with being powered solely by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Co. We fit the light curves of these four SNe Ia in a consistent manner and measure possible correlations between the light curve stretch - a proxy for the intrinsic luminosity of the SN - and the parameters of the physical model used in the fit (e.g., the mass ratio of $^{56}$Co and $^{57}$Co produced in the explosion, or the time at which freeze-out sets in). We propose a new, late-time Phillips-like correlation between the stretch of the SNe and the shape of their late-time light curves, which we parametrize as the difference between their pseudo-bolometric luminosities at 600 and 900 days: $\Delta L_{900} = {\rm log}(L_{600}/L_{900})$. This model-independent correlation provides a new way to test which physical process lies behind the slow-down of SN Ia light curves $>900$ days after explosion, and, ultimately, fresh constraints on the various SN Ia progenitor and explosion models.},

abstract = {Late-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), >900 days after explosion, have shown that this type of SN does not suffer an "IR catastrophe" at 500 days as previously predicted. Instead, several groups have observed a slow-down in the optical light curves of these SNe. A few reasons have been suggested for this slow-down, from a changing fraction of positrons reprocessed by the expanding ejecta, through a boost of energy from slow radioactive decay chains such as 57Co --> 57Fe, to atomic "freeze-out." Discovering which of these (or some other) heating mechanisms is behind the slow-down will directly impact studies of SN Ia progenitors, explosion models, and nebular-stage physics. Recently, Graur et al. (2018) suggested a possible correlation between the shape of the late-time light curves of four SNe Ia and their stretch values, which are proxies for their intrinsic luminosities. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope observations of the SN Ia ASASSN-14lp at $\sim$850-960 days past maximum light. With a stretch of s = 1.15 +/- 0.05, it is the most luminous normal SN Ia observed so far at these late times. We rule out contamination by light echoes and show that the late-time, optical light curve of ASASSN-14lp is flatter than that of previous SNe Ia observed at late times. This result is in line with-and strengthens-the Graur et al. (2018) correlation, but additional SNe are needed to verify it.},

Here, I report complementary photometry of SN 2014J taken with the HST Wide Field Camera 3 when it was $\sim$360-1300 days old. My F555W measurements are consistent with the F606W measurements of Yang et al., but the F438W measurements are $\sim$1 mag fainter than their F475W measurements. I corroborate their finding that even though SN 2014J has spatially resolved light echoes, its photometry is not contaminated by an unresolved echo. Finally, I compare the F438W and F555W light curves of SN 2014J to those of the other late-time SNe Ia observed to date and show that more intrinsically luminous SNe have slower light-curve decline rates. This is consistent with the correlation claimed by Graur et al., which was based on a comparison of pseudo-bolometric light curves. By conducting a direct comparison of the late-time light curves in the same filters, I remove any systematic uncertainties introduced by the assumptions that go into constructing the pseudo-bolometric light curves, thus strengthening the Graur et al. claim.},

abstract = {Aims. Recurrent nova systems like RS Oph have been proposed as a possible channel for type Ia supernova (SN) explosions based on the high mass of the accreting white dwarf. Additional support for this hypothesis has recently been provided by the detection of circumstellar material around SN 2006X and SN 2007le, showing a structure compatible with that expected for recurrent nova outbursts. We investigate the circumstellar environment of RS Oph and its structure with the aim of establishing a firmer and independent link between this class of objects and type Ia SN progenitors. Methods. We study the time evolution of Ca ii, Na i, and K i absorption features in RS Oph before, during, and after the last outburst, using multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy and applying the same method as was adopted for SN 2006X and SN 2007le. Results. A number of components are detected, that are blue-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of RS Oph. In particular, one feature strongly weakens in the first two weeks after the outburst, at the same time that the very narrow P-Cyg profiles disappear, which are overimposed on the much wider nova emission lines of H, He, Fe ii, and other elements. Conclusions. We interpret this as the signature of density enhancements in the circumstellar material, suggesting that the recurrent eruptions might indeed create complex structures within the material lost by the donor star. This establishes a strong link between RS Oph and the progenitor system of the type Ia SN 2006X, for which similar features have been detected. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

abstract = {We model the galactic population of ultrashort-period binaries with helium white dwarf (WD) donors and carbon-oxygen WD accretors. Their total number is ∼ 108. Our model suggests that ∼ 10 systems of this kind, with V≤13.0 mag, 6≲Porb≲50 min and 0.03≲M2/M⊙≲0.15, may be observed. The rate of accretion-induced collapses in all systems with helium donors is a strong function of the efficiency of the orbital energy dissipation in the common envelope stages preceding their formation, and may be as high as ∼ 10-5 yr-1. The total galactic rate of supernovascale events induced by helium shell flashes on accreting white dwarfs in binary systems with degenerate and non-degenerate helium donors may be as high as ∼5 × 10-3 yr-1, comparable to the estimates of the galactic rate of type Ia supernovae. We estimate that among semidetached double-degenerate systems with helium donors up to ∼ 100 may be luminous supersoft X-ray sources which arise as a result of stationary helium burning at the surface of an accreting dwarf and/or of the presence of compact hot discs. Typical orbital periods of these systems are ∼ 2-4 min.},

abstract = {We have carried out a detailed study of one of the most favoured evolutionary channels for the production of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitors, the single-degenerate channel (CO + MS), where a carbon/oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes matter from an unevolved or slightly evolved non-degenerate star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit. Employing Eggleton's stellar evolution code and adopting the prescription of Hachisu et al. for the accretion efficiency, we performed binary stellar evolution calculations for about 2300 close WD binary systems and mapped out the initial parameters in the orbital period-secondary mass (P-M 2) plane (for a range of WD masses) which lead to a successful Type Ia supernova. We obtained accurate, analytical fitting formulae to describe this parameter range which can be used for binary population synthesis (BPS) studies. The contours in the P-M 2 plane differ from those obtained by Hachisu et al. for low-mass CO WDs, which are more common than massive CO WDs. We confirm that WDs with a mass as low as 0.67 M ⊙ can accrete efficiently and reach the Chandrasekhar limit. We have implemented these results in a BPS study to obtain the birth rates for SNe Ia and the evolution of birth rates with time of SNe Ia for both a constant star formation rate and a single starburst. The birth rates are lower than (but comparable to) those inferred observationally.},

abstract = {The discovery of supersoft X-ray sources, described as massive white dwarfs burning accreted matter from their (more massive) companions, opens a new channel to type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). According to conventional binary evolutionary theory, if the mass ratio of the donor to the white dwarf exceeds a critical value, the mass transfer becomes unstable, and a common envelope will be formed. However, recent calculations by Hachisu, Kato & Nomoto (1996) suggest a strong wind to stabilize the mass transfer when the mass transfer rate is higher than a certain value. Adopting the strong wind assumption , we have performed evolutionary calculations of white dwarf binaries, in which mass transfer occurs through Roche-lobe overflow, to search for the progenitors of SNe Ia. We find that there are two types of systems that can produce SNe Ia. One is close binaries with ∼ 2to∼3.5M main-sequence or subgiant companions, and the initial orbital period of several tenth of a day to several days. The other is wide binaries with low-mass (∼ 1M) red giant companions and long initial or-bital period (tens to hundreds of days). The derived birth rate of SNe Ia in the Galaxy is roughly consistent with the observed one.},

abstract = {We present long-duration numerical simulations of the tidal disruption of stars modelled with accurate stellar structures and spanning a range of pericentre distances, corresponding to cases where the stars are partially and completely disrupted. We substantiate the prediction that the late-time power-law index of the fallback rate n ∞ −5/3 for full disruptions, while for partial disruptions-in which the central part of the star survives the tidal encounter intact-we show that n ∞ −9/4. For the subset of simulations where the pericenter distance is close to that which delineates full from partial disruption, we find that a stellar core can reform after the star has been completely destroyed; for these events the energy of the zombie core is slightly positive, which results in late-time evolution from n −9/4 to n −5/3. We find that self-gravity can generate an n(t) that deviates from n ∞ by a small but significant amount for several years post-disruption. In one specific case with the stellar pericenter near the critical value, we find self-gravity also drives the re-collapse of the central regions of the debris stream into a collection of several cores while the rest of the stream remains relatively smooth. We also show that it is possible for the surviving stellar core in a partial disruption to acquire a circumstellar disc that is shed from the rapidly rotating core. Finally, we provide a novel analytical fitting function for the fallback rates that may also be useful in a range of contexts beyond TDEs.},

abstract = {Optical observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005bl in NGC 4070, obtained from -6 to +66 d with respect to the B-band maximum, are presented. The photometric evolution is characterized by rapidly declining light curves [$\Delta$m15(B)true = 1.93] and red colours at peak and soon thereafter. With MB,max = -17.24 the SN is an underluminous SN Ia, similar to the peculiar SNe 1991bg and 1999by. This similarity also holds for the spectroscopic appearance, the only remarkable difference being the likely presence of carbon in pre-maximum spectra of SN 2005bl. A comparison study among underluminous SNe Ia is performed, based on a number of spectrophotometric parameters. Previously reported correlations of the light-curve decline rate with peak luminosity and (Si) are confirmed, and a large range of post-maximum Si ii $\lambda$6355 velocity gradients is encountered. 1D synthetic spectra for SN 2005bl are presented, which confirm the presence of carbon and suggest an overall low burning efficiency with a significant amount of leftover unburned material. Also, the Fe content in pre-maximum spectra is very low, which may point to a low metallicity of the precursor. Implications for possible progenitor scenarios of underluminous SNe Ia are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {This is the second paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). In this paper, a complete SN sample is constructed, and the observed (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions (LFs) of SNe are derived. These LFs solve two issues that have plagued previous rate calculations for nearby SNe: the luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object and fit a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find significant fractions of SNe II-L (10 per cent), IIb (12 per cent) and IIn (9 per cent) in the SN II sample. Furthermore, we derive the LFs and the observed fractions of different SN subclasses in a magnitude-limited survey with different observation intervals, and find that the LFs are enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more 'standard' with smaller scatter, and that the LFs and fractions of SNe do not change significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10d. We also discuss the LFs in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for different SN subclasses. Some notable results are that there is not a strong correlation between the SN LFs and the host-galaxy size, but there might be a preference for SNe IIn to occur in small, late-type spiral galaxies. The LFs in different inclination bins do not provide strong evidence for extreme extinction in highly inclined galaxies, though the sample is still small. The LFs of different SN subclasses show significant differences. We also find that SNe Ibc and IIb come from more luminous galaxies than SNe II-P, while SNe IIn come from less luminous galaxies, suggesting a possible metallicity effect. The limitations and applications of our LFs are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We studied the spectral features of Si II $\lambda$$\lambda$4130, 5972, 6355 and S II W-trough for a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We find that in NV (Normal-Velocity) subclass of SNe Ia, these features tend to reach a maximum line strength near maximum light, except for Si II $\lambda$5972. Spectral features with higher excitation energy, such as S II W-trough, are relatively weak and have relatively low velocity. SNe Ia with larger ∆m 15 (B) tend to have lower velocities especially at phases after maximum light. NV SNe show a trend of increasing line strength with increasing ∆m 15 (B), while 91T/99aa-like SNe show an opposite trend. Near maximum light, the absorption depth of Si II $\lambda$5972 shows the strongest correlation with ∆m 15 (B), while at early times the sum of the depths of Si II $\lambda$$\lambda$4130 and 5972 shows the strongest correlation with ∆m 15 (B). The overall correlation between velocity and line strength is positive, but within NV SNe the correlation is negative or unrelated. In normal SNe Ia, the velocity-difference and depth-ratio of a longer-wavelength feature to a shorter-wavelength feature tend to increase with increasing ∆m 15 (B). These results are mostly well explained with atomic physics, but some puzzles remain, possibly related to the effects of the saturation, line competition or other factors.},

abstract = {As a promising channel to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we have proposed a symbiotic binary system consisting of a white dwarf (WD) and a low mass red-giant (RG), where strong winds from the accreting WD play a key role to increase the WD mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit. Here we propose two new evolutionary processes which make the symbiotic channel to SNe Ia much wider. (1) We first show that the WD + RG close binary can form from a wide binary even with such a large initial separation as $a_i \lesssim 40000 R_\odot$. Such a binary consists of an AGB star and a low mass main-sequence (MS) star, where the AGB star is undergoing superwind before becoming a WD. If the superwind at the end of AGB evolution is as fast as or slower than the orbital velocity, the wind outflowing from the system takes away the orbital angular momentum effectively. As a result the wide binary shrinks greatly to become a close binary. Therefore, the WD + RG binary can form from much wider binaries than our earlier estimate. (2) When the RG fills its inner critical Roche lobe, the WD undergoes rapid mass accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. Our earlier analysis has shown that the mass transfer is stabilized by this wind only when the mass ratio of RG/WD is smaller than 1.15. Our new finding is that the WD wind can strip mass from the RG envelope, which could be efficient enough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the RG/WD mass ratio exceeds 1.15. With the above two new effects (1) and (2), the symbiotic channel can account for the inferred rate of SNe Ia in our Galaxy.},

We show that several combinations of white dwarf masses and impact parameters are able to produce sufficient quantities of56Ni to be observable at cosmological distances. We find that the56Ni production in double-degenerate white dwarf collisions ranges from sub-luminous to the super-luminous, depending on the parameters of the collision. For all mass pairs, collisions with small impact parameters have the highest likelihood of detonating, but56Ni production is insensitive to this parameter in high-mass combinations, which significantly increases their likelihood of detection. We also find that the56Ni dependence on total mass and mass ratio is not linear, with larger-mass primaries producing disproportionately more56Ni than their lower-mass secondary counterparts, and symmetric pairs of masses producing more 56Ni than asymmetric pairs. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We made three-dimensional numerical simulations of collisions between white dwarfs using a smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with 5000 particles. The code allows for radiation and degenerate pressure and uses a reduced nuclear network which models the large release of nuclear energy. Two different collision models are considered over a range of impact parameters: between two 0.6 Mq carbon-oxygen white-dwarfs and between 0.9 M 0 and 0.7 M 0 carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. In nearly head-on collisions a very substantial fraction of the mass is lost as a result of a large release of nuclear energy. In grazing collisions, where nuclear energy release is much less important, the fraction of mass lost is close to that produced in collisions between main-sequence stars. The quantity of processed elements ejected into the interstellar medium by these collisions does not significantly affect the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Some grazing collisions produce a coalescence of the two white dwarfs into an object whose mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The inevitable collapse of this white dwarf is delayed by the high temperature and fast rotation it acquired in the collision. Subject headings: hydrodynamics stars: interiors-stars: mass loss-stars: white dwarfs I. INTRODUCTION Collisions between main-sequence stars are important in the cores of globular clusters (Hills and Day 1976) and in galactic nuclei. White dwarfs, being the end product of the envolution of most stars, should coexist in large numbers with main-sequence stars in these systems. We expect collisions in which one of the colliding stars is a compact object to be relatively frequent. Unfortunately, computer simulations of collisions between a white dwarf and a giant or between a white dwarf and a main-sequence star are exceptionally challenging because of the huge differences in densities and dimensions between these stars. Shara and Shaviv (1977, 1978), Shara and Regev (1986), and Regev and Shara (1987) attempted to simulate head-on collisions between main-sequence stars of various masses and a white dwarf (modeled as a point mass) in two dimensions using a very rudimentary scheme to model nuclear energy release. Simulations in three-dimensions of encounters between a low-mass main-sequence star and a white dwarf have been published recently by Soker et al (1987). They show that for a wide range of off-axis collisions the encounter resulted in the formation of a massive disk around the white dwarf. The formation of such disks was also obtained by Benz and Hills (1987, hereafter Paper I) in their simulations of main-sequence star collisions. We show in this paper that they also form in collisions of two white dwarfs. In this paper, which is the second step in the learning curve towards the simulation of collisions between main-sequence stars and compact objects, we investigate collisions between two white dwarfs. These collisions may seem quite unlikely since white dwarfs are about one to two orders-of-magnitude smaller than the lower main-sequence stars found in older},

abstract = {We construct a new model of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), based on the single degenerate scenario, taking account of the metallicity dependences of white dwarf (WD) wind and the mass-stripping effect on the binary companion star. Our model naturally predicts that SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of 0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at ∼0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the red giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be explained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of the metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the binary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H] −1, e.g., high-z spiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. Our SN Ia model can give better reproduction of the [($\alpha$, Mn, Zn)/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations in the solar neighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. The metallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young population of SNe Ia. We also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova rates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and the cosmic SN Ia rate history with a peak at z ∼ 1. At z 1, the predicted SN Ia rate decreases toward higher redshifts and SNe Ia will be observed only in the systems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment. This suggests that the evolution effect in the supernova cosmology can be small.},

We argue that both the presence of X-ray synchrotron radiation and the width of the synchrotron emitting region suggest a locally higher shock velocity of V_s = 2700 km/s and a magnetic field of B = 24+/-5 microGauss. Moreover, we also show that a simple power law cosmic ray electron spectrum with an exponential cut-off cannot explain the broad band synchrotron emission. Instead a concave electron spectrum is needed, as predicted by non-linear shock acceleration models. Finally, we show that the derived shock velocity strengthens the case that RCW 86 is the remnant of SN 185.},

However, some authors have suggested that the guest star might have been a comet. It has also been proposed that the record is the concatenation of a nova with a comet made by an early compiler. We have checked the record of the guest star, comparing it with records of comets in the same history. We find that most descriptions of comets clearly indicate motion, whereas the record of the guest star does not. We further argue that the term "yan" used to describe the star's "size" might be short for yan-chuang (seat bed), and "half a yan" would be simply as an imaginary figuration of the ancient observer. Moreover, we show that the term "hou -year" (hou-nian) most probably means the year after next. We argue that the asterism Southern Gate consisted of the stars $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Cen. We conclude that the record describing the guest star of AD 185 is completely different from any comet record in the same history, and that it almost certainly was a supernova.},

Observations of a supernova immediately following the explosion provide unique information on the distribution of ejected material and the progenitor system. Models predict that the interaction of supernova ejecta with a companion star or circumstellar debris lead to a sudden brightening lasting from hours to days. Here we present data for three supernovae that are likely to be type Ia observed during the Kepler mission with a time resolution of 30 minutes. We find no signatures of the supernova ejecta interacting with nearby companions. The lack of observable interaction signatures is consistent with the idea that these three supernovae resulted from the merger of binary white dwarfs or other compact stars such as helium stars.},

abstract = {The origin of the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is still uncertain. The coredegenerate (CD) scenario has been proposed as an alternative way for the production of SNe Ia. In this scenario, SNe Ia are formed at the final stage of common-envelope evolution from a merger of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) with the CO core of an asymptotic giant branch companion. However, the birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are still not well determined. In this work, we performed a detailed investigation on the CD scenario based on a binary population synthesis approach. The SN Ia delay times from this scenario are basically in the range of 90-2500 Myr, mainly contributing to the observed SNe Ia with short and intermediate delay times, although this scenario can also produce some old SNe Ia. Meanwhile, our work indicates that the Galactic birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are not more than 20 per cent of total SNe Ia due to more careful treatment of mass transfer. Although the SN Ia birthrates in this work are lower than those in Ilkov & Soker, the CD scenario cannot be ruled out as a viable mechanism for the formation of SNe Ia. Especially, SNe Ia with circumstellar material from this scenario contribute to 0.7-10 per cent of total SNe Ia, which means that the CD scenario can reproduce the observed birthrates of SNe Ia like PTF 11kx. We also found that SNe Ia happen systemically earlier for a high value of metallicity and their birthrates increase with metallicity.},

abstract = {In the core-degenerate (CD) scenario for the formation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) the Chandrasekhar or super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) is formed at the termination of the common envelope phase or during the planetary nebula phase, from a merger of a WD companion with the hot core of a massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The WD is destroyed and accreted onto the more massive core. In the CD scenario the rapidly rotating WD is formed shortly after the stellar formation episode, and the delay from stellar formation to explosion is basically determined by the spin-down time of the rapidly rotating merger remnant. The spin-down is due to the magneto-dipole radiation torque. Several properties of the CD scenario make it attractive compared with the double-degenerate (DD) scenario. (1) Off-center ignition of carbon during the merger process is not likely to occur. (2) No large envelope is formed. Hence avoiding too much mass loss that might bring the merger remnant below the critical mass. (3) This model explains the finding that more luminous SNe Ia occur preferentially in star forming galaxies. Copyright {\textcopyright} International Astronomical Union 2013.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO-WDs), are currently the best cosmological "standard candles," but the triggering mechanism of the explosion is unknown. It was recently shown that the rate of head-on collisions of typical field CO-WDs in triple systems may be comparable to the SNe Ia rate. Here we provide evidence supporting a scenario in which the majority of SNe Ia are the result of such head-on collisions of CO-WDs. In this case, the nuclear detonation is due to a well understood shock ignition, devoid of commonly introduced free parameters such as the deflagration velocity or transition to detonation criteria. By using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a fully resolved ignition process, we show that zero-impact-parameter collisions of typical CO-WDs with masses 0.5-1 Ṁ result in explosions that synthesize 56Ni masses in the range of ∼0.1-1 Ṁ, spanning the wide distribution of yields observed for the majority of SNe Ia. All collision models yield the same late-time (≳ 60 days since explosion) bolometric light curve when normalized by 56Ni masses (to better than 30%), in agreement with observations. The calculated widths of the 56Ni-mass-weighted line-of-sight velocity distributions are correlated with the calculated 56Ni yield, agreeing with the observed correlation. The strong correlation, shown here for the first time, between 56Ni yield and total mass of the colliding CO-WDs (insensitive to their mass ratio), is suggestive as the source for the continuous distribution of observed SN Ia features, possibly including the Philips relation. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {This is the second paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). In this paper, a complete SN sample is constructed, and the observed (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions (LFs) of SNe are derived. These LFs solve two issues that have plagued previous rate calculations for nearby SNe: the luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object and fit a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find significant fractions of SNe II-L (10 per cent), IIb (12 per cent) and IIn (9 per cent) in the SN II sample. Furthermore, we derive the LFs and the observed fractions of different SN subclasses in a magnitude-limited survey with different observation intervals, and find that the LFs are enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more 'standard' with smaller scatter, and that the LFs and fractions of SNe do not change significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10 d. We also discuss the LFs in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for different SN subclasses. Some notable results are that there is not a strong correlation between the SN LFs and the host-galaxy size, but there might be a preference for SNe IIn to occur in small, late-type spiral galaxies. The LFs in different inclination bins do not provide strong evidence for extreme extinction in highly inclined galaxies, though the sample is still small. The LFs of different SN subclasses show significant differences. We also find that SNe Ibc and IIb come from more luminous galaxies than SNe II-P, while SNe IIn come from less luminous galaxies, suggesting a possible metallicity effect. The limitations and applications of our LFs are also discussed.},

abstract = {With growing data from ongoing and future supernova surveys, it is possible to empirically quantify the shapes of SNIa light curves in more detail, and to quantitatively relate the shape parameters with the intrinsic properties of SNIa. Building such relationships is critical in controlling systematic errors associated with supernova cosmology. Based on a collection of well-observed SNIa samples accumulated in the past years, we construct an empirical SNIa light curve model using a statistical method called the functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for sparse and irregularly sampled functional data. Using this method, the entire light curve of an SNIa is represented by a linear combination of principal component functions, and the SNIa is represented by a few numbers called "principal component scores." These scores are used to establish relations between light curve shapes and physical quantities such as intrinsic color, interstellar dust reddening, spectral line strength, and spectral classes. These relations allow for descriptions of some critical physical quantities based purely on light curve shape parameters. Our study shows that some important spectral feature information is being encoded in the broad band light curves; for instance, we find that the light curve shapes are correlated with the velocity and velocity gradient of the Si II $\lambda$6355 line. This is important for supernova surveys (e.g., LSST and WFIRST). Moreover, the FPCA light curve model is used to construct the entire light curve shape, which in turn is used in a functional linear form to adjust intrinsic luminosity when fitting distance models.},

abstract = {We undertake a theoretical study of the near-infrared (NIR) lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In these bands, the lightcurves are distinguished by a secondary maximum occurring roughly 20 to 30 days after the initial one. Using time-dependent multi-group radiative transfer calculations, we calculate the UBVRIJHK-band lightcurves of model SN Ia ejecta structures. Our synthetic NIR lightcurves show distinct secondary maxima, and provide favorable fits to observed SNe Ia. We offer a detailed explanation of the origin of the NIR secondary maximum, which is shown to relate directly to the ionization evolution of iron group elements in the ejecta. This understanding provides immediate intuition into the dependence of the NIR lightcurves on the physical properties of the ejecta, and in particular explains why brighter supernovae have a later and more prominent secondary maximum. We demonstrate the dependence of the NIR lightcurves on the mass of 56Ni, the degree of 56Ni mixing, the mass of electron caputre elements, the progenitor metallicity, and the abundance of intermediate mass elements (especially calcium). The secondary maximum is shown to be a valuable diagnostic of these important physical parameters. The models further confirm that SNe Ia should be excellent standard candles in the NIR, with a dispersion < 0.2 mag even when the physical properties of the ejecta are varied widely. This study emphasizes the consummate value of NIR observations in probing the structure of SNe Ia and in furthering their cosmological utility.},

We show that the dust extinction of the objects where the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 {\AA} is detected is consistent with the visual extinction derived from the supernova colors. This strongly suggests that the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in the interstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar material associated with the progenitor system. One quarter of the supernovae display anomalously large Na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their colors. Remarkably, all of the cases of unusually strong Na i D absorption correspond to "Blueshifted" profiles in the classification scheme of Sternberg et al. This coincidence suggests that outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the cases of anomalously large Na i column densities. Two supernovae with unusually strong Na i D absorption showed essentially normal K i column densities for the dust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be a universal characteristic. Overall, we find the most accurate predictor of individual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 {\AA}, and provide an empirical relation for its use. Finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the Na abundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate and double-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.},

abstract = {The supernova remnant LMC N132D is a remarkably luminous gamma-ray emitter at ∼50 kpc with an age of ∼2500 years. It belongs to the small group of oxygen-rich SNRs, which includes Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and Puppis A. N132D is interacting with a nearby molecular cloud. By adding 102 hours of new observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) to the previously published data with exposure time of 150 hours, we achieve the significant detection of N132D at a 5.7$\sigma$ level in the very high energy (VHE) domain. The gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with a single power law extending above 10 TeV. We set a lower limit on an exponential cutoff energy at 8 TeV with 95% CL. The multi-wavelength study supports a hadronic origin of VHE gamma-ray emission indicating the presence of sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons. The detection of N132D is remarkable since the TeV luminosity is higher than that of Cas A by more than an order of magnitude. Its luminosity is comparable to, or even exceeding the luminosity of RX J1713.7-3946 or HESS J1640-465. Moreover, the extended power-law tail in the VHE spectrum of N132D is surprising given both the exponential cutoff at 3.5 TeV in the spectrum of its 340-year-old sibling, Cassiopeia A, and the lack of TeV emission from a Fermi-LAT 2FHL source (E > 50 GeV) associated with Puppis A. We discuss a physical scenario leading to the enhancement of TeV emission via the interaction between N132D and a near molecular cloud.

abstract = {This work aims to study different probes of Type Ia supernova progenitors that have been suggested to be linked to the presence of circumstellar material (CSM). In particular, we have investigated, for the first time, the link between narrow blueshifted Na D absorption profiles and the presence and strength of the broad high-velocity Ca near infrared triplet absorption features seen in Type Ia supernovae around maximum light. With the probes exploring different distances from the supernova; Na D > 10 17 cm, high-velocity Ca features < 10 15 cm. For this, we have used a new intermediate-resolution X-shooter spectral sample of 15 Type Ia supernovae. We do not identify a link between these two probes, implying either that, one (or both) is not physically related to the presence of CSM or that the occurrence of CSM at the distance explored by one probe is not linked to its presence at the distance probed by the other. However, the previously identified statistical excess in the presence of blueshifted (over redshifted) Na D absorption is confirmed in this sample at high significance and is found to be stronger in Type Ia supernovae hosted by late-type galaxies. This excess is difficult to explain as being from an interstellar-medium origin as has been suggested by some recent modelling, as such an origin is not expected to show a bias for blueshifted absorption. However, a circumstellar origin for these features also appears unsatisfactory based on our new results given the lack of link between the two probes of CSM investigated.},

abstract = {We have assembled a data set of 165 low redshift, z < 0.06, publicly available Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We produce maximum light magnitude (MB and MV) distributions of SNe Ia to explore the diversity of parameter space that they can fill. Before correction for host galaxy extinction we find that the mean MB and MV of SNe Ia are -18.58 ± 0.07 and -18.72 ± 0.05 mag, respectively. Host galaxy extinction is corrected using a new method based on the SN spectrum. After correction, the mean values of MB and MV of SNe Ia are -19.10 ± 0.06 and -19.10 ± 0.05 mag, respectively. After correction for host galaxy extinction, 'normal' SNe Ia ($\Delta$m15(B) < 1.6 mag) fill a larger parameter space in the width-luminosity relation than previously suggested, and there is evidence for luminous SNe Ia with large $\Delta$m15(B). We find a bimodal distribution in $\Delta$m15(B), with a pronounced lack of transitional events at $\Delta$m15(B) = 1.6 mag. We confirm that faster, low-luminosity SNe tend to come from passive galaxies. Dividing the sample by host galaxy type, SNe Ia from star-forming (S-F) galaxies have a mean MB = -19.20 ± 0.05 mag, while SNe Ia from passive galaxies have a mean MB = -18.57 ± 0.24 mag. Even excluding fast declining SNe, 'normal' (MB < -18 mag) SNe Ia from S-F and passive galaxies are distinct. In the V band, there is a difference of 0.4 ± 0.13 mag between the median (MV) values of the 'normal' SN Ia population from passive and S-F galaxies. This is consistent with ($\sim$15 ± 10) per cent of 'normal' SNe Ia from S-F galaxies coming from an old stellar population.},

abstract = {Using light curves and host galaxy spectra of 101 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with redshift z < 0.3fromthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey Supernova Survey (SDSS-SN), we derive the SN Ia rate as a function of progenitor age (the delay time distribution, DTD). We use the VESPA stellar population synthesis algorithm to analyze the SDSS spectra of all galaxies in the field searched by SDSS-SN, giving us a reference sample of 77, 000 galaxies for our SN Ia hosts. Our method does not assume any a priori shape for the DTD and is therefore minimally parametric. We present the DTD in physical units for high-stretch (luminous, slow declining) and low-stretch (subluminous, fast declining) supernovae in three progenitor age bins. We find strong evidence of two progenitor channels: one that produces high-stretch SNe Ia < ∼400 Myr after the birth of the progenitor system, and one that produces low-stretch SNe Ia with a delay > ∼2.4 Gyr. We find that each channel contributes roughly half of the Type Ia rate in our reference sample. We also construct the average spectra of high-stretch and low-stretch SN Ia host galaxies, and find that the difference of these spectra looks like a main-sequence B star with nebular emission lines indicative of star formation. This supports our finding that there are two populations of SNe Ia, and indicates that the progenitors of high-stretch supernovae are at the least associated with very recent star formation in the last few tens of Myr. Our results provide valuable constraints for models of Type Ia progenitors and may help improve the calibration of SNe Ia as standard candles. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {The rate of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a galaxy depends not only on stellar mass, but also on star formation history. Here we show that two simple observational quantities ($g-r$ or $u-r$ host galaxy color, and $r$-band luminosity), coupled with an assumed delay time distribution (the rate of SNe Ia as a function of time for an instantaneous burst of star formation), are sufficient to accurately determine a galaxy's SN Ia rate, with very little sensitivity to the precise details of the star formation history. Using this result, we compare observed and predicted color distributions of SN Ia hosts for the MENeaCS cluster supernova survey, and for the SDSS Stripe 82 supernova survey. The observations are consistent with a continuous delay time distribution (DTD), without any cutoff. For old progenitor systems the power-law slope for the DTD is found to be $-1.50 ^{+0.19} _{-0.15}$. This result favours the double degenerate scenario for SN Ia, though other interpretations are possible. We find that the late-time slopes of the delay time distribution are different at the 1$\sigma$ level for low and high stretch supernova, which suggest a single degenerate scenario for the latter. However, due to ambiguity in the current models' DTD predictions, single degenerate progenitors can neither be confirmed as causing high stretch supernovae nor ruled out from contributing to the overall sample.},

Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have imaged 25 galaxy-cluster fields and parallel fields of non-cluster galaxies. We report a sample of 27 SNe discovered in the parallel fields. Of these SNe,13 are classified as SN Ia candidates, including four SN Ia candidates at redshifts z > 1.2. We measure volumetric SN Ia rates to redshift 1.8 and add the first upper limit on the SN Ia rate in the range 1.8 < z < 2.4. The results are consistent with the rates measured by the HST/GOODS and Subaru Deep Field SN surveys. We model these results together with previous measurements at z < 1 from the literature. The best-fitting SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst of star formation and subsequent SN Ia explosions) is a power law with an index of , where the statistical uncertainty is a result of the 68% and 95% (in parentheses) statistical uncertainties reported for the various SN Ia rates (from this work and from the literature), and the systematic uncertainty reflects the range of possible cosmic star-formation histories. We also test DTD models produced by an assortment of published binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations. The shapes of all BPS double-degenerate DTDs are consistent with the volumetric SN Ia measurements, when the DTD models are scaled up by factors of 3-9. In contrast, all BPS single-degenerate DTDs are ruled out by the measurements at >99% significance level. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most types of supernovae (SNe) have yet to be connected with their progenitor stellar systems. Here, we reanalyze the 10-year SN sample collected during 1998-2008 by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) in order to constrain the progenitors of SNe Ia and stripped-envelope SNe (SE SNe, i.e., SNe$\sim$IIb, Ib, Ic, and broad-lined Ic). We matched the LOSS galaxy sample with spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measured SN rates as a function of galaxy stellar mass, specific star formation rate, and oxygen abundance (metallicity). We find significant correlations between the SN rates and all three galaxy properties. The SN Ia correlations are consistent with other measurements, as well as with our previous explanation of these measurements in the form of a combination of the SN Ia delay-time distribution and the correlation between galaxy mass and age. The ratio between the SE SN and SN II rates declines significantly in low-mass galaxies. This rules out single stars as SE$\sim$SN progenitors, and is consistent with predictions from binary-system progenitor models. Using well-known galaxy scaling relations, any correlation between the rates and one of the galaxy properties examined here can be expressed as a correlation with the other two. These redundant correlations preclude us from establishing causality - that is, from ascertaining which of the galaxy properties (or their combination) is the physical driver for the difference between the SE SN and SN II rates. We outline several methods that have the potential to overcome this problem in future works.},

Here, we test this result by splitting the volume-limited subsample of the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) SN sample into low- and high-mass galaxies and comparing the relative rates of various SN types found in them. The LOSS volume-limited sample contains 180 SNe and SN impostors and is complete for SNe Ia out to 80 Mpc and core-collapse SNe out to 60 Mpc. All of these transients were recently reclassified by us in Shivvers et al. (2017). We find that the relative rates of some types of SNe differ between low- and high-mass galaxies: SNe Ib and Ic are underrepresented by a factor of $\sim$3 in low-mass galaxies. These galaxies also contain the only examples of SN 1987A-like SNe in the sample and host about 9 times as many SN impostors. Normal SNe Ia seem to be $\sim$30\% more common in low-mass galaxies, making these galaxies better sources for homogeneous SN Ia cosmology samples. The relative rates of SNe IIb are consistent in both low- and high-mass galaxies. The same is true for broad-line SNe Ic, although our sample includes only two such objects. The results presented here are in tension with a similar analysis from the Palomar Transient Factory, especially as regards SNe IIb.},

abstract = {Late-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), >900 days after explosion, have shown that this type of SN does not suffer an "IR catastrophe" at 500 days as previously predicted. Instead, several groups have observed a slow-down in the optical light curves of these SNe. A few reasons have been suggested for this slow-down, from a changing fraction of positrons reprocessed by the expanding ejecta, through a boost of energy from slow radioactive decay chains such as 57Co --> 57Fe, to atomic "freeze-out." Discovering which of these (or some other) heating mechanisms is behind the slow-down will directly impact studies of SN Ia progenitors, explosion models, and nebular-stage physics. Recently, Graur et al. (2018) suggested a possible correlation between the shape of the late-time light curves of four SNe Ia and their stretch values, which are proxies for their intrinsic luminosities. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope observations of the SN Ia ASASSN-14lp at $\sim$850-960 days past maximum light. With a stretch of s = 1.15 +/- 0.05, it is the most luminous normal SN Ia observed so far at these late times. We rule out contamination by light echoes and show that the late-time, optical light curve of ASASSN-14lp is flatter than that of previous SNe Ia observed at late times. This result is in line with-and strengthens-the Graur et al. (2018) correlation, but additional SNe are needed to verify it.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the assumption that the width-luminosity relation (WLR) and the color-luminosity relation (CLR) in the type Ia SN luminosity standardization would not vary with progenitor age. Unlike this expectation, recent age datings of stellar populations in host galaxies have shown significant correlations between progenitor age and Hubble residual (HR). It was not clear, however, how this correlation arises from the SN luminosity standardization process, and how this would impact the cosmological result. Here we show that this correlation originates from a strong progenitor age dependence of the WLR and the CLR, in the sense that SNe from younger progenitors are fainter each at given light-curve parameters x 1 and c. This is reminiscent of Baade's discovery of two Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and, as such, causes a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. Other host properties show substantially smaller and insignificant differences in the WLR and CLR for the same dataset. We illustrate that the differences between the high-z and low-z SNe in the WLR and CLR, and in HR after the standardization, are fully comparable to those between the correspondingly young and old SNe at intermediate redshift, indicating that the observed dimming of SNe with redshift is most likely an artifact of over-correction in the luminosity standardization. When this systematic bias with redshift is properly taken into account, there is no or little evidence left for an accelerating universe, posing a serious question to one of the cornerstones of the concordance model.},

abstract = {The first observational evidence for the cosmic acceleration appeared from the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) Hubble diagram from two different groups. However, the empirical treatment of SNe Ia and their ability to show cosmic acceleration have been the subject of some debate in the literature. In this work we probe the assumption of redshift-independent absolute magnitude (M B) of SNe along with its correlation with spatial curvature (Ω k0) and cosmic distance dual-ity relation (CDDR) parameter ($\eta$(z)). This work is divided into two parts. Firstly, we check the validity of CDDR which relates the luminosity distance (d L) and angular diameter distance (d A) via redshift. We use three different redshift-dependent parametrizations of the distance duality parameter ($\eta$(z)). CDDR is fairly consistent for almost every parametrization within 95% confidence level in both flat and non-flat universe. However, one of the parametrizations does not validate CDDR in the case of a non-flat universe. In second part, we take the validity of CDDR for granted and emphasise on the variability of M B and its correlation with Ω k0. We choose three different redshift-dependent parametrizations of M B. The results indicate no evolution of M B at 99% confidence level but clearly indicates the inclination towards a non-flat open universe. We further extend our analysis and examine the dependence of the results on the choice of different priors for H 0 .},

abstract = {Dense circumstellar material (CSM) is thought to play an important role in observed luminous optical transients: if such CSM is shocked, e.g. by ejecta expelled from the progenitor during core-collapse, then radiation produced by the shock-heated CSM can power bright UV/optical emission. If the initial CSM has an 'outer edge' where most of the mass is contained and at which the optical depth is large, then shock breakout-when photons are first able to escape the shocked CSM-occurs near this outer edge. The ∼thin shell of shocked CSM subsequently expands, and in the ensuing cooling-envelope phase, radiative and adiabatic losses compete to expend the CSM thermal energy. Here we derive an analytic solution to the bolometric light-curve produced by such shocked CSM. For the first time, we provide a solution to the cooling-envelope phase that is applicable already starting from shock breakout. In particular, we account for the planar CSM geometry that is relevant at early times and impose physically-motivated initial conditions. We show that these effects can dramatically impact the resulting light-curves, particularly if the CSM optical depth is only marginally larger than c/v sh (where v sh is the shock velocity). This has important implications for interpreting observed fast optical transients, which have previously been modeled using either computationally-expensive numerical simulations or more simplified models that do not properly capture the early light-curve evolution.},

abstract = {We present an investigation of the optical spectra of 264 low-redshift (z < 0.2) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory, an untargeted transient survey. We focus on velocity and pseudo-equivalent width measurements of the Si II 4130, 5972, and 6355{\AA} lines, as well those of the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet, up to +5 days relative to the SN B-band maximum light. We find that a high-velocity component of the Ca II NIR triplet is needed to explain the spectrum in 95 per cent of SNe Ia observed before-5 days, decreasing t{\~{o}}80 per cent at maximum. The average velocity of the Ca II highvelocity component is 8500 km s<sup>-1</sup> higher than the photospheric component. We confirm previous results that SNe Ia around maximum light with a larger contribution from the highvelocity component relative to the photospheric component in their Ca II NIR feature have, on average, broader light curves and lower Ca II NIR photospheric velocities. We find that these relations are driven by both a stronger high-velocity component and a weaker contribution from the photospheric Ca II NIR component in broader light curve SNe Ia. We identify the presence of C II in very-early-time SN Ia spectra (before -10 days), finding that >40 per cent of SNe Ia observed at these phases show signs of unburnt material in their spectra, and that C II features are more likely to be found in SNe Ia having narrower light curves.},

SN 2019muj exhibits almost identical characteristics with the subluminous SNe Iax 2008ha and 2010ae in terms of the observed spectral features and the light curve evolution at the early phase, except for the peak luminosity. The long-term observations unveil the flattening light curves at the late time as seen in a luminous SN Iax 2014dt. This can be explained by the existence of an inner dense and optically-thick component possibly associated with a bound white dwarf remnant left behind the explosion. We demonstrate that the weak deflagration model with a wide range of the explosion parameters can reproduce the late-phase light curves of other SNe Iax. Therefore, we conclude that a common explosion mechanism operates for different subclass SNe Iax.},

abstract = {Current time domain facilities are finding several hundreds of transient astronomical events a year. The discovery rate is expected to increase in the future as soon as new surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Large Synoptic Sky Survey (LSST) come on line. At the present time, the rate at which transients are classified is approximately one order or magnitude lower than the discovery rate, leading to an increasing "follow-up drought". Existing telescopes with moderate aperture can help address this deficit when equipped with spectrographs optimized for spectral classification. Here, we provide an overview of the design, operations and first results of the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM), operating on the Palomar 60-inch telescope (P60). The instrument is optimized for classification and high observing efficiency. It combines a low-resolution (R∼100) integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph with "Rainbow Camera" (RC), a multi-band field acquisition camera which also serves as multi-band (ugri) photometer. The SEDM was commissioned during the operation of the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and has already proved lived up to its promise. The success of the SEDM demonstrates the value of spectrographs optimized to spectral classification. Introduction of similar spectrographs on existing telescopes will help alleviate the follow-up drought and thereby accelerate the rate of discoveries.},

abstract = {The light curves of type Ia supernovae are routinely used to constrain cosmology models. Driven by radioactive decay of 56Ni, the light curves steadily decline over time, but after 150 d post-explosion the near-infrared portion is poorly characterized. We report a year-long plateau in the near-infrared light curve at 150–500 d, followed by a second decline phase accompanied by a possible appearance of [Fe i] emission lines. This near-infrared plateau contrasts sharply with type IIP plateaux and requires a new physical mechanism. We suggest a masking of the ‘near-infrared catastrophe'—a predicted, yet unobserved, sharp light-curve decline—by scattering of ultraviolet photons to longer wavelengths. The transition off the plateau could be due to a change in the dominant ionization state of the supernova ejecta. Our results help explain the complex radiative transfer processes that take place in type Ia supernovae and enhance their use as ‘standard candles'.},

Letters 484, L79–L84 (2019). In the analysis section of the paper, an error occurred in correcting for the width of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow-band filters (60 {\AA} and 65 {\AA} for F487N and F502N, respectively) when comparing with our theoretical models. This introduces an offset in the modelled surface brightnesses shown in the original manuscript's Fig. 2, as well as the upper limits in Fig. 3. The corrected versions are shown in Figs 1 and 2 below. Despite this correction, our revised upper limits remain the strongest existing constrains on the ionizing luminosity of the progenitor of SN 2014J, and are deeper than X-ray limits on the bolometric luminosity for T = 6 × 105 K. For an assumed 1 cm−3 constant surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) density, however, we cannot exclude a progenitor comparable to most known supersoft sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), nor can we exclude Chandrasekhar-mass helium accretors in the steadyburning or mild-flashes regimes for the same assumed ISM density. Our observed [O III] upper limits remain in tension with theoretical models and observed LMC supersoft sources for surrounding ISM densities of order nISM ∼ 10 cm−3 and higher (see Fig. 2). As concluded in the original manuscript, future efforts will be able to resolve this ambiguity with deeper observations.},

abstract = {2 Ashall et al. We present a multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic analysis of thirteen "Super-Chandrasekhar Mass"/2003fg-like type Ia Supernova (SNe Ia). Nine of these objects were observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project. 2003fg-like SNe have slowly declining light curves (∆m 15 (B) <1.3 mag), and peak absolute B-band magnitudes between −19 < M B < −21 mag. Many 2003fg-like SNe are located in the same part of the luminosity width relation as normal SNe Ia. In the optical B and V bands, 2003fg-like SNe look like normal SNe Ia, but at redder wavelengths they diverge from normal objects. Unlike other luminous SNe Ia, 2003fg-like SNe generally have only one i-band maximum which peaks after the epoch of B-band maximum, while their NIR light curve rise times can be 40 days longer than those of normal SNe Ia. They are also at least one magnitude brighter in the NIR bands than normal SNe Ia, peaking above M H < −19 mag, and generally have negative Hubble residuals. Spectroscopically, 2003fg-like SNe exhibit peculiarities such as unburnt carbon well past maximum light, a large spread (8000-12000 km s −1) in Si ii $\lambda$6355 velocities at maximum light with no rapid early velocity decline, no clear H-band break at +10 d, and low ionization lines in the nebular phase. We find that SNe with a larger pseudo equivalent width of C ii at maximum light have lower Si ii $\lambda$6355 velocities and slower declining light curves. There are also multiple factors that contribute to the peak luminosity of 2003fg-like SNe. The explosion of a CO degenerate core inside a carbon-rich envelope is consistent with these observations. Such a configuration may come from the core degenerate scenario.},

The availability of deep pre-explosion imaging allowed us to place tight constraints on the explosion epoch. Our observational campaign began approximately one day post-explosion, and extended over a period of about 150 days post maximum light, making it one of the best observed objects of this class to date. We find a peak magnitude of M r = −17.27 ± 0.07, and a (∆m 15) r = 0.69 ± 0.04. Comparing our observations to synthetic spectra generated from simulations of deflagrations of Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, we find reasonable agreement with models of weak deflagra-tions that result in the ejection of ∼0.2 M of material containing ∼0.07 M of 56 Ni. The model light curve however, evolves more rapidly than observations, suggesting that a higher ejecta mass is to be favoured. Nevertheless, empirical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve suggests that 0.6 M of material was ejected, implying that the white dwarf is not completely disrupted, and that a bound remnant is a likely outcome.},

abstract = {The nearby supernova SN 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail. Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models, which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN 2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white dwarfs (WDs)-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most widely discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum, but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified. Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads to differences in the 55 Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed sufficiently long to study this effect.},

abstract = {The progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are still under debate. Based on recent hydrodynamics simulations, non-degenerate companions in the single-degenerate scenario (SDS) should survive the supernova (SN) impact. One way to distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario is to search for the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants. Using a technique that combines multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations, we have examined the post-impact evolution of helium-rich binary companions in the SDS. It is found that these helium-rich PIRSs (He PIRSs) dramatically expand and evolve to a luminous phase (L ∼ 10 4 L) about 10 yr after an SN explosion. Subsequently, they contract and evolve to become hot blue-subdwarf-like (sdO-like) stars by releasing gravitational energy, persisting as sdO-like stars for several million years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase. We therefore predict that a luminous OB-like star should be detectable within ∼30 yr after the SN explosion. Thereafter, it will shrink and become an sdO-like star in the central regions of SN Ia remnants within star-forming regions for SN Ia progenitors evolved via the helium-star channel in the SDS. These He PIRSs are predicted to be rapidly rotating (v rot 50 km s −1) and to have high spatial velocities (v linear 500 km s −1). Furthermore, if SN remnants have diffused away and are not recognizable at a later stage, He PIRSs could be an additional source of single sdO stars and/or hypervelocity stars.},

We found that the near-infrared (NIR) light curve evolutions and color evolutions are similar to those of SNe Iax 2005hk and 2008ha. The NIR absolute magnitudes (M J ∼ −18.1 mag and M H ∼ −18.3 mag) and the rate of decline of the light curve (∆ m 15 (B)= 1.6 ± 0.1 mag) are very similar to those of SN 2005hk (M J ∼ −17.7 mag, M H ∼−18.0 mag, and ∆ m 15 (B)∼ 1.6 mag), yet differ significantly from SNe 2008ha and 2010ae (M J ∼ −14 − −15 mag and ∆ m 15 (B)∼ 2.4 − 2.7 mag). The estimated rise time is 12.0 ± 3.0 days, which is significantly shorter than that of SN 2005hk or any other Ia SNe. The rapid rise indicates that the 56 Ni distribution may extend into the outer layer or that the effective opacity may be lower than that in normal SNe Ia. The late-phase spectrum exhibits broader emission lines than those of SN 2005hk by a factor of 6-8. Such high velocities of the emission lines indicate that the density profile of the inner ejecta extends more than that of SN 2005hk. We argue that the most favored explosion scenario is a 'failed deflagration' model, although the pulsational delayed detonations is not excluded.

abstract = {In most astrophysical situations, the radioactive decay of Ni 56 to Co 56 occurs via electron capture with a fixed half-life of 6.1 days. However, this decay rate is significantly slowed when the nuclei are fully ionized because K-shell electrons are unavailable for capture. In this paper, we explore the effect of these delayed decays on white dwarfs (WDs) that may survive Type Ia and Type Iax supernovae (SNe Ia and SNe Iax). The energy released by the delayed radioactive decays of Ni 56 and Co 56 drives a persistent wind from the surviving WD's surface that contributes to the late-time appearance of these SNe after emission from the bulk of the SN ejecta has faded. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to calculate the hydrodynamic evolution and resulting light curves of these winds. Our post-SN Ia models conflict with late-time observations of SN 2011fe, but uncertainties in our initial conditions prevent us from ruling out the existence of surviving WD donors. Much better agreement with observations is achieved with our models of post-SN Iax bound remnants, providing evidence that these explosions are due to deflagrations in accreting WDs that fail to completely unbind the WDs. Future radiative transfer calculations and wind models utilizing simulations of explosions for more accurate initial conditions will extend our study of radioactively powered winds from post-SN surviving WDs and enable their use as powerful discriminants among the various SN Ia and SN Iax progenitor scenarios.},

abstract = {Type-Iax supernovae (SN Iax) are stellar explosions that are spectroscopically similar to some type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at maximum light, except with lower ejecta velocities 1, 2. They are also distinguished by lower luminosities. At late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from other SN 3-6 , but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-mass elements 1, 7) suggests a physical connection to normal SN Ia. These are not rare; SN Iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal SN Ia rate 1. The leading models for SN Iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (C/O WD) that do not completely unbind the star 8-10 , implying they are "less suc-cessful" cousins of normal SN Ia, where complete disruption is observed. Here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of the type-Iax SN 2012Z in deep pre-explosion imaging. Its luminosity, colors, environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the Galactic helium nova V445 Puppis 11-13 , suggest that SN 2012Z was the explosion of a WD accreting from a helium-star companion. Observations in the next few years, after SN 2012Z has faded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernova was actually the explosive death of a massive star 14, 15. SN 2012Z was discovered 16 in the Lick Observatory Su-pernova Search on UT 2012-Jan-29.15. It had an optical spectrum similar to the type-Iax (previously called SN 2002cx-like) SN 2005hk 3-5 (see Extended Data Fig. 1). The similarities between SN Iax and normal SN Ia make understanding SN Iax progenitors important, especially because no normal SN Ia progenitor has been identified. Like core-collapse SN (but also slowly-declining, luminous SN Ia), SN Iax are found preferentially in young, star-forming galaxies 17, 18. A single SN Iax, SN 2008ge, was in a relatively old (S0) galaxy with no indication of current star formation to deep limits 19. Non-detection of the progenitor of SN 2008ge in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pre-explosion imaging restricts its initial mass 12 M, and combined with the lack of hydrogen or helium in the SN 2008ge spectrum, favours a white dwarf progenitor 19. Deep observations of NGC 1309, the host galaxy of SN 2012Z, were obtained with HST in 2005-2006 and 2010, serendipitously including the location of the supernova before its explosion. To pinpoint the position of SN 2012Z with high precision, we obtained follow-up HST data in 2013. Colour-composite images made from these observations before and after the supernova are shown in Fig. 1, and photometry of stellar sources in the pre-explosion images near the supernova location is reported in Extended Data Table 1. We detect a source, called S1, coincident with the supernova at a formal separation of 0. 0082 ± 0. 0103 (equal to 1.3 ± 1.6 pc at 33 Mpc, the distance to NGC 1309 20, 21). The pre-explosion data reach a 3$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of MV ≈ −3.5, quite deep for typical extra-galactic SN progenitor searches 22 , but certainly the possibility exists that the progenitor system of SN 2012Z was of lower lu-minosity and would be undetected in our data (as has been the case for all normal SN Ia progenitor searches to date 23). However , the locations of SN 2012Z and S1 are identical to within 0.8$\sigma$, and we estimate only a 0.24% (2.1%) probability that a random position near SN 2012Z would be within 1$\sigma$ (3$\sigma$) of any detected star, making a chance alignment unlikely (see Methods, and Extended Data Fig. 2). We also observe evidence for vari-1},

abstract = {A dark-energy which behaves as the cosmological constant until a sudden phantom transition at very-low redshift (z < 0.1) seems to solve the >4$\sigma$ disagreement between the local and high-redshift determinations of the Hubble constant, while maintaining the phenomenological success of the $\Lambda$CDM model with respect to the other observ-ables. Here, we show that such a hockey-stick dark energy cannot solve the H 0 crisis. The basic reason is that the supernova absolute magnitude M B that is used to derive the local H 0 constraint is not compatible with the M B that is necessary to fit super-nova, BAO and CMB data, and this disagreement is not solved by a sudden phantom transition at very-low redshift. We make use of this example to show why it is preferable to adopt in the statistical analyses the prior on M B as an alternative to the prior on H 0. The three reasons are: i) one avoids potential double counting of low-redshift supernovae, ii) one avoids assuming the validity of cosmography, in particular fixing the deceleration parameter to the standard model value q 0 = −0.55, iii) one includes in the analysis the fact that M B is constrained by local calibration, an information which would otherwise be neglected in the analysis, biasing both model selection and parameter constraints. We provide the priors on M B relative to the recent Pantheon and DES-SN3YR supernova catalogs. We also provide a Gaussian joint prior on H 0 and q 0 that generalizes the prior on H 0 by SH0ES.},

abstract = {We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of supernova (SN) 2019cad during the first ∼ 100 days from explosion. Based on the light curve morphology, we find that SN 2019cad resembles the double-peaked type Ib/c SN 2005bf and the type Ic PTF11mnb. Unlike those two objects, SN 2019cad also shows the initial peak in the redder bands. Inspection of the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±−band light curve indicates the initial peak is reached in ∼8 days, while the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± band peak occurred ∼15 days post-explosion. A second and more prominent peak is reached in all bands at ∼45 days past explosion, followed by a fast decline from ∼60 days. During the first 30 days, the spectra of SN 2019cad show the typical features of a type Ic SN, however, after 40 days, a blue continuum with prominent lines of Si {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6355 and C {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6580 is observed again. Comparing the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2019cad is consistent with a pre-SN mass of 11 M , and an explosion energy of 3.5×10 51 erg. The light curve morphology can be reproduced either by a double-peaked 56 Ni distribution with an external component of 0.041 M , and an internal component of 0.3 M or a double-peaked 56 Ni distribution plus magnetar model ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ∼11 ms and {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°µ ∼26×10 14 G). If SN 2019cad were to suffer from significant host reddening (which cannot be ruled out), the 56 Ni model would require extreme values, while the magnetar model would still be feasible.},

abstract = {In the late 1990's, observations of two directionally-skewed samples of, in total, 93 Type Ia supernovae were analysed in the framework of the Friedmann-LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmol-ogy. Assuming these to be 'standard(isable) candles' it was inferred that the Hubble expansion rate is accelerating as if driven by a positive Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ in Einstein's theory of gravity. This is still the only direct evidence for the 'dark energy' that is the dominant component of today's standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. Other data such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the large-scale distribution of galaxies, temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), measurement of stellar ages, the rate of growth of structure, etc are all 'concordant' with this model but do not provide independent evidence for accelerated expansion. The recent discussions about whether the inferred acceleration is real rests on analysis of a larger sample of 740 SNe Ia which shows that these are not quite standard candles, and more importantly highlights the 'corrections' that are applied to analyse the data in the FLRW framework. The latter holds in the reference frame in which the CMB is isotropic, whereas observations are carried out in our heliocentric frame in which the CMB has a large dipole anisotropy. This is assumed to be of kinematic origin i.e. due to our non-Hubble motion driven by local inhomogeneity in the matter distribution which has grown under gravity from primordial density perturbations traced by the CMB fluctuations. The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts how this peculiar velocity should fall off as the averaging scale is raised and the universe becomes sensibly homogeneous. However observations of the local 'bulk flow' are inconsistent with this expectation and convergence to the CMB frame is not seen. Moreover the kinematic interpretation implies a corresponding dipole in the sky distribution of high redshift quasars, which is rejected by observations at 4.9$\sigma$. Hence the peculiar velocity corrections employed in supernova cosmology are inconsistent and discontinuous within the data. The acceleration of the Hubble expansion rate is in fact anisotropic at 3.9$\sigma$ and aligned with the bulk flow. Thus dark energy could be an artefact of analysing data assuming that we are idealised observers in an FLRW universe, when in fact the real universe is inhomogeneous and anisotropic out to distances large enough to impact on cosmological analyses.},

Yet FRB sources are rare, and most of these objects, found in the Galaxy, do not make FRB. Special and rare circumstances may be required for these common objects to be sources of FRB. The recent discovery of a repeating FRB in a globular cluster belonging to the galaxy M81 suggests a model involving a neutron star and a close binary companion, likely a white dwarf; both neutron stars and close binaries are superabundant in globular clusters. Magnetic interaction is a plausible, though unproven, mechanism of acceleration of relativistic particles that may radiate coherently as FRB. Double neutron star binaries cannot be the observed long-lived repeating FRB sources, but might make much shorter lived sources, and perhaps apparently non-repeating FRB.},

abstract = {We present optical and ultraviolet photometry, as well as optical spectra, for the type II supernova (SN) 2015bf. Our observations cover the phases from ∼ 2 to ∼ 200 d after explosion. The first spectrum is characterised by a blue continuum with a blackbody temperature of ∼ 24, 000 K and flash-ionised emission lines. After about one week, the spectra of SN 2015bf evolve like those of a regular SN II. From the luminosity of the narrow emission component of H$\alpha$, we deduce that the mass-loss rate is larger than ∼ 3.7 × 10 −3 M yr −1. The disappearance of the flash features in the first week after explosion indicates that the circumstellar material is confined within ∼ 6 × 10 14 cm. Thus, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2015bf experienced violent mass loss shortly before the supernova explosion. The multiband light curves show that SN 2015bf has a high peak luminosity with an absolute visual magnitude M V = −18.11 ± 0.08 mag and a fast post-peak decline with a V-band decay of 1.22 ± 0.09 mag within ∼ 50 d after maximum light. Moreover, the R-band tail luminosity of SN 2015bf is fainter than that of SNe II with similar peak by 1-2 mag, suggesting a small amount of 56 Ni (∼ 0.009 M) synthesised during the explosion. Such a low nickel mass indicates that the progenitor of SN 2015bf could be a super-asymptotic-giant-branch star that collapsed owing to electron capture.},

abstract = {We present a novel method of classifying Type Ia supernovae using convolutional neural networks, a neural network framework typically used for image recognition. Our model is trained on photometric information only, eliminating the need for accurate redshift data. Photometric data is pre-processed via 2D Gaussian process regression into two-dimensional images created from flux values at each location in wavelength-time space. These "flux heatmaps" of each supernova detection, along with "uncertainty heatmaps" of the Gaussian process uncertainty, constitute the dataset for our model. This preprocessing step not only smooths over irregular sampling rates between filters but also allows SCONE to be independent of the filter set on which it was trained. Our model has achieved impressive performance without redshift on the in-distribution SNIa classification problem: 99.73 ± 0.26% test accuracy with no over/underfitting on a subset of supernovae from PLAsTiCC's unblinded test dataset. We have also achieved 98.18±0.3% test accuracy performing 6-way classification of supernovae by type. The out-of-distribution performance does not fully match the in-distribution results, suggesting that the detailed characteristics of the training sample in comparison to the test sample have a big impact on the performance. We discuss the implication and directions for future work.

Such experiments are becoming more streamlined, especially with the advent of time domain surveys, and understanding their systematic and statistical uncertainties in a model-aware and physics-driven way can help improve their accuracy and precision. Here we demonstrate the software's capabilities by exploring the effect of measuring time delays from lensed quasars and supernovae in many wavelengths and under different microlensing and intrinsic variability assumptions. In this initial application, we find that the cadence of the observations and combining information from different wavelengths plays an important role in the correct recovery of the time delays.

We also predict significant He I line emission at optical and near-infrared wavelengths for both hydrogen-rich or helium-rich material, providing an additional observational probe of stripped ejecta.

abstract = {A key tracer of the elusive progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying Na I D absorption lines, interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding the progenitor system. The origin of this material is controversial, but the simplest explanation is that it results from previous mass loss in a system containing a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. We present new single-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift SNe Ia taken with XShooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Combining this sample with events from the literature, we confirm an excess ($\sim$20 per cent) of SNe Ia displaying blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features compared to non-blueshifted Na I D features. The host galaxies of SNe Ia displaying blueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies, compared to SNe Ia that show no Na I D absorption, and SNe Ia displaying blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features have broader light curves. The strength of the Na I D absorption is stronger in SNe Ia displaying blueshifted Na I D absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and the strength of the blueshifted Na I D is correlated with the B-V colour of the SN at maximum light. This strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to the SN. In the context of the progenitor systems of SNe Ia, we discuss the significance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on the nature of SN Ia progenitors. We present a summary that suggests there are at least two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful SNe Ia.},

abstract = {We use non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transport modeling to examine observational signatures of sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation explosions in the nebular phase. Results range from spectra that look like typical and sub-luminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe) for higher mass progenitors to spectra that look like Ca-rich transients for lower mass progenitors. This ignition mechanism produces an inherent relationship between emission features and the progenitor mass as the ratio of the nebular [CaII]/[FeIII] emission lines increases with decreasing white dwarf (WD) mass. Examining the [CaII]/[FeIII] nebular line ratio in a sample of observed SNe we find further evidence for the two distinct classes of SNe Ia identified in Polin et al. (2019) by their relationship between SiII velocity and B-band magnitude, both at time of peak brightness. This suggests that SNe Ia arise from more than one progenitor channel, and provides an empirical method for classifying events on based on their physical origin. Furthermore, we provide insight to the mysterious origin of Ca-rich transients as we show that only a small mass fraction of Ca (1%) is required to produce a nebular spectrum that cools primarily through forbidden [CaII] emission.},

abstract = {The explosive death of a star as a supernova is one of the most dramatic events in the Universe. Supernovae have an outsized impact on many areas of astrophysics: they are major contributors to the chemical enrichment of the cosmos and significantly influence the formation of subsequent generations of stars and the evolution of galaxies. Here we review the observational properties of thermonuclear supernovae—exploding white dwarf stars resulting from the stellar evolution of low-mass stars in close binary systems. The best known objects in this class are type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), astrophysically important in their application as standardizable candles to measure cosmological distances and the primary source of iron group elements in the Universe. Surprisingly, given their prominent role, SN Ia progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are not fully understood; the observations we describe here provide constraints on models, not always in consistent ways. Recent advances in supernova discovery and follow-up have shown that the class of thermonuclear supernovae includes more than just SNe Ia, and we characterize that diversity in this review.},

SN 2011fe is the closest ($\mu$ = 29.04) and brightest (Bmax = 9.94 mag) SN Ia observed since the advent of modern large scale programs for the intensive periodic followup of supernovae. Both synthetic light curve measurements and spectral feature analysis attest to the normality of SN 2011fe. There is very little evidence for reddening in its host galaxy. The homogeneous calibration, intensive time sampling, and high signal-to-noise ratio of the data set make it unique. Thus it is ideal for studying the physics of SN Ia explosions in detail, and for furthering the use of SNe Ia as standardizable candles for cosmology. Several such applications are shown, from the creation of a bolometric light curve and measurement of the 56Ni mass, to the simulation ofdetection thresholds for unburned carbon, direct comparisons with other SNe Ia, and existing spectral templates. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {We present the snapshot distance method (SDM), a modern incarnation of a proposed technique for estimating the distance to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) from minimal observations. Our method, which has become possible owing to recent work in the application of deep learning to SN Ia spectra (we use the deepSIP package), allows us to estimate the distance to an SN Ia from a single optical spectrum and epoch of 2+ passband photometry-one night's worth of observations (though contemporaneity is not a requirement). Using a compilation of well-observed SNe Ia, we generate snapshot distances across a wide range of spectral and photometric phases, light-curve shapes, photometric passband combinations, and spectrum signal-to-noise ratios. By comparing these estimates to the corresponding distances derived from fitting all available photometry for each object, we demonstrate that our method is robust to the relative temporal sampling of the provided spectroscopic and photometric information, and to a broad range of light-curve shapes that lie within the domain of standard width-luminosity relations. Indeed, the median residual (and asymmetric scatter) between SDM distances derived from two-passband photometry and conventional light-curve-derived distances that utilise all available photometry is 0.013 +0.154 −0.143 mag. Moreover, we find that the time of maximum brightness and light-curve shape (both of which are spectroscopically derived in our method) are only minimally responsible for the observed scatter. In a companion paper, we apply the SDM to a large number of sparsely observed SNe Ia as part of a cosmological study.},

abstract = {We present nebular spectra of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2019yvq, which had a bright flash of blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, followed by a rise similar to other SNe Ia. Although SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare characteristics such as persistent high ejecta velocity near peak brightness, it was not especially peculiar and if the early “excess” emission were not observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux can be explained by several different physical models linked to the details of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. Each has unique predictions for the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular spectra, we detect strong [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291, 7324 and Ca NIR triplet emission, consistent with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I] emission, predictions for some single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up H or He is <2.8 × 10−4 and 2.4 × 10−4 M, respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq nebular spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape. Comparing to double-detonation models, we find that the Ca emission is consistent with a model with a total progenitor mass of 1.15 M . However, we note that a lower progenitor mass better explains the early light-curve and peak luminosity. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick He-shell double-detonations only account for 1.1+2−1..11% of the total “normal” SN Ia rate. SN 2019yvq is one of the best examples yet that multiple progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce the full diversity of “normal” SNe Ia.},

abstract = {We present optical/near-infrared photometry and spectra of the type Ia SN 2002bo spanning epochs from - 13 d before maximum B-band light to + 102 d after. The pre-maximum optical coverage is particularly complete. The extinction deduced from the observed colour evolution and from interstellar Na I D absorption is quite high, namely E(B - V) = 0.43 ± 0.10. On the other hand, model matches to the observed spectra point to a lower reddening [E(B - V) ∼ 0.30]. In some respects, SN 2002bo behaves as a typical 'Branch normal' type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at optical and infrared wavelengths. We find a B-band risetime of 17.9 ± 0.5 d, a $\delta$m 15(B) of 1.13 ± 0.05, and a dereddened M B = -19.41 ± 0.42. However, comparison with other type Ia supernovae having similar $\delta$m 15(B) values indicates that in other respects SN 2002bo is unusual. While the optical spectra of SN 2002bo are very similar to those of SN 1984A [$\delta$m 15(B) = 1.19], lower velocities and a generally more structured appearance are found in SNe 1990N, 1994D and 1998bu. For supernovae having $\delta$m 15(B) > 1.2, we confirm the variation of Rℛ(Si II) with $\delta$m 15(B). However, for supernovae such as SN 2002bo, with lower values of $\delta$m 15(B) the relation breaks down. Moreover, the evolution of Rℛ(Si II) for SN 2002bo is strikingly different from that shown by other type Ia supernovae. The velocities of SN 2002bo and 1984A derived from S II 5640 {\AA}, Si II 6355 {\AA} and Ca II H and K lines are either much higher and/or evolve differently from those seen in other normal SNe Ia events. Thus, while SN 2002bo and SN 1984A appear to be highly similar, they exhibit behaviour which is distinctly different from other SNe Ia having similar $\delta$m 15(B) values. We suggest that the unusually low temperature, the presence of high-velocity intermediate-mass elements and the low abundance of carbon at early times indicates that burning to Si penetrated to much higher layers than in more normal type Ia supernovae. This may be indicative of a delayed detonation explosion.},

abstract = {We present 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of a Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation model which synthesizes 0.51 M⊙ of 56Ni, and confront our results to the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2002bo over the first 100 d of its evolution. Assuming only homologous expansion, this same model reproduces the bolometric and multiband light curves, the secondary near-infrared (NIR) maxima, and the optical and NIR spectra. The chemical stratification of our model qualitatively agrees with previous inferences by Stehle et al., but reveals significant quantitative differences for both iron-group and intermediate-mass elements. We show that ±0.1 M⊙ (i.e. ±20 per cent) variations in 56Ni mass have a modest impact on the bolometric and colour evolution of our model. One notable exception is the U band, where a larger abundance of iron-group elements results in less opaque ejecta through ionization effects, our model with more 56Ni displaying a higher near-ultraviolet flux level. In the NIR range, such variations in 56Ni mass affect the timing of the secondary maxima but not their magnitude, in agreement with observational results. Moreover, the variation in the I, J, and Ks magnitudes is less than 0.1 mag within $\sim$10 d from bolometric maximum, confirming the potential of NIR photometry of SNe Ia for cosmology. Overall, the delayed-detonation mechanism in single Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitors seems well suited for SN 2002bo and similar SNe Ia displaying a broad Si II 6355{\AA} line. Whatever multidimensional processes are at play during the explosion leading to these events, they must conspire to produce an ejecta comparable to our spherically symmetric model.},

abstract = {The abundance stratification in the ejecta of the normal Type Ia supernova 2002bo is derived by fitting a series of spectra obtained at close time intervals. A Monte Carlo code, modified to include abundance stratification, is used to compute synthetic spectra at 13 epochs in the photospheric phase, starting 13d before B maximum. A description of the abundance distribution above 7600 km/s is thus obtained. Abundances in deeper layers, down to zero velocity, are derived from models of two nebular-phase spectra. Elements synthesized in different stages of burning are significantly, but not completely, mixed in the ejecta. A total 56Ni mass of 0.52M_sun is derived. Evidence for intermediate-mass elements at high velocities (> 18 000 km/s) is found, most clearly in Si II 6355A, in Ca II H&K, and in the Ca II infrared triplet. Carbon lines are not seen at any velocity, with possible implications for the progenitor/explosion scenario. A synthetic bolometric light curve computed using the inferred abundance distribution is in very good agreement with the observed one, providing an independent check. In particular, the fast rise of the light curve is reproduced very well. This is due to outward mixing of 56Ni, which is clearly well determined by the spectroscopic modelling.},

abstract = {We present convincing evidence of unburned carbon at photospheric velocities in new observations of five Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory. These SNe are identified by examining 346 spectra from 124 SNe obtained before +2.5 days relative to maximum. Detections are based on the presence of relatively strong C ii $\lambda$6580 absorption "notches" in multiple spectra of each SN, aided by automated fitting with the SYNAPPS code. Four of the five SNe in question are otherwise spectroscopically unremarkable, with ions and ejection velocities typical of SNe Ia, but spectra of the fifth exhibit high-velocity (v > 20,000 km s −1) Si ii and Ca ii features. On the other hand, the light curve properties are preferentially grouped, strongly suggesting a connection between carbon-positivity and broadband light curve/color behavior: three of the five have relatively narrow light curves but also blue colors and a fourth may be a dust-reddened member of this family. Accounting for signal to noise and phase, we estimate that 22 +10 −6 % of SNe Ia exhibit spectroscopic C ii signatures as late as −5 days with respect to maximum. We place these new objects in the context of previously recognized carbon-positive SNe Ia and consider reasonable scenarios seeking to explain a physical connection between light curve properties and the presence of photospheric carbon. We also examine the detailed evolution of the detected carbon signatures and the surrounding wavelength regions to shed light on the distribution of carbon in the ejecta. Our ability to reconstruct the C ii $\lambda$6580 feature in detail under the assumption of purely spherical symmetry casts doubt on a "carbon blobs" hypothesis, but does not rule out all asymmetric models. A low volume filling factor for carbon, combined with line-of-sight effects, seems unlikely to explain the scarcity of detected carbon in SNe Ia by itself.},

Two minor groups are recognized, "MUV-blue" and "irregular" SNe Ia. While we conclude that the latter group is a subset of the NUV-red group, containing the SNe with the broadest optical peaks, we conclude that the "MUV-blue" group is a distinct group. Separating into the groups and accounting for the time evolution of the UV-optical colors lowers the scatter in two NUV-optical colors (e.g., u − v and uvw1 − v) to the level of the scatter in b − v. This finding is promising for extending the cosmological utilization of SNe Ia into the NUV. We generate spectrophotometry of 33 SNe Ia and determine the correct grouping for each. We argue that there is a fundamental spectral difference in the 2900-3500 {\AA} wavelength range, a region suggested to be dominated by absorption from iron-peak elements. The NUV-blue SNe Ia feature less absorption than the NUV-red SNe Ia. We show that all NUV-blue SNe Ia in this sample also show evidence of unburned carbon in optical spectra, whereas only one NUV-red SN Ia features that absorption line. Every NUV-blue event also exhibits a low gradient of the Si ii $\lambda$6355 absorption feature. Many NUV-red events also exhibit a low gradient, perhaps suggestive that NUV-blue events are a subset of the larger low-velocity gradient group.},

abstract = {We present empirical fits to the UBVRI light curves of type Ia supernovae. These fits are used to objectively evaluate light curve parameters. We find that the relative times of maximum light in the filter passbands are very similar for most objects. Surprisingly the maximum at longer wavelengths is reached earlier than in the B and V light curves. This clearly demonstrates the complicated nature of the supernova emission. Bolometric light curves for a small sample of well-observed SNe Ia are constructed by integration over the optical filters. In most objects a plateau or inflection is observed in the light curve about 20−40 days after bolometric maximum. The strength of this plateau varies considerably among the individual objects in the sample. Furthermore the rise times show a range of several days for the few objects which have observations early enough for such an analysis. On the other hand, the decline rate between 50 and 80 days past maximum is remarkably similar for all objects, with the notable exception of SN 1991bg. The similar late decline rates for the supernovae indicate that the energy release at late times are very uniform; the differences at early times are likely due to the radiation diffusing out of the ejecta. With the exception of SN 1991bg, the range of absolute bolometric luminosities of SNe Ia is found to be at least a factor of 2.5. The nickel masses derived from this estimate range from 0.4 to 1.1 M. It seems impossible to explain such a mass range by a single explosion mechanism, especially since the rate of $\gamma$−ray escape at late phases seems to be very uniform.},

We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SNe Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz ! 2500 km s {\`{A}}1), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SNe Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find that the Hubble flow SNe with H 0 d SN ! 7400 km s {\`{A}}1 yield an expansion rate that is 6:5% AE 1:8% lower than the rate determined from SNe within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SNe Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the cosmic microwave background. Direct fits of SNe Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest that their mean extinction law may be described by R V ' 2:7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on R V .},

We focus on the Branch spectroscopic classification of 34 SNe Ia and morphological types of host galaxies. We carefully study their distribution of peak colors on the B − V , V − R color-color diagram, as well as the color excess and absolute magnitude deviation from the stretch-color relation of the bluest SNe Ia. We find that SNe Ia which show the reddest color occur in early-type spirals and the trend holds when divided into Branch sub-types. The dust extinction becomes close to the Milky-Way like extinction if we exclude some peculiar red Broad Line 1 (BL) sub-type SNe Ia. Furthermore, two of these red BLs occur in elliptical galaxies, less-dusty environment, suggesting intrinsic color diversity in BL sub-type SNe Ia.},

abstract = {We present SNIascore, a deep-learning based method for spectroscopic classification of thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia) based on very low-resolution (R∼ 100) data. The goal of SNIascore is fully automated classification of SNe Ia with a very low false-positive rate (FPR) so that human intervention can be greatly reduced in large-scale SN classification efforts, such as that undertaken by the public Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS). We utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with a combination of bidirectional long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit layers. SNIascore achieves a < 0.6% FPR while classifying up to 90% of the low-resolution SN Ia spectra obtained by the BTS. SNIascore simultaneously performs binary classification and predicts the redshifts of secure SNe Ia via regression (with a typical uncertainty of < 0.005 in the range from z = 0.01 to z = 0.12). For the magnitude-limited ZTF BTS survey (≈ 70% SNe Ia), deploying SNIascore reduces the amount of spectra in need of human classification or confirmation by ≈ 60%. Furthermore, SNIascore allows SN Ia classifications to be automatically announced in real-time to the public immediately following a finished observation during the night.},

These data are supplemented by multi-color Panoramic Survey Telescope (Pan-STARRS1) and Rapid Response System 1 and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m Dark Energy Camera (CTIO 4-m DECam) observations obtained within hours of explosion. The K2 light curve has an unusual two-component shape, where the flux rises with a steep linear gradient for the first few days, followed by a quadratic rise as seen for typical supernovae (SNe)Ia. This "flux excess" relative to canonical SNIa behavior is confirmed in our i-band light curve, and furthermore, SN 2018oh is especially blue during the early epochs. The flux excess peaks 2.14±0.04 days after explosion, has a FWHM of 3.12±0.04 days, a blackbody temperature of T 17, 500 9,000 11,500 =-+ K, a peak luminosity of 4.3 0.2 10 erg s 37 1  ´-, and a total integrated energy of 1.27 0.01 10 erg 43  ´. We compare SN 2018oh to several models that may provide additional heating at early times, including collision with a companion and a shallow concentration of radioactive nickel. While all of these models generally reproduce the early K2 light curve shape, we slightly favor a companion interaction, at a distance of ∼2 10 cm 12´based 12´ 12´based on our early color measurements, although the exact distance depends on the uncertain viewing angle. Additional confirmation of a companion interaction in future modeling and observations of SN 2018oh would provide strong support for a single-degenerate progenitor system.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2018oh (ASASSN-18bt) is the first spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observed in the Kepler field. The Kepler data revealed an excess emission in its early light curve, allowing us to place interesting constraints on its progenitor system. Here we present extensive optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared photometry, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra, for this object. SN 2018oh is relatively normal in its photometric evolution, with a rise time of 18.3±0.3 days and $\Delta$m 15 (B)=0.96±0.03 mag, but it seems to have bluer B−V colors. We construct the "UVOIR" bolometric light curve having a peak luminosity of 1.49×10 43 erg s −1 , from which we derive a nickel mass as 0.55±0.04 M e by fitting radiation diffusion models powered by centrally located 56 Ni. Note that the moment when nickel-powered luminosity starts to emerge is +3.85 days after the first light in the Kepler data, suggesting other origins of the early-time emission, e.g., mixing of 56 Ni to outer layers of the ejecta or interaction between the ejecta and nearby circumstellar material or a nondegenerate companion star. The spectral evolution of SN 2018oh is similar to that of a normal SN Ia but is characterized by prominent and persistent carbon absorption features. The CII features can be detected from the early phases to about 3 weeks after the maximum light, representing the latest detection of carbon ever recorded in an SN Ia. This indicates that a considerable amount of unburned carbon exists in the ejecta of SN 2018oh and may mix into deeper layers.},

We study broadband UV+optical light curves and low resolution spectroscopy spanning from −13.8 to +108 d from the maximum light in B-band. The photometric analysis indicates that SN 2017hpa is a normal type Ia with ∆m B (15) = 0.98 ± 0.16 mag and M B = −19.45 ± 0.15 mag at a distance modulus of µ = 34.08 ± 0.09 mag. The (uvw1 − uvv) colour evolution shows that SN 2017hpa falls in the NUV-blue group. The (B − V) colour at maximum is bluer in comparison to normal type Ia supernovae. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the Si ii 6355 absorption feature evolves rapidly with a velocity gradient, ˙ v = 128 ± 7 km s −1 d −1. The pre-maximum phase spectra show prominent C ii 6580 {\AA} absorption feature. The C ii 6580 {\AA} line velocity measured from the observed spectra is lower than the velocity of Si ii 6355 {\AA}, which could be due to a line of sight effect. The synthetic spectral fits to the pre-maximum spectra using syn++ indicate the presence of a high velocity component in the Si ii absorption, in addition to a photospheric component. Fitting the observed spectrum with the spectral synthesis code TARDIS, the mass of unburned C in the ejecta is estimated to be ∼ 0.019 M. The peak bolometric luminosity is L bol peak = 1.43 × 10 43 erg s −1. The radiation diffusion model fit to the bolometric light curve indicates 0.61 ± 0.02 M of 56 Ni is synthesized in the explosion.},

abstract = {We studied the spectral features of Si II $\lambda$$\lambda$4130, 5972, 6355 and the S II W-trough for a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We found that in the NV (normal-velocity) subclass of SNe Ia, these features tend to reach a maximum line strength near maximum light, except for Si II $\lambda$5972. Spectral features with higher excitation energy, such as the S II W-trough, are relatively weak and have a relatively low velocity. SNe Ia with larger m 15 (B) tend to have lower velocities, especially at phases after maximum light. NV SNe show a trend of increasing line strength with increasing m 15 (B), while 91T/99aa-like SNe show an opposite trend. Near maximum light, the absorption depth of Si II $\lambda$5972 shows the strongest correlation with m 15 (B), while at early times the sum of the depths of Si II $\lambda$$\lambda$4130 and 5972 shows the strongest correlation with m 15 (B). The overall correlation between velocity and line strength is positive, but within NV SNe the correlation is negative or unrelated, depending on the phase. In normal SNe Ia (including the high-velocity SNe), the velocity difference and depth ratio of a longer-wavelength feature to a shorter-wavelength feature tend to increase with increasing m 15 (B). These results are mostly well explained with atomic physics, but some puzzles remain, possibly related to the effects of saturation, line competition or other factors.},

abstract = {<p>Normal type Ia supernovae (SNe) are thought to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of massive (&gt;0.8 M⊙) carbon–oxygen white dwarfs (WDs), although the exact mechanism is debated. In some models, helium accretion on to a carbon–oxygen (CO) WD from a companion was suggested to dynamically trigger a detonation of the accreted helium shell. The helium detonation then produces a shock that after converging on itself close to the core of the CO WD, triggers a secondary carbon detonation, and gives rise to an energetic explosion. However, most studies of such scenarios have been done in one or two dimensions, and/or did not consider self-consistent models for the accretion and the He donor. Here, we make use of detailed 3D simulation to study the interaction of a He-rich hybrid $0.69\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ HeCO WD with a more massive $0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ CO WD. We find that accretion from the hybrid WD on to the CO WD gives rise to a helium detonation. However, the helium detonation does not trigger a carbon detonation in the CO WD. Instead, the helium detonation burns through the accretion stream to also burn the helium shell of the donor hybrid HeCO WD. The detonation of its massive helium shell then compresses its CO core, and triggers its detonation and full destruction. The explosion gives rise to a faint, likely highly reddened transient, potentially observable by the Vera Rubin survey, and the high-velocity ($\sim \! 1000\, \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$) ejection of the heated surviving CO WD companion. Pending on uncertainties in stellar evolution, we estimate the rate of such transient to be up to $\sim \! 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the rate of type Ia SNe.</p>},

abstract = {<p>A string of recent studies has debated the exact form and physical origin of an evolutionary trend between the peak luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the properties of the galaxies that host them. We shed new light on the discussion by presenting an analysis of ∼200 low-redshift SNe Ia in which we measure the separation of Hubble residuals (HR; as probes of luminosity) between two host-galaxy morphological types. We show that this separation can test the predictions made by recently proposed models, using an independently and empirically determined distribution of each morphological type in host-property space. Our results are partially consistent with the new HR–age slope, but we find significant scatter in the predictions from different galaxy catalogues. The inconsistency in age illuminates an issue in the current debate that was not obvious in the long-discussed mass models: HR–host-property models are strongly dependent on the methods employed to determine galaxy properties. While our results demonstrate the difficulty in constructing a universal model for age as a proxy for host environment, our results indeed identify evolutionary trends between mass, age, morphology, and HR values, encouraging (or requiring, if such trends are to be accounted for in cosmological studies) further investigation.</p>},

abstract = {We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of supernova (SN) 2019cad during the first ∼ 100 days from explosion. Based on the light curve morphology, we find that SN 2019cad resembles the double-peaked type Ib/c SN 2005bf and the type Ic PTF11mnb. Unlike those two objects, SN 2019cad also shows the initial peak in the redder bands. Inspection of the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±−band light curve indicates the initial peak is reached in ∼8 days, while the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± band peak occurred ∼15 days post-explosion. A second and more prominent peak is reached in all bands at ∼45 days past explosion, followed by a fast decline from ∼60 days. During the first 30 days, the spectra of SN 2019cad show the typical features of a type Ic SN, however, after 40 days, a blue continuum with prominent lines of Si {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6355 and C {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6580 is observed again. Comparing the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2019cad is consistent with a pre-SN mass of 11 M , and an explosion energy of 3.5×10 51 erg. The light curve morphology can be reproduced either by a double-peaked 56 Ni distribution with an external component of 0.041 M , and an internal component of 0.3 M or a double-peaked 56 Ni distribution plus magnetar model ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ∼11 ms and {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°µ ∼26×10 14 G). If SN 2019cad were to suffer from significant host reddening (which cannot be ruled out), the 56 Ni model would require extreme values, while the magnetar model would still be feasible.},

Although the common envelope (CE) in a binary, outcomes of the CE and conditions for the SN explosion during the CE phase are uncertain, it has been suggested that SN explosions can be triggered during the CE phase. In this work, we explore formation and evolution routes of carbon/oxygen (CO) WDs binaries in order to investigate mergers of CO WDs and cores of non-degenerate stars during the CE phase as possible origins for SNe under the core merger detonation (CMD) scenario by considering several binary physical models. Evolution of CO WD + intermediate mass normal star binaries lead to mergers during the CE phases still may trigger type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) interacting with circumstellar material under different models. Mergers between CO WDs and cores of He stars within the CE phases are rare comparing to other CE merger events. Above two channels may produce peculiar SNe Ia such as over-luminous/super-chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia as certain fraction of them have combined core masses ≥ 2M. In the channel of CO WD + massive star (≥ 8M) CE events, we find that rates of mergers between CO WDs and He cores of massive stars are (0.85-12.18)×10 −5 M −1 which may initiate type II superluminous SNe like SN 2006gy, and delay times from this scenario are in the range of 34-120 Myr. Our results based on the CMD model are comparable with observational results of peculiar SNe.},

abstract = {The increase in the number of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has demonstrated that the population shows greater diversity than has been assumed in the past. The reasons (e.g. parent population, explosion mechanism) for this diversity remain largely unknown. We investigated a sample of SNe Ia near-infrared light curves and correlated the phase of the second maximum with the bolometric peak luminosity. The peak bolometric luminosity is related to the time of the second maximum (relative to the B light curve maximum) as follows: L max (10 43 erg s −1) = (0.039 ± 0.004) × t 2 (J)(days) + (0.013 ± 0.106). 56 Ni masses can be derived from the peak luminosity based on Arnett's rule, which states that the luminosity at maximum is equal to the instantaneous energy generated by the nickel decay. We checked this assumption against recent radiative-transfer calculations of Chandrasekhar-mass delayed detonation models and find this assumption is valid to within 10% in recent radiative-transfer calculations of Chandrasekhar-mass delayed detonation models. The L max vs. t 2 relation is applied to a sample of 40 additional SNe Ia with significant reddening (E(B − V) > 0.1 mag), and a reddening-free bolometric luminosity function of SNe Ia is established. The method is tested with the 56 Ni mass measurement from the direct observation of $\gamma$-rays in the heavily absorbed SN 2014J and found to be fully consistent. Super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, in particular SN 2007if, do not follow the relations between peak luminosity and second IR maximum. This may point to an additional energy source contributing at maximum light. The luminosity function of SNe Ia is constructed and is shown to be asymmetric with a tail of low-luminosity objects and a rather sharp high-luminosity cutoff, although it might be influenced by selection effects.},

Recently, Yamanaka et al. reported a near-infrared (NIR) excess for SN 2012dn and proposed that the excess originates from an echo by circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper, we examine a detailed distribution of the CS dust around SN 2012dn and investigate implications of the CS dust echo scenario for general cases of SC-SNe Ia. We find that a disk/bipolar CS medium configuration reproduces the NIR excess fairly well, where the radial density distribution is given by a stationary mass loss. The inner radius of the CS dust is 0.04 pc. The mass-loss rate of the progenitor system is estimated to b{\'{e}}b{\'{e}}-1.2 10 5 and´-and´and´-3.2 10 6 M e yr −1 for the disk and bipolar CS medium configurations, respectively, which adds further support for the single-degenerate scenario. Our models limit SN 2009dc, another SC-SN Ia, to have a dust mass less than 0.16 times that of SN 2012dn. While this may merely indicate some variation on the CS environment among SC-SNe Ia, this could raise another interesting possibility. There could be two classes among SC-SNe Ia: the brighter SC-SNe Ia in a clean environment (SN 2009dc) and the fainter SC-SNe Ia in a dusty environment (SN 2012dn).},

We find that SNe Ia which show the reddest color occur in early-type spirals and the trend holds when divided into Branch sub-types. The dust extinction becomes close to the Milky Way like extinction if we exclude some peculiar red Broad Line (BL) sub-type SNe Ia.

abstract = {The detonation of a helium shell on top of a carbon–oxygen white dwarf has been argued as a potential explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The ash produced during helium shell burning can lead to light curves and spectra that are inconsistent with normal SNe Ia, but may be viable for some objects showing a light-curve bump within the days following explosion. We present a series of radiative transfer models designed to mimic predictions from double-detonation explosion models. We consider a range of core and shell masses, and systematically explore multiple post-explosion compositions for the helium shell. We find that a variety of luminosities and time-scales for early light-curve bumps result from those models with shells containing 56Ni, 52Fe, or 48Cr. Comparing our models to SNe Ia with light-curve bumps, we find that these models can reproduce the shapes of almost all of the bumps observed, but only those objects with red colours around maximum light (B − V ≳ 1) are well matched throughout their evolution. Consistent with previous works, we also show that those models in which the shell does not contain iron-group elements provide good agreement with normal SNe Ia of different luminosities from shortly after explosion up to maximum light. While our models do not amount to positive evidence in favour of the double-detonation scenario, we show that provided the helium shell ash does not contain iron-group elements, it may be viable for a wide range of normal SNe Ia.},

abstract = {The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new robotic time-domain survey currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern visible sky at rates of $\sim$3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g $\sim$ 20.8 and r $\sim$ 20.6 mag (AB, 5sigma in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines, alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and analyzing the products. The realtime pipeline employs a novel image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point source transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures are also extracted and vetted. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per science image with respect to Gaia is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is the RMS per axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N >= 10. The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes varies between 8 and 25 millimag. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2%. The products support a broad range of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae, rare flux transients, variable stars, eclipsing binaries, variability from active galactic nuclei, counterparts to gravitational wave sources, a more complete census of Type Ia supernovae, and Solar System objects.},

abstract = {Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Supernova Survey-II (SDSS-II SN Survey), we measure the rate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a function of galaxy properties at intermediate redshift. A sample of 342 SNe Ia with 0.05 < z < 0.25 is constructed. Using broadband photometry and redshifts, we use the P{\'{E}}GASE.2 spectral energy distributions to estimate host galaxy stellar masses and recent star formation rates (SFRs). We find that the rate of SNe Ia per unit stellar mass is significantly higher (by a factor of 30) in highly star-forming galaxies compared to passive galaxies. When parameterizing the SN Ia rate (SNRIa) based on host galaxy properties, we find that the rate of SNe Ia in passive galaxies is not linearly proportional to the stellar mass; instead an SNRIaM 0.68 is favored. However, such a parameterization does not describe the observed SNRIa in star-forming galaxies. The SNRIa in star-forming galaxies is well fitted by SNRIa = (0.41 ± 0.15) × 10-10 M 0.72 ± 0.15 + (0.65 ± 0.25) × 10 -3SFR1.01 ± 0.22 (statistical errors only), where M is the host galaxy stellar mass (in M ⊙) and SFR is the SFR (in M ⊙ yr-1). We show that our results, for SNe Ia in passive galaxies, are consistent with those at higher redshifts (favoring SNRIaM) when accounting for the difference in the ages of our galaxies. This suggests that the rate of SNe Ia is correlated with the age of the stellar population. The MLCS extinction parameter, AV , is similar in passive and moderately star-forming galaxies, but we find indications that it is smaller, on average, in highly star-forming galaxies. This result appears to be driven by a deficit of the reddest (AV > 0.15) SNe Ia in highly star-forming galaxies. We consider that the high levels of dust in these systems may be obscuring the reddest and faintest SNe Ia. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of galaxies hosting Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory. Combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) UV data with optical and near-infrared photometry, we employ stellar population synthesis techniques to measure SN Ia host galaxy stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and reddening due to dust. We reinforce the key role of GALEX UV data in deriving accurate estimates of galaxy SFRs and dust extinction. Optical spectra of SN Ia host galaxies are fitted simultaneously for their stellar continua and emission lines fluxes, from which we derive high-precision redshifts, gas-phase metallicities, and H$\alpha$-based SFRs. With these data we show that SN Ia host galaxies present tight agreement with the fiducial galaxy mass-metallicity relation from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for stellar masses log(M * /M) > 8.5 where the relation is well defined. The star formation activity of SN Ia host galaxies is consistent with a sample of comparable SDSS field galaxies, though this comparison is limited by systematic uncertainties in SFR measurements. Our analysis indicates that SN Ia host galaxies are, on average, typical representatives of normal field galaxies.},

abstract = {We report the early discovery and multi-color (BV I) high-cadence light curve analyses of a rapidly-declining sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova KSP-OT-201509b (= AT2015cx) from the KMTNet Supernova Program. The Phillips parameter and color stretch parameter of KSP-OT-201509b are ∆M B,15 ≃ 1.62 mag and s BV ≃ 0.54, respectively, at an inferred redshift of 0.072. These, together with other measured parameters (such as the strength of the secondary I-band peak, colors and luminosity), identify the source to be a rapidly-declining Type Ia of transitional nature that is closer to Branch Normal than 91bg-like. Its early light curve evolution and bolometric luminosity are consistent with those of homologously expanding ejecta powered by radioactive decay and a Type Ia SN explosion with 0.32 ± 0.01 M ⊙ of synthesized 56 Ni mass, 0.84 ± 0.12 M ⊙ of ejecta mass and (0.61 ± 0.14) × 10 51 erg of ejecta kinetic energy. While its B − V and V − I colors evolve largely synchronously with the changes in the I-band light curve as found in other supernovae, we also find the presence of an early redward evolution in V −I prior to-10 days since peak. The bolometric light curve of the source is compatible with a stratified 56 Ni distribution extended to shallow layers of the exploding progenitor. Comparisons between the observed light curves and those predicted from ejecta-companion interactions clearly disfavor Roche Lobe-filling companion stars at large separation distances, thus supporting a double-degenerate scenario for its origin. The lack of any apparent host galaxy in our deep stack images reaching a sensitivity limit of ∼ 28 mag arcsec −2 makes KSP-OT-201509b a hostless Type Ia supernova and offers new insights into supernova host galaxy environments.},

Performing SALT2 light curve fits to the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ZTF photometry, we show that for these equally distant 'standardizable candles", there is a difference of 2 magnitudes in their rest frame {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°µ-band peaks, and the fainter SN has a significantly red SALT2 colour {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± = 0.57 ± 0.04, while the stretch values {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±¥ 1 of the two SNe are similar, suggesting that the fainter SN is attenuated by dust in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.

Assuming the colour excess is entirely due to dust, the result differs by 2{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ from the average Milky-Way total-to-selective extinction ratio, but is in good agreement with the colour-brightness corrections empirically derived from the most recent SN Ia Hubble-Lemaitre diagram fits. Thus we suggest that SN "siblings", which will increasingly be discovered in the coming years, can be used to probe the validity of the colour and lightcurve shape corrections using in SN Ia cosmology while avoiding important systematic effects in their inference from global multi-parameter fits to inhomogeneous data-sets, and also help constrain the role of interstellar dust in SN Ia cosmology.},

Inclusion of either interaction with surrounding circumstellar material or a rapidly-rotating neutron star (magnetar) significantly increases the quality of the model fit. We also investigate the possibility for an object similar to DES14X2fna to act as a contaminant in photometric samples of SNe Ia for cosmology, finding that a similar simulated object is misclassified by a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based photometric classifier as a SN Ia in ∼1.1-2.4 per cent of cases in DES, depending on the probability threshold used for a positive classification.},

abstract = {Modern wide-field high-cadence surveys have revealed the significant diversity of optical transient phenomena in their luminosity and timescale distributions, which led to the discovery of some mysterious fast optical transients (FOTs). These FOTs can usually rise and decline remarkably in a timescale of a few days to weeks, which are obviously much rapider than ordinary supernovae. SN 2019bkc/ATLAS19dqr is one of the fastest detected FOTs so far and, meanwhile, it was found to be un-associated with a host galaxy. These discoveries provide a good chance to explore the possible origins of FOTs. So, we model the light curves of SN 2019bkc in details. It is found that SN 2019bkc can be well explained by the thermal emission of an explosion ejecta that is powered by a long-lasting central engine. The engine could be a spinning-down millisecond magnetar or a fallback accretion onto a compact object. Combining the engine property, the mass of the ejecta, and the hostlessness of SN 2019bkc, we suggest that this FOT is likely to originate from a merger of a white dwarf and a neutron star.},

abstract = {Double detonations in sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with helium shell are a potential explosion mechanism for a Type Ia supernova. It comprises a shell detonation and subsequent core detonation. The focus of our study is on the effect of the progenitor metallicity on the nucleosynthetic yields. For this, we compute and analyse a set of eleven different models with varying core and shell masses at four different metallicities each. This results in a total of 44 models at metallicities between 0.01 Z and 3 Z. Our models show a strong impact of the metallicity in the high density regime. The presence of 22 Ne causes a neutron-excess which shifts the production from 56 Ni to stable isotopes such as 54 Fe and 58 Ni in the $\alpha$-rich freeze-out regime. The isotopes of the metallicity implementation further serve as seed nuclei for additional reactions in the shell detonation. Most significantly, the production of 55 Mn increases with metallicity confirming the results of previous work. A comparison of elemental ratios relative to iron shows a relatively good match to solar values for some models. Super-solar values are reached for Mn at 3 Z and solar values in some models at Z. This indicates that the required contribution of Type Ia supernovae originating from Chandrasekhar mass WDs can be lower than estimated in previous work to reach solar values of [Mn/Fe] at [Fe/H]= 0. Our galactic chemical evolution models suggest that Type Ia supernovae from sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, along with core-collapse supernovae, could account for more than 80% of the solar Mn abundance. Using metallicity-dependent Type Ia supernova yields helps to reproduce the upward trend of [Mn/Fe] as a function of metallicity for the solar neighborhood. These chemical evolution predictions, however, depend on the massive star yields adopted in the calculations.},

This indicates that the speed of the spectral evolution of HV SNe Ia is correlated not only to the velocity at the maximum light, but also to the light curve decline rate like the case for Normal-Velocity (NV) SNe Ia. Spectral synthesis modeling shows that the outermost layer at > 17, 000 km s −1 is well described by the ONe -C burning layer extending to at least 25, 000 km s −1 , and there is no unburnt carbon below 30, 000 km s −1 ; these properties are largely consistent with the delayed detonation scenario, and are shared with the prototypical HV SN 2002bo despite the large difference in ∆m 15 (B). This structure is strikingly different from that derived for the well-studied NV SN 2011fe. We suggest that the relation between the mass of 56 Ni (or ∆m 15) and the extent of the ONe -C burning layer provides an important constraint on the explosion mechanism(s) of HV and NV SNe. 2 Kawabata M., et al.},

abstract = {The delay time distribution (DTD) of Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is important for understanding chemical evolution, SN Ia progenitors, and SN Ia physics. Past estimates of the DTD in galaxy clusters have been deduced from SN Ia rates measured in cluster samples observed at various redshifts, corresponding to different time intervals after a presumed initial brief burst of star formation. A recent analysis of a cluster sample at z = 1.13 − 1.75 confirmed indications from previous studies of lower-redshift clusters, that the DTD has a power-law form, DTD(t) = R 1 (t/Gyr) $\alpha$ , with amplitude R 1 , at delay t = 1 Gyr, several times higher than measured in field-galaxy environments. This implied that SNe Ia are somehow produced in larger numbers by the stellar populations in clusters. This conclusion, however, could have been affected by the implicit assumption that the stars were formed in a single brief starburst at high z. Here, we re-derive the DTD from the cluster SN Ia data, but relax the single-burst assumption. Instead, we allow for a range of star-formation histories and dust extinctions for each cluster. Via MCMC modeling, we simultaneously fit, using stellar population synthesis models and DTD models, the integrated galaxy-light photometry in several bands, and the SN Ia numbers discovered in each cluster. With these more-realistic assumptions, we find a best-fit DTD with power-law index $\alpha$ = −1.09 +0.15 −0.12 , and amplitude R 1 = 0.41 +0.12 −0.10 × 10 −12 yr −1 M −1. We confirm a cluster-environment DTD with a larger amplitude than the field-galaxy DTD, by a factor ∼ 2 − 3 (at 3.8$\sigma$). Cluster and field DTDs have consistent slopes of $\alpha$ ≈ −1.1.},

There has been long and intensive discussion on whether the so-called single degenerate (SD) scenario or the double degenerate (DD) scenario, or anything else, could explain a major population of SNe Ia, but the conclusion has not yet been reached. With rapidly increasing observational data and new theoretical ideas, the field of studying the SN Ia progenitors has been quickly developing, and various new insights have been obtained in recent years. This article aims at providing a summary of the current situation regarding the SN Ia progenitors, both in theory and observations.

Here we present an X-ray study of N103B (0509-68.7), a Type Ia SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud, that is known to be interacting with dense circumstellar matter (CSM). Applying our novel method for feature extraction to deep Chandra observations, we have successfully resolved the CSM, Fe-rich ejecta, and intermediate-mass element (IME) ejecta components, and revealed each of their spatial distribution. Remarkably, the IME ejecta component exhibits a double-ring structure, implying that the SNR expands into an hourglass-shape cavity and thus forms bipolar bubbles of the ejecta. This interpretation is supported by more quantitative spectroscopy that reveals a clear bimodality in the distribution of the ionization state of the IME ejecta. These observational results can be naturally explained if the progenitor binary system had formed a dense CSM torus on the orbital plane prior to the explosion, providing further evidence that the SNR N103B originates from a single-degenerate progenitor.

Using the evolutionary code mesa-binary we simulate evolution of binary systems with stars of initial masses of 6 − 7.5M. The more massive star, the primary, transfers mass to the secondary star and leaves a CO WD remnant of mass 1M. The secondary becomes massive enough to end in a CCSN. As the secondary evolves to the RSG phase it engulfs the WD and the system experience a common envelope evolution that ends with a WD-core binary system at an orbital separation of a f 1 − 5R. Our simulations show that the core explodes as a CCSN at t CEE−CCSN 3000 − 10 5 yr after the CEE. The rest of the scenario is speculative. We assume that if the WD accretes helium-rich gas from the core it might explode as a SN Ia in the frame of the double detonation scenario for SNe Ia and peculiar SNe Ia. The peculiar SN Ia explosion might occur at the end of the CEE evolution or just few years before the CCSN. We predict the very rare occurrence of a peculiar SN Ia followed within months to years by a CCSN.},

We develop a model calculating time dependent emission spectrum of interaction-powered transients. We solve energy equations of electron-proton plasma in the shocked SN ejecta and CSM and a radiation transfer equation out to the outer edge of the CSM, incorporating the collisional relaxation and the comptoniza-tion of the bremsstrahlung radiation. We compare our model to observations of Type IIn supernovae covering frequency ranges from optical to X-rays. For SN 2010jl the observed optical and X-ray light curves can be consistently explained if clumpy or asymmetric structure in the CSM is assumed, in agreement with previous studies. For SN 2014C our model successfully reproduces the X-ray bremsstrahlung component and the emergence of H$\alpha$ emission at 400 days after explosion. Finally we find a parameter space where the supernova is extremely X-ray bright, reaching 10 43-10 44 erg s −1 for up to 100 days. Such X-ray transients are likely detectable with all-sky surveys by e.g. eROSITA.},

abstract = {The many unusual properties of the enigmatic AT2018cow suggested that at least some subset of the empirical class of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represents a genuinely new astrophysical phenomenon. Unfortunately, the intrinsic rarity and fleeting nature of these events have made it difficult to identify additional examples early enough to acquire the observations necessary to constrain theoretical models. We present here the Zwicky Transient Facility discovery of AT2020xnd (ZTF20acigmel, the "Camel") at = 0.243, the first unambiguous AT2018cow analog to be found and confirmed in real time. AT2018cow and AT2020xnd share all key observational properties: a fast optical rise, sustained high photospheric temperature, absence of a second peak attributable to ejection of a radioactively-heated stellar envelope, extremely luminous radio, millimetre, and X-ray emission, and a dwarf-galaxy host. This supports the argument that AT2018cow-like events represent a distinct phenomenon from slower-evolving radio-quiet supernovae, likely requiring a different progenitor or a different central engine. The sample properties of the four known members of this class to date disfavour tidal disruption models but are consistent with the alternative model of an accretion powered jet following the direct collapse of a massive star to a black hole. Contextual filtering of alert streams combined with rapid photometric verification using multi-band imaging provides an efficient way to identify future members of this class, even at high redshift.},

Progress in developing a detailed understanding of the complex, multi-threaded evolutionary pathways of these systems is limited by the lack of statistically sound observational constraints on the relative fractions of various sub-populations, and their physical properties. The available samples are small, heterogeneous, and subject to a multitude of observational biases. Our overarching goal is to establish a volume-limited sample of all types of white dwarf binaries that is representative of the underlying population as well as sufficiently large to serve as a benchmark for future binary population models. In this first paper, we provide an overview of the project, and assemble reference samples within a distance limit of 300 pc of known white dwarf binaries spanning the most common sub-classes: post-common envelope binaries containing a white dwarf plus a main sequence star, cataclysmic variables and double-degenerate binaries. We carefully vet the members of these "Gold" Samples, which span most of the evolutionary parameter space of close white dwarf binary evolution. We also explore the differences between magnitude and volume limited close white dwarf binary samples, and discuss how these systems evolve in their observational properties across the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.},

Several complementary observational evidences indicate that the cosmic dust mass density significantly drops from redshift z = 1 to z = 0. Clearly, and for the first time during cosmic evolution, dust must be destroyed more rapidly than it is formed. By considering the dust production/destruction processes acting in this cosmic time lapse, we find that the drop can be explained if dust is mainly destroyed by astration (49% contribution in the fiducial case) and supernova shocks within galaxies (42%). Our results further imply that on average each supernova destroys only M d,sn = 0.45 M of dust, i.e. 5 − 10 times less than usually assumed, with a hard upper limit of M d,sn < 3.0M set by the available metal budget and maximal grain growth.

We find that the peak brightness of the radio emission increases until ∼ 200 days and subsequently begins to decrease steadily. Using the standard equipartition analysis, including the effects of synchrotron cooling as determined by the joint VLA-ALMA spectral energy distributions, we find that the outflow powering the radio emission is in roughly free expansion with a velocity of ≈ 0.07c, while its kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 5 from 55 to 200 days and plateaus at ≈ 5 × 10 48 erg thereafter. The ambient density traced by the outflow declines as ≈ R −1.6 on a scale of ≈ (1 − 4) × 10 16 cm (≈ 6300 − 25000 R s), followed by a steeper decline to ≈ 6 × 10 16 cm (≈ 37500 R s). Allowing for a collimated geometry, we find that to reach even mildly relativistic velocities ($\Gamma$ = 2) the outflow requires an opening angle of $\theta$ j ≈ 2 • , which is narrow even by the standards of GRB jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from Type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.},

abstract = {The discovery of SN 2018gep (ZTF18abukavn) challenged our understanding of the late-phase evolution of massive stars and their supernovae (SNe). The fast rise in luminosity of this SN (spectro-scopically classified as a broad-lined Type Ic SN), indicates that the ejecta interacts with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), while an additional energy source such as 56 Ni-decay is required to explain the late-time light curve. These features hint at the explosion of a massive star with pre-supernova mass-loss. In this work, we examine the physical origins of rapidly evolving astrophysical transients like SN 2018gep. We investigate the wave-driven mass-loss mechanism and how it depends on model parameters such as progenitor mass and deposition energy, searching for stellar progenitor models that can reproduce the observational data. A model with an ejecta mass ∼ 2 M ⊙ , explosion energy ∼ 10 52 erg, a circumstellar medium of mass ∼ 0.3 M ⊙ and radius ∼ 1000 R ⊙ , and a 56 Ni mass of ∼ 0.3 M ⊙ provides a good fit to the bolometric light curve. We also examine how interaction-powered light curves depend more generally on these parameters, and how ejecta velocities can help break de-generacies. We find both wave-driven mass-loss and mass ejection via pulsational pair-instability can plausibly create the dense CSM in SN 2018gep, but we favor the latter possibility.},

abstract = {The mechanism for the blue and excessive early-phase emission reported within the first few days of several Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been suggested to be the interaction of the SN ejecta with either a non-degenerate companion star or circumstellar media (CSM). Recently, another mechanism has been suggested within the context of the He-detonation-triggered SN scenario (i.e., the double-detonation scenario or He-ignited violent merger), in which the radioactive isotopes in the outermost layer of the SN ejecta produce the early emission. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the excessive early-phase emission predicted by these different scenarios. The early flash in the He-detonation scenario shows behaviors different from those in the companion/CSM interaction scenarios. Especially clear diagnostics are provided once the behaviors in the UV and in the optical are combined. The spectra synthesized for the He-detonation scenario are characterized by absorptions due to He-detonation products, which develop in the decay phase. We further expect a relation between the properties of the early-phase flash and those of the maximum SN emission, in such a way that the brighter and slower initial flash is accompanied by a more substantial effect from the additional absorptions (and reddening). This relation, however, should be considered together with the maximum luminosity of the SN, since the larger luminosity suppresses the effect of the additional absorption. With these expected features, we address the possible origins of the excessive early-phase emission observed in several SNe.},

We review the evidence derived from spectropolarimetry that has established several key results: Virtually all supernovae are significantly aspherical near maximum light; core-collapse supernovae behave differently than thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae; the asphericity of core-collapse supernovae is more pronounced in the inner layers, showing that the explosion process is strongly aspherical; core-collapse supernovae tend to establish a preferred direction of asymmetry; and the asphericity is stronger in the outer layers of thermonuclear supernovae, providing constraints on the burning process. We emphasize the utility of the Q/U plane as a diagnostic tool and revisit SN 1987A and SN 1993J in a contemporary context. An axially symmetric geometry can explain many basic features of core-collapse supernovae, but significant departures from axial symmetry are needed to explain most events. We introduce a spectropolarimetry type to classify the range of behavior observed in polarized supernovae. Understanding asymmetries in supernovae is important for phenomena as diverse as the origins of gamma-ray bursts and the cosmological applications of Type Ia supernovae in studies of the dynamics of the universe.

abstract = {Spectropolarimetry enables us to measure the geometry and chemical structure of the ejecta in supernova explosions, which is fundamental for the understanding of their explosion mechanism(s) and progenitor systems. We collected archival data of 35 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observed with Focal Reducer and Low-Dispersion Spectrograph (FORS) on the Very Large Telescope at 127 epochs in total. We examined the polarization of the Si II $\lambda$6355 {\AA} line (p Si II) as a function of time, which is seen to peak at a range of various polarization degrees and epochs relative to maximum brightness. We reproduced the m 15-p Si II relationship identified in a previous study, and show that subluminous and transitional objects display polarization values below the m 15-p Si II relationship for normal SNe Ia. We found a statistically significant linear relationship between the polarization of the Si II $\lambda$6355 {\AA} line before maximum brightness and the Si II line velocity and suggest that this, along with the m 15-p Si II relationship, may be explained in the context of a delayed-detonation model. In contrast, we compared our observations to numerical predictions in the m 15-v Si II plane and found a dichotomy in the polarization properties between Chandrasekhar and sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions, which supports the possibility of two distinct explosion mechanisms. A subsample of SNe displays evolution of loops in the q-u plane that suggests a more complex Si structure with depth. This insight, which could not be gleaned from total flux spectra, presents a new constraint on explosion models. Finally, we compared our statistical sample of the Si II polarization to quantitative predictions of the polarization levels for the double-detonation, delayed-detonation, and violent-merger models.},

abstract = {The nearby supernova SN 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail. Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models, which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN 2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white dwarfs (WDs)-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most widely discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum, but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified. Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads to differences in the 55 Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed sufficiently long to study this effect.},

abstract = {As part of an ongoing effort to identify, understand and correct for astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) for cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNe Ia into those that are located in predominantly younger or older environments. This classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a projected distance of 1 kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly, as it provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNe Ia in predominantly younger environments are ∆ Y = 0.163 ± 0.029 mag (5.7$\sigma$) fainter than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic connected to the host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established step in standardized brightnesses between SNe Ia in hosts with lower or higher total stellar masses is smaller, at ∆ M = 0.119 ± 0.032 mag (4.5$\sigma$), for the same set of SNe Ia. When fit simultaneously, the environment-age offset remains very significant, with ∆ Y = 0.129 ± 0.032 mag (4.0$\sigma$), while the global stellar mass step is reduced to ∆ M = 0.064 ± 0.029 mag (2.2$\sigma$). Thus, approximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Also, we verify that using the local star formation rate alone is not as powerful as LsSFR at sorting SNe Ia into brighter and fainter subsets. Standardization that only uses the SNe Ia in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from 0.142 ± 0.008 mag to 0.120 ± 0.010 mag. We show that as environment-ages evolve with redshift, a strong bias, especially on the measurement of the derivative of the dark energy equation of state, can develop. Fortunately, data that measure and correct for this effect using our local specific star formation rate indicator, are likely to be available for many next-generation SN Ia cosmology experiments.},

Although the GAMA database does include near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fits is significantly poorer when these NIR data are included. Further, for a large fraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from the optical-plus-NIR photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred from the optical data alone. This may indicate problems in our stellar population library, or NIR data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for future versions of the catalogue. For now, we have chosen to base our stellar mass estimates on optical photometry only. In light of our decision to ignore the available NIR data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained based on optical data alone.

abstract = {Photometric and spectroscopic observations of Type Ia supernova (SN) 2017fgc, which cover the period from −12 to + 137 d since the B-band maximum are presented. SN 2017fgc is a photometrically normal SN Ia with the luminosity decline rate, m 15 (B) true = 1.10 ± 0.10 mag. Spectroscopically, it belongs to the high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia group, with the Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity near the B-band maximum estimated to be 15 200 ± 480 km s −1. At the epochs around the near-infrared secondary peak, the R and I bands show an excess of ∼0.2-mag level compared to the light curves of the normal velocity (NV) SNe Ia. Further inspection of the samples of HV and NV SNe Ia indicates that the excess is a generic feature among HV SNe Ia, different from NV SNe Ia. There is also a hint that the excess is seen in the V band, both in SN 2017fgc and other HV SNe Ia, which behaves like a less prominent shoulder in the light curve. The excess is not obvious in the B band (and unknown in the U band), and the colour is consistent with the fiducial SN colour. This might indicate that the excess is attributed to the bolometric luminosity, not in the colour. This excess is less likely caused by external effects, like an echo or change in reddening but could be due to an ionization effect, which reflects an intrinsic, either distinct or continuous, difference in the ejecta properties between HV and NV SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Analyses of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have found puzzling correlations between their standardized luminosities and host galaxy properties: SNe Ia in high-mass, passive hosts appear brighter than those in lower mass, star-forming hosts. We examine the host galaxies of SNe Ia in the Dark Energy Survey 3-yr spectroscopically confirmed cosmological sample, obtaining photometry in a series of 'local' apertures centred on the SN, and for the global host galaxy. We study the differences in these host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and rest-frame U − R colours, and their correlations with SN Ia parameters including Hubble residuals. We find all Hubble residual steps to be >3$\sigma$ in significance, both for splitting at the traditional environmental property sample median and for the step of maximum significance. For stellar mass, we find a maximal local step of 0.098 ± 0.018 mag; ∼0.03 mag greater than the largest global stellar mass step in our sample (0.070 ± 0.017 mag). When splitting at the sample median, differences between local and global U − R steps are small, both ∼0.08 mag, but are more significant than the global stellar mass step (0.057 ± 0.017 mag). We split the data into sub-samples based on SN Ia light-curve parameters: stretch (x 1) and colour (c), finding that redder objects (c > 0) have larger Hubble residual steps, for both stellar mass and U − R, for both local and global measurements, of ∼0.14 mag. Additionally, the bluer (star-forming) local environments host a more homogeneous SN Ia sample, with local U − R rms scatter as low as 0.084 ± 0.017 mag for blue (c < 0) SNe Ia in locally blue U − R environments.},

From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we resolve spectra of individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, t = 1.4 ± 5.0 d, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the light curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the SN Ia host galaxy at z = 0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z = 0.2163. We detect strong Na ID absorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying 'anomalously' large Na ID column densities compared to dust extinction derived from light curves. For the lens galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$ = 129 ± 4 km s −1 , which significantly constrains the lens model. We use ground-based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ∼70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si II-line, indicate that iPTF16geu is a normal SN Ia. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.},

abstract = {The ejecta velocities of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as measured by the Si II $\lambda$6355 line, have been shown to correlate with other supernova properties, including color and standardized luminosity. We investigate these results using the Foundation Supernova Survey, with a spectroscopic data release presented here, and photometry analyzed with the SALT2 light-curve fitter. We find that the Foundation data do not show significant evidence for an offset in color between SNe Ia with high and normal photospheric velocities, with ∆c = 0.005 ± 0.014. Our SALT2 analysis does show evidence for redder high-velocity SN Ia in other samples, including objects from the Carnegie Supernova Project, with a combined sample yielding ∆c = 0.017 ± 0.007. When split on velocity, the Foundation SN Ia also do not show a significant difference in Hubble diagram residual, ∆HR = 0.015 ± 0.049 mag. Intriguingly, we find that SN Ia ejecta velocity information may be gleaned from photometry, particularly in redder optical bands. For high-redshift SN Ia, these rest-frame red wavelengths will be observed by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Our results also confirm previous work that SN Ia host-galaxy stellar mass is strongly correlated with ejecta velocity: high-velocity SN Ia are found nearly exclusively in high-stellar-mass hosts. However, host-galaxy properties alone do not explain velocity-dependent differences in supernova colors and luminosities across samples. Measuring and understanding the connection between intrinsic explosion properties and supernova environments, across cosmic time, will be important for precision cosmology with SNe Ia.},

abstract = {The progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are debated, particularly the evolutionary state of the binary companion that donates mass to the exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarf. In previous work, we presented hydrodynamic models and optically thin radio synchrotron light-curves of SNe Ia interacting with detached, confined shells of CSM, representing CSM shaped by novae. In this work, we extend these light-curves to the optically thick regime, considering both synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption. We obtain simple formulae to describe the evolution of optical depth seen in the simulations, allowing optically thick light-curves to be approximated for arbitrary shell properties. We then demonstrate the use of this tool by interpreting published radio data. First, we consider the non-detection of PTF11kx-an SN Ia known to have a detached, confined shell-and find that the non-detection is consistent with current models for its CSM, and that observations at a later time would have been useful for this event. Secondly, we statistically analyze an ensemble of radio non-detections for SNe Ia with no signatures of interaction, and find that shells with masses (10 −4 − 0.3) M located (10 15 − 10 16) cm from the progenitor are currently not well constrained by radio datasets, due to their dim, rapidly-evolving light-curves.},

abstract = {Accepted-. Received-; in original form-ABSTRACT Using a sample of nearby spiral galaxies hosting 185 supernovae (SNe) Ia, we perform a comparative analysis of the locations and light curve decline rates (∆m 15) of normal and peculiar SNe Ia in the star formation deserts (SFDs) and beyond. To accomplish this, we present a simple visual classification approach based on the UV/H$\alpha$ images of the discs of host galaxies. We demonstrate that, from the perspective of the dynamical timescale of the SFD, where the star formation (SF) is suppressed by the bar evolution, the ∆m 15 of SN Ia and progenitor age can be related. The SFD phenomenon gives an excellent possibility to separate a subpopulation of SN Ia progenitors with the ages older than a few Gyr. We show, for the first time, that the SFDs contain mostly faster declining SNe Ia (∆m 15 > 1.25). For the galaxies without SFDs, the region within the bar radius, and outer disc contain mostly slower declining SNe Ia. To better constrain the delay times of SNe Ia, we encourage new studies (e.g. integral field observations) using the SFD phenomenon on larger and more robust datasets of SNe Ia and their host galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the best 265 sampled R-band light curves of spectroscopically identified Type Ia supernovae (SNe) from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; 2009-2012) survey and the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF; 2013-2017). A model-independent light-curve template is built from our data-set with the purpose to investigate average properties and diversity in our sample. We searched for multiple populations in the light-curve properties using machine learning tools. We also utilized the long history of our light curves, up to 4000 days, to exclude any significant pre-or post-supernova flares. From the shapes of light curves we found the average rise time in the R band to be 16.8 +0.5 −0.6 days. Although PTF/iPTF were single-band surveys, by modelling the residuals of the SNe in the Hubble-LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre diagram, we estimate the average colour excess of our sample to be E(B − V) ≈ 0.05(2) mag and thus the mean corrected peak brightness to be M R = −19.02 ± 0.02 +5 log(H 0 [ km s −1 Mpc −1 ]/70) mag with only weak dependennce on light-curve shape. The intrinsic scatter is found to be $\sigma$ R = 0.186 ± 0.033 mag for the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.1, without colour corrections of individual SNe. Our analysis shows that Malmquist bias becomes very significant at z = 0.13. A similar limitation is expected for the ongoing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey using the same telescope, but new camera expressly designed for ZTF.},

These observations are complemented by observations in two narrow-band filters used in an H$\alpha$ survey of nearby galaxies by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory that also captured the first days of the brightening of the supernova. The evolution of the light curves is consistent with the expected signal from the cooling of shock heated material of large scale dimensions, > ∼ 1R. This could be due to heated material of the progenitor, a companion star or pre-existing circumstellar environment, e.g., in the form of an accretion disk. Structure seen in the light curves during the first days after explosion could also originate from radioactive material in the outer parts of an exploding white dwarf, as suggested from the early detection of gamma-rays. The model degeneracy translates into a systematic uncertainty of ±0.3 days on the estimate of the first light from SN 2014J. Key word: supernovae: individual (SN 2014J)},

abstract = {There is extensive, yet fragmented, evidence of gender differences in academia suggesting that women are underrepresented in most scientific disciplines and publish fewer articles throughout a career, and their work acquires fewer citations. Here, we offer a comprehensive picture of longitudinal gender differences in performance through a bibliometric analysis of academic publishing careers by reconstructing the complete publication history of over 1.5 million gender-identified authors whose publishing career ended between 1955 and 2010, covering 83 countries and 13 disciplines. We find that, paradoxically, the increase of participation of women in science over the past 60 years was accompanied by an increase of gender differences in both productivity and impact. Most surprisingly, though, we uncover two gender invariants, finding that men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and have equivalent career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we demonstrate that differences in publishing career lengths and dropout rates explain a large portion of the reported career-wise differences in productivity and impact, although productivity differences still remain. This comprehensive picture of gender inequality in academia can help rephrase the conversation around the sustainability of women's careers in academia, with important consequences for institutions and policy makers. gender inequality | science of science | STEM | scientific careers G ender differences in academia, captured by disparities in the number of female and male authors, their productivity , citations, recognition, and salary, are well documented across all disciplines and countries (1-8). The epitome of gender difference is the "productivity puzzle" (9-13)-the persistent evidence that men publish more than women over the course of their career, which has inspired a plethora of possible explanations (14-16), from differences in family responsibilities (17-19), to career absences (20), resource allocation (21), the role of peer review (22), collaboration (23, 24), role stereotypes (25), academic rank (26), specialization (27), and work climate (28). The persistence of these gender differences could perpetuate the naive interpretation that the research programs of female and male scientists are not equivalent. However, such simplistic reading of the data dismisses increasing evidence that systemic barriers impede the female academic. Indeed, the deep interre-latedness of these factors has limited our ability to differentiate the causes from the consequences of the productivity puzzle, complicating the scientific community's ability to enact effective policies to address it. A key methodological obstacle has been the difficulty to reconstruct full publishing careers for scientists of both genders across the diverse academic population. Consequently, much of the available evidence on gender differences is based on case studies limited to subsets of active scientists in specific countries, disciplines, or institutions, making it difficult to compare and generalize the finding to all of science. A further complication arises from the heavy-tailed nature of academia: a disproportionately small number of authors produce a large fraction of the publications and receive the majority of the citations (29), an effect that is exacerbated in small sample sizes (30). To truly understand the roots of the gender inequality, we need to survey the whole longitudinal, disciplinary, and geographical landscape, which is possible only if we capture complete publishing careers for all scientists across disciplinary and national boundaries. Here, we reconstructed the full publishing career of 7,863,861 scientists from their publication record in the Web of Science (WoS) database between 1900 and 2016. By deploying a state-of-the-art method for gender identification (SI Appendix, section S2.E), we identified the gender of over 3 million authors (856,889 female and 2,146,926 male) spanning 83 countries and 13 major disciplines (SI Appendix, section S2). We then focused on 1,523,002 scientists (412,808 female and 1,110,194 male) whose publishing careers ended between 1955 and 2010 (SI Appendix, sections S1 and S2.H), allowing us to systematically compare complete male and female careers. This extensive sample covers 33% of all papers published between 1955 and 2010 but due to methodological limitations, systematically lacks Significance Empirical evidence suggests significant gender differences in the total productivity and impact of academic careers across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Paradoxically, the increase in the number of women academics over the past 60 years has increased these gender differences. Yet, we find that men and women publish a comparable number of papers per year and have equivalent career-wise impact for the same total number of publications. This suggests the productivity and impact of gender differences are explained by different publishing career lengths and dropout rates. This comprehensive picture of gender inequality in academic publishing can help rephrase the conversation around the sustainability of women's careers in academia, with important consequences for institutions and policy makers.},

abstract = {Radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs)-when a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH)-provide a unique laboratory for studying outflows in the vicinity of SMBHs and their connection to accretion onto the SMBH. Radio emission has been detected in only a handful of TDEs so far. Here, we report the detection of delayed radio flares from an optically-discovered TDE. Our prompt radio observations of the TDE ASASSN-15oi showed no radio emission until the detection of a flare six months later, followed by a second and brighter flare, years later. We find that the standard scenario, in which an outflow is launched briefly after the stellar disruption, is unable to explain the combined temporal and spectral properties of the delayed flare. We suggest that the flare is due to the delayed ejection of an outflow, perhaps following a transition in accretion states. Our discovery motivates observations of TDEs at various timescales and highlights a need for new models. Synoptic time-domain surveys have been increasingly fruitful in discovering nearby tidal disruption events (TDEs) over the last several years 1. These transient events which are interpreted as stars being tidally disrupted by super-massive black holes 2 (SMBHs), may provide a window into many diverse astrophysical questions. Uncovering dormant SMBHs is only one of the revelations made through these events. The complex physical process of accretion of matter onto a SMBH is another. The nature of TDEs and their emission mechanisms are still puzzling. For example, what generates the ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission? Is it a process related to accretion or maybe internal shocks in streams of stellar debris 3, 4 ? Does an accretion disk form around the SMBH, and if so, when and in which geometry 3, 5, 6 ? Panchromatic studies of a growing number of events hold the key for unlocking many of the remaining open questions.},

We present the early discovery and rapid ultraviolet (UV), optical, and infrared (IR) temporal development of AT 2019qyl, a recent nova in NGC 300. The light curve shows a rapid rise lasting 1 day, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of M V = −9.2 mag, and a very fast decline, fading by 2 mag over 3.5 days. A steep drop-off in the light curves after 71 days and the rapid decline timescale suggest a low-mass ejection from a massive WD with M WD 1.2 M. We present an unprecedented view of the early spectroscopic evolution of such an event. Three spectra prior to the peak reveal a complex, multi-component outflow giving rise to 2 Jencson et al. internal collisions and shocks in the ejecta of an He/N-class nova. We identify a coincident IR-variable counterpart in the extensive pre-eruption coverage of the transient location, and infer the presence of a symbiotic progenitor system with an O-rich asymptotic-giant-branch donor star, as well as evidence for an earlier UV-bright outburst in 2014. We suggest that AT 2019qyl is analogous to the subset of Galactic recurrent novae with red-giant companions such as RS Oph and other embedded nova systems like V407 Cyg. Our observations provide new evidence that internal outflow collisions likely play an important role in generating the shock-powered emission from such systems.},

abstract = {We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of five Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Nearby Supernova Factory selected to be spectroscopic analogs of the candidate super-Chandrasekhar-mass events SN 2003fg and SN 2007if. Their spectra are characterized by hot, highly ionized photospheres near maximum light, for which SN 1991T supplies the best phase coverage among available close spectral templates. Like SN 2007if, these supernovae are overluminous (−19.5 < M V < −20) and the velocity of the Si ii $\lambda$6355 absorption minimum is consistent with being constant in time from phases as early as a week before, and up to two weeks after, B-band maximum light. We interpret the velocity plateaus as evidence for a reverse-shock shell in the ejecta formed by interaction at early times with a compact envelope of surrounding material, as might be expected for SNe resulting from the mergers of two white dwarfs. We use the bolometric light curves and line velocity evolution of these SNe to estimate important parameters of the progenitor systems, including 56 Ni mass, total progenitor mass, and masses of shells and surrounding carbon/oxygen envelopes. We find that the reconstructed total progenitor mass distribution of the events (including SN 2007if) is bounded from below by the Chandrasekhar mass, with SN 2007if being the most massive. We discuss the relationship of these events to the emerging class of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, estimate the relative rates, compare the mass distribution to that expected for double-degenerate SN Ia progenitors from population synthesis, and consider implications for future cosmological Hubble diagrams.},

abstract = {Merging carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs are a promising progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), but the underlying physics and timing of the detonation are still debated. If an explosion occurs after the secondary star is fully disrupted, the exploding primary will expand into a dense CO medium that may still have a disk-like structure. This interaction will decelerate and distort the ejecta. Here we carry out multidimensional simulations of "tamped" SN Ia models, using both particle and grid-based codes to study the merger and explosion dynamics and a radiative transfer code to calculate synthetic spectra and light curves. We find that post-merger explosions exhibit an hourglass-shaped asymmetry, leading to strong variations in the light curves with viewing angle. The two most important factors affecting the outcome are the scale height of the disk, which depends sensitively on the binary mass ratio, and the total 56 Ni yield, which is governed by the central density of the remnant core. The synthetic broadband light curves rise and decline very slowly, and the spectra generally look peculiar, with weak features from intermediate mass elements but relatively strong carbon absorption. We also consider the effects of the viscous evolution of the remnant and show that a longer time delay between merger and explosion probably leads to larger 56 Ni yields and more symmetrical remnants. We discuss the relevance of this class of aspherical "tamped" SN Ia for explaining the class of "super-Chandrasekhar" SN Ia.},

abstract = {We present comprehensive, multi-wavelength observations of AT 2016jbu, an interacting transient. High cadence photometric coverage reveals that AT 2016jbu underwent significant photometric variability followed by two luminous events, the latter of which reached an absolute magnitude of M V ∼ −18.5 mag. This is similar to the transient SN 2009ip whose nature is still debated. Spectra are dominated by narrow emission lines and show a blue continuum during the peak of the second event. AT 2016jbu shows signatures of a complex, non-homogeneous circumstellar material (CSM). We see slowly evolving asymmetric hydrogen line profiles, with velocities of 500 km s −1 seen in narrow emission features from a slow moving CSM, and up to 10,000 km s −1 seen in broad absorption from some high velocity material. Similar velocities are seen in other SN 2009ip-like transients. Late-time spectra (∼ +1 year) show a lack of forbidden emission lines expected from a core-collapse supernova during the nebular phase and are dominated by strong emission from H, He i and Ca ii. Strong asymmetric emission features, a bumpy lightcurve, and continually evolving spectra suggest late time CSM interaction is inhibiting the emergence of any nebular features. We compare the evolution of H$\alpha$ among SN 2009ip-like transients and find possible evidence for orientation angle effects. The light-curve evolution of AT 2016jbu suggests similar, but not identical, circumstellar environments to other SN 2009ip-like transients. In Paper II we continue the discussion of AT 2016jbu and SN 2009ip-like transients and using the data presented here, we focus on the local environment, the progenitor, and on modelling the transient itself.},

abstract = {In the second of two papers on the peculiar interacting transient AT 2016jbu, we present the bolometric lightcurve, identification and analysis of the progenitor candidate, as well as preliminary modelling to help elucidate the nature of this event. We identify the progenitor candidate for AT 2016jbu in quiescence, and find it to be consistent with a ∼ 20 M yellow hypergiant surrounded by a dusty circumstellar shell. We see evidence for significant photometric variability in the progenitor, as well as strong H$\alpha$ emission consistent with pre-existing circumstellar material. The age of the resolved stellar population surrounding AT 2016jbu, as well as integral-field unit spectra of the region support a progenitor age of >16 Myr, again consistent with a progenitor mass of ∼20 M. Through a joint analysis of the velocity evolution of AT 2016jbu, and the photospheric radius inferred from the bolometric lightcurve, we find that the transient is consistent with two successive outbursts or explosions. The first outburst ejected a shell of material with velocity 650 km s −1 , while the second more energetic event ejected material at 4500 km s −1. Whether the latter is the core-collapse of the progenitor remains uncertain, as the required ejecta mass is relatively low (few tenths of M). We also place a restrictive upper limit on the ejected 56 Ni mass of <0.016 M. Using the BPASS code, we explore a wide range of possible progenitor systems, and find that the majority of these are in binaries, some of which are undergoing mass transfer or common envelope evolution immediately prior to explosion. Finally, we use the SNEC code to demonstrate that the low-energy explosion of some of these systems together with sufficient CSM can reproduce the overall morphology of the lightcurve of AT 2016jbu.},

Previous theoretical work has, for the most part, been unable to match the entire breadth of observed SNe Ia with one progenitor scenario. Here, for the first time, we apply non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations to a range of accurate explosion models of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf detonations. The resulting pho-tometry and spectra are in excellent agreement with the range of observed non-peculiar SNe Ia through 15 d after the time of B-band maximum, yielding one of the first examples of a quantitative match to the entire Phillips (1993) relation. The intermediate-mass element velocities inferred from theoretical spectra at maximum light for the more massive white dwarf explosions are higher than those of bright observed SNe Ia, but these and other discrepancies likely stem from the one-dimensional nature of our explosion models and will be improved upon by future non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiation transport calculations of multi-dimensional sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf detonations.},

As opposed to other published Hubble diagrams, these are solely based on light curves obtained with CCDs, which have been carefully reduced in order to avoid background contamination. Special care was also taken in the extrapolation of peak magnitudes for the SNe that were discovered after maximum light by using five different template light curves representing the range of observed decline rates of SNe Ia. The resulting Hubble diagrams show clear evidence for a distance-dependent dispersion. Although some of the scatter could be due to the peculiar velocities of the host galaxies or to uncorrected dust absorption in the host galaxies, we argue that the dominant source is an intrinsic dispersion in the peak absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia of approximately 0.8 mag in MB and approximately 0.5 mag in MV. If low-luminosity events like SN 1991bg are actually a separate class of supernovae which arise from different progenitors, then the intrinsic dispersion in MB and MV for normal SNe Ia would decrease to approximately 0.3-0.5 mag. This study confirms, in general terms, the finding by Phillips (1993) from a sample of well observed nearby SNe Ia that the absolute B and V magnitudes are correlated with the initial decline rate of the B light curve, although this effect seems to be less pronounced in the Calan/Tololo SNe. Although the number of SNe studied here is relatively small, we find that galaxies having a younger stellar population appear to host the most luminous SNe Ia. We present Hubble diagrams in B and V for the subset of the Calan/Tololo SNe which have decline rates in the range 0.8 less than Delta m15(B) less than 1.5. A dramatic decrease in the scatter in these diagrams is obtained when the data are corrected for the peak luminosity-decline rate relation derived from events in the Phillips sample of nearby SNe Ia covering the same range of decline rates. Using the recently measured Cepheid distance to NGC 5253, a Hubble constant in the range H0 approximately equal to 62-67 km/s/Mpc is calculated when the peak luminosity-decline rate relation is taken into account. The result of ignoring this effect for SN 1972E is to underestimate H0 by approximately 15%.},

abstract = {The ejecta velocities of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as measured by the Si II $\lambda$6355 line, have been shown to correlate with other supernova properties, including color and standardized luminosity. We investigate these results using the Foundation Supernova Survey, with a spectroscopic data release presented here, and photometry analyzed with the SALT2 light-curve fitter. We find that the Foundation data do not show significant evidence for an offset in color between SNe Ia with high and normal photospheric velocities, with ∆c = 0.005 ± 0.014. Our SALT2 analysis does show evidence for redder high-velocity SN Ia in other samples, including objects from the Carnegie Supernova Project, with a combined sample yielding ∆c = 0.017 ± 0.007. When split on velocity, the Foundation SN Ia also do not show a significant difference in Hubble diagram residual, ∆HR = 0.015 ± 0.049 mag. Intriguingly, we find that SN Ia ejecta velocity information may be gleaned from photometry, particularly in redder optical bands. For high-redshift SN Ia, these rest-frame red wavelengths will be observed by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Our results also confirm previous work that SN Ia host-galaxy stellar mass is strongly correlated with ejecta velocity: high-velocity SN Ia are found nearly exclusively in high-stellar-mass hosts. However, host-galaxy properties alone do not explain velocity-dependent differences in supernova colors and luminosities across samples. Measuring and understanding the connection between intrinsic explosion properties and supernova environments, across cosmic time, will be important for precision cosmology with SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Binary neutron star mergers are thought to be one of the dominant sites of production for rapid neutron capture elements, and the source of platinum and gold in the Universe. Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, and its associated kilonova AT2017gfo, numerous works have attempted to determine the composition of its outflowing material, but they have been hampered by the lack of complete atomic data. Here, we demonstrate how inclusion of new atomic data in synthetic spectra calculations can provide insights and constraints on the production of the heaviest elements. We employ theoretical atomic data for neutral, singly-and doubly-ionised platinum and gold, to generate photospheric and simple nebular-phase model spectra for kilonova-like ejecta properties. We make predictions for the locations of strong transitions, which could feasibly appear in the spectra of kilonovae that are rich in these species. We use grasp 0 to generate the underlying atomic structure, and tardis to model the diffusion phase, showing that the strongest features lie in the ultraviolet region. We identify low-lying electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions that may give rise to forbidden lines when the ejecta becomes optically thin. The strongest lines lie beyond 8000 {\AA}, motivating high quality near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of kilonova candidates. We compare our model spectra to the observed spectra of AT2017gfo, and conclude that no platinum or gold signatures are prominent in the ejecta. This work demonstrates how new atomic data of heavy elements can be included in radiative transfer calculations, and motivates future searches for elemental signatures.},

abstract = {Improving the use of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) as standard candles requires a better approach to incorporate the relationship between SNIa and the properties of their host galaxies. Using a spectroscopically-confirmed sample of ∼1600 SNIa, we develop the first empirical model of underlying populations for SNIa light-curve properties that includes their dependence on host-galaxy stellar mass. These populations are important inputs to simulations that are used to model selection effects and correct distance biases within the BEAMS with Bias Correction (BBC) framework. Here we improve BBC to also account for SNIa-host correlations, and we validate this technique on simulated data samples. We recover the input relationship between SNIa luminosity and host-galaxy stellar mass (the mass step, $\gamma$) to within 0.004 mags, which is a factor of 5 improvement over the previous method that results in a $\gamma$-bias of ∼0.02. We adapt BBC for a novel dust-based model of intrinsic brightness variations, which results in a greatly reduced mass step for data ($\gamma$ = 0.017±0.008), and for simulations ($\gamma$ = 0.006 ± 0.007). Analysing simulated SNIa, the biases on the dark energy equation-of-state, w, vary from ∆w = 0.006(5) to 0.010(5) with our new BBC method; these biases are significantly smaller than the 0.02(5) w-bias using previous BBC methods that ignore SNIa-host correlations.},

ASASSN-18tb was a fast-declining, sub-luminous event that fits well within the observed photometric and spectroscopic distributions of the SN Ia population. We detect a prominent H $\alpha$ emission line (L H $\alpha$ = 2.2 ± 0.2 × 10 38 ergs s −1) with FWHM ≈ 1100 km s −1 in the nebular-phase spectrum of this SN Ia. High-luminosity H $\alpha$ emission (L H $\alpha$ 10 40 ergs s −1) has previously been discovered in a rare class of SNe Ia-like objects showing circum-stellar medium (CSM) interactions (SNe Ia-CSM). They predominantly belong to overluminous (M max < −19 mag in optical) 1991T-like SNe Ia and are exclusively found in star-forming galaxies. By contrast, ASASSN-18tb is a sub-luminous SN Ia (M B,max ∼ −17.7 mag) found in an early-type galaxy dominated by old stellar populations. We discuss possible origins for the observed hydrogen. Of the 75 SNe Ia for which we have so far obtained nebular spectra in 100IAS, no other SN shows a ∼1000 km s −1 H $\alpha$ emission line with comparable line luminosity as ASASSN-18tb, emphasizing the rarity of such emission in the nebular phase. Based on preliminary results from our survey, the rate for ASASSN-18tb-like nebular H $\alpha$ emission could be as high as ∼10 per cent among sub-luminous SNe Ia.},

Multicolor photometry show that SN2018cqj/ ATLAS18qtd is a low-luminosity (»-M 17.9 B max mag), fast-declining TypeIa, with color stretch s BV ≈0.6 and B-band decline rate $\Delta$m 15 (B)≈1.77 mag. Two nebular-phase spectra obtained as part of the 100IAS survey at +193 and +307days after peak show the clear detection of a narrow H$\alpha$ line in emission that is resolved in the first spectrum with FWHM≈1200 km s −1 and L H$\alpha$ ≈3.8×10 37 ergs −1. The detection of a resolved H$\alpha$ line with a declining luminosity is broadly consistent with recent models where hydrogen is stripped from the nondegenerate companion in a single-degenerate progenitor system. However, the amount of hydrogen consistent with the luminosities of the H$\alpha$ line would be ∼10 −3 M e , which is significantly less than theoretical model predictions in the classical single-degenerate progenitor systems.

abstract = {Observations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) reveal a wealth of information about the dynamics of the supernova ejecta and its composition but reveal very little direct information about the progenitor star. Constraining properties of the progenitor and the explosion, such as explosion energy, requires coupling the observations with a theoretical model of the explosion. Here, we use a new model for driving turbulence-aided neutrino-driven core-collapse supernovae in 1D (STIR) which contains a non-parametric treatment of the neutrino transport while also accounting for turbulence and convection. We couple this with the SuperNova Explosion Code to produce bolometric light curves from a landscape of CCSNe driven from self-consistent CCSN simulations with robust neutrino transport. We compare our results to several well observed bolometric light curves of Type IIP CCSNe and find that our best fitting models differ from those found in previous studies using thermal bomb explosions, indicating ZAMS masses as much as about 10M greater than previous studies. Using our large sample of 136 self-consistent CCSN explosions, we explore correlations between observable features of the light curves and properties of the progenitor star. Among other significant correlations, we find a robust linear relationship between light curve plateau luminosity and the iron core mass of the progenitor. This relationship allows for properties of the core of the progenitor to be constrained for the first time from photometry alone.},

abstract = {We calculate the average stretch-corrected rise time of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Supernova Legacy Survey. We use the aggregate light curves of spectroscopic and photometrically identified SNe Ia to fit the rising part of the light curve with a simple quadratic model. We obtain a light curve shape corrected, i.e., stretch-corrected, fiducial rise time of 17.02 +0.18 −0.28 (stat) days. The measured rise time differs from an earlier finding by the SNLS (Conley et al.) due to the use of different SN Ia templates. We compare it to nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the early part of the light curve of SNe Ia up to z = 1. We search for variations among different populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the sample in stretch. Bright and slow decliners (s > 1.0) have consistent stretch-corrected rise times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8 < s 1.0); they are shorter by 0.57 +0.47 −0.50 (stat) days. Subluminous SNe Ia (here defined as objects with s 0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with a rise time of 18.03 +0.81 −1.37 (stat) days. We study several systematic biases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect the average rise time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. Based on our results, we estimate that subluminous SNe Ia are powered by 0.05-0.35 M of 56 Ni synthesized in the explosion. Our conclusions are the same for the single-stretch and two-stretch parameterizations of the light curve.},

abstract = {The physical process whereby a carbon-oxygen white dwarf explodes as a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remains highly uncertain. The degree of neutronization in SN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the metallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior to the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization using Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs). Applying this method to Suzaku data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397, and G337.2−0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find that the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho and Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source of neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to infer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied metallicities of 3C 397, G337.2−0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to the local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that progenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for these SNRs. Although the relationship between ejecta neutronization and equivalent progenitor metallicity is subject to uncertainties stemming from the 12 C+ 16 O reaction rate, which affects the Ca/S mass ratio, our main results are not sensitive to these details.},

We show that the V-band luminosity constitutes a roughly constant fraction of the bolometric luminosity between 900 and 1900 days, and we obtain an approximate bolometric light curve out to 4334 days by scaling the late time V-band data by a constant factor where no bolometric light curve data is available. Considering the five most relevant decay chains starting at 44 Ti, 55 Co, 56 Ni, 57 Ni, and 60 Co, we perform a least squares fit to the constructed composite bolometric light curve. For the nickel isotopes, we obtain best fit values of M(56 Ni) = (7.1 ± 0.3) × 10 −2 M and M(57 Ni) = (4.1 ± 1.8) × 10 −3 M. Our best fit 44 Ti mass is M(44 Ti) = (0.55 ± 0.17) × 10 −4 M , which is in disagreement with the much higher (3.1 ± 0.8) × 10 −4 M recently derived from INTEGRAL observations. The associated uncertainties far exceed the best fit values for 55 Co and 60 Co and, as a result, we only give upper limits on the production masses of M(55 Co) < 7.2 × 10 −3 M and M(60 Co) < 1.7 × 10 −4 M. Furthermore, we find that the leptonic channels in the decay of 57 Co (internal conversion and Auger electrons) are a significant contribution and constitute up to 15.5% of the total luminosity. Consideration of the kinetic energy of these electrons is essential in lowering our best fit nickel isotope production ratio to [ 57 Ni/ 56 Ni] = 2.5 ± 1.1, which is still somewhat high but is in agreement with gamma-ray observations and model predictions.},

abstract = {Several recently discovered peculiar Type Ia supernovae seem to demand an altogether new formation theory that might help explain the puzzling dissimilarities between them and the standard Type Ia supernovae. The most striking aspect of the observational analysis is the necessity of invoking super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs having masses ∼2.1-2.8 M , M being the mass of Sun, as their most probable progenitors. Strongly magnetized white dwarfs having super-Chandrasekhar masses have already been established as potential candidates for the progenitors of peculiar Type Ia supernovae. Owing to the Landau quantization of the underlying electron degenerate gas, theoretical results yielded the observationally inferred mass range. Here, we sketch a possible evolutionary scenario by which super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs could be formed by accretion on to a commonly observed magnetized white dwarf, invoking the phenomenon of flux freezing. This opens multiple possible evolution scenarios ending in supernova explosions of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs having masses within the range stated above. We point out that our proposal has observational support, such as the recent discovery of a large number of magnetized white dwarfs by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

To this aim, we run detailed one-infall and two-infall chemical evolution models, adopting a large compilation of yield sets corresponding to different white dwarf progenitors (near-Chandrasekar and sub-Chandrasekar) taken from the literature. We adopt a fixed delay time distribution function for Type Ia SNe , in order to avoid degeneracies in the analysis of the different nucleosynthesis channels. We also combine yields for different Type Ia SN progenitors in order to test the contribution to chemical evolution of different Type Ia SN channels. The results of the models are compared with recent LTE and NLTE observational data. We find that "classical" W7 and WDD2 models produce Fe masses and [{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}»¼/Fe] abundance patterns similar to more recent and physical near-Chandrasekar and sub-Chandrasekar models. For Fe-peak elements, we find that the results strongly depend either on the white dwarf explosion mechanism (deflagration-to-detonation, pure deflagration, double detonation) or on the initial white dwarf conditions (central density, explosion pattern). The comparison of chemical evolution model results with observations suggests that a combination of near-Chandrasekar and sub-Chandrasekar yields is necessary to reproduce the data of V, Cr, Mn and Ni, with different fractions depending on the adopted massive stars stellar yields. This comparison also suggests that NLTE and singly ionised abundances should be definitely preferred when dealing with most of Fe-peak elements at low metallicity.},

abstract = {We present photospheric-phase observations of LSQ12gdj, a slowly declining, UV-bright Type Ia supernova. Classified well before maximum light, LSQ12gdj has extinction-corrected absolute magnitude MB = -19.8, and pre-maximum spectroscopic evolution similar to SN 1991T and the super-Chandrasekhar-mass SN 2007if. We use ultraviolet photometry from Swift, ground-based optical photometry, and corrections from a near-infrared photometric template to construct the bolometric (1600-23 800 {\AA}) light curve out to 45 d past B-band maximum light. We estimate that LSQ12gdj produced 0.96 ± 0.07 M{\textperiodcentered} of 56Ni, with an ejected mass near or slightly above the Chandrasekhar mass. As much as 27 per cent of the flux at the earliest observed phases, and 17 per cent at maximum light, is emitted bluewards of 3300 {\AA}. The absence of excess luminosity at late times, the cutoff of the spectral energy distribution bluewards of 3000 {\AA} and the absence of narrow line emission and strong Na I D absorption all argue against a significant contribution from ongoing shock interaction. However, $\sim$10 per cent of LSQ12gdj's luminosity near maximum light could be produced by the release of trapped radiation, including kinetic energy thermalized during a brief interaction with a compact, hydrogen-poor envelope (radius <1013 cm) shortly after explosion; such an envelope arises generically in double-degenerate merger scenarios.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the early, rising light curves of 18 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory and the La Silla-QUEST variability survey. We fit these early data flux using a simple power law (f(t) = $\alpha$ × t n) to determine the time of first light (t 0), and hence the rise time (t rise) from first light to peak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise (n). We find a mean uncorrected rise time of 18.98 ± 0.54 d, with individual supernova (SN) rise times ranging from 15.98 to 24.7 d. The exponent n shows significant departures from the simple 'fireball model' of n = 2 (or f(t) ∝ t 2) usually assumed in the literature. With a mean value of n = 2.44 ± 0.13, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. This deviation has implications for the distribution of 56 Ni throughout the SN ejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56 Ni mixing. The range of n found also confirms that the 56 Ni distribution is not standard throughout the population of SNe Ia, in agreement with earlier work measuring such abundances through spectral modelling. We also show that the duration of the very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of its maximal value, does not correlate with the light-curve shape or stretch used to standardize SNe Ia in cosmological applications. This has implications for the cosmological fitting of SN Ia light curves.},

abstract = {In this article, we compare optical light curves of two SN2002es-like Type Ia supernovae (SNe), iPTF14atg and iPTF14dpk, from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. Although the two light curves resemble each other around and after maximum, they show distinct early-phase rise behavior in the r-band. On the one hand, iPTF14atg revealed a slow and steady rise that lasted for 22 days with a mean rise rate of 0.2-0.3 mag day-1 , before it reached the R-band peak (−18.05 mag). On the other hand, iPTF14dpk rose rapidly to −17 mag within a day of discovery with a rise rate >-1.8 mag day 1 , and then rose slowly to its peak (−18.19 mag) with a rise rate similar to iPTF14atg. The apparent total rise time of iPTF14dpk is therefore only 16 days. We show that emission from iPTF14atg before −17 days with respect to its maximum can be entirely attributed to radiation produced by collision between the SN and its companion star. Such emission is absent from iPTF14dpk probably because of an unfavored viewing angle, provided that SN2002es-like events arise from the same progenitor channel. We further show that an SN2002es-like SN may experience a dark phase after the explosion but before its radioactively powered light curve becomes visible. This dark phase may be lit by radiation from supernova-companion interaction.},

abstract = {The progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not yet fully understood. The two leading progenitor scenarios are the single-degenerate (SD) scenario and the double-degenerate scenario. In the SD scenario, the collision of the SN Ia ejecta with its companion star is expected to produce detectable ultraviolet (UV) emission in the first few days after the SN explosion within certain viewing angles. A strong UV flash has recently been detected in an SN 2002es-like peculiar SN Ia iPTF14atg by Cao et al., which is interpreted as evidence of an early-time UV signature due to SN ejecta interacting with its companion star, supporting the SD scenario. In this paper, we present the expected luminosity distributions of early-time UV emission arising from SN Ia ejecta-companion interaction by performing binary population synthesis calculations for different progenitor systems in the SD scenario. Our theoretical predictions will be helpful for future early-time observations of SNe Ia to constrain their possible progenitors. Assuming the observed strong UV pulse of iPTF14atg was indeed produced by the SN ejecta-companion interaction, our population synthesis model suggests that the progenitor system of iPTF14atg is most likely a red-giant donor binary system, and it is unlikely to have been a main-sequence or helium-star donor system.},

This has been interpreted as evidence for a single-degenerate (SD) progenitor system, where such a signal is expected from interactions between the SN ejecta and the non-degenerate companion star. Here, we compare synthetic observables of multidimensional state-of-the-art explosion models for different progenitor scenarios to the light curves and spectra of iPTF14atg. From our models, we have difficulties explaining the spectral evolution of iPTF14atg within the SD progenitor channel. In contrast, we find that a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with 0.9 and 0.76 M , respectively, provides an excellent match to the spectral evolution of iPTF14atg from 10 d before to several weeks after maximum light. Our merger model does not naturally explain the initial UV flash of iPTF14atg.

Here, we present photometry and spectroscopy of the SN in the nebular phase. A comparison of the early time data with a sample of SNe Ia shows distinct features, differing from normal SNe Ia at early phases but similar to normal SNe Ia at a few weeks after maximum light (i.e. the transitional phase) and well into the nebular phase. The transparency timescales (t 0) for this sample of SNe Ia range between ∼ 25 and 41 days indicating a diversity in the ejecta masses. t 0 also weakly correlates with the peak bolometric luminosity, consistent with the interpretation that SNe with higher ejecta masses would produce more 56 Ni. Comparing the t 0 and the maximum luminosity, L max distribution of a sample of SNe Ia to predictions from a wide range of explosion models we find an indication that the sub-Chandrasekhar mass models span the range of observed values. However, the bright end of the distribution can be better explained by Chandrasekhar mass delayed detonation models, hinting at multiple progenitor channels to explain the observed bolometric properties of SNe Ia. iPTF16abc appears to be consistent with the predictions from the M ch models.},

From the H $\alpha$ line identified in the host spectra, we determine a redshift of 0.0736. At this distance, the SN reached an absolute magnitude of −20.4, brighter than any other SNe Ia ever observed. If the source of luminosity is radioactive decay, a large amount of radioactive nickel (∼1.5 M) is required to power the peak luminosity, more than can be produced realistically in a Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. Low expansion velocity, similar to that of 2003fg, is also measured around the maximum light.

A spectrum at 5 days past B-band maximum light is a direct match to the super-Chandrasekhar-mass candidate SN Ia 2003fg, showing Si ii and C ii at ∼9000 km s −1. A high signal-to-noise co-addition of the SN spectral time series reveals no Na i D absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the host galaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the Lira relation for normal SNe Ia. The ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strong maximum in I band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing in near-maximum-light spectra. SN 2007if also displays a plateau in the Si ii velocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for an overdense shell in the SN ejecta. We calculate the bolometric light curve of the SN and use it and the Si ii velocity evolution to constrain the mass of the shell and the underlying SN ejecta, and demonstrate that SN 2007if is strongly inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass scenario. Within the context of a "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, and assuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4 ± 0.2 M , with 1.6 ± 0.1 M of 56 Ni and with 0.3-0.5 M in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/ oxygen. Our modeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a more efficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the low velocities typical of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia.},

The data comprise 5559 optical (ugriBV) and 1043 near-infrared (Y JHK s) data points in the natural system of the Swope telescope. Twenty-eight SNe have pre-maximum data, and for 15 of these, the observations begin at least 5 days before B maximum. This is one of the most accurate data sets of low-redshift SNe Ia published to date. When completed, the CSP data set will constitute a fundamental reference for precise determinations of cosmological parameters, and serve as a rich resource for comparison with models of SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Recently, a few peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that show exceptionally large peak luminosity have been discovered. Their luminosity requires more than 1 M of 56 Ni to be ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might have originated from super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. However, the nature of these objects is not yet well understood. In particular, no data have been taken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. We report on Subaru and Keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the SN Ia 2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these "overluminous" SNe Ia. The late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal SNe Ia, reinforcing the argument that SN 2006gz belongs to a different subclass than normal SNe Ia. However, the peculiar features found at late times are not readily connected to a large amount of 56 Ni; the SN is faint, and it lacks [Fe ii] and [Fe iii] emissions. If the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the SN ejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal SNe Ia, the mass of 56 Ni does not exceed ∼0.3 M. We discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem. With the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identify which process is responsible. An interesting possibility is that the bulk of the emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in other SNe Ia, which might be related to dense C-rich regions as indicated by the early-phase data. Alternatively , it might be the case that SN 2006gz, though peculiar, was actually not substantially overluminous at early times.},

abstract = {Extremely luminous, 'super-Chandrasekhar' (SC) Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are as yet an unexplained phenomenon. We analyse a well-observed SN of this class, SN 2009dc, by modelling its photospheric spectra with a spectral synthesis code, using the technique of 'Abundance Tomography'. We present spectral models based on different density profiles, corresponding to different explosion scenarios, and discuss their consistency. First, we use a density structure of a simulated explosion of a 2 M rotating CO white dwarf, which is often proposed as a possibility to explain SC SNe Ia. Then, we test a density profile empirically inferred from the evolution of line velocities (blueshifts). This model may be interpreted as a core-collapse SN with an ejecta mass of ∼3 M. Finally, we calculate spectra assuming an 'interaction scenario'. In such a scenario, SN 2009dc would be a standard white dwarf (WD) explosion with a normal intrinsic luminosity, and this luminosity would be augmented by interaction of the ejecta with a H-/He-poor circumstellar medium. We find that none of the models tested easily explains SN 2009dc. With the 2 M WD model, our abundance analysis predicts small amounts of burning products in the intermediate-/high-velocity part of the ejecta (v 9000 km s −1). However, in the original explosion simulations, where the nuclear energy release per unit mass is large, burned material is present at high velocities. This contradiction can only be resolved if asymmetries strongly affect the radiative transfer or if CO white dwarfs with masses significantly above 2 M exist. In a core-collapse scenario, low velocities of Fe-group elements are expected, but the abundance stratification in SN 2009dc seems 'SN-Ia-like'. The interaction-based model looks promising, and we have some speculations on possible progenitor configurations. However, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations will be needed to judge whether this scenario is realistic at all.},

abstract = {Extended optical and near-IR observations reveal that SN 2009dc shares a number of similarities with normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), but is clearly overluminous, with a (pseudo-bolometric) peak luminosity of log (L) = 43.47 (erg s −1). Its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light [m 15 (B) true = 0.71], and the early-time near-IR light curves show secondary maxima, although the minima between the first and the second peaks are not very pronounced. The bluer bands exhibit an enhanced fading after ∼200 d, which might be caused by dust formation or an unexpectedly early IR catastrophe. The spectra of SN 2009dc are dominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times, and by iron-group elements at late phases. Strong C II lines are present until ∼2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear SNe. The ejecta velocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous SNe Ia. No signatures of interaction with a circumstellar medium (CSM) are found in the spectra. Assuming that the light curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests that SN 2009dc produced ∼1.8 M of 56 Ni assuming the smallest possible rise time of 22 d. Together with a derived total ejecta mass of ∼2.8 M , this confirms that SN 2009dc is a member of the class of possible super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia similar to SNe 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if.

The decline rate of the light curve is $\Delta$m 15 (B) = 0.65 ± 0.03, which is one of the slowest among SNe Ia. The peak V-band absolute magnitude is estimated to be M V = −19.90 ± 0.15 mag if no host extinction is assumed. It reaches M V = −20.19 ± 0.19 mag if we assume the host extinction of A V = 0.29 mag. SN 2009dc belongs to the most luminous class of SNe Ia, like SNe 2003fg and 2006gz. Our JHK s-band photom-etry shows that this SN is also one of the most luminous SNe Ia in near-infrared wavelengths. We estimate the ejected 56 Ni mass of 1.2 ± 0.3 M for the no host extinction case (and of 1.6 ± 0.4 M for the host extinction of A V = 0.29 mag). The C ii $\lambda$6580 absorption line remains visible until a week after the maximum brightness, in contrast to its early disappearance in SN 2006gz. The line velocity of Si ii $\lambda$6355 is about 8000 km s −1 around the maximum, being considerably slower than that of SN 2006gz. The velocity of the C ii line is similar to or slightly less than that of the Si ii line around the maximum. The presence of the carbon line suggests that the thick unburned C+O layer remains after the explosion. Spectropolarimetric observations by Tanaka et al. indicate that the explosion is nearly spherical. These observational facts suggest that SN 2009dc is a super-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia.},

The decline rate m 15 (B) true = 0.92 ± 0.04 mag is lower than that of normal Type Ia supernovae, and similar to the luminous SN 1991T. However, the photometric and spectroscopic behaviour of SN 2012dn is different from that of SN 1991T. Early-phase light curves in R and I bands are very broad. The I-band peak has a plateau-like appearance similar to the super-Chandra SN 2009dc. Pre-maximum spectra show clear evidence of C II 6580 {\AA} line, indicating the presence of unburned materials. The velocity evolution of C II line is peculiar. Except for the very early phase (∼−13 d), the C II line velocity is lower than the velocity estimated using the Si II line. During the pre-maximum and close to the maximum phase, to reproduce observed shape of the spectra, the synthetic spectrum code SYN++ needs significantly higher blackbody temperature than those required for normal Type Ia events.

Here we utilize the fast and highly parametrized spectrum synthesis tool, SYNAPPS, to estimate relative expansion velocities of species inferred from optical spectra obtained with six facilities. As with previous studies of normal SN Ia, we find that both unburned carbon and intermediate-mass elements are spatially coincident within the ejecta near and below 14 000 km s −1. Although the upper limit on SN 2012dn's peak luminosity is comparable to some of the most luminous normal SN Ia, we find a progenitor mass exceeding ∼1.6 M is not strongly favoured by leading merger models since these models do not accurately predict spectroscopic observations of SN 2012dn and more normal events. In addition, a comparison of light curves and host-galaxy masses for a sample of literature and Palomar Transient Factory SN Ia reveals a diverse distribution of SN Ia subtypes where carbon-rich material remains unburned in some instances.

The observations were performed at 5.6 and 89.5 days after the B-band maximum. The data taken at the later epoch are used to determine the interstellar polarization. Continuum polarization is found to be small (<0.3%), indicating that the explosion is nearly spherically symmetric. This fact suggests that a very aspherical explosion is not a likely scenario for SN 2009dc. Polarization at the Si ii and Ca ii lines clearly shows a loop in the Q-U plane, indicating a non-axisymmetric, clumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements. The degree of line polarization at the Si and Ca lines is moderate (0.5% ± 0.1% and 0.7% ± 0.1%, respectively), but it is higher than expected from the trend of other Type Ia SNe. This may suggest that there are thick enough, clumpy Si-rich layers above the thick 56 Ni-rich layers (1.2 M).

Optical spectra of SN 2007if, a similar object, are also shown. SN 2009dc had one of the most slowly evolving light curves ever observed for a SN Ia, with a rise time of ∼23 d and m 15 (B) = 0.72 mag. We calculate a lower limit to the peak bolometric luminosity of ∼2.4 × 10 43 erg s −1 , though the actual value is likely almost 40 per cent larger. Optical spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if obtained near maximum brightness exhibit strong C II features (indicative of a significant amount of unburned material), and the post-maximum spectra are dominated by iron-group elements (IGEs). All of our spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if also show low expansion velocities. However, we see no strong evidence in SN 2009dc for a velocity 'plateau' near maximum light like the one seen in SN 2007if. The high luminosity and low expansion velocities of SN 2009dc lead us to derive a possible WD progenitor mass of more than 2 M and a 56 Ni mass of about 1.4-1.7 M. We propose that the host galaxy of SN 2009dc underwent a gravitational interaction with a neighbouring galaxy in the relatively recent past. This may have led to a sudden burst of star formation which could have produced the SC WD progenitor of SN 2009dc and likely turned the neighbouring galaxy into a 'post-starburst galaxy'. No published model seems to match the extreme values observed in SN 2009dc, but simulations do show that such massive progenitors can exist (likely as a result of the merger of two WDs) and can possibly explode as SC SNe Ia.},

Here, we present and discuss the most comprehensive optical data set of this SN to date, comprised of a densely sampled series of early-time spectra obtained within the Nearby Supernova Factory project, plus photometry and spectroscopy obtained at the Very Large Telescope about 1 yr after the explosion. The light curves, colour curves, spectral time series, and ejecta velocities of SN 2012dn are compared with those of other 09dc-like and normal SNe Ia, the overall variety within the class of 09dc-like SNe Ia is discussed, and new criteria for 09dc-likeness are proposed. Particular attention is directed to additional insight that the late-phase data provide. The nebular spectra show forbidden lines of oxygen and calcium, elements that are usually not seen in late-time spectra of SNe Ia, while the ionization state of the emitting iron plasma is low, pointing to low ejecta temperatures and high densities. The optical light curves are characterized by an enhanced fading starting ∼60 d after maximum and very low luminosities in the nebular phase, which is most readily explained by unusually early formation of clumpy dust in the ejecta. Taken together, these effects suggest a strongly perturbed ejecta density profile, which might lend support to the idea that 09dc-like characteristics arise from a brief episode of interaction with a hydrogen-deficient envelope during the first hours or days after the explosion.},

abstract = {Context. The recent discovery of a very bright type Ia supernova, SNLS-03D3bb (≡SN 2003fg), in the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) has raised the question of whether super-Chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf stars are needed to explain such bright explosions. Progenitors of this sort could form by mergers of pairs of rather massive white dwarfs. Binary systems of two white dwarfs in close orbit, where their total mass significantly exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass, have not yet been found. Therefore SNLS-03D3bb could establish the first clear case of a double-degenerate progenitor of a (peculiar) type Ia supernovae. Moreover, if this interpretation is correct, it casts some doubt on the universality of the calibration relations used to make SNe Ia distance indicators for cosmology. Aims. We aim to evaluate the case for a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor for SNLS-03D3bb in light of previous theoretical work on super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. Furthermore, we propose an alternative scenario involving only a Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. Methods. We present a theoretically motivated critical discussion of the expected observational fingerprints of super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. As an alternative, we describe a simple class of aspherical Chandrasekhar-mass models in which the products of nuclear burning are displaced from the center. We then perform simple radiative transfer calculations to predict synthetic lightcurves for one such off-center explosion model. Results. In important respects, the expected observational consequences of super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are not consistent with the observations of SNLS-03D3bb. We demonstrate that the lopsided explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf could provide a better explanation.},

abstract = {SN 2017ein is a narrow-lined Type Ic SN that was found to share a location with a point-like source in the face on spiral galaxy NGC 3938 in pre-supernova images, making SN 2017ein the first credible detection of a Type Ic progenitor. Results in the literature suggest this point-like source is likely a massive progenitor of 60-80 M , depending on if the source is a binary, a single star, or a compact cluster. Using new photometric and spectral data collected for 200 days, including several nebular spectra, we generate a consistent model covering the photospheric and nebular phase using a Monte Carlo radiation transport code. Photospheric phase modelling finds an ejected mass 1.2-2.0 M with an E k of ∼ (0.9 ± 0.2) × 10 51 erg, with approximately 1 M of material below 5000 km s −1 found from the nebular spectra. Both photospheric and nebular phase modelling suggests a 56 Ni mass of 0.08-0.1 M. Modelling the [O i] emission feature in the nebular spectra suggests the innermost ejecta is asymmetric. The modelling results favour a low mass progenitor of to 16-20 M which is in disagreement with the pre-supernova derived high mass progenitor. This contradiction is likely due to the pre-supernova source not representing the actual progenitor.},

abstract = {Double peaked light curves are observed for some Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic) including LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc. One possible explanation of the first peak would be shock-cooling emission from massive extended material around the progenitor, which is produced by mass eruption or rapid expansion of the outermost layers of the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. We investigate the effects of such circumstellar matter (CSM) on the multi-band optical light curves of SNe Ic using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. Two different SNe Ic progenitor masses at the pre-SN stage (3.93 M and 8.26 M) are considered in the SN models. The adopted parameter space consists of the CSM mass of M CSM = 0.05−0.3M , the CSM radius of R CSM = 10 13 −10 15 cm and the explosion energy of E burst = (1.0 − 12.0) × 10 51 erg. We also investigate the effects of the radioactive nickel distribution on the overall shape of the light curve and the color evolution. Comparison of our SN models with the double peaked SNe Ic LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc indicate that these three SNe Ic had a similar CSM structure (i.e., M CSM ≈ 0.1 − 0.2M and R CSM = 10 13 − 10 14 cm), which might imply a common mechanism for the CSM formation. The implied mass loss rate of ˙ M 1.0 M yr −1 is too high to be explained by the previously suggested scenarios for pre-SN eruption , which calls for a novel mechanism.},

abstract = {We infer the progenitor mass distribution for 22 historic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) using a Bayesian hierarchical model from D{\'{i}}az-Rodr{\'{i}}guez et al. (2018). For this inference, we use the local star formation histories to estimate the age for each supernova (SN) as inferred in Williams et al. (2018). These star formation histories often show multiple bursts of star formation; our model assumes that one burst is associated with the SN progenitor and the others are random bursts of star formation. The primary inference is the progenitor age distribution. Due to the limited number of historic SNe and highly uncertain star formation at young ages, we restrict our inference to the slope of the age distribution and the maximum age for CCSNe. Using single-star evolutionary models, we transform the progenitor age distribution into a progenitor mass distribution. Under these assumptions, the minimum mass for CCSNe is M min = 8.60 +0.37 −0.41 M and the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is $\alpha$ = −2.61 +1.05 −1.18. The power-law slope for the progenitor mass distribution is consistent with the standard Salpeter initial mass function ($\alpha$ = −2.35). These values are consistent with previous estimates using precursor imaging and the age-dating technique, further confirming that using stellar populations around SN and supernova remnants is a reliable way to infer the progenitor masses.},

abstract = {We investigate the consequences of fairly normal Type Ia supernovae being embedded in compact and dense envelopes of carbon-and oxygen-rich circumstellar material by means of detailed radiation hydrodynamic simulations. Our main focus rests on exploring the effects of the interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material on the ejecta evolution and the broad-band light curve. In our calculations, we find that a strong reverse shock efficiently decelerates and compresses the ejecta material. This leads to a significant broadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower decline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy is generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime. Only if reprocessing due to radiation-matter interactions is very efficient, a significant boost in the optical light curve is observed. We discuss these findings in particular in the context of the superluminous event SN 2009dc. As our calculations are able to reproduce a number of its peculiar properties, we conclude that the flavour of the interaction scenario investigated in this work constitutes a promising candidate to explain such 'Super-Chandrasekhar' supernovae.},

We analyze observational data of Suzaku around the SNR and the adjacent pulsar PSR J2229+6114. We find diffuse X-ray emission that is represented by either thermal or non-thermal one. However, the metal abundance for the thermal emission is < 0.13 Z , which may be too small in the Milky Way and suggests that the emission is non-thermal. The intensity of the diffuse emission increases toward PSR J2229+6114 in the same way as radio emission, and it is in contrast with gamma-ray emission concentrated on a molecular cloud. The X-ray photon index does not change with the distance from the pulsar and it indicates that radiative cooling is ineffective and particle diffusion is not extremely slow. The X-ray and radio emissions seem to be of leptonic origin and the parent electrons may originate from the pulsar or its wind nebula. The gamma-ray emission appears to be of hadronic origin because of its spacial distribution. The parent protons may be tightly confined in the cloud separately from the diffusing electrons.},

Here we explain this model as a scenario of vacuum energy interacting with matter and radiation. We consider two cases of the model: (i) ˜ $\Lambda$CDM with one additional free parameter $\delta$ G and (ii) e ˜ $\Lambda$CDM with two additional free parameters $\delta$ G and $\delta$ $\Lambda$. We use two data combinations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) and CMB+BAO+SN+H 0 (CBSH), to constrain the models. We find that, in the case of using the CBS data, neither˜$\Lambda$CDM neither˜ neither˜$\Lambda$CDM nor e ˜ $\Lambda$CDM can effectively alleviate the H 0 tension. However, it is found that using the CBSH data the H 0 tension can be greatly relieved by the models. In particular, in the case of e ˜ $\Lambda$CDM, the H 0 tension can be resolved to 0.6$\sigma$. We find that as an interacting dark energy model, ˜ $\Lambda$CDM is much better than $\Lambda$(t)CDM in the sense of both relieving the H 0 tension and fitting to the current observational data.},

Here we present the results of a systematic study of 1077 Type I supernovae discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory, leading to nine new members of this peculiar class. Moreover, we find there are two distinct subclasses based on their spectroscopic, photometric, and host galaxy properties: "SN 2002cx-like" supernovae tend to be in later-type or more irregular hosts, have more varied and generally dimmer luminosities, have longer rise times, and lack a Ti ii trough when compared to "SN 2002es-like" supernovae. None of our objects show helium, and we counter a previous claim of two such events. We also find that the occurrence rate of these transients relative to Type Ia supernovae is 5.6 +22 −3.8 % (90% confidence), lower compared to earlier estimates. Combining our objects with the literature sample, we propose that these subclasses have two distinct physical origins.},

abstract = {The double-detonation explosion model has been considered a candidate for explaining astrophysical transients with a wide range of luminosities. In this model, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a surface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is the presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface helium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the optical depths of important He i lines in the ejecta of double-detonation models. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the He i lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion simulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the near-infrared 10 830 {\AA} and 2 µm lines of He i. We first consider a double detonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This model has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 M and our calculations suggest that the 2 µm feature is expected to be very weak but that the 10 830 {\AA} feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta. Consequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He i 10 830 {\AA} feature may be expected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum light. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model (∼19 000 km s −1) mean that the He i 10 830 {\AA} feature may be confused or blended with the C i 10 690 {\AA} line forming at lower velocities. We also present calculations for the He i 10 830 {\AA} and 2 µm lines for a lower mass (low luminosity) double detonation model, which has a post-explosion He mass of 0.077 M. In this case, both the He i features we consider are strong and can provide a clear observational signature of the double-detonation mechanism.},

abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2019yvq, from its discovery $\sim$1 day after explosion to $\sim$100 days after its peak brightness. This SN exhibits several unusual features, most notably an extremely bright UV excess seen within $\sim$5 days of its explosion. As seen in Swift UV data, this early excess outshines its "peak" brightness, making this object more extreme than other SNe with early UV/blue excesses (e.g. iPTF14atg and SN 2017cbv). In addition, it was underluminous ($M_B=-18.4$), relatively quickly declining ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35$), and shows red colors past its early blue bump. Unusual (although not unprecedented) spectral features include extremely broad-lined and high-velocity Si absorption. Despite obvious differences in peak spectra, we classify SN 2019yvq as a transitional member of the 02es-like subclass due to its similarities in several respects (e.g. color, peak luminosity, peak Ti, nebular [Ca II]). We model this dataset with a variety of published models, including SN ejecta - companion shock interaction and sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD double detonation models. Radio constraints from the VLA place an upper limit of $(4.5 - 20) \times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr on the mass-loss rate from a symbiotic progenitor, which does not exclude a red giant or main sequence companion. Ultimately we find that no one model can accurately replicate all aspects of the dataset, and further we find that the ubiquity of early excesses in 02es-like SNe Ia requires a progenitor system that is capable of producing isotropic UV flux, ruling out some models for this class of objects.},

Despite their importance, an accurate description of which objects explode and why and how they explode is still lacking. One of the main characteristics of such explosions is that they are the main suppliers of newly synthesized chemical elements in the Galaxy. Since some of these isotopes are radioactive, it is possible to use the corresponding gamma-rays as a diagnostic tool of the explosion thanks to their independence on the thermal state of the debris. The drawback is the poor sensitivity of detectors in the MeV energy domain. As a consequence, the radioactive lines have only been detected in one core collapse supernova (SN 1987A), one Type Ia supernova (SN 2014J), and one supernova remnant (Cas A). Nevertheless these observations have provided and are providing important information about the explosion mechanisms. Unfortunately, novae are still eluding detection. These results emphasize the necessity to place as soon as possible a new instrument in orbit with enough sensitivity to notice-* ably enlarge the sample of detected events.},

abstract = {The joint detection of the gravitational wave GW170817, of the short $\gamma$-ray burst GRB170817A and of the kilonova AT2017gfo, generated by the the binary neutron star merger observed on August 17, 2017, is a milestone in multimessenger astronomy and provides new constraints on the neutron star equation of state. We perform Bayesian inference and model selection on AT2017gfo using semi-analytical, multi-components models that also account for non-spherical ejecta. Observational data favor anisotropic geometries to spherically symmetric profiles, with a log-Bayes' factor of ∼10 4 , and favor multi-component models against single-component ones. The best fitting model is an anisotropic three-component composed of dynamical ejecta plus neutrino and viscous winds. Using the dynamical ejecta parameters inferred from the best-fitting model and numerical-relativity connecting the ejecta properties ot the binary properties, we constrain the binary mass ratio to q < 1.54 and the reduced tidal parameter to 120 < ˜ $\Lambda$ < 1110. Finally, we combine the predictions from AT2017gfo with those from GW170817, constraining the radius of a neutron star of 1.4 M to 12.2 ± 0.5 km (1$\sigma$ level). This prediction could be further strengthened by improving kilonova models with numerical-relativity information.},

abstract = {Using a combination of ground-based and HST imaging, we have constructed a catalog of 179 supernova remnants (SNRs) and SNR candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy M51. Follow-up spectroscopy of 66 of the candidates confirms 61 of these as SNRs, and suggests that the vast majority of the unobserved objects are SNRs as well. A total of 55 of the candidates are coincident with (mostly soft) X-ray sources identified in deep Chandra observations of M51; searching the positions of other soft X-ray sources resulted in several additional possible optical candidates. There are 16 objects in the catalog coincident with known radio sources. None of the sources with spectra shows the high velocities (500 km s −1) characteristic of young, ejecta-dominated SNRs like Cas A; instead, most if not all appear to be middle-aged SNRs. The general properties of the SNRs, size distribution and spectral characteristics, resemble those in other nearby spiral galaxies, notably M33, M83, and NGC 6946, where similar samples exist. However, the spectroscopically observed [N II]:H$\alpha$ ratios appear to be significantly higher than in any of these other galaxies. Although we 2 Winkler et al. have explored various ideas to explain the high ratios in M51, none of the explanations appears to be satisfactory.},

abstract = {We present VLT − FORS spectropolarimetric observations of the type II supernova (SN) 2012aw taken at seven epochs during the photospheric phase, from 16 to 120 d after explosion. We correct for the interstellar polarization by postulating that the SN polarization is naught near the rest wavelength of the strongest lines-this is later confirmed by our modeling. SN 2012aw exhibits intrinsic polarization, with strong variations across lines, and with a magnitude that grows in the 7000 {\AA} line-free region from 0.1 % at 16 d up to 1.2 % at 120 d. This behavior is qualitatively similar to observations gathered for other type II SNe. A suitable rotation of Stokes vectors places the bulk of the polarization in q, suggesting the ejecta of SN 2012aw is predominantly axisymmetric. Using an upgraded version of our 2D polarized radiative transfer code, we model the wavelength-and time-dependent polarization of SN 2012aw. The key observables may be explained by the presence of a confined region of enhanced 56 Ni at ∼ 4000 km s −1 , which boosts the electron density in a cone having an opening angle of ∼ 50 deg and an observer's inclination of ∼ 70 deg to the axis of symmetry. With this fixed asymmetry in time, the observed evolution of the SN 2012aw polarization arises from the evolution of the ejecta optical depth, ionization, and the relative importance of multiple versus single scattering. However, the polarization signatures exhibit numerous degeneracies. Cancellation effects at early times imply that a low polarization may even occur for ejecta with a large asymmetry. An axisymmetric ejecta with a latitudinal dependent explosion energy can also yield similar polarization signatures as an asymmetry in the 56 Ni distribution. In spite of these uncertainties, SN 2012aw provides additional evidence for the generic asymmetry of type II SN ejecta, of which VLT − FORS spectropolarimetric observations are a decisive and exquisite probe.},

Previous observations of this supernova at 5.5 yrs since explosion showed a double-peaked radio light curve accompanied by a detection in the X-rays, but no evidence for broad H$\alpha$ spectral features. The Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations presented here show that the PTF11qcj GHz radio ejecta remains marginally resolved at the sub-milliarcsecond level at ≈ 7.5 yrs after the explosion, pointing toward a non-relativistic expansion. Our VLBI observations thus favor a scenario in which the second peak of the PTF11qcj radio light curve is related to strong interaction of the supernova ejecta with a circumstellar medium of variable density, rather than to the emergence of an off-axis jet. Continued VLBI monitoring of PTF11qcj in the radio may strengthen further this conclusion.},

There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most Type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, M chan ≈ 1.39 M ⊙ , and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling Type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis will be on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints.},

abstract = {The delayed-detonation explosion mechanism applied to a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf offers a very attractive model to explain the inferred characteristics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The resulting ejecta are chemically stratified, have the same mass and roughly the same asymptotic kinetic energy, but exhibit a range in 56 Ni mass. We investigate the con-temporaneous photometric and spectroscopic properties of a sequence of delayed-detonation models, characterized by 56 Ni masses between 0.18 and 0.81 M ⊙. Starting at 1 d after explosion , we perform the full non-LTE, time-dependent radiative transfer with the code CMFGEN, with an accurate treatment of line blanketing, and compare our results to SNe Ia at bolometric maximum. Despite the 1D treatment, our approach delivers an excellent agreement to observations. We recover the range of SN Ia luminosities, colours, and spectral characteristics from the near-UV to 1 µm, for standard as well as low-luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia. Our models predict an increase in rise time to peak with increasing 56 Ni mass, from ∼ 15 to ∼ 21 d, yield peak bolometric luminosities that match Arnett's rule to within 10 % and reproduce the much smaller scatter in near-IR magnitudes compared to the optical. We reproduce the morphology of individual spectral features, the stiff dependence of the R(Si) spectroscopic ratio on 56 Ni mass, and the onset of blanketing from Ti II/Sc II in low-luminosity SNe Ia with a 56 Ni mass 0.3 M ⊙. We find that ionization effects, which often dominate over abundance variations, can produce high-velocity features in Ca II lines, even in 1D. Distinguishing between different SN Ia explosion mechanisms is a considerable challenge but the results presented here provide additional support to the viability of the delayed-detonation model.},

Photometrically, SN 2020ank is one of the brightest SLSN (M g,peak ∼-21.84 ± 0.10 mag), having fast pre-peak rising and post-peak decaying rates. The bolometric light-curve of SN 2020ank exhibits a higher peak luminosity (L max) of ∼ (3.9 ± 0.7) × 10 44 erg s −1 and appears to be symmetric around the peak with L rise max /e ≈ L f all max /e ≈ 15 d. The semi-analytical light-curve modelling using the MINIM code suggests a spin down millisecond magnetar with P i ∼ 2.2 ± 0.5 ms and B ∼ (2.9 ± 0.1) × 10 14 G as a possible powering source for SN 2020ank. The possible magnetar origin and excess ultraviolet flux at early epochs indicate a central-engine based powering source for SN 2020ank. Near-peak spectra of SN 2020ank are enriched with the W-shaped O ii features but with the weaker signatures of C ii and Fe iii. Using the estimated rise time of ∼ 27.9 d and the photo-spheric velocity of ∼ 12,050 km s −1 , we constrain the ejecta mass to ∼ 7.2 M and the kinetic energy of ∼6.3 × 10 51 erg. The near-peak spectrum of SN 2020ank exhibits a close spectral resemblance with that of fast-evolving SN 2010gx. The absorption features of SN 2020ank are blue-shifted compared to Gaia16apd, suggesting a higher expansion velocity. The spectral similarity with SN 2010gx and comparatively faster spectral evolution than PTF12dam (a slow-evolving SLSN) indicate the fast-evolving behavior of SN 2020ank.},

For 292 SNe Ia, we measure SB at the location of the SN Ia from publicly available Pan-STARRS (PS1) images. The Hubble residuals are from two recent measurements with low-z SNe Ia that overlap the PS1 footprint: 1) the DES 3-year cosmology analysis, with 120 overlapping low-z SNe Ia from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics surveys and Carnegie Supernova Project, and 2) the PS1 single-telescope analysis, with 172 overlapping low-z SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey. This study is motivated by previous reports of anomalous inefficiencies and flux scatter for transients on bright galaxies. We compare HR distributions of the bright and faint halves of the SB distribution: the mean HR values differ by ∆HR = 0.031 ± 0.018, consistent with no difference at the 2$\sigma$ level. We also perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for the bright and faint half HR distributions, and conclude that the two distributions are statistically consistent with a KS p-value of 0.07. However, if future studies with larger datasets find ∆HR ∼ 0.03 with high significance, this difference would be a leading systematic uncertainty in measurements of the dark energy equation of state, w.},

abstract = {In spite of their importance as standard candles in cosmology and as major major sites of nucleosynthesis in the Universe, what kinds of progenitor systems lead to type Ia supernovae (SN) remains a subject of considerable debate in the literature. This is true even for the case of Tycho's SN exploded in 1572 although it is deeply studied both observationally and theoretically. Analyzing X-ray data of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) obtained with Chandra in 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2015, we discover that the expansion before 2007 was substantially faster than radio measurements reported in the past decades and then rapidly decelerated during the last ∼ 15 years. The result is well explained if the shock waves recently hit a wall of dense gas surrounding the SNR. Such a gas structure is in fact expected in the so-called single-degenerate scenario, in which the progenitor is a binary system consisting of a white dwarf and a stellar companion, whereas it is not generally predicted by a competing scenario, the double-degenerate scenario, which has a binary of two white dwarfs as the progenitor. Our result thus favors the former scenario. This work also demonstrates a novel technique to probe gas environments surrounding SNRs and thus disentangle the two progenitor scenarios for Type Ia SNe.},

Linking the morphology of SNRs to anisotropies developed in their parent SNe can be essential to obtain key information on many aspects of the explosion processes associated with SNe. Nowadays, our capability to study the SN-SNR connection has been largely improved thanks to multi-dimensional models describing the long-term evolution from the SN to the SNR as well as to observational data of growing quality and quantity across the electromagnetic spectrum which allow to constrain the models. Here we used the numerical resources obtained in the framework of the "Accordo Quadro INAF-CINECA (2017)" together with a CINECA ISCRA Award N.HP10BARP6Y to describe the full evolution of a SNR from the core-collapse to the full-fledged SNR at the age of 2000 years. Our simulations were compared with observations of SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) at the age of ∼ 350 years. Thanks to these simulations we were able to link the physical, chemical and morphological properties of a SNR to the physical processes governing the complex phases of the SN explosion.},

abstract = {We present the results of a large multi-wavelength follow-up campaign of the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT 2019dsg, focusing on low to high resolution optical spectroscopy, X-ray, and radio observations. The galaxy hosts a super massive black hole of mass (5.4 ± 3.2) × 10 6 M and careful analysis finds no evidence for the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus, instead the TDE host galaxy shows narrow optical emission lines that likely arise from star formation activity. The transient is luminous in the X-rays, radio, UV and optical. The X-ray emission becomes undetected after ∼125 days, and the radio luminosity density starts to decay at frequencies above 5.4 GHz by ∼180 days. Optical emission line signatures of the TDE are present up to ∼250 days after the discovery of the transient. The medium to high resolution spectra show traces of absorption lines that we propose originate in the self-gravitating debris streams. At late times, after ∼200 days, narrow Fe lines appear in the spectra. The TDE was previously classified as N-strong, but after careful subtraction of the host galaxy's stellar contribution, we find no evidence for these N lines in the TDE spectrum, even though O Bowen lines are detected. The observed properties of the X-ray emission are fully consistent with the detection of the inner regions of a cooling accretion disc. The optical and radio properties are consistent with this central engine seen at a low inclination (i.e., seen from the poles).},

I received 54 responses from 53 astronomers and one computer scientist of which 23 were in an academic position beyond postdoc (faculty, scientist, etc.), 1 was an individual research fellow, 4 were in their third postdoc, 4 were in their second postdoc, 16 were in their first postdoc, and 6 were graduate students. I report the results of this survey here.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves inform about the probable distances at which an observed signal originated. This information when combined over multiple observations is used in the modeling of the redshift evolution of the merger rate. This is an important aspect of binary black hole population analysis which is expected to have close ties with the star formation history of the universe or dynamical evolution of star clusters. At the least, it can probe the time delay between the star formation and merger of remnants. However, due to the degeneracy between the inclination angle of the binary and the luminosity distance, the measured luminosity distance has large uncertainty that limits our ability to precisely measure the redshift distribution of mergers. In this letter, we show that by imposing the cosmological principle it is possible to suppress this uncertainty and better discriminate between different distributions modeling the redshift evolution of binary black hole merger rate. Additionally, we show that by making a comparison with an analysis that does not make such imposition we can probe the cosmological principle.},

abstract = {We present an expanded sample of 75 Milky Way Cepheids with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and Gaia EDR3 parallaxes which we use to recalibrate the extragalactic distance ladder and refine the determination of the Hubble constant. All HST observations were obtained with the same instrument (WFC3) and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) used for imaging of extragalactic Cepheids in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) hosts. The HST observations used the WFC3 spatial scanning mode to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors, reaching a mean photometric error of 5 millimags per observation. We use new Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, vastly improved since DR2, and the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation of these Cepheids to simultaneously calibrate the extragalactic distance ladder and to refine the determination of the Gaia EDR3 parallax offset. The resulting geometric calibration of Cepheid luminosities has 1.0% precision, better than any alternative geometric anchor. Applied to the calibration of SNe Ia, it results in a measurement of the Hubble constant of 73.0 ± 1.4 km s −1 Mpc −1 , in good agreement with conclusions based on earlier Gaia data releases. We also find the slope of the Cepheid P-L relation in the Milky Way, and the metallicity dependence of its zeropoint, to be in good agreement with the mean values derived from other galaxies. In combination with the best complementary sources of Cepheid calibration, we reach 1.8% precision and find H 0 =73.2 ± 1.3 km s −1 Mpc −1 , a 4.2$\sigma$ difference with the prediction from Planck CMB observations under $\Lambda$CDM. We expect to reach ∼ 1.3% precision in the near term from an expanded sample of ∼ 40 SNe Ia in Cepheid hosts.},

abstract = {The merger of two neutron stars produces an outflow of radioactive heavy nuclei. Within a second of merger, the central remnant is expected to also launch a relativistic jet, which shock-heats and disrupts a portion of the radioactive ejecta. Within a few hours, emission from the radioactive material gives rise to an ultraviolet, optical, and infrared transient (a kilonova). We use the endstates of a suite of 2D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of jet-ejecta interaction as initial conditions for multi-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations of the resulting viewing angle-dependent light curves and spectra starting at 1.5 h after merger. We find that on this timescale, jet shock heating does not affect the kilonova emission. However, the jet disruption to the density structure of the ejecta does change the light curves. The jet carves a channel into the otherwise spheroidal ejecta, revealing the hot, inner regions. As seen from near (30 •) the jet axis, the kilonova is brighter by a factor of a few and bluer. The strength of this effect depends on the jet parameters, since the light curves of more heavily disrupted ejecta are more strongly affected. The light curves and spectra are also more heavily modified in the ultraviolet than in the optical.},

We consider the explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf using the deflagration model with deflagration-detonation transition with spherical symmetry. The dark matter component is comparable in size with that of the normal matter, and so the system is described by two-fluid, one-dimensional Eulerian hydrodynamics. The explosion leaves all the dark matter trapped as a remnant compact dark star in all of our considered models. The presence of dark matter lengthens the deflagration phase to produce more thermo-neutrinos and similar amounts of iron-group elements compared to those of ordinary explosions with no dark matter admixture. The dark matter admixed models produce dimmer and broader light curves, which challenge the role of thermonuclear super-novae as standard candles in cosmic distance measurement. Our results also suggest a formation path of dark compact objects which mimic sub-solar-mass black holes as dark gravitational sources, through near-solar-mass dark matter admixed thermonuclear supernovae.},

abstract = {Gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) observations of neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers can provide precise local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), ideal for resolving the current H0 tension. We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated NSBHs, incorporating both GW and EM selection for the first time. We show that NSBHs could achieve unbiased 1.5-2.4% precision H0 estimates by 2030. The achievable precision is strongly affected by the details of spin precession and tidal disruption, highlighting the need for improved modeling of NSBH mergers. Introduction. The current expansion rate of the Universe-the Hubble constant, H 0-is at the heart of a significant cosmological controversy. Direct measurements in the local Universe by the SH0ES team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder [1] find H 0 = 74.03 ± 1.42 km s −1 Mpc −1. This is discrepant at the 4.4-$\sigma$ level from the 67.36 ± 0.54 km s −1 Mpc −1 value inferred from the Planck satellite's observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, assuming the standard flat cosmological model [2]. There are two potential explanations for this discrepancy , the most exciting of which derives from the model-dependence of the CMB constraint: could the discrepancy be due to physics beyond the standard model? Despite extensive effort (e.g., Refs. [3, 4]), consensus on a compelling theoretical explanation has not been reached. The more prosaic explanation posits undiagnosed systematic errors or underestimated uncertainties; however, despite multiple investigations of both the distance ladder [5] and CMB [6] datasets, no study has found incontrovertible evidence warranting a change of conclusions. In the absence of conclusive evidence of systematic errors or consensus on an extended model, independent ver-ifications of the two central measurements offer a promising route to resolving the tension. Independent verification of the CMB anisotropy constraints comes from recent inverse distance ladder datasets [7]. Local verification has, however, proven more challenging, with some alternative analyses supporting the SH0ES team's findings [8] and others providing contradictory conclusions of varying significance [9], in some cases using the same data. A direct, completely independent local measurement with percent-level precision is therefore needed to resolve the H 0 tension. Combined gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) observations of nearby compact-object mergers are ideal candidates to provide that mea},

abstract = {The analysis of current and future cosmological surveys of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high-redshift depends on the accurate photometric classification of the SN events detected. Generating realistic simulations of photometric SN surveys constitutes an essential step for training and testing photometric classification algorithms, and for correcting biases introduced by selection effects and contamination arising from core collapse SNe in the photometric SN Ia samples. We use published SN time-series spectrophotometric templates, rates, luminosity functions and empirical relationships between SNe and their host galaxies to construct a framework for simulating photometric SN surveys. We present this framework in the context of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year photometric SN sample, comparing our simulations of DES with the observed DES transient populations. We demonstrate excellent agreement in many distributions, including Hubble residuals, between our simulations and data. We estimate the core collapse fraction expected in the DES SN sample after selection requirements are applied and before photometric classification. After testing different modelling choices and astrophysical assumptions underlying our simulation, we find that the predicted contamination varies from 5.8 to 9.3 per cent, with an average of 7.0 per cent and r.m.s. of 1.1 per cent. Our simulations are the first to reproduce the observed photometric SN and host galaxy properties in high-redshift surveys without fine-tuning the input parameters. The simulation methods presented here will be a critical component of the cosmology analysis of the DES photometric SN Ia sample: correcting for biases arising from contamination, and evaluating the associated systematic uncertainty.},

abstract = {Much of the cosmological utility thus far extracted from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) relies on the assumption that SN Ia peak luminosities do not evolve significantly with the age (local or global) of their stellar environments. Two recent studies have provided conflicting results in evaluating the validity of this assumption, with one finding no correlation between Hubble residuals (HR) and stellar environment age, while the other claims a significant correlation. In this Letter we perform an independent reanalysis that rectifies issues with the statistical methods employed by both of the aforementioned studies. Our analysis follows a principled approach that properly accounts for regression dilution and critically (and unlike both prior studies) utilises the Bayesian-model-produced SN environment age estimates (posterior samples) instead of point estimates. Moreover, the posterior is used as an informative prior in the regression. We find the Pearson correlation between the HR and local (global) age to be in excess of 4{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ (3{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼). Assuming there exists a linear relationship between HR and local (global) age, we find a corresponding slope of −0.035±0.007 mag Gyr −1 (−0.036±0.007 mag Gyr −1). We encourage further usage of our approach to examine possible cosmological implications of the HR and age correlation.},

abstract = {We describe a homogeneous catalog compilation of common proper motion stars based on Gaia DR2. A preliminary list of all pairs of stars within the radius of 100 pc around the Sun with a separation less than a parsec was compiled. Also, a subset of comoving pairs, wide binary stars, was selected. The clusters and systems with multiplicity larger than 2 were excluded from consideration. The resulting catalog contains 10358 pairs of stars. The catalog selectivity function was estimated by comparison with a set of randomly selected field stars and with a model sample obtained by population synthesis. The estimates of the star masses in the catalogued objects, both components of which belong to the main-sequence, show an excess of "twins", composed by stars with similar masses. This excess decreases with increasing separation between components. It is shown that such an effect cannot be a consequence of the selectivity function only and does not appear in the model where star formation of similar masses is not artificially preferred.

abstract = {In the next decade, transient searches from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will increase the sample of known Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) from ∼10 3 to 10 5. With this reduction of statistical uncertainties on cosmological measurements, new methods are needed to reduce systematic uncertainties. Characterizing the underlying spectroscopic evolution of SN Ia remains a major systematic uncertainty in current cosmological analyses, motivating a new simulation tool for the next era of SN Ia cosmology: Build Your Own Spectral Energy Distribution (byosed). byosed is used within the SNANA framework to simulate light curves by applying spectral variations to model SEDs, enabling flexible testing of possible systematic shifts in SN Ia distance measurements. We test the framework by comparing a nominal Roman SN Ia survey simulation using a baseline SED model to simulations using SEDs perturbed with byosed, and investigate the impact of neglecting specific SED features in the analysis. These features include semi-empirical models of two possible, predicted relationships: between SN ejecta velocity and light curve observables, and a redshift-dependent relationship between SN Hubble residuals and host galaxy mass. We analyze each byosed simulation using the SALT2 & BBC framework, and estimate changes in the measured value of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w. We find a difference of ∆w = −0.023 for SN velocity and ∆w = 0.021 for redshift-evolving host mass when compared to simulations without these features. By using byosed for SN Ia cosmology simulations, future analyses (e.g., Rubin and Roman SN Ia samples) will have greater flexibility to constrain or reduce such SN Ia modeling uncertainties.},

abstract = {Understanding the nature of the first stars is key to understanding the early universe. With new facilities such as JWST we may soon have the first observations of the earliest stellar populations, but to understand these observations we require detailed theoretical models. Here we compute a grid of stellar evolution models using the Geneva code with the aim to improve our understanding of the evolution of zero-metallicity stars, with particular interest in how rotation affects surface properties, interior structure, and metal enrichment. We produce a range of models of initial masses (M ini) from 1.7 M to 120 M , focusing on massive models of 9 M M ini 120 M. Our grid includes models with and without rotation, with rotating models having an initial velocity of 40% of the critical velocity. We find that rotation strongly impacts the evolution of the first stars, mainly through increased core size and stronger H-burning shells during core He-burning. Without radiative mass loss, angular momentum builds at the surface in rotating models, thus models of initial masses M ini 60 M reach critical rotation on the main sequence and experience mass loss. We find that rotational mixing strongly affects metal enrichment, but does not always increase metal production as we see at higher metallicities. This is because rotation leads to an earlier CNO boost to the H shell during He-burning, which may hinder metal enrichment depending on initial mass and rotational velocity. Electronic tables of this new grid of Population III models are publicly available.},

We find that the results are influenced by the priors of mass ratio, and this candidate could also be from the merger of two low mass black holes (BH). In the case for a binary black hole (BBH) merger, the effective spin is likely negative and the effective precession spin is non-negligible. As for the NSBH merger, supposing the mass of the light object follow the distribution of current neutron stars (NSs) with a reasonably measured/constrained mass, the spin of the low mass BH is so small that is hard to generate bright electromagnetic emission.

Such a fast collision between individually rare massive clusters is unexpected in Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology at such high z. However, this is required for non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the merger to match its observed properties (Zhang et al. 2015). Here, we determine the probability of finding a similar object in a $\Lambda$CDM context using the Jubilee simulation box with side length 6 h −1 Gpc. We search for galaxy cluster pairs that have turned around from the cosmic expansion with properties similar to El Gordo in terms of total mass, mass ratio, redshift, and collision velocity relative to virial velocity. We fit the distribution of pair total mass quite accurately, with the fits used in two methods to infer the probability of observing El Gordo in the surveyed region. The more conservative (and detailed) method involves considering the expected distribution of pairwise mass and redshift for analogue pairs with similar dimensionless parameters to El Gordo in the past lightcone of a z = 0 observer. Detecting one pair with its mass and redshift rules out $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at 6.16$\sigma$. We also use the results of Kraljic & Sarkar (2015) to show that the Bullet Cluster is in 2.78$\sigma$ tension once the sky coverage of its discovery survey is accounted for. Using a $\chi$ 2 approach, the combined tension can be estimated as 6.43$\sigma$. Both collisions arise naturally in a Milgromian dynamics (MOND) cosmology with light sterile neutrinos.},

abstract = {The study of the intensity fluctuation power spectrum of individual supernova remnants (SNRs) can reveal the structures present at sub-pc scales, and also constrain the physical process that generates those structures. There are various effects, such as the remnant shell thickness, projection of a three-dimensional structure onto a two-dimensional observational plane, and the presence of diffuse "foreground" emission , which causes the observed power spectrum to deviate from the intrinsic power spectrum of the fluctuations. Here, we report results from a systematic study of these effects, using direct numerical simulations, in the measured power spectrum. For an input power-law power spectrum, independent of the power-law index, we see a break in the observed power law at a scale which depends on the shell thickness of a shell-type SNR, and the three-dimensional turbulence changes to two-dimensional turbulence beyond that scale. We also report how the estimated power spectrum is expected to deviate from the intrinsic SNR power spectrum in the presence of additional diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (DGSE) around the remnant shell. For a reasonable choice of the parameters, if the intrinsic SNR power spectrum is shallower than the DGSE power spectrum, the SNR contribution dominates at small angular scales of the estimated power spectra. On the other hand, if the SNR power spectrum is relatively steeper, the original power spectra is recovered only over a small window of angular scales. This study shows how detailed modeling may be used to infer the true power spectrum from the observed SNR intensity fluctuations power spectrum, which in turn can be used to constrain the nature of the turbulence that gives rise to these small scale structures.},

abstract = {Unburned carbon is potentially a powerful probe of Type Ia supernova (SN) explosion mechanisms. We present comprehensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) data on the "transitional" Type Ia SN 2015bp. An early NIR spectrum (t = −9.9 days with respect to B-band maximum) displays a striking C I $\lambda$1.0693 µm line at 11.9 × 10 3 km s −1 , distinct from the prominent Mg II $\lambda$1.0927 µm feature , which weakens toward maximum light. SN 2015bp also displays a clear C II $\lambda$6580{\AA}$\lambda$6580{\AA} notch early (t = −10.9 days) at 13.2 × 10 3 km s −1 , consistent with our NIR carbon detection. At M B = −18.46, SN 2015bp is less luminous than a normal SN Ia and, along with iPTF13ebh, is the second member of the transitional subclass to display prominent early-time NIR carbon absorption. We find it unlikely that the C I feature is misidentified He I $\lambda$1.0830 µm because this feature grows weaker toward maximum light, while the helium line produced in some double-detonation models grows stronger at these times. Intrigued by these strong NIR carbon detections, but lacking NIR data for other SNe Ia, we investigated the incidence of optical carbon in the sample of nine transitional SNe Ia with early-time data (t −4 days). We find that four display C II $\lambda$6580{\AA}$\lambda$6580{\AA}, while two others show tentative detections, in line with the SN Ia population as a whole. The common occurrence of carbon in the spectra of the faint transitional SN Ia subclass argues against a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion as their origin, despite recent theoretical work suggesting this must be the case. 2 Wyatt et al.},

abstract = {Observational evidence suggests that the majority of stars may have been born in stellar clusters or associations. Within these dense environments, dynamical interactions lead to high rates of close stellar encounters. A variety of recent observational and theoretical indications suggest stellar-mass black holes may be present and play an active dynamical role in stellar clusters of all masses. In this study, we explore the tidal disruption of main sequence stars by stellar-mass black holes in young star clusters. We compute a suite of over 3000 independent N-body simulations that cover a range in cluster mass, metallicity, and half-mass radii. We find stellar-mass black hole tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur at an overall rate of up to roughly 300 Gpc −3 yr −1 in young stellar clusters in the local universe, with the majority occurring through binary-mediated dynamical encounters. These TDEs are expected to have several characteristic features, namely fast rise times of order a day, peak X-ray luminosities of at least 10 44 erg s −1 , and bright optical luminosities (roughly 10 41 − 10 44 erg s −1) associated with reprocessing by a disk wind. In particular, we show these events share many features in common with the emerging class of Fast Blue Optical Transients.},

abstract = {We present TARDIS-an open-source code for rapid spectral modelling of supernovae (SNe). Our goal is to develop a tool that is sufficiently fast to allow exploration of the complex parameter spaces of models for SN ejecta. This can be used to analyse the growing number of high-quality SN spectra being obtained by transient surveys. The code uses Monte Carlo methods to obtain a self-consistent description of the plasma state and to compute a synthetic spectrum. It has a modular design to facilitate the implementation of a range of physical approximations that can be compared to assess both accuracy and computational expediency. This will allow users to choose a level of sophistication appropriate for their application. Here, we describe the operation of the code and make comparisons with alternative radiative transfer codes of differing levels of complexity (SYN++, PYTHON and ARTIS). We then explore the consequence of adopting simple prescriptions for the calculation of atomic excitation, focusing on four species of relevance to Type Ia SN spectra-Si II, S II, Mg II and Ca II. We also investigate the influence of three methods for treating line interactions on our synthetic spectra and the need for accurate radiative rate estimates in our scheme.},

abstract = {On 2018 February 4.41, the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) discovered ASASSN-18bt in the K2 Campaign 16 field. With a redshift of z=0.01098 and a peak apparent magnitude of B max =14.31, ASASSN-18bt is the nearest and brightest SNe Ia yet observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Here we present the discovery of ASASSN-18bt, the K2 light curve, and prediscovery data from ASAS-SN and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The K2 early-time light curve has an unprecedented 30-minute cadence and photometric precision for an SNIa light curve, and it unambiguously shows a ∼4 day nearly linear phase followed by a steeper rise. Thus, ASASSN-18bt joins a growing list of SNe Ia whose early light curves are not well described by a single power law. We show that a double-power-law model fits the data reasonably well, hinting that two physical processes must be responsible for the observed rise. However, we find that current models of the interaction with a nondegenerate companion predict an abrupt rise and cannot adequately explain the initial, slower linear phase. Instead, we find that existing published models with shallow 56 Ni are able to span the observed behavior and, with tuning, may be able to reproduce the ASASSN-18bt light curve. Regardless, more theoretical work is needed to satisfactorily model this and other early-time SNeIa light curves. Finally, we use Swift X-ray nondetections to constrain the presence of circumstellar material (CSM) at much larger distances and lower densities than possible with the optical light curve. For a constant-density CSM, these nondetections constrain $\rho$<4.5×10 5 cm −3 at a radius of 4×10 15 cm from the progenitor star. Assuming a wind-like environment, we place mass loss limits of M M 8 10 yr 6 1 < ´-˙ ☉ for v w =100 km s −1 , ruling out some symbiotic progenitor systems. This work highlights the power of well-sampled early-time data and the need for immediate multiband, high-cadence follow-up for progress in understanding SNeIa.},

abstract = {Received (month) (day), (year); accepted (month) (day), (year) ABSTRACT Context. Thermonuclear supernovae (SNe), a subset of which are the highly important SNe Type Ia, remain one of the more poorly understood phenomena known to modern astrophysics. In recent years, the single degenerate helium (He) donor channel, where a white dwarf star (WD) accretes He-rich matter from a hydrogen-depleted companion, has emerged as a promising candidate progenitor scenario for these events. An unresolved question in this scenario is the fate of the companion star, which would be evident as a runaway hot subdwarf (He sdO/B) in the aftermath of the SN event. Aims. Previous studies have shown that the kinematic properties of an ejected companion provide an opportunity to closer examination of the properties of an SN progenitor system. However, with the number of observed objects not matching predictions by theory, the viability of this mechanism is called into question. In this study, we first synthesize a population of companion stars ejected by the aforementioned mechanism, taking into account predicted ejection velocities, inferred population density in the Galactic (Gal.) mass distribution and subsequent kinematics in the Gal. potential. We then discuss the astrometric properties of this population. Methods. We present 10 6 individual ejection trajectories, numerically computed with a newly developed, lightweight simulation framework. Initial conditions are randomly generated, but weighted according to Gal. mass density and ejection velocity data. We then discuss the bulk properties (Gal. distribution and observational parameters) of our sample. Results. Our synthetic population reflects the Gal. mass distribution. A peak in the density distribution for close objects is expected in the direction of the Gal. center. Higher mass runaways should outnumber lower mass ones. If the entire considered mass range is realized, the radial velocity distribution should show a peak at 500 km s −1. If only close US 708 analogues are considered, there should be a peak at (∼ 750 − 850) km s −1. In either case, US 708 should be a member of the high-velocity tail of the distribution. Conclusions. We show that the puzzling lack of confirmed surviving companion stars of thermonuclear SNe, though possibly an observation-related selection effect, may indicate a selection against high mass donors in the SD He donor channel.},

abstract = {The delay time distribution (DTD) of Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the rate of SNe Ia, as a function of time, that explode in a hypothetical stellar population of unit mass, formed in a brief burst at time t = 0, and is important for understanding chemical evolution, SN Ia progenitors, and SN Ia physics. Past estimates of the DTD in galaxy clusters have been deduced from SN Ia rates measured in cluster samples observed at various redshifts, corresponding to different time intervals after a presumed initial brief burst of star formation. Recently, Friedmann and Maoz analysed a cluster sample at z = 1.13 − 1.75 and confirmed indications from previous studies of lower-redshift clusters, that the DTD has a power-law form whose normalisation is at least several times higher than measured in field-galaxy environments , implying that SNe Ia are produced in larger numbers by the stellar populations in clusters. This conclusion, however, could have been affected by the implicit assumption that the stars were formed in a single brief starburst at high z. Here, we re-derive the DTD from the cluster SN Ia data, but now relax the single-burst assumption. Instead, we allow for a range of star-formation histories and dust extinctions for each cluster. Via MCMC modeling, we simultaneously fit, using stellar population synthesis models and DTD models, the integrated galaxy-light photometry in several bands and the SN Ia numbers discovered in each cluster. With these more-realistic assumptions, we find a best-fit DTD with power-law index $\alpha$ = −1.09 +0.15 −0.12 , and amplitude, at delay t = 1 Gyr, R 1 = 0.41 +0.12 −0.10 × 10 −12 yr −1 M −1 (or, equivalently to the amplitude, a Hubble-time-integrated number of SNe Ia per unit formed stellar mass of N/M = 3.1 +1.1 −1.0 × 10 −3 M −1). The derived cluster-environment DTD remains higher (at 3.8$\sigma$ significance) than the field-galaxy DTD, by a factor ∼ 2 − 3. Cluster and field DTDs both have consistent slopes of $\alpha$ ≈ −1.1.},

abstract = {The nature of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains a mystery. Binary systems consisting of a white dwarf (WD) and a main-sequence (MS) donor are potential progenitors of SNe Ia, in which a thermonuclear explosion of the WD may occur when its mass reaches the Chandrasekhar limit during accretion of material from a companion star. In the present work, we address theoretical rates and delay times of a specific MS donor channel to SNe Ia, in which a helium (He) star + MS binary produced from a common envelope event subsequently forms a WD + MS system without the He star undergoing mass transfer by Roche lobe overflow. By combining the results of self-consistent binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models, we find that the contribution of SNe Ia in this channel is around 2.0 × 10 −4 yr −1. In addition, we find that delay times of SNe Ia in this channel cover a range of about 1.0-2.6 Gyr, and almost all SNe Ia produced in this way (about 97 %) have a delay time of 1 Gyr. While the rate of SN Ia in this work is about 10% of the overall SN Ia rate, the channel represents a possible contribution to the old population (1-3 Gyr) of observed SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are the inevitable fate of most massive stars. Since most stars form in groups, SN progenitors can be constrained with information of their environments. It remains challenging to accurately analyse the various components in the environment and to correctly identify their relationships with the SN progenitors. Using a combined dataset of VLT/MUSE spatially-resolved integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy and HST/ACS+WFC3 high-spatial resolution imaging, we present a detailed investigation of the environment of the Type II-P SN 2004dg and Type IIb SN 2012P. The two SNe occurred in a spiral arm of NGC 5806, where a star-forming complex is apparent with a giant H region. By modelling the ionised gas, a compact star cluster and the resolved stars, we derive the ages and extinctions of stellar populations in the vicinity of the SNe. The various components are consistent with a sequence of triggered star formation as the spiral density wave swept through their positions. For SNe 2004dg and 2012P, we identify their host stellar populations and derive initial masses of 10.0 +0.3 −0.2 {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± and 15.2 +2.0 −1.0 {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± for their progenitors, respectively. Both results are consistent with those from pre-explosion images or nebular-phase spectroscopy. SN 2012P is spatially coincident but less likely to be coeval with the star-forming complex. As in this case, star formation bursts on small scales may appear correlated if they are controlled by any physical processes on larger scales; this may lead to a high probability of chance alignment between older SN progenitors and younger stellar populations.},

abstract = {Low frequency radio wave scattering and refraction can have a dramatic effect on the observed size and position of radio sources in the solar corona. The scattering and refraction is thought to be due to fluctuations in electron density caused by turbulence. Hence, determining the true radio source size can provide information on the turbulence in coronal plasma. However, the lack of high spatial resolution radio interferometric observations at low frequencies, such as with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), has made it difficult to determine the true radio source size and level of radio wave scattering. Here we directly fit the visibilities of a LOFAR observation of a Type IIIb radio burst with an elliptical Gaussian to determine its source size and position. This circumvents the need to image the source and then de-convolve LOFAR's point spread function, which can introduce spurious effects to the source size and shape. For a burst at 34.76 MHz, we find full width at half maximum (FWHM) heights along the major and minor axes to be 18.8 ± 0.1 and 10.2 ± 0.1 , respectively, at a plane of sky heliocentric distance of 1.75 R. Our results suggest that the level of density fluctuations in the solar corona is the main cause of the scattering of radio waves, resulting in large source sizes. However, the magnitude of $\epsilon$ may be smaller than what has been previously derived in observations of radio wave scattering in tied-array images.},

abstract = {Upcoming high-cadence transient survey programmes will produce a wealth of observational data for Type Ia supernovae. These data sets will contain numerous events detected very early in their evolution, shortly after explosion. Here, we present synthetic light curves, calculated with the radiation hydrodynamical approach STELLA for a number of different explosion models, specifically focusing on these first few days after explosion. We show that overall the early light curve evolution is similar for most of the investigated models. Characteristic imprints are induced by radioactive material located close to the surface. However, these are very similar to the signatures expected from ejecta-CSM or ejecta-companion interaction. Apart from the pure deflagration explosion models, none of our synthetic light curves exhibit the commonly assumed power-law rise. We demonstrate that this can lead to substantial errors in the determination of the time of explosion. In summary, we illustrate with our calculations that even with very early data an identification of specific explosion scenarios is challenging, if only photometric observations are available.},

abstract = {The detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) has emerged as one of the most promising Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor scenarios. Recent studies have suggested that the rapid transfer of a very small amount of helium from one WD to another is sufficient to ignite a helium shell detonation that subsequently triggers a carbon core detonation, yielding a "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" SN Ia. Because the helium shell that surrounds the core explosion is so minimal, this scenario approaches the limiting case of a bare C/O WD detonation. Motivated by discrepancies in previous literature and by a recent need for detailed nucleosynthetic data, we revisit simulations of naked C/O WD detonations in this paper. We disagree to some extent with the nucleosynthetic results of previous work on sub-Chandrasekhar-mass bare C/O WD detonations; for example, we find that a median-brightness SN Ia is produced by the detonation of a 1.0 ☉ M WD instead of a more massive and rarer 1.1 ☉ M WD. The neutron-rich nucleosynthesis in our simulations agrees broadly with some observational constraints, although tensions remain with others. There are also discrepancies related to the velocities of the outer ejecta and light curve shapes, but overall our synthetic light curves and spectra are roughly consistent with observations. We are hopeful that future multidimensional simulations will resolve these issues and further bolster the dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation scenario's potential to explain most SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2017cbv in NGC 5643 is one of a handful of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) reported to have excess blue emission at early times. This paper presents extensive BV RIY JHK s-band light curves of SN 2017cbv, covering the phase from −16 to +125 days relative to B-band maximum light. SN 2017cbv reached a B-band maximum of 11.710±0.006 mag, with a post-maximum magnitude decline ∆m 15 (B)=0.990±0.013 mag. The supernova suffered no host reddening based on Phillips intrinsic color, Lira-Phillips relation, and the CMAGIC diagram. By employing the CMAGIC distance modulus µ = 30.58 ± 0.05 mag and assuming H 0 = 72 km s −1 Mpc −1 , we found that 0.73 M ⊙ 56 Ni was synthesized during the explosion of SN 2017cbv, which is consistent with estimates using reddening-free and distance-free methods via the phases of the secondary maximum of the NIR-band light curves. We also present 14 near-infrared spectra from −18 to +49 days relative to the B-band maximum light, providing constraints on the amount of swept-up hydrogen from the companion star in the context of the single degenerate progenitor scenario. No P a$\beta$ emission feature was detected from our post-maximum NIR spectra, placing a hydrogen mass upper limit of 0.1 M ⊙. The overall optical/NIR photometric and NIR spectral evolution of SN 2017cbv is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, even though its early evolution is marked by a flux excess no seen in most other well-observed normal SNe Ia. We also compare the exquisite light curves of SN 2017cbv with some M ch DDT models and sub-M ch double detonation models.},

It is supposed that there exists a dark sector which is mirror of the ordinary matter. Some MDM models allow particle interactions mirror and ordinary matter, in addition to the grav-itational interaction. The possibility of neutron to mirror neutron transition has recently been discussed both from theoretical and experimental perspectives. This paper is based on a previous work in which we obtained stringent upper limits on the possibility of converting neutrons to mirror neutrons in the interiors of neutron stars, by using timing data of binary pulsars. Such a transition would imply mass loss in neutron stars leading to a significant change of orbital period of neutron star binary systems. The observational bounds on the period changes of such binaries, therefore put strong limits on the above transition rate and hence on the neutron-mirror-neutron mixing parameter ǫ ′. Our limits are much stronger than the values required to explain the neutron decay anomaly via n − n ′ mixing.},

We analyze five CC SNe for which we obtained N U V measurements before the first ground-based R-band detection. We introduce SOPRANOS, a new maximum likelihood fitting tool for models with variable temporal validity windows, and use it to fit the Sapir & Waxman (2017) shock cooling model to the data. We report four Type II SNe with progenitor radii in the range of R * ≈ 600 − 1100R ⊙ and a shock velocity parameter in the range of v s * ≈ 2700 − 6000 km s −1 (E/M ≈ 2 − 8 × 10 50 erg/M ⊙) and one type IIb SN with R * ≈ 210R ⊙ and v s * ≈ 11000 km s −1 (E/M ≈ 1.8 × 10 51 erg/M ⊙). Our pilot GALEX/PTF project thus suggests that a dedicated, systematic SN survey in the N U V band, such as the wide-field UV explorer ULTRASAT mission, is a compelling method to study the properties of SN progenitors and SN energetics.},

We characterize the SN lightcurves near the peak using a two-parameter model, with t pk being the time to rise to a peak and L pk the spectral luminosity at that peak. Over all SNe in our sample at D < 100 Mpc, we find that t pk = 10 1.7±0.9 d, and that L pk = 10 25.5±1.6 erg s −1 Hz −1 , and therefore that generally, 50% of SNe will have L pk < 10 25.5 erg s −1 Hz −1. These L pk values are ∼30 times lower than those for only detected SNe. Types I b/c and II (excluding IIn's) have similar mean values of L pk but the former have a wider range, whereas Type IIn SNe have ∼ 10 times higher values with L pk =10 26.5±1.1 erg s −1 Hz −1.

The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their discovery by routine survey operations. They show a general trend of slow luminosity rise lasting at least a few months. The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in photometry and spectroscopy. The light curves present an initial short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT 2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at ∼ 7 × 10 40 erg s −1 , while AT 2020hat is almost one order of magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although still more luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy with other LRNe, the spectra of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble those of Type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become similar to those of K-type stars during the plateau, and to M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat shows a redder continuum already at early epochs, and its spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A moderate-resolution spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals with velocities of 180 km s −1 , along with an H$\alpha$ emission with a full-width at half-maximum velocity of 250 km s −1. For AT 2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is provided by archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with an absolute magnitude M F606W = −3.33 ± 0.09 mag and a colour F606W − F814W = 1.14 ± 0.05 mag, which are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that could later produce a core-collapse supernova. Although quite peculiar, the two objects well match the progenitor vs. light curve absolute magnitude correlations discussed in the literature.},

abstract = {We present the follow-up campaign of the luminous red nova (LRN) AT 2019zhd, the third event of this class observed in M 31. The object was followed by several sky surveys for about five months before the outburst, during which it showed a slow luminosity rise. In this phase, the absolute magnitude ranged from M r = −2.8 ± 0.2 mag to M r = −5.6 ± 0.1 mag. Then, over a four-five day period, AT 2019zhd experienced a major brightening, reaching at peak M r = −9.61 ± 0.08 mag, and an optical luminosity of 1.4 × 10 39 erg s −1. After a fast decline, the light curve settled onto a short-duration plateau in the red bands. Although less pronounced, this feature is reminiscent of the second red maximum observed in other LRNe. This phase was followed by a rapid linear decline in all bands. At maximum, the spectra show a blue continuum with prominent Balmer emission lines. The post-maximum spectra show a much redder continuum, resembling that of an intermediate-type star. In this phase, H$\alpha$ becomes very weak, H$\beta$ is no longer detectable and a forest of narrow absorption metal lines now dominate the spectrum. The latest spectra, obtained during the post-plateau decline, show a very red continuum (T e f f ≈ 3000 K) with broad molecular bands of TiO, similar to those of M-type stars. The long-lasting, slow photometric rise observed before the peak resembles that of LRN V1309 Sco, which was interpreted as the signature of the common-envelope ejection. The subsequent outburst is likely due to the gas outflow following a stellar merging event. The inspection of archival HST images taken 22 years before the LRN discovery reveals a faint red source (M F555W = 0.21 ± 0.14 mag, with F555W − F814W = 2.96 ± 0.12 mag) at the position of AT 2019zhd, which is the most likely quiescent precursor.

The object shows a faint (M r = −15 mag) and very long (∼130 days) plateau, followed by a 2.7 mag drop in the r-band to the radioactive tail. The first spectrum shows a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines, while during the plateau the spectra show numerous metal lines, all with strong and narrow P-Cygni profiles. The expansion velocities are low, in the 1000-1400 km s −1 range. The nebular spectrum, dominated by H$\alpha$ in emission, reveals weak emission from [O I] and [Ca II] doublets. The absolute light curve and spectra at different phases are similar to those of low-luminosity SNe IIP. We estimate that 0.002 M of 56 Ni mass were ejected, through hydrodynamical simulations. The best fit of the model to the observed data is found for an extremely low explosion energy of 0.055 foe, a progenitor radius of 215 R and a final progenitor mass of 9-10 M. Finally, we performed a modeling of the nebular spectrum, to establish the amount of oxygen and calcium ejected. We found a low M(16 O)≈ 0.02 M , but a high M(40 Ca) of 0.3 M. The inferred low explosion energy, the low ejected 56 Ni mass and the progenitor parameters, along with peculiar features observed in the nebular spectrum, are consistent with both an electron-capture SN explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch star and with a low-energy, Ni-poor iron core-collapse SN from a 10-12 M red supergiant.},

We focus on the iron peak elements Mn, Zn and Cu. To this end, we also briefly review the different burning regimes and production sites of these elements as well as the results of abundance measurements and several galactic chemical evolution studies. We find that super-solar values of [Mn/Fe] are not restricted to Chandrasekhar mass explosion models. Scenarios including a helium detonation can significantly contribute to the production of Mn, in particular the models proposed for calcium-rich transients. Although Type Ia supernovae are often not accounted for as production sites of Zn and Cu, our models involving helium shell detonations can produce these elements in super-solar ratios relative to Fe. Our results suggest a reconsideration of Type Ia supernova yields in galactic chemical evolution models.

abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011fe, taken on 10 epochs from −13.1 to +40.8 d relative to B-band maximum light, and spanning the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (IR) are presented. This spectroscopic coverage makes SN 2011fe the best-studied local SN Ia to date. SN 2011fe is a typical moderately luminous SN Ia with no evidence for dust extinction. Its near-UV spectral properties are representative of a larger sample of local events (Maguire et al.). The near-UV to optical spectra of SN 2011fe are modelled with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code using the technique of 'abundance tomography', constraining the density structure and the abundance stratification in the SN ejecta. SN 2011fe was a relatively weak explosion, with moderate Fe-group yields. The density structures of the classical model W7 and of a delayed detonation model were tested. Both have shortcomings. An ad hoc density distribution was developed which yields improved fits and is characterized by a high-velocity tail, which is absent in W7. However, this tail contains less mass than delayed detonation models. This improved model has a lower energy than one-dimensional explosion models matching typical SNe Ia (e.g. W7, WDD1; Iwamoto et al.). The derived Fe abundance in the outermost layer is consistent with the metallicity at the SN explosion site in M101 (∼0.5 Z). The spectroscopic rise-time (∼19 d) is significantly longer than that measured from the early optical light curve, implying a 'dark phase' of ∼1 d. A longer rise-time has significant implications when deducing the properties of the white dwarf and binary system from the early photometric behaviour. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remain a well-exploited cosmological probe and an immediate route to understanding the nature of dark C},

abstract = {Supernovae of Type I are deprived of hydrogen and rich in heavy elements, and share the same physics of light curve and spectrum formation: continuum processes are unimportant compared to line-blocking, especially in the UV. An analysis of their spectra and light curves yields insights into the explosion mechanism. SNe Ia, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting mass to reach the Chandrasekhar limit, have homogeneous properties and are used as standardized candles, but the reason for this is only now beginning to emerge. SNe Ib and Ic result from the explosion following the core collapse of massive stars that had lost their outer envelope. SNe Ib are rich in He, while SNe Ic are not, suggesting that they are caused by the collapse of bare CO cores. SNe Ic show a wide range of properties. The most massive and energetic SNe Ic are linked to Gamma Ray Bursts. Additionally, signatures of strong asphericities can be deduced from their late-time spectra and from polarisation. Such asphericities may be common to all core-collapse SNe. The exact nature of the progenitors of these SNe remains unclear.},

abstract = {While Type Ia supernovae are widely used as distance indicators, the reasons for the correlation between luminosity and light curve width that allows SNe Ia to be calibratable standard candles is not yet fully understood, and in particular the details of the explosion mechanism are still the subject of heated debate. We present the results of a systematic approach that uses the high-quality data collected by the European Research Training Network "The Physics of Type Ia Supernova Explosions" to map the supernova ejecta and to infer the properties of the explosion. The distribution of the elements in the outer layers of the ejecta of a (Type Ia) su-pernova can be derived by modelling a closely spaced time series of spectra, while the nebular spectra give information about the inner ejecta (Stehle et al. 2005). Results for SN 2002bo show that the composition stratification that is imprinted at the time of the explosion is largely preserved. Using the abundance distribution obtained as above, and assuming that all NSE elements contribute equally to the opacity while only radioactive nickel contributes to the radiative output, the light curve of SN 2002bo can be reproduced very accurately. Examining the spectra of a large sample of SNe Ia, we find that the outer extent of the burning, as indicated by the velocity of the strong Si ii 6355{\AA}6355{\AA} line, is approximately the same in all SNe Ia, regardless of their luminosity. We confirm that the amount and distribution of 56 Ni is proportional to the luminosity of the SN, and find that SNe Ia produce a roughly constant amount of stable NSE isotopes. We show that the sum of all NSE elements gives a better correlation with the width of the light curve. These results suggest that the kinetic energy of all SNe Ia is similar, and that the mass of the progenitor white dwarf is constant, which supports the single degenerate scenario. A variation in the ratio of stable versus unstable NSE species can generate a dispersion about the mean brightness-decline rate relation. Such a variation may be the consequence of different progenitor metallicities. A systematic evolution of the metallicity of SN Ia progenitors may cause a redshift-dependent shift of SNe in the brightness-decline rate plane which may to a certain extent mimic the accelerated expansion of the Universe.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars composed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. However, the physics of the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of a large sample of well-observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical scenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in all supernovae, having an expansion velocity of ∼11,000 kilometers per second and corresponding to a mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae considered here burned similar masses and suggests that their progenitors had the same mass. Synthetic light-curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {Evidence of high-velocity features (HVFs) such as those seen in the near-maximum spectra of some Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; e.g., SN 2000cx) has been searched for in the available SN Ia spectra observed earlier than 1 week before B maximum. Recent observational efforts have doubled the number of SNe Ia with very early spectra. Remarkably, all SNe Ia with early data (seven in our Research Training Network sample and 10 from other programs) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in Ca ii IR and some also in the Si ii l6355 line. HVFs may be interpreted as abundance or density enhancements. Abundance enhancements would imply an outer region dominated by Si and Ca. Density enhancements may result from the sweeping up of circumstellar material (CSM) by the highest velocity SN ejecta. In this scenario, the high incidence of HVFs suggests that a thick disk and/or a high-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be the case in single degenerate systems. Large-scale angular fluctuations in the radial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this could originate in the explosion and would suggest a deflagration as the more likely explosion mechanism. CSM interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist, possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. In some SNe, the HVFs are narrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burned material.},

abstract = {The use of Type Ia supernovae as distance indicators relies on the determination of their brightness. This is not constant, but it can be calibrated using an observed relation between the brightness and the properties of the optical light curve (decline rate, width, shape), which indicates that brighter SNe have broader, slower light curves. However, the physical basis for this relation is not yet fully understood. Among possible causes are di †erent masses of the progenitor white dwarfs or di †erent opacities in Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We parameterize Chandrasekhar-mass models, which synthesize di †er-ent amounts of 56Ni, and compute bolometric light curves and spectra at various epochs. Since opacity in SNe Ia is mostly a result of spectral lines, it should depend on the mass of Fe-peak elements synthesized in the explosion, and on the temperature in the ejecta. Bolometric light curves computed using these prescriptions for the optical opacity reproduce the relation between brightness and decline rate. Furthermore, when spectra are calculated, the change in color between maximum and 2 weeks later allows the observed relation between and to be reproduced quite nicely.

abstract = {We present an analysis of the Band V-band rise-time distributions of nearby Type Ia su-pernovae (SNe Ia). Drawing mostly from the recently published Lick Observatory Supernova Search sample of SNe Ia , together with other published nearby SNe Ia with data starting at least 1 week before maximum light, we use a two-stretch template-fitting method to measure the rise and decline of BV light curves. Our analysis of 61 SNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between explosion and maximum light (i.e. the rise time), the slower the decline of the light curve after maximum. However, SNe with slower post-maximum decline rates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter family of light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a single-parameter family of varying widths. Comparison of the B-band rise-time distribution for spectroscopically normal SNe Ia to those exhibiting high-velocity (HV) spectral features indicates that HV SNe Ia have shorter B-band rise times compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. After normalizing the B-band light curves to m 15 (B) = 1.1 mag (i.e. correcting the post-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find that spectroscopically normal SNe Ia have a rise time of 18.03 ± 0.24 d, while HV SNe have a faster B-band rise time of 16.63 ± 0.29 d. Despite differences in the B band, we find that HV and normal SNe Ia have similar rise times in the V band. Furthermore, the initial rise of a SN Ia B-band light curve follows a power law with index 2.20 +0.27 −0.19 , consistent with a parabolic rise in flux predicted by an expanding fireball toy model. We compare our early-time B-band data to models for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from the single-degenerate progenitor scenario. There is a substantial degree of degeneracy between the adopted power-law index of the SN light-curve template, the rise time and the amount of shock emission required to match the data.},

abstract = {We study a sample of 16 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) having both spectroscopic and photometric observations within 2 $-$ 3 days after the first light. The early $B-V$ colors of such a sample tends to show a continuous distribution. For objects with normal ejecta velocity (NV), the C$\sim$II $\lambda$6580 feature is always visible in the early spectra while it is absent or very weak in the high-velocity (HV) counterpart. Moreover, the velocities of the detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Ca$\sim$II NIR triplet (CaIR3) above the photosphere are found to be much higher in HV objects than in NV objects, with typical values exceeding 30,000 km$\sim$s$^{-1}$ at 2 $-$ 3 days. We further analyze the relation between %velocities of Si$\sim$II$\sim$$\lambda$6355 at maximum, $v_{\rm Si,max}$, the velocity shift of late-time [Fe$\sim$II] lines ($v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$) and host galaxy mass. We find that all HV objects have redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ while NV objects have both blue- and redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$. It is interesting to point out that the objects with redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ are all located in massive galaxies, implying that HV and a portion of NV objects may have similar progenitor metallicities and explosion mechanisms. We propose that, with a geometric/projected effect, the He-detonation model may account for the similarity in birthplace environment and the differences seen in some SNe Ia, including $B-V$ colors, C$\sim$II feature, CaIR3 HVFs at early time and $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ in the nebular phase. Nevertheless, some features predicted by He-detonation simulation, such as the rapidly decreasing light curve, deviate from the observations, and some NV objects with blueshifted nebular $v_{\rm [Fe\simII]}$ may involve other explosion mechanisms.},

Binary systems consisting of a white dwarf (WD) and a main-sequence (MS) donor are potential progenitors of SNe Ia, in which a thermonuclear explosion of the WD may occur when its mass reaches the Chandrasekhar limit during accretion of material from a companion star. In the present work, we address theoretical rates and delay times of a specific MS donor channel to SNe Ia, in which a helium (He) star + MS binary produced from a common envelope event subsequently forms a WD + MS system without the He star undergoing mass transfer by Roche lobe overflow. By combining the results of self-consistent binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models, we find that the contribution of SNe Ia in this channel is around 2.0 × 10 −4 yr −1. In addition, we find that delay times of SNe Ia in this channel cover a range of about 1.0-2.6 Gyr, and almost all SNe Ia produced in this way (about 97 %) have a delay time of 1 Gyr. While the rate of SN Ia in this work is about 10% of the overall SN Ia rate, the channel represents a possible contribution to the old population (1-3 Gyr) of observed SNe Ia.},

We test the use of supervised ML to classify blazars according to its synchrotron peak energy, either lower or higher than 1015Hz. We select a blazar sample with 4178 objects labelled as 1279 high synchrotron peak sources (HSP: $\nu$-peak > 1015Hz) and 2899 low synchrotron peak sources (LSP: $\nu$-peak < 1015Hz). A set of multifrequency input features were defined to represent each source, that includes spectral slopes ($\alpha$$\nu$1,$\nu$2) between the radio, infra-red, optical, and X-ray bands, also considering IR colours. We describe the optimisation of five ML algorithms: Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and the Ludwig auto-ML framework, and report on accurate models for blazar classification into LSP and HSP. In our particular case, the SVM algorithm had the best performance, reaching 93% of balanced-accuracy. A joint-feature permutation test revealed that the spectral slopes alpha-radio-IR and alpha-radio-optical are the most relevant for the ML modelling, followed by the IR colours. This work shows that ML algorithms can distinguish multifrequency spectral characteristics and handle the classification task of blazars into LSPs and HSPs, and is a hint for the potential use of ML algorithms for the autonomous determination of broadband spectral parameters (as the synchrotron $\nu$-peak), or even to search for new blazars in all-sky databases.},

abstract = {We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the ∼3 j detection of a "Hubble bubble"-a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation (b) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favor a Hubble bubble. We find that SN data give , instead of the one would expect from purely Milky Way-like dust. This b 2 b 4 suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology.},

abstract = {A group of superluminous supernovae characterized by broad light curves have been suggested to be pair instability SNe (PISNe). Nebular spectra computed using PISN models have failed to reproduce the broad emission lines observed in these SNe, casting doubts on their true nature. Here, models of both PISNe and the explosion following the collapse of the core of a very massive star (100 M) are used to compute nebular spectra, which are compared to the spectrum of the prototypical PISN candidate, SN 2007bi. PISN models are confirmed to produce synthetic spectra showing narrow emission lines, resulting from the confinement of 56 Ni to the lowest velocities (∼ < 2000 km s −1) and in clear disagreement with the spectrum of SN 2007bi. Spectra more closely resembling SN 2007bi are obtained if the PISN models are fully mixed in abundance. Massive core-collapse models produce enough 56 Ni to power the light curve of PISN candidates, but their spectra are also not adequate. The nebular spectrum of SN 2007bi can be successfully reproduced if the inner region is artificially filled with oxygen-rich, low-velocity ejecta. This most likely requires a grossly aspherical explosion. A major difference between PISN and massive collapse models is that the former emit much more strongly in the NIR. It is concluded that: (a) current PISN candidates, in particular SN 2007bi, are more likely the result of the collapse and explosion of massive stars below the PI limit; (b) significant asymmetry is required to reproduce the late-time spectrum of SN 2007bi.},

abstract = {A characteristic feature that is frequently met in nearby supernova remnants (SNRs) is the existence of two antisymmetric, local protrusions that are projected as two "ears" in the morphology of the nebula. In this work, we present a novel scenario for the "ear" formation process according to which the two lobes are formed through the interaction of the SNR with a bipolar circumstellar medium (CSM) that was surrounding the explosion center. We conduct two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and we show that the SNR shock breakout from the bipolar CSM triggers the inflation of two opposite protrusions at the equator of the remnant that retain their size and shape for several hundreds up to a few thousand years of the SNR evolution. We run a set of models by varying the supernova (SN) and CSM properties and we demonstrate that the extracted results reveal a good agreement with the observables, regarding the "ears" sizes, lifespan, morphology and kinematics. We discuss the plausibility of our model in nature and we suggest that the most likely progenitors of the "ear-carrying" SNRs are the Luminous Blue Variables or the Red/Yellow Supergiants for the SNRs resulted by core collapse SN events and the symbiotic binaries or the planetary nebulae for the remnants formed by Type Ia SNe. Finally, we compare our model with other "ear" formation models of the literature and we show that there are distinctive differences among them, concerning the "ears" orientation and the phase in which the "ear" formation process occurs.},

Examples are the gamma-ray lines from SN 2014J as measured by INTEGRAL/SPI, and morphology information from radioactive isotopes in older remnants such as Tycho. A systematic study on the effects of parameters such as ignition geometry and burning morphology in SNe Ia is still missing. We use a 2D hydrodynamics code with post-processing nucleosynthesis and simulate the double detonations in a sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf starting from the nuclear runaway in the accumulated He envelope towards disruption of the white dwarf. We explore potential variety through four triggering scenarios that sample main asymmetry drivers. We further investigate their global effects on the aspherical structure of the ejecta based on individual elements. We apply the results to the well observed SN 2014J and other recently observed SN remnants in order to illustrate how these new observational data together with other observed quantities help to constrain the explosion and the progenitors of SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) explosions are a major feedback mechanism regulating star formation in galaxies through their momentum input. We review the observations of SNRs in radiative stages in the Milky Way to validate the theoretical results on the momentum/energy injection from a single SN explosion. For seven SNRs where we can observe fast-expanding, atomic radiative shells, we show that the shell momentum inferred from Hi 21 cm line observations is in the range of (0.5-4.5)×10 5 M km s −1. In two SNRs (W44 and IC 443), shocked molecular gas with momentum comparable to that of the atomic SNR shells has been also observed. We compare the momentum and kinetic/thermal energy of these seven SNRs with the results from 1D and 3D numerical simulations. The observation-based momentum and kinetic energy agree well with the expected momentum/energy input from an SN explosion of ∼ 10 51 erg. It is much more difficult to use data/model comparisons of thermal energy to constrain the initial explosion energy, however, due to rapid cooling and complex physics at the hot/cool interface in radiative SNRs. We discuss the observational and theoretical uncertainties of these global parameters and explosion energy estimates for SNRs in complex environments.},

abstract = {The processes that shape the extended atmospheres of red supergiants, heat their chromospheres, create molecular reservoirs, drive mass loss, and create dust remain poorly understood. Betelgeuse's V-band "Great Dimming" event of 2019 September /2020 February and its subsequent rapid brightening provides a rare opportunity to study these phenomena. Two different explanations have emerged to explain the dimming ; new dust appeared in our line of sight attenuating the photospheric light, or a large portion of the photosphere had cooled. Here we present five years of Wing three-filter (A, B, and C band) TiO and near-IR photometry obtained at the Wasatonic Observatory. These reveal that parts of the photosphere had a mean effective temperature (T eff) significantly lower than that found by Levesque & Massey (2020). Synthetic photometry from MARCS-model photospheres and spectra reveal that the V band, TiO index, and C-band photometry, and previously reported 4000-6800{\AA}6800{\AA} spectra can be quantitatively reproduced if there are multiple photospheric components, as hinted at by Very Large Telescope (VLT)-SPHERE images Montarg{\`{e}}s et al. (2020). If the cooler component has ∆T eff ≥ 250 K cooler than 3650 K, then no new dust is required 2 Harper et al. to explain the available empirical constraints. A coincidence of the dominant short-(∼ 430 day) and long-period (∼ 5.8 yr) V-band variations occurred near the time of deep minimum (Guinan et al. 2019a). This is in tandem with the strong correlation of V mag and photospheric radial velocities, recently reported by Dupree et al. (2020b). These suggest that the cooling of a large fraction of the visible star has a dynamic origin related to the photospheric motions, perhaps arising from pulsation or large-scale convective motions.},

abstract = {We analyze the rise and fall times of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. From a set of 391 light curves k-corrected to the rest-frame B and V bands, we find a smaller dispersion in the rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. This is in qualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in radioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the decline rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest that a single "stretch" correction to the light curve phase does not properly model the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset of 105 light curves well observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and develop a "2-stretch" fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times independently. We find the average time from explosion to B-band peak brightness is 17.38 ± 0.17 days, but with a spread of rise times which range from 13 days to 23 days. Our average rise time is shorter than the 19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different light curve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. The SDSS-II supernova set and the local SNe Ia with well-observed early light curves show no significant differences in their average rise-time properties. We find that slow-declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that the distribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single peaked. This distribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was first suggested by Strovink from an analysis of a small set of local SNe Ia. We divide the SDSS-II sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, t r − t f 2 days and t r − t f > 2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxy properties and Hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxy properties or Hubble residuals in our sample.},

abstract = {The progenitor channel responsible for the majority of Type Ia supernovae is still uncertain. One emergent scenario involves the detonation of a He-rich layer surrounding a C/O white dwarf, which sends a shock wave into the core. The quasi-spherical shock wave converges and strengthens at an off-center location, forming a second, C-burning, detonation that disrupts the whole star. In this paper, we examine this second detonation of the double detonation scenario using a combination of analytic and numeric techniques. We perform a spatially resolved study of the imploding shock wave and outgoing detonation and calculate the critical imploding shock strengths needed to achieve a core C detonation. We find that He detonations in recent two-dimensional simulations yield converging shock waves that are strong enough to ignite C detonations in high-mass C/O cores, with the caveat that a truly robust answer requires multi-dimensional detonation initiation calculations. We also find that convergence-driven detonations in low-mass C/O cores and in O/Ne cores are harder to achieve and are perhaps unrealized in standard binary evolution.},

abstract = {Progress in the three-dimensional modeling of supernovae (SN) prompts us to re-visit the supernova remnant (SNR) phase. We continue our study of the imprint of a thermonuclear explosion on the SNR it produces, that we started with a delayed-detonation model of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. Here we compare two different types of explosion models, each with two variants: two delayed detonation models (N100ddt, N5ddt) and two pure deflagration models (N100def, N5def), where the N number parametrizes the ignition. The output of each SN simulation is used as input of a SNR simulation carried on until 500 yr after the explosion. While all SNR models become more spherical over time and overall display the theoretical structure expected for a young SNR, clear differences are visible amongst the models, depending on the geometry of the ignition and on the presence or not of detonation fronts. Compared to N100 models, N5 models have a strong dipole component, and produce asymmetric remnants. N5def produces a regular-looking, but offset remnant, while N5ddt produces a two-sided remnant. Pure deflagration models exhibit specific traits: a central over-density, because of the incomplete explosion, and a network of seam lines across the surface, boundaries between burning cells. Signatures from the SN dominate the morphology of the SNR up to 100 yr to 300 yr after the explosion, depending on the model, and are still measurable at 500 yr, which may provide a way of testing explosion models.},

We find that a variant broken-power-law function provides a good fit, with the simple assumption that the optical emission is approximately the blackbody emission of the expanding fireball. This function is mathematically analytic and is derived directly from the photospheric velocity evolution. When deriving the function, we assume that both the blackbody temperature and photospheric velocity are constant, but the final function is able to accommodate these changes during the fitting procedure. Applying it to the case study of SN 2011fe gives a surprisingly good fit that can describe the light curves from the first-light time to a few weeks after peak brightness, as well as over a large range of fluxes (∼ 5 mag, and even ∼ 7 mag in the g band). Since SNe Ia share similar light-curve shapes, this fitting method has the potential to fit most other SNe Ia and characterize their properties in large statistical samples such as those already gathered and in the near future as new facilities become available.},

abstract = {https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9725-2524. Fast radio bursts are mysterious millisecond-duration transients prevalent in the radio sky. Rapid accumulation of data in recent years has facilitated an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of these events. Knowledge gained from the neighboring fields of gamma-ray bursts and radio pulsars also offered insight. Here I review developments in this fast-moving field.Two generic categories of radiation model invoking either magnetospheres of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) or relativistic shocks launched from such objects have been much debated. The recent detection of a Galactic fast radio burst in association with a soft gamma-ray repeater suggests that magnetar engines can produce at least some, and probably all, fast radio bursts. Other engines that could produce fast radio bursts are not required, but are also not impossible. On 24 July, 2001, a bright, dispersed radio pulse reached the Parkes 64-m telescope in Australia. The recorded signal remained unnoticed until Duncan Lorimer and his collaborators discovered it (now known as the fast radio burst FRB 010724) several years later and published the results in Science 1. For some time, some astronomers were not convinced that this so-called "Lorimer burst" was a genuine type of astrophysical event, until four more events were reported in 2013 (ref. 2). The field then enjoyed a rapid boost from both observational and theoretical fronts. With the identification of the microwave-oven-origin of some artificial bursts known as "perytons", the astrophysical origin of the bona fide bursts was finally established 3. This was followed by the detection of the first repeating source, known as FRB 121102 (ref. 4) and its localization in a dwarf star forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.19(refs. 5-7), establishing the extragalactic/cosmological origin (in contrast to the Galactic origin 8) of these events. Numerous theoretical models have been proposed to interpret these mysterious events 9. These have been driven by observations and groundbreaking results from numerous radio observatories: Parkes, Arecibo, Green Bank Telescope, the 1},

abstract = {Hubble tension is routinely presented as a mismatch between the Hubble constant H 0 determined locally and a value inferred from the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In essence, the tension boils down to a disagreement between two numbers. Here, assuming the tension is cosmological in origin, we predict that within flat $\Lambda$CDM there should be other inferred values of H 0 , and that a "running of H 0 with redshift" can be expected. These additional determinations of H 0 may be traced to a difference between the effective equation of state (EoS) of the Universe and the current standard model. We introduce a diagnostic that flags such a running of H 0 .},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) explosions, through the metals they release, play a pivotal role in the chemical evolution of the Universe and the origin of life. Nebular phase spectroscopy constrains such metal yields, for example through forbidden line emission associated with O i, Ca ii, Fe ii, or Fe iii. Fluid instabilities during the explosion produce a complex 3D ejecta structure, with considerable macroscopic, but no microscopic, mixing of elements. This structure sets a formidable challenge for detailed nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer modeling, which is generally limited to 1D in grid-based codes. Here, we present a novel and simple method that allows for macroscopic mixing without any microscopic mixing, thereby capturing the essence of mixing in SN explosions. With this new technique, the macroscopically mixed ejecta is built by shuffling in mass space, or equivalently in velocity space, the shells from the unmixed coasting ejecta. The method requires no change to the radiative transfer, but necessitates high spatial resolution to resolve the rapid variation in composition with depth inherent to this shuffled-shell structure. We show results for a few radiative-transfer simulations for a Type II SN explosion from a 15 M progenitor star. Our simulations capture the strong variations in temperature or ionization between the various shells that are rich in H, He, O, or Si. Because of nonlocal energy deposition, $\gamma$ rays permeate through an extended region of the ejecta, making the details of the shell arrangement unimportant. The greater physical consistency of the method delivers spectral properties at nebular times that are more reliable, in particular in terms of individual emission line strengths, which may serve to constrain the SN yields and, for core collapse SNe, the progenitor mass. The method works for all SN types.},

abstract = {The use of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure cosmological parameters has grown significantly over the past two decades. However, there exists a significant diversity in the SN Ia population that is not well understood. Over-luminous SN 1991T-like and sub-luminous SN 1991bg-like objects are two characteristic examples of peculiar SNe. The identification and classification of such objects is an important step in studying what makes them unique from the remaining SN population. With the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory promising on the order of a million new SNe over a ten-year survey, spectroscopic classifications will be possible for only a small subset of observed targets. As such, photometric classification has become an increasingly important concern in preparing for the next generation of astronomical surveys. Using observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) SN Survey, we apply here an empirically based classification technique targeted at the identification of SN 1991bg-like SNe in photometric data sets. By performing dedicated fits to photometric data in the rest-frame redder and bluer bandpasses, we classify 16 previously unidentified 91bg-like SNe. Using SDSS-II host-galaxy measurements, we find that these SNe are preferentially found in host galaxies having an older average stellar age than the hosts of normal SNe Ia. We also find that these SNe are found at a further physical distance from the center of their host galaxies. We find no statistically significant bias in host galaxy mass or specific star formation rate for these targets.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2017cbv in NGC 5643 is one of a handful of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) reported to have excess blue emission at early times. This paper presents extensive BV RIY JHK s-band light curves of SN 2017cbv, covering the phase from −16 to +125 days relative to B-band maximum light. SN 2017cbv reached a B-band maximum of 11.710±0.006 mag, with a post-maximum magnitude decline ∆m 15 (B)=0.990±0.013 mag. The supernova suffered no host reddening based on Phillips intrinsic color, Lira-Phillips relation, and the CMAGIC diagram. By employing the CMAGIC distance modulus µ = 30.58 ± 0.05 mag and assuming H 0 = 72 km s −1 Mpc −1 , we found that 0.73 M ⊙ 56 Ni was synthesized during the explosion of SN 2017cbv, which is consistent with estimates using reddening-free and distance-free methods via the phases of the secondary maximum of the NIR-band light curves. We also present 14 near-infrared spectra from −18 to +49 days relative to the B-band maximum light, providing constraints on the amount of swept-up hydrogen from the companion star in the context of the single degenerate progenitor scenario. No P a$\beta$ emission feature was detected from our post-maximum NIR spectra, placing a hydrogen mass upper limit of 0.1 M ⊙. The overall optical/NIR photometric and NIR spectral evolution of SN 2017cbv is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, even though its early evolution is marked by a flux excess no seen in most other well-observed normal SNe Ia. We also compare the exquisite light curves of SN 2017cbv with some M ch DDT models and sub-M ch double detonation models.},

abstract = {Shock breakout (SBO), the first expected electromagnetic signature of a supernova (SN), can be an important probe of the progenitors of these explosions. Unfortunately, SBO is difficult to capture with current surveys due to its brief timescale (1 hr). However, SBO may be lengthened when dense circumstellar material (CSM) is present. Indeed, recent photometric modeling studies of SNe, as well as early spectroscopy, suggest that such dense CSM may be present more often than previously expected. If true, this should also affect the features of SBO. We present an exploration of the impact of such CSM interaction on the SBO width and luminosity using both analytic and numerical modeling, where we parameterize the CSM as a steady-state wind. We then compare this modeling to PS1-13arp, a SN that showed an early UV excess that has been argued to be SBO in dense CSM. We find PS1-13arp is well fit with a wind of mass ∼ 0.08 M ⊙ and radius ∼ 1900 R ⊙ , parameters which are similar to, if not slightly less massive than, what have been inferred for Type II SNe using photometric modeling. This similarity suggests that future SBO observations of SNe II may be easier to obtain than previously appreciated.},

We combine the subset of 279PS1 SNe Ia (0.03<z<0.68) with useful distance estimates of SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), SNLS, and various low-z and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of SNe Ia, consisting of a total of 1048SNe Ia in the range of 0.01<z<2.3, which we call the "Pantheon Sample."

abstract = {While it is clear that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the result of thermonuclear explosions in C/O white dwarfs (WDs), a great deal remains uncertain about the binary companion that facilitates the explosive disruption of the WD. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a large, unique data set of 127 SNe$\,$Ia with exquisite coverage by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). High-cadence (six observations per night) ZTF observations allow us to measure the SN rise time and examine its initial evolution. We develop a Bayesian framework to model the early rise as a power law in time, which enables the inclusion of priors in our model. For a volume-limited subset of normal SNe$\,$Ia, we find that the mean power-law index is consistent with 2 in the $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$-band ($\alpha_r = 2.01\pm0.02$), as expected in the expanding fireball model. There are, however, individual SNe that are clearly inconsistent with $\alpha_r=2$. We estimate a mean rise time of 18.9$\,$d (with a range extending from $\sim$15 to 22$\,$d), though this is subject to the adopted prior. We identify an important, previously unknown, bias whereby the rise times for higher-redshift SNe within a flux-limited survey are systematically underestimated. This effect can be partially alleviated if the power-law index is fixed to $\alpha=2$, in which case we estimate a mean rise time of 21.7$\,$d (with a range from $\sim$18 to 23$\,$d). The sample includes a handful of rare and peculiar SNe$\,$Ia. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of lessons learned from the ZTF sample that can eventually be applied to observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.},

abstract = {Dust destruction by supernovae is one of the main processes removing dust from the interstellar medium (ISM). Estimates of the efficiency of this process, both theoretical and observational, typically assume a shock propagating into a homogeneous medium, whereas the ISM possesses significant substructure in reality. We self-consistently model the dust and gas properties of the shocked ISM in three supernova remnants (SNRs), using X-ray and infrared (IR) data combined with corresponding emission models. Collisional heating by gas with properties derived from X-ray observations produces dust temperatures too high to fit the far-IR fluxes from each SNR. An additional colder dust component is required, which has a minimum mass several orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm dust heated by the X-ray emitting gas. Dust-togas mass ratios indicate that the majority of the dust in the X-ray emitting material has been destroyed, while the fraction of surviving dust in the cold component is plausibly close to unity. As the cold component makes up virtually all the total dust mass, destruction timescales based on homogeneous models, which cannot account for multiple phases of shocked gas and dust, may be significantly overestimating actual dust destruction efficiencies, and subsequently underestimating grain lifetimes.},

abstract = {We present a study of 28 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) in the context of the ejecta mass and photospheric velocity. We combine photometry and spectroscopy to infer ejecta masses via the formalism of radiation diffusion equations. We show an improved method to determine the photospheric velocity by combining spectrum modeling and cross correlation techniques. We find that Type I SLSNe can be divided into two groups by their pre-maximum spectra. Members of the first group have the W-shaped absorption trough in their pre-maximum spectrum, usually identified as due to O II. This feature is absent in the spectra of supernovae in the second group, whose spectra are similar to SN 2015bn. We confirm that the pre-or near-maximum photospheric velocities correlate with the velocity gradients: faster evolving SLSNe have larger photosheric velocities around maximum. We classify the studied SLSNe into the Fast or the Slow evolving group by their estimated photosheric velocities, and find that all those objects that resemble to SN 2015bn belong to the Slow evolving class, while SLSNe showing the W-like absorption are represented in both Fast and Slow evolving groups. We estimate the ejecta masses of all objects in our sample, and obtain values in the range of 2.9 (±0.8)-208 (±61) M ⊙ , with a mean of 43(±12) M ⊙. We conclude that Slow evolving SLSNe tend to have higher ejecta masses compared to the Fast ones. Our ejecta mass calculations suggests that SLSNe are caused by energetic explosions of very massive stars, irrespectively of the powering mechanism of the light curve.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae are believed to be white dwarfs disrupted by a thermonuclear explosion. Here we investigate the scenario in which a rather low-mass, carbon-oxygen (C + O) white dwarf accumulates helium on its surface in a sufficient amount for igniting a detonation in the helium shell before the Chandrasekhar mass is reached. In principle, this can happen on white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion or by merging a C + O white dwarf with a low-mass helium one. In this scenario, the helium detonation is thought to trigger a secondary detonation in the C + O core. It is therefore called the "double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar" super-nova model. By means of a set of numerical simulations, we investigate the robustness of this explosion mechanism for generic 1-M models and analyze its observable predictions. Also a resolution dependence in numerical simulations is analyzed. Hydrodynamic simulations of the double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar scenario are conducted in two and three spatial dimensions. The propagation of thermonuclear detonation fronts, both in helium and in the carbon-oxygen mixture, is computed by means of both a level-set function and a simplified description for nuclear reactions. The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the white dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In a parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell masses of 0.2 and 0.1 M (and thus 0.8 and 0.9 M of C + O), we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a very robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in the He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the white dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete evolution of three selected models with 0.2 M of He through the C/O-detonation phase and obtain 56 Ni-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 M. Although we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our results show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal or sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta features significant amounts of 56 Ni in the outer layers at high expansion velocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a model for the long-term evolution of the merger of two unequal mass C/O white dwarfs (WDs). After the dynamical phase of the merger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading to nearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 10 −4-1 yr, long before significant cooling can occur. Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous phases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and radially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure. Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the envelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective carbon burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the envelope on a thermal timescale of 10 3-10 4 yr compresses the base of the envelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term evolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous calculations: the burning shell diffuses inward over ∼10 4 yr, eventually yielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star, rather than a Type Ia supernova. During the cooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the Eddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, a few dozen of these ∼10 38 erg s −1 sources should exist in a Milky Way type galaxy. While the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physical picture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous work. Furthermore, substantial remaining uncertainties related to the convective structure near the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution may significantly affect our conclusions. Thus, future work within the context of the physical model presented here is required to better address the eventual fate of double WD mergers, including those for which one or both of the components is a He WD.},

abstract = {The ejecta velocity is a very important parameter in studying the structure and properties of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). It is also a candidate key parameter in improving the utility of SNe Ia for cosmological distance determinations. Here we study the velocity distribution of a sample of 311 SNe Ia from the kaepora database. The velocities are derived from the Si II {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6355 absorption line in optical spectra measured at (or extrapolated to) the time of peak brightness. We statistically show that the observed velocity has a bimodal Gaussian distribution consisting of two groups of SNe Ia: Group I with a lower but narrower scatter ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ 1 = 11,000 km s −1 , {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ 1 = 700 km s −1), and Group II with a higher but broader scatter ({\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ 2 = 12,300 km s −1 , {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ 2 = 1800 km s −1). The population ratio of Group I to Group II is 201:110 (65%:35%). There is substantial degeneracy between the two groups, but for SNe Ia with velocity {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\pounds} > 12,000 km s −1 , the distribution is dominated by Group II. The true origin of the two components is unknown, though there could be that naturally there exist two intrinsic velocity distributions as observed. However, we try to use asymmetric geometric models through statistical simulations to reproduce the observed distribution assuming all SNe Ia share the same intrinsic distribution. In the two cases we consider, 35% of SNe Ia are considered to be asymmetric in Case 1, and all SNe Ia are asymmetric in Case 2. Simulations for both cases can reproduce the observed velocity distribution but require a significantly large portion (> 35%) of SNe Ia to be asymmetric. In addition, the Case 1 result is consistent with recent polarization observations that SNe Ia with higher Si II {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼6355 velocity tend to be more polarized.},

abstract = {The diversity of Type II supernovae (SNe II) is thought to be driven mainly by differences in their progenitor's hydrogen-rich (H-rich) envelope mass, with SNe IIP having long plateaus (∼ 100 days) and the most massive H-rich envelopes. However, it is an ongoing mystery why SNe II with short plateaus (tens of days) are rarely seen. Here we present optical/near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous Type II short-plateau SNe 2006Y, 2006ai, and 2016egz. Their plateaus of about 50-70 days and luminous optical peaks (−18.4 mag) indicate significant pre-explosion mass loss resulting in partially-stripped H-rich envelopes and early circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. We compute a large grid of MESA+STELLA single-star progenitor and light-curve models with 2 Hiramatsu et al. various progenitor zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses, mass-loss efficiencies, explosion energies, 56 Ni masses, and CSM densities. Our model grid shows a continuous population of SNe IIP-IIL-IIb-like light-curve morphology in descending order of H-rich envelope mass. With large 56 Ni masses (0.05 M), short-plateau SNe II lie in a confined parameter space as a transitional class between SNe IIL and IIb. For SNe 2006Y, 2006ai, and 2016egz, our findings suggest high-mass red supergiant (RSG) progenitors (M ZAMS 18-22 M) with small H-rich envelope masses (M Henv 1.7 M) that experience enhanced mass loss (˙ M 10 −2 M yr −1) for the last few decades before the explosion. If high-mass RSGs result in rare short-plateau SNe II, then these events might ease some of the apparent under-representation of higher-luminosity RSGs in observed SN II progenitor samples.},

abstract = {Aims. We simulate shells created by supernovae expanding into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the nuclear region of a galaxy, and analyze how the shell evolution is influenced by the supernova (SN) position relative to the galactic center, by the interstellar matter (ISM) density, and by the combined gravitational pull of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and supermassive black hole (SMBH). Methods. We adopted simplified hydrodynamical simulations using the infinitesimally thin layer approximation in 3D (code RING) and determined whether and where the shell expansion may bring new gas into the inner parsec around the SMBH. Results. The simulations show that supernovae occurring within a conical region around the rotational axis of the galaxy can feed the central accretion disk surrounding the SMBH. For ambient densities between 10 3 and 10 5 cm −3 , the average mass deposited into the central parsec by individual supernovae varies between 10 to 1000 solar masses depending on the ambient density and the spatial distribution of supernova events. Supernovae occurring in the aftermath of a starburst event near a galactic center can supply two to three orders of magnitude more mass into the central parsec, depending on the magnitude of the starburst. The deposited mass typically encounters and joins an accretion disk. The fate of that mass is then divided between the growth of the SMBH and an energetically driven outflow from the disk.},

We determine star formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellar masses and ages of these objects. As expected, strong correlations between the SN Ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found: fainter, faster declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-rich galaxies. There is some evidence that redder SNe Ia explode in higher metallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the SN colour and host galaxy extinction based on the Balmer decrement, suggesting that the colour variation of these SNe does not primarily arise from this source. SNe Ia in higher mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colour corrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the stronger correlation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the more important variable. We also compared the host stellar mass distribution to that in galaxy-targeted SN surveys and the high-redshift untargeted Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). SNLS has many more low-mass galaxies, while the targeted searches have fewer. This can be explained by an evolution in the galaxy stellar mass function, coupled with an SN delay-time distribution proportional to t −1. Finally, we found no significant difference in the mass-metallicity relation of our SN Ia hosts compared to field galaxies, suggesting any metallicity effect on the SN Ia rate is small.},

abstract = {The observational evidence for the inflationary cosmology with baryosynthesis and dark matter/energy can be viewed as the messenger for new physics, which governed the Universe origin, evolution and structure. To specify the physics beyond the Standard model (BSM), underlying the modern cosmological paradigm additional model dependent messengers are proposed, involving multi-component and composite dark matter, meta-stable particles, primordial black holes and antimatter domains in baryon asymmetrical Universe. 1. Introduction The data of precision cosmology strongly tighten deviations from the predictions of inflationary model with baryosynthesis and dark matter/energy [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. All these basic elements of the modern cosmological paradigm find their physical nature in predictions of BSM models, which in their turn involve cosmological probes for their test [5, 6, 7, 8]. In the context of the modern cosmological paradigm we may consider the observed structure and evolution of the Universe as the messenger of BSM physics, which needs additional model dependent signatures to be specified. Such model dependent cosmological signatures reflect the fundamental structure and symmetry breaking pattern of the BSM model [7, 8, 9] and can be viewed as multi-messenger cosmological probes for new physics. Here we briefly review some examples of these probes. They involve new stable and meta-stable particles, multi-component dark matter, composite dark matter and dark atoms, primordial black holes and primordial nonlinear structures, as well as antimatter stars in the baryon asymmetrical Universe as a profound signature of strongly nonhomogeneous baryosynthesis. Such consequences are not inevitable predictions of BSM models, but reminding Ya.B.Zeldovich one can say that "even if the probability for these phenomena is very low, the expectation value of their discovery would be very high". In general, effects of new physics with energy scale V appear with full strength at high energies E ≥ V. At these energies new particles with the mass characterized by the scale V can be copiously produced, as well as their exchange is not suppressed. At smaller energies E < V these particles can be produced in virtual states and their effects are suppressed by some power of (E/V). For high energy scale V , cosmology, predicting the stages of early Universe with very high energy density, becomes natural laboratory of new physics. Its observable signatures require some messengers, which retain information on the processes in the very early Universe and provide their confrontation with the astrophysical data on the phenomena, taking place at much},

abstract = {Time domain science has undergone a revolution over the past decade, with tens of thousands of new supernovae (SNe) discovered each year. However, several observational domains, including SNe within days or hours of explosion and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here, we present the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled griz light curves for thousands of transient events up to z ≈ 0.2. This large sample of transients with 4-band light curves will lay the foundation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy science. As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover transients as faint ∼21.5 mag in gri and ∼20.5 mag in z, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 square degrees of sky every three days and we plan to increase the area to 1500 square degrees in the near future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find ∼5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within three days of explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed 8.3% of the transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020. We present an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics and a summary of our transient discoveries to date.},

abstract = {We develop an analytic solution of the radiation transport problem for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and show that it reproduces bolometric light curves produced by more detailed calculations under the assumption of a constant-extinction coefficient. This model is used to derive the thermal conditions in the interior of SNe Ia and to study the sensitivity of light curves to various properties of the underlying supernova explosions. Although the model is limited by simplifying assumptions, it is adequate for demonstrating that the relationship between SNe Ia maximum-light luminosity and rate of decline is most easily explained if SNe Ia span a range in mass. The analytic model is also used to examine the size of various terms in the transport equation under conditions appropriate to maximum light. For instance, the Eulerian and advective time derivatives are each shown to be of the same order of magnitude as other order v/c terms in the transport equation. We conclude that a fully time-dependent solution to the transport problem is needed in order to compute SNe Ia light curves and spectra accurate enough to distinguish subtle di †erences of various explosion models.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the early, rising light curves of 18 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory and the La Silla-QUEST variability survey. We fit these early data flux using a simple power law (f(t) = $\alpha$ × t n) to determine the time of first light (t 0), and hence the rise time (t rise) from first light to peak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise (n). We find a mean uncorrected rise time of 18.98 ± 0.54 d, with individual supernova (SN) rise times ranging from 15.98 to 24.7 d. The exponent n shows significant departures from the simple 'fireball model' of n = 2 (or f(t) ∝ t 2) usually assumed in the literature. With a mean value of n = 2.44 ± 0.13, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. This deviation has implications for the distribution of 56 Ni throughout the SN ejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56 Ni mixing. The range of n found also confirms that the 56 Ni distribution is not standard throughout the population of SNe Ia, in agreement with earlier work measuring such abundances through spectral modelling. We also show that the duration of the very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of its maximal value, does not correlate with the light-curve shape or stretch used to standardize SNe Ia in cosmological applications. This has implications for the cosmological fitting of SN Ia light curves.},

Their light curves and spectra are characterized by distinct features that indicate strong mixing of the explosion ejecta. Pure turbulent deflagrations have been shown to produce such mixed ejecta. Here, we present hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis and radiative-transfer calculations for a 3D full-star deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. Our model is able to reproduce the characteristic observational features of SN 2005hk (a prototypical 2002cx-like supernova), not only in the optical, but also in the near-infrared. For that purpose we present, for the first time, five near-infrared spectra of SN 2005hk from −0.2 to 26.6 d with respect to B-band maximum. Since our model burns only small parts of the initial white dwarf, it fails to completely unbind the white dwarf and leaves behind a bound remnant of ∼1.03 M-consisting mainly of unburned carbon and oxygen, but also enriched by some amount of intermediate-mass and iron-group elements from the explosion products that fall back on the remnant. We discuss possibilities for detecting this bound remnant and how it might influence the late-time observables of 2002cx-like SNe.},

We reduce this data with an implementation of the image subtraction pipeline used by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) optimized for use with the TESS images. In empirical fits to the rising light curves, we do not find strong correlations between the fit parameters and the peak luminosity. Existing semi-analytic models fit the light curves of the Type II supernovae well, but do not yield reasonable estimates of the progenitor radius or explosion energy, likely because they are derived for use with ultraviolet observations while TESS observes in the near-infrared. If we instead fit the data with numerically simulated light curves, the rising light curves of the Type II supernovae are consistent with the explosions of red supergiants. While we do not identify shock breakout emission for any individual event, when we combine the fit residuals of the Type II supernovae in our sample, we do find a > 5{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}¼ flux excess in the ∼ 0.5 day before the start of the light curve rise.

abstract = {We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray transient, serendipitously detected by Swift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) on 2020 February 5, located in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J143359.16+400636.0 at z = 0.099 (luminosity distance D L = 456 Mpc). The transient was observed to reach a peak luminosity of ∼ 10 44 erg s −1 in the 0.3-10 keV X-ray band, which was around ∼ 20 times more than the peak optical/UV luminosity. Optical, UV, and X-ray lightcurves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Swift show a decline in flux from the source consistent with t −5/3 , and observations with NuSTAR and Chandra show a soft X-ray spectrum with photon index $\Gamma$ = 2.9 ± 0.1. The X-ray/UV properties are inconsistent with well known AGN properties and have more in common with known X-ray tidal disruption events (TDE), leading us to conclude that it was likely a TDE. The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) can be described well by a disk blackbody model with an inner disk temperature of 7.3 +0.3 −0.8 × 10 5 K, with a large fraction (> 40%) of the disk emission up-scattered into the X-ray band. An optical spectrum taken with Keck/LRIS after the X-ray detection reveals LINER line ratios in the host galaxy, suggesting low-level accretion on to the supermassive black hole prior to the event, but no broad lines or other indications of a TDE were seen. The stellar velocity dispersion implies the mass of the supermassive black hole powering the event is log(M BH /M)= 7.41 ± 0.41, and we estimate that at peak the Eddington fraction of this event was ∼50%. This likely TDE was not identified by wide-field optical surveys, nor optical spectroscopy, indicating that more events like this would be missed without wide-field UV or X-ray surveys.},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the Universe, and the need for dark energy, were inferred from observations of type Ia supernovae. There is a consensus that type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions that destroy carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that have accreted matter from a companion star, although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. These supernovae are thought to be reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel and a uniform trigger: they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white dwarf nears the Chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 solar masses (M⊙). Here we show that the high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy that both imply a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. Super-Chandrasekhar-mass supernovae should occur preferentially in a young stellar population, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend that overluminous type Ia supernovae occur only in 'young' environments. As this supernova does not obey the relations that allow type Ia supernovae to be calibrated as standard candles, and as no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmology studies will have to consider possible contamination from such events. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {In the double-detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae, it is suggested that a detonation initiates in a shell of helium-rich material accreted from a companion star by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. This shell detonation drives a shock front into the carbon-oxygen white dwarf that triggers a secondary detonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of the white dwarf. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in accounting for the observed properties of Type Ia supernovae since the explosion ejecta are surrounded by the products of explosive helium burning in the shell. Recently, however, it was proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive helium shells than previously assumed (Bildsten et al.). Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these minimum helium shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the carbon-oxygen core (Fink et al.). Therefore, it is possible that the impact of the helium layer on observables is less than previously thought. Here, we present time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for models with minimum helium shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the optical and $\gamma$-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those found in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more massive helium shells were considered. Our models predict light curves that cover both the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed Type Ia supernovae. However, their colors and spectra do not match the observations. In particular, their B − V colors are generally too red. We show that this discrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the helium shell of the Fink et al. models which contain significant amounts of titanium and chromium. Using a toy model, we also show that the burning products of the helium shell depend crucially on its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement between sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed Type Ia supernovae may still be feasible but further study of the shell properties is required.},

abstract = {Analysis of the theory of evolution of low-and intermediate-mass binaries allows us to select promising scenarios that lead to presupemova systems consisting of an accreting electron-degenerate dwarf (made primarily either of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, of carbon and oxygen, or of helium) and a low-mass (M $\sim$ M {\"{o}}) star supplying hydrogen-rich matter at rates in the range $\sim$ 10 " 9-10 6 M 0 yr 1 or a heavy disk composed of helium or of C and O supplying matter at an as yet undetermined rate. Some of these scenarios have an estimated frequency of realization comparable with the observed frequency ($\sim$ 10-2 yr-1) of Type I supemovae (SNel), but it is as yet impossible to identify conclusively a single one as the most likely explanation of the SNI phenomenon and to reject all other possibilities. It is therefore not excluded that SNel are a mixture of products of different scenarios. Estimates of formation frequency are very preliminary, since some of them are strongly dependent on the distribution of unevolved binaries over the initial mass ratio <7 0 , especially for q Q $\sim$ 0.1-0.3, and most of them require knowledge of the processes that occur during a common envelope stage, the understanding of which is still very rudimentary. We find that those systems having the highest formal probability (-0.008 yr-1) of evolving into the presupemova state are binaries with component masses in the range 5-9 M Q , semimajor axes between 70 and 1500 R q , and orbital periods in the range 1 month to 6 yr. After experiencing two common envelope stages, these systems become two electron-degenerate dwarfs composed of carbon and oxygen; the dwarfs have individual masses in the range 0.7-1 M G , are separated by a distance of 0.2 to 3.5 R 0 , and orbit each other with periods between 12 minutes and 14 hr. The angular momentum carried away by gravitational waves forces the components closer together over a time ranging from 10 5 to 10 10 yr, and when the semimajor axis is reduced to-0.01 R g , the less massive of the two dwarfs is transformed into a heavy disk or rapidly rotating envelope about the more massive dwarf. When accretion from the disk raises the mass of the single stellar remnant to-1.4 A/ 0 , a supernova explosion results. An interesting aspect of this scenario is that it predicts SN characteristics in accord with the observations: typical expansion velocities of the ejectum of-11,000 km s _1 , no detectable hydrogen or helium in the spectrum at maximum light, the presence in the SN spectrum of incompletely burned heavy elements including Ca and Si, and a light curve whose peak half-width matches that of most observed SNel light curves. Further, the longest period representatives of these systems can occur in elliptical galaxies 10 10 yr after star formation has ceased. The next (formally) most likely scenario (realization frequency-0.005 yr-1) begins with two stars each of mass about 3-4 M 0 , separated by a distance between 70 and 460 R 0 , and orbiting with periods between 20 days to 1 yr. Again after two common envelope stages, these systems evolve into two electron degenerate dwarfs, but this time the dwarfs are composed of helium and have masses between 0.4 and 0.5 M Q. The initial semimajor axes and orbital periods of the potential presupemova systems are, respectively, in the ranges 0.13-1 R Q and 8 minutes to 3 hr. Within 2x10 5 to 5x10 8 yr the angular momentum loss by gravitational wave radiation brings the components close enough together to lead to the formation of a heavy disk which is then accreted by the initially more massive dwarf. Possible disadvantages of this scenario, when compared with the observations, are that it predicts typical expansion velocities on the order of 16,000 km s-1 , the absence of Ca and Si in the SN spectrum, and a half-width for the peak of the light curve that is, in most instances, narrower than the observed one by about a factor of 2. If the (unknown) accretion rate from the heavy disk is large enough, the merging dwarf system will not produce an SN explosion but will instead produce a CO dwarf as a final product. In contrast, the double CO dwarf system will always produce an SN explosion, regardless of the rate of disk accretion. Further, in the framework of our approximations, most double helium dwarf systems are formed at such small initial separations that evolution to the potentially explosive state occurs in less than-5 X10 8 yr, and thus such systems may not account for the occurrence of SNel in elliptical galaxies. One last scenario which IBEN AND TUTUKOV Vol. 54 336 produces two degenerate dwarfs drawn together by gravitational wave radiation is a hybrid of the other two scenarios, and the product is also a hybrid: one dwarf composed of C and O, the other of helium. The realization frequency is $\sim$ 0.001 yr-1 , and the most likely end product is an R CrB star rather than an SN. Other scenarios lead to potential presupemova systems which consist of a carbon-oxygen dwarf and a main-sequence or red (super)giant companion which transfers hydrogen-rich material to the dwarf. The most restrictive aspect of these systems is that the occurrence of hydrogen and helium shell flashes prevents the dwarf from retaining matter accreted between flashes unless the accretion rate is within a relatively narrow interval. We find formal realization frequencies of $\sim$ 0.004 yr " 1 for cataclysmic systems and $\sim$ 0.003 yr " 1 for cataclysmic-like systems which may reach the explosive state, provided mass transfer within an appropriate interval can be maintained. The realization frequency of possibly "successful" symbiotic-like systems in which mass transfer from a giant is due to Roche lobe f{\"{u}}ling is < 5X10-4 yr-1 , whereas the frequency of producing symbiotic systems in which the dwarf captures mass from the wind emitted by an asymptotic giant branch star is < 0.004 yr-1 , but our upper limit requires the most favorable choice of an unknown parameter in an expression for mass capture. Since the formation frequency of low-mass X-ray binaries is so small ($\sim$ 10$\sim$ 7 yr-1) compared with the observed formation frequency of SNel, we infer that such binaries are not the typical end product of evolution which produces SNel. We strengthen this inference by demonstrating that low-mass X-ray binaries could be formed at the known frequency by a variety of capture and exchange capture processes in the cores of existing and disrupted globular clusters, as well as by similar processes occurring among field stars in the galactic bulge.},

abstract = {It is suggested that the immediate progenitors of Type I supernovae in elliptical galaxies are binary systems of long period (1-6 years) that have evolved from an initial configuration consisting of a light secondary of mass less than or equal to 0.8 M{\textcopyright} and a primary of intermediate mass (1.8-3 M{\textcopyright}), with orbital period between 5 and 9 years. Beginning on the main sequence, the primary evolves rapidly and, following mass loss and/or mass transfer, becomes a carbon-oxygen white dwarf of mass close to 1.4 M{\textcopyright}. The secondary, now of mass 0.8 M{\textcopyright}, evolves for 10 10 years before reaching the asymptotic giant branch. On swelling beyond its Roche surface, the secondary transfers mass onto the primary which then (we presume) develops rapidly into a supernova. An examination of the frequency of binary systems with appropriate orbital characteristics shows that our conjecture is not inconsistent with the available data concerning the frequency of Type I supernovae. Subject headings: binaries-mass loss-supernovae I. THE CONUNDRUM AND A POSSIBLE SOLUTION It is believed that the vast majority of stars in elliptical galaxies that are still actively consuming nuclear fuel are old and hence are of low mass. If, for example, we assume an age of 10 10 years and an initial helium abundance of F $\sim$ 0.25, then the maximum mass of an active star is only 0.8 M 0. Current ideas about the conditions that lead to a supernova explosion suggest that likely progenitors of supernovae are massive stars that can develop a highly evolved, electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core of mass about 1.4 M 0. Putting two and two together, we might conclude that supernovae could not occur in elliptical galaxies. Yet we know that supernovae of Type I occur in such galaxies at a frequency of 1 per 100 years per 10 11 stars. A possible solution may involve mass transfer between members of a binary system (see, e.g., Wheeler and Hansen 1971; Truran and Cameron 1971; Hartwick 1972; Mazurek 1973). We propose an initial binary system that consists of (1) a massive component (primary), that passes through its active nuclear burning life in a time short compared with a galactic lifetime, leaving an inactive white dwarf composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, and (2) a light component (secondary) whose nuclear burning lifetime is comparable to the galactic age. A specific final configuration that appears promising for the formation of a super-nova consists of (1) a white dwarf made of carbon and oxygen with a mass somewhat less than the Chandrasekhar limit, say $\sim$ 1.2-1.38 M 0 , and (2) a red giant of mass $\sim$0.8 M q that is about to fill its Roche lobe and start transferring mass to its more massive companion. The extra pressure on the surface of the more massive star will cause it to contract and heat. The matter at the interface between the carbon-oxygen core and the newly added hydrogen-helium envelope will ignite, forming first a pure helium layer and adding then more carbon and oxygen to the core which, growing in *},

In empirical fits to the rising light curves, we do not find strong correlations between the fit parameters and the peak luminosity.

If we instead fit the data with numerically simulated light curves, the rising light curves of the Type II supernovae are consistent with the explosions of red supergiants.

Therefore, such binaries are good candidates for detection at high energies. However, only the massive binary $\eta$ Carinae has been firmly associated with a $\gamma$-ray signal. A second system, $\gamma$ 2 Velorum, is positionally coincident with a $\gamma$-ray source, but we lack unambiguous identification. Aims. Observing orbital modulation of the flux would establish an unambiguous identification of the binary $\gamma$ 2 Velorum as the $\gamma$-ray source detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Methods. We used more than ten years of observations with Fermi-LAT. Events are phase-folded with the orbital period of the binary to search for variability. We studied systematic errors that might arise from the strong emission of the nearby Vela pulsar with a more conservative pulse-gated analysis. Results. We find hints of orbital variability, indicating maximum flux from the binary during apastron passage. Conclusions. Our analysis strengthens the possibility that $\gamma$-rays are produced in $\gamma$ 2 Velorum, most likely as a result of particle acceleration in the wind collision region. The observed orbital variability is consistent with predictions from recent magnetohydrodynamic simulations, but contrasts with the orbital variability from $\eta$ Carinae, where the peak of the light curve is found at periastron.},

Given that sequestering requires very specific configurations, supersymmetric particles are in general expected to be very heavy implying that the neutralino dark matter should be overproduced in a standard thermal history. However, in this paper we point out that this is generically not the case since early matter domination driven by string moduli can dilute the dark matter abundance down to the observed value. We argue that generic features of string compactifications, namely a high supersymmetry breaking scale and late time epochs of modulus domination, might imply superheavy neutralino dark matter with mass around 10 10 − 10 11 GeV. Interestingly, this is the right range to explain the recent detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube and ANITA via dark matter decay.},

We begin by examining thirty-two different combinations of nuclear inputs: eight mass models, two types of spontaneous fission rates and two types of fission daughter product distributions. We find that such nuclear physics uncertainties typically generate at least one order of magnitude uncertainty in key quantities such as the nuclear heating (one and a half orders of magnitude at one day post-merger), the bolometric luminosity (one order of magnitude at five days post-merger), and the inferred mass of material from the bolometric luminosity (factor of eight when considering the eight to ten day region). Since particular nuclear processes are critical for determining the electromagnetic signal, we provide tables of key nuclei undergoing $\beta$-decay, $\alpha$-decay, and spontaneous fission important for heating at different times, identifying decays that are common among the many nuclear input combinations.},

abstract = {The most precise local measurements of H 0 rely on observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) coupled with Cepheid distances to SN Ia host galaxies. Recent results have shown tension comparing H 0 to the value inferred from CMB observations assuming $\Lambda$CDM, making it important to check for potential systematic uncertainties in either approach. To date, precise local H 0 measurements have used SN Ia distances based on optical photometry, with corrections for light curve shape and colour. Here, we analyse SNe Ia as standard candles in the near-infrared (NIR), where luminosity variations in the supernovae and extinction by dust are both reduced relative to the optical. From a combined fit to 9 nearby calibrator SNe with host Cepheid distances from Riess et al. (2016) and 27 SNe in the Hubble flow, we estimate the absolute peak J magnitude M J = −18.524 ± 0.041 mag and H 0 = 72.8 ± 1.6 (statistical) ±2.7 (systematic) km s −1 Mpc −1. The 2.2% statistical uncertainty demonstrates that the NIR provides a compelling avenue to measuring SN Ia distances, and for our sample the intrinsic (unmodeled) peak J magnitude scatter is just ∼0.10 mag, even without light curve shape or colour corrections. Our results do not vary significantly with different sample selection criteria, though photometric calibration in the NIR may be a dominant systematic uncertainty. Our findings suggest that tension in the competing H 0 distance ladders is likely not a result of supernova systematics that could be expected to vary between optical and NIR wavelengths, like dust extinction. We anticipate further improvements in H 0 with a larger calibrator sample of SNe Ia with Cepheid distances, more Hubble flow SNe Ia with NIR light curves, and better use of the full NIR photometric data set beyond simply the peak J-band magnitude.},

Although the model is limited by simplifying assumptions, it is adequate for demonstrating that the relationship between SNe Ia maximum-light luminosity and rate of decline is most easily explained if SNe Ia span a range in mass. The analytic model is also used to examine the size of various terms in the transport equation under conditions appropriate to maximum light. For instance, the Eulerian and advective time derivatives are each shown to be of the same order of magnitude as other order v/c terms in the transport equation.

We study the physical origin of this width-luminosity relation (WLR) using detailed radiative transfer calculations of Chandrasekhar-mass SN Ia models. We find that the luminosity dependence of the diffusion time (emphasized in previous studies) is in fact of secondary relevance in understanding the model WLR. Instead, the essential physics involves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of SNe Ia. Following maximum light, the SN colors are increasingly affected by the development of numerous Fe ii/Co ii lines that blanket the B band and, at the same time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. Because dimmer SNe Ia are generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of Fe iii to Fe ii recombination in the iron group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a more rapid evolution of the SN colors to the red. The faster B-band decline rate of dimmer SNe Ia thus reflects their faster ionization evolution.},

We obtained high-resolution echelle spectra that we combine with other spectra to investigate its line profile evolution. All epochs reveal narrow P Cygni components from pre-shock circumstellar material (CSM), indicating an axisymmetric outflow from the progenitor of 40-50 km s −1. Intermediate-width and broad components exhibit the classic evolution seen in luminous SNe IIn: symmetric Lorentzian profiles from pre-shock CSM lines broadened by electron scattering at early times, transitioning at late times to multi-component, irregular profiles coming from the SN ejecta and post-shock shell. As in many SNe IIn, profiles show a progressively increasing blueshift, with a clear flux deficit in red wings of the intermediate and broad velocity components after day 200. This blueshift develops after the continuum luminosity fades, and in the intermediate-width component, persists at late times even after the SN ejecta fade. In SN 2017hcc, the blueshift cannot be explained as occul-tation by the SN photosphere, pre-shock acceleration of CSM, or a lopsided explosion or CSM. Instead, the blueshift arises from dust formation in the post-shock shell and in the SN ejecta. The effect has a wavelength dependence characteristic of dust, exhibiting an extinction law consistent with large grains. Thus, SN 2017hcc experienced post-shock dust formation and had a mildly bipolar CSM shell, similar to SN 2010jl. Like other superluminous SNe IIn, the progenitor lost around 10 M ⊙ due to extreme eruptive mass loss in the decade before exploding.},

Assuming that ZTF19abanrhr is the bona fide EM counterpart to GW190521, and using the GW luminosity distance estimate from three different waveforms NRSur7dq4, SEOBNRv4PHM, and IMRPhenomPv3HM, we report a measurement of the Hubble constant H 0 = 50.4 +28.1 −19.5 km/s/Mpc, 62.2 +29.5 −19.7 km/s/Mpc, and 43.1 +24.6 −11.4 km/s/Mpc (median along with 68% credible interval) respectively after marginalizing over matter density Ω m (or dark energy equation of state w 0) assuming the flat LCDM (or wCDM) model. Combining our results with the binary neutron star event GW170817 with its redshift measurement alone, as well as with its inclination angle inferred from Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), we find H 0 = 67.6 +4.3 −4.2 km/s/Mpc, Ω m = 0.47 +0.34 −0.27 , and w 0 = −1.17 +0.68 −0.57 (median along with 68% credible interval) providing the most stringent measurement on H 0 and the first constraints on Ω m and w 0 from bright standard siren. In the future, 1.3% measurement of H 0 = 68 km/s/Mpc and 28% measurement of w 0 = −1 is possible from about 200 GW190521-like sources.},

abstract = {Most supernova explosions accompany the death of a massive star. These explosions give birth to neutron stars and black holes and eject solar masses of heavy elements. However, determining the mechanism of explosion has been a half-century journey of great complexity. In this paper, we present our perspective of the status of this theoretical quest and the physics and astrophysics upon which its resolution seems to depend. The delayed neutrino-heating mechanism is emerging as a robust solution, but there remain many issues to address, not the least of which involves the chaos of the dynamics, before victory can unambiguously be declared. It is impossible to review in detail all aspects of this multi-faceted, more-than-half-century-long theoretical quest. Rather, we here map out the major ingredients of explosion and the emerging systematics of the observables with progenitor mass, as we currently see them. Our discussion will of necessity be speculative in parts, and many of the ideas may not survive future scrutiny. Some statements may be viewed as informed predictions concerning the numerous observables that rightly exercise astronomers witnessing and diagnosing the supernova Universe. Importantly, the same explosion in the inside, by the same mechanism, can look very different in photons, depending upon the mass and radius of the star upon explosion. A 10 51-erg (one "Bethe") explosion of a red supergiant with a massive hydrogen-rich envelope, a diminished hydrogen envelope, no hydrogen envelope, and, perhaps, no hydrogen envelope or helium shell all look very different, yet might have the same core and explosion evolution. 1 Core-Collapse Supernova Explosions Stars are born, they live, and they die. Many terminate their thermonuclear lives after billions of years of cooking light elements into heavier elements by ejecting their outer hydrogen-rich envelopes over perhaps hundreds of years. In the process, they give birth to compact white dwarf stars, half as massive as the Sun, but a hundred times smaller. Such dense remnants cool off over billions of years like dying embers plucked from a fire. A subset of these white dwarfs in binary stellar systems will later (perhaps hundreds of millions of years) ignite in spectacular thermonuclear explosions, many of these the so-called Type Ia supernovae used, due to their brightness from across the Universe, to take its measure. However, some stars, those more massive than ∼8 M , die violently in supernova explosions that inject freshly synthesized elements, generation after generation progressively enriching the interstellar medium with these products of existence. They too leave behind remnants, but neutron 1},

While the optical peak of the event was missed, a peak was detected in the infrared with an absolute magnitude of M 4.5 µm = −18.4 mag, leading us to infer a visual-wavelength peak absolute magnitude of −13.5 to −14.5. The light curve from the pre-discovery archival data indicated no outbursts over the previous 16 yr. The colors, magnitudes, and inferred temperatures of the progenitor best match a 13-14 M yellow or blue supergiant, if only foreground extinction is taken into account, or a hotter and more massive star, if any additional local extinction is included. A pre-eruption spectrum of the star reveals strong H$\alpha$ emission having a narrow line core with a width of about 200 km s −1 (FWHM) and with wings extending to ± 2000 km s −1. The post-eruption spectrum is fairly flat and featureless with only H$\alpha$, Na I D, [Ca II], and the Ca II near-infrared triplet in emission, with very little change in the shape of H$\alpha$ over 120 days. As in many previous intermediate-luminosity transients, AT 2019krl 2 Andrews et al. shows remarkable similarities to both massive luminous blue variable (LBV) eruptions and SN 2008S-like events. However, in this case, the information about the pre-eruption star allows us to clearly rule out both a super-AGB star and an electron-capture SN as the origin of this SN 2008S-like event. Instead, the data favor either a relatively unobscured blue supergiant (likely viewed pole-on) or a highly extinguished LBV with M > 20 M , confirming that BSGs or LBVs that may undergo mergers are a viable progenitor pathway to produce SN 2008S-like events.},

abstract = {Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) have been proposed as progenitors of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). In this scenario, bursts originate from the interaction between a young magnetar and its surrounding supernova remnant (SNR). Such a model could explain the repeating, apparently non-Poissonian nature of FRB121102, which appears to display quiescent and active phases. This bursting behaviour is better explained with a Weibull distribution, which includes parametrisation for clustering. We observed 10 SLSNe/LGRBs for 63 hours, looking for repeating FRBs with the Effelsberg-100 m radio telescope, but have not detected any bursts. We scale the burst rate of FRB121102 to an FRB121102-like source inhabiting each of our observed targets, and compare this rate to our upper burst rate limit on a source by source basis. By adopting a fiducial beaming fraction of 0.6, we obtain 99.99% and 83.4% probabilities that at least one, and at least half of our observed sources are beamed towards us respectively. One of our SLSN targets, PTF10hgi, is coincident with a persistent radio source, making it a possible analogue to FRB121102. We performed further observations on this source using the Effelsberg-100 m and Parkes-64 m radio telescopes. Assuming that PTF10hgi contains an FRB121102-like source, the probabilities of not detecting any bursts from a Weibull distribution during our observations are 14% and 16% for Effelsberg and Parkes respectively. We conclude by showing that a survey of many short observations increases burst detection probability for a source with Weibull distributed bursting activity.},

Two forms of the luminosity function (LF) are assumed : a log-normal form and a single power-law form, respectively. The rate of SLSNe-I is assumed to be proportional to the cosmic star formation rate with an additional redshift evolution of (1 + z) $\alpha$. Our results show that the single power-low form fits the data better than the log-normal form, and the event rate of SLSNe-I is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate directly (with $\alpha$ = 0). We measure the SLSNe-I rate to be about 40 yr −1 Gpc −3 at a weighted mean redshift of z = 0.89, which is consistent with previous works.},

abstract = {The phenomenology of anomalous X-ray pulsars is usually interpreted within the paradigm of very highly magnetized neutron stars, also known as magnetars. According to this paradigm, the persistent emission of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) is powered by the decay of the magnetic field. However, an alternative scenario in which the persistent emission is explained through accretion is also discussed in literature. In particular, AXP 4U 0142+61 has been suggested to be either an accreting neutron star or a white dwarf. Here, we rule out this scenario based on the the observed X-ray variability properties of the source. We directly compare the observed power spectra of 4U 0142+61 and of two other magnetars, 1RXS J170849.0−400910 and 1E 1841−045 with that of the X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262, and of the intermediate polar GK Persei. In addition, we include a bright young radio pulsar PSR B1509-58 for comparison. We show that, unlike accreting sources, no aperiodic variability within the expected frequency range is observed in the power density spectrum of the magnetars and the radio pulsar. Considering that strong variability is an established feature of all accreting systems from young stellar objects to super-massive black holes and the absence of the variability reports from other magnetars, we conclude that our results also indicate that magnetars, in general, are not powered by accretion.},

abstract = {With the localization of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to galaxies similar to the Milky Way and the detection of a bright radio burst from SGR J1935+2154 with energy comparable to extragalactic radio bursts, a magnetar origin for FRBs is evident. By studying the environments of FRBs, evidence for magnetar formation mechanisms not observed in the Milky Way may become apparent. In this paper, we use a sample of FRB host galaxies and a complete sample of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) hosts to determine whether FRB progenitors are consistent with a population of magnetars born in CCSNe. We also compare the FRB hosts to the hosts of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) to determine whether the population of FRB hosts is compatible with a population of transients that may be connected to millisecond magnetars. After using a novel approach to scale the stellar masses and star-formation rates of each host galaxy to be statistically representative of z = 0 galaxies, we find that the CCSN hosts and FRBs are consistent with arising from the same distribution. Furthermore, the FRB host distribution is inconsistent with the distribution of SLSNe-I and LGRB hosts. With the current sample of FRB host galaxies, our analysis shows that FRBs are consistent with a population of magnetars born through the collapse of giant, highly magnetic stars.},

abstract = {The success of supernova (SN) cosmology in the determination of the accelerating expansion of the Universe is based upon the distance standardisation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which relies on a single global linear relationship between their brightness and colour, the $\beta$ parameter. However, there are several pieces of evidence and many physical reasons to believe that this relation is not universal and may change within different subgroups, or even among individual objects. In this work, by allowing $\beta$ to vary with different observed properties in the cosmological fits, we coherently bring together several loose ends of SN science: their distance calibration and the origin of the mass-step, the presence of multiple intrinsic populations related to environment, and a difference in average reddening laws for different galaxies. Although the inferred cosmological parameters are always consistent with previous studies that assume a single colour-brightness relation, we find that the SN data favour nonuniversal distributions of $\beta$ when divided according to SN colour and/or host-galaxy mass. For galaxy mass, we obtain a $\beta$-step relation in which low $\beta$ values occur in more massive galaxies, a trend that can be explained by differing dust reddening laws for two types of environments. For colour, we find that bluer/redder SNe Ia are consistent with a lower/larger $\beta$. This trend is explained with $\beta$ being a combination of a low intrinsic colour-luminosity relation dominant in bluer SNe and a higher extrinsic reddening relation dominant at larger colours. The galaxy mass-step always provides better distance calibration, regardless of the multiple $\beta$ approaches, and we find that its origin is a difference in intrinsic colour-luminosity properties of SNe Ia in two types of environments. Additionally, we find that blue SNe in low-mass environments are better standard candles than the others. Our simple inclusion of multiple colour-brightness relations based on colour and galaxy mass can be readily used in present and future cosmological analyses.},

abstract = {On 17 August 2017, less than two years after the direct detection of gravitational radiation from the merger of two ∼30 M ⊙ black holes, a binary neutron star merger was identified as the source of a gravitational wave signal of ∼100 s duration that occurred at less than 50 Mpc from Earth. A short GRB was independently identified in the same sky area by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites for high energy astrophysics, which turned out to be associated with the gravitational event. Prompt follow-up observations at all wavelengths led first to the detection of an optical and infrared source located in the spheroidal galaxy NGC4993 and, with a delay of ∼10 days, to the detection of radio and X-ray signals. This paper revisits these observations and focusses on the early optical/infrared source, which was thermal in nature and powered by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes of elements synthesized via rapid neutron capture during the merger and in the phases immediately following it. The far-reaching consequences of this event for cosmic nucleosynthesis and for the history of heavy elements formation in the Universe are also illustrated.},

abstract = {Current cosmological data exhibit a tension between inferences of the Hubble constant, H0, derived from early-and late-universe measurements. One proposed solution is to introduce a new component in the early universe, which initially acts as "early dark energy" (EDE), thus decreasing the physical size of the sound horizon imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and increasing the inferred H0. Previous EDE analyses have shown this model can relax the H0 tension, but the CMB-preferred value of the density fluctuation amplitude, $\sigma$8, increases in EDE as compared to $\Lambda$CDM, increasing tension with large-scale structure (LSS) data. We show that the EDE model fit to CMB and SH0ES data yields scale-dependent changes in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM, including 10% more power at k = 1 h/Mpc. Motivated by this observation, we reanalyze the EDE scenario, considering LSS data in detail. We also update previous analyses by including Planck 2018 CMB likelihoods, and perform the first search for EDE in Planck data alone, which yields no evidence for EDE. We consider several data set combinations involving the primary CMB, CMB lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, galaxy clustering, and local distance-ladder data (SH0ES). While the EDE component is weakly detected (3$\sigma$) when including the SH0ES data and excluding most LSS data, this drops below 2$\sigma$ when further LSS data are included. Further, this result is in tension with strong constraints imposed on EDE by CMB and LSS data without SH0ES, which show no evidence for this model. We also show that physical priors on the fundamental scalar field parameters further weaken evidence for EDE. We conclude that the EDE scenario is, at best, no more likely to be concordant with all current cosmological data sets than $\Lambda$CDM, and appears unlikely to resolve the H0 tension.},

abstract = {A constant Early Dark Energy (EDE) component contributing a fraction fEDE(zc) ∼ 10% of the energy density of the universe around zc 3500 and diluting as or faster than radiation afterwards, can provide a simple resolution to the Hubble tension, the ∼ 5$\sigma$ discrepancy-in the $\Lambda$CDM context-between the H0 value derived from early-and late-universe observations. However, it has been pointed out that including Large-Scale Structure (LSS) data, which are in ∼ 3$\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies, might break some parameter degeneracy and alter these conclusions. We reassess the viability of the EDE against a host of high-and low-redshift measurements, by combining LSS observations from recent weak lensing (WL) surveys with CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), growth function (FS) and Supernova Ia (SNIa) data. Introducing a model whose only parameter is fEDE(zc), we report in agreement with past work a ∼ 2$\sigma$ preference for non-zero fEDE(zc) from Planck CMB data alone, while the tension with the local H0 measurement from SH0ES is reduced below 2$\sigma$. Adding BAO, FS and SNIa does not affect this conclusion, while the inclusion of a prior on H0 from SH0ES increase the preference for EDE over $\Lambda$CDM to the ∼ 3.6$\sigma$ level. After checking the EDE non-linear matter power spectrum as predicted by standard semi-analytical algorithms via a dedicated set of N-body simulations, we test the 1-parameter EDE cosmology against WL data. We find that it does not significantly worsen the fit to the S8 measurement as compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and that current WL observations do not exclude the EDE resolution to the Hubble tension. We also caution against the interpretation of constraints obtained from combining statistically inconsistent data sets within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In light of the CMB lensing anomalies, we show that the lensing-marginalized CMB data also favor non-zero fEDE(zc) at ∼ 2$\sigma$, predicts H0 in 1.4$\sigma$ agreement with SH0ES and S8 in 1.5$\sigma$ and 0.8$\sigma$ agreement with KiDS-VIKING and DES respectively. There still exists however a ∼ 2.5$\sigma$ tension with the joint results from KiDS-VIKING and DES. With an eye on Occam's razor, we finally discuss promising extensions of the EDE cosmology that could allow to fully restore cosmological concordance.},

The discovery of such surviving companions could therefore provide conclusive support for the SD model. Several years ago, a new type of mysterious variables was discovered, the so-called blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs). Here we show that all the properties of BLAPs can be reasonably well reproduced if they are indeed such surviving companions, in contrast to other proposed channels. This suggests that BLAPs could potentially be the long-sought surviving companions of SNe Ia. Our model also predicts a new channel for forming single hot subdwarf stars, consistent with a small group in the present hot-subdwarf-star sample.},

In this analysis, we hold fixed Rung 1 as the distance to the LMC determined to 1% using Detached Eclipsing Binary stars. For Rung 2 we analyze two methods, the TRGB and Cepheid distances for the luminosity calibration of Type Ia supernovae in nearby galaxies. For Rung 3 we analyze various modern digital supernova samples in the Hubble flow, such as the Cal{\'{a}}n-Tololo, CfA, CSP, and Supercal datasets. This metadata analysis demonstrates that the TRGB calibration yields smaller H 0 values than the Cepheid calibration, a direct consequence of the systematic difference in the distance moduli calibrated from these two methods. Selecting the three most independent possible methodologies/bandpasses, namely, the V-band by Phillips et al. (1999), the J-band by Kattner et al. (2012), and the B-band by Riess et al. (2019), we obtain H 0 =69.9±0.8 and H 0 =73.5±0.7 km s −1 Mpc −1 from the TRGB and Cepheid calibrations, respectively. This subset reveals a significant 3.4 $\sigma$ systematic difference in the calibration of Rung 2. If Rung 1 and Rung 2 are held fixed, the different formalisms developed for standardizing the supernova peak magnitudes yield consistent results, with a standard deviation of 1.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 , that is, Type Ia supernovae are able to anchor Rung 3 with 2% precision. This study demonstrates that Type Ia supernovae have provided a remarkably robust calibration of R3 for over 25 years.},

Phase I shows a hot blue spectrum with signatures of ionised circumstellar material (CSM), Phase II has the appearance of broad SN features, consistent with those seen in a Type IIb supernova at maximum light, and Phase III is that of a supernova interacting with helium-rich CSM, similar to a Type Ibn supernova. This event provides an apparently rare opportunity to view the inner workings of an interacting supernova. The observed properties can be explained by the explosion of a star in an aspherical CSM. The initial light is emitted from an extended CSM (∼ 4000 R), which ionises the exterior unshocked material. Some days after, the SN photosphere envelops this region, leading to the appearance of a SN IIb. Over time, the photosphere recedes in velocity space, revealing interaction between the supernova ejecta and the CSM that partially obscures the supernova nebular phase. Modelling of the initial spectrum reveals a surface composition consistent with compact H-deficient Wolf-Rayet and LBV stars. Such configurations may not be unusual, with SNe IIb being known to have signs of interaction so at least some SNe IIb and SNe Ibn may be the same phenomena viewed from different angles or, possibly with differing CSM configurations.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are believed to be a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf, but the mass of their progenitors is still an open problem. In near-Chandrasekhar-mass (near-M Ch) models of SNe Ia, the central density reaches 10 9 g cm −3. The electron chemical potential becomes higher than the Q-values of electron capture (EC) transitions between f p-shell nuclei, so a portion of the available electrons is captured by iron group elements and thus neutron-rich isotopes are formed. Since EC reaction rates are sensitive to the density, the degree of neutronization is a key to distinguish near-and sub-M Ch models. In order to compare observations and theoretical models, an accurate treatment of EC reactions is necessary. In previous theoretical works, however, effects of electron screening on ECs are ignored. Screening lowers EC rates and thus leads to a higher electron fraction. We implement electron screening on ECs to calculate explosive SN Ia nucleosynthesis in a near-M Ch single degenerate model. It is found that some of neutron-rich nuclear abundances, namely those of 46, 48 Ca, 50 Ti, 54 Cr, 58 Fe, 64 Ni and 67, 70 Zn, decrease when screening effects on ECs are considered. Of these, 50 Ti, 54 Cr and 58 Fe are particularly interesting because a significant portion of the solar abundance of these nuclei is presumed to originate from SNe Ia. We conclude that implementing the screening effect on ECs in modern SN Ia models is desirable to precisely calculate abundances of neutron-rich nuclides.},

abstract = {The interaction of a SN ejecta with a pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM) is one of the most promising energy sources for a variety of optical transients. Recently, a semi-analytic method developed by Chatzopoulos et al. (2012, hereafter CWV12) has been commonly used to describe the optical light curve behaviors under such a scenario. We find that the expressions for many key results in CWV12 are too complicated for readers to make order of magnitude estimation or parameter dependency judgement. Based on the same physical picture, here we independently re-derive all the formulae and re-establish a set of reader friendly formula expressions. Nevertheless, we point out and correct some minor errors or typos existing in CWV12. EJECTA-CSM INTERACTION MODEL CWV12 combined the self-similar solutions presented by Chevalier (1982) with Arnett (1982) diffusion modeling formalism to calculate the bolometric optical light curves powered by CSM-ejecta interaction. With the SN kinetic energy E SN and the ejecta mass M ej , the density profile could be expressed as (Kasen et al. 2016) $\rho$ ej (v, t) =      $\zeta$ $\rho$ Mej v 3 tr t 3 r vtrt −$\delta$ , v < v tr , $\zeta$ $\rho$ Mej v 3 tr t 3 r vtrt −n , v ≥ v tr , (1) where the transition velocity v tr = $\zeta$ v (E SN /M ej) 1/2 is obtained from the density continuity condition 1. The outer density index n depends on SN progenitor. For core-collapse SNe typical values are $\delta$ = 1, n = 10 (Kasen et al. 2016). The coefficients $\zeta$ $\rho$ and $\zeta$ v are given in Eqs (6) and (7) of (Kasen et al. 2016). Since v tr cannot be observed directly, a constant x 0 is introduced to relate v tr and the characteristic velocity v SN of SN expansion, i.e. v SN = v tr /x 0. The fraction of outer region ejecta mass is $\xi$ M = x 3 0 − x n 0 n−3 3−$\delta$ x 3 0 + (x 3 0 − x n 0). (2) Assume that the CSM density profile is: $\rho$ CSM (r) = qr −s. (3) where q is a scaling factor, which could be set as q = $\rho$ CSM,in R s CSM,in , where $\rho$ CSM,in is the density at the CSM inner radius R CSM,in. s is the power-law index for the CSM density profile. s = 2 is wind-like CSM profile and s = 0 is shell-like CSM profile. The forward shock(FS)/reverse shock(RS) dynamics could be described by a self-similar solution (Chevalier 1982) R FS = R CSM,in + $\beta$ FS t tr v tr t t tr n−3 n−s (4) R RS = R CSM,in + $\beta$ RS t tr v tr t t tr n−3 n−s , (5) 1 CWV12 took a scaling parameter for the ejecta density profile as g n = [2(5−$\delta$)(n−5)E SN ] (n−3)/2 /[(3−$\delta$)(n−3)M ej ] (n−5)/2 /(4$\pi$(n−$\delta$)).

abstract = {We pioneer the black hole mass gap as a powerful new tool for constraining modified gravity theories. These theories predict fifth forces that alter the structure and evolution of population-III stars, exacerbating the pair-instability. This results in the formation of lighter astrophysical black holes and lowers both the upper and lower edges of the mass gap. These effects are explored using detailed numerical simulations to derive quantitative predictions that can be used as theoretical inputs for Bayesian data analysis. We discuss detection strategies in light of current and upcoming data as well as complications that may arise due to environmental screening. To demonstrate the constraining power of the mass gap, we present a novel test of the strong equivalence principle where we apply our results to an analysis of the first ten LIGO/Virgo binary black hole merger events to obtain a 7% bound on the relative difference between the gravitational constant experienced by baryonic matter, and that experienced by black holes, ∆G/G. The recent GW190521 event resulting from two black holes with masses in the canonical mass gap can be explained by modified gravity if the event originated from an unscreened galaxy where the strength of gravity is enhanced by ∼ 30% or reduced by ∼ 50% relative to its strength in the solar system.},

To study the evolution of binary populations and the consequent formation of these objects, many methods have been developed over the years, of which a robust approach named binary population synthesis (BPS) warrants special attention. This approach has seen widespread use in many areas of astrophysics, including but not limited to analyses of the stellar content of galaxies , research on galactic chemical evolution, and studies concerning star formation and cosmic re-ionization. In this review, we discuss the role of BPS, its general picture, and the various components that comprise it. We pay special attention to the stability criteria for mass transfer in binaries, as this stability largely determines the fate of binary systems. We conclude with our perspectives regarding the future of this field.},

The transfer code SEDONA has been developed to calculate the light curves, spectra, and polarization of aspherical supernova models. From the onset of free expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative transfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray transfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of the temperature structure. Line fluorescence processes can also be treated directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer calculation, providing a direct link between multidimensional hydrodynamic explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques applied in SEDONA and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations. We find that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for complicated multidimensional configurations. We also investigate the accuracy of a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely, the stationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.},

abstract = {We undertake a theoretical study of the near-infrared (NIR) light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In these bands, the light curves are distinguished by a secondary maximum occurring roughly 20Y30 days after the initial one. Using time-dependent multigroup radiative transfer calculations, we calculate the UBVRIJHK-band light curves of model SN Ia ejecta structures. Our synthetic NIR light curves show distinct secondary maxima and provide favorable fits to observed SNe Ia. We offer a detailed explanation of the origin of the NIR secondary maximum, which is shown to relate directly to the ionization evolution of iron group elements in the ejecta. This understanding provides immediate insight into the dependence of the NIR light curves on the physical properties of the ejecta and in particular explains why brighter supernovae have a later and more prominent secondary maximum. We demonstrate the dependence of the NIR light curves on the mass of 56 Ni, the degree of 56 Ni mixing, the mass of electron capture elements, the progenitor metallicity, and the abundance of intermediate-mass elements (especially calcium). The secondary maximum is shown to be a valuable diagnostic of these important physical parameters. The models further confirm that SNe Ia should be excellent standard candles in the NIR, with a dispersion of P0.2 mag even when the physical properties of the ejecta are varied widely. This study emphasizes the consummate value of NIR observations in probing the structure of SNe Ia and in furthering their cosmological utility.},

Hence, ultra-wide triple white-dwarfs (TWDs) can be perturbed, by flyby stars, to sufficiently high outer eccentricity such that the triple becomes dynamically unstable. An unstable triple undergoes multiple binary-single resonant encounters between all three WDs. These encounters might result in a direct collision between any random two WDs and lead to a Type Ia supernova (SN) event. In case where the multiple resonant encounters did not produce a collision a compact binary is formed (while the third WD is ejected), this binary either collides or merges via gravitational wave emission, similar to the classic double-degenerate (DD) channel. In this research study we estimate the galactic rates of Type Ia SN from this channel to be 4% − 46% and an addition of 1% − 10% to the DD scenario.},

abstract = {We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019yvq, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting several peculiar properties including an excess of UV/optical flux within days of explosion, a high Si II velocity, and a low peak luminosity. Photometry near the time of first light places new constraints on the rapid rise of the UV/optical flux excess and shows that it peaks ∼ 2 days earlier than previously thought. A near-infrared spectrum at +173 days after maximum light places strict limits on the presence of H or He emission, effectively excluding the presence of a nearby non-degenerate star at the time of explosion. New optical spectra, acquired at +128 and +150 days after maximum light, confirm the presence of [Ca II]$\lambda$7300{\AA}$\lambda$7300{\AA} and persistent Ca II NIR triplet emission as SN 2019yvq transitions into the nebular phase. The lack of [O I]$\lambda$6300{\AA}$\lambda$6300{\AA} emission disfavors the violent merger of two C/O white dwarfs (WDs) but the merger of a C/O WD with a He WD cannot be excluded. We compare our findings with several models in the literature postulated to explain the early flux excess including double-detonation explosions, 56 Ni mixing into the outer ejecta during ignition, and interaction with Hand He-deficient circumstellar material. Each model may be able to explain both the early flux excess and the nebular [Ca II] emission, but none of the models can reconcile the high photospheric velocities with the low peak luminosity without introducing new discrepancies.},

Photometrically, the objects of our sample show a diverse late-time behaviour, some of them fading quite rapidly after a light-curve break at ∼ 150-200 d. The latter is likely the result of flux redistribution into the infrared, possibly caused by dust formation, rather than a true bolometric effect. Nebular spectra of superluminous SNe Ia are characterised by weak or absent [Fe iii] emission, pointing at a low ejecta ionisation state as a result of high densities. To constrain the ejecta and 56 Ni masses of superluminous SNe Ia, we compare the observed bolometric light curve of SN 2009dc with synthetic model light curves, focusing on the radioactive tail after ∼ 60 d. Models with enough 56 Ni to explain the light-curve peak by radioactive decay, and at the same time sufficient mass to keep the ejecta velocities low, fail to reproduce the observed light-curve tail of SN 2009dc because of too much $\gamma$-ray trapping. We instead propose a model with ∼ 1 M ⊙ of 56 Ni and ∼ 2 M ⊙ of ejecta, which may be interpreted as the explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) enshrouded by 0.6-0.7 M ⊙ of C/O-rich material , as it could result from a merger of two massive C/O WDs. This model reproduces the late light curve of SN 2009dc well. A flux deficit at peak may be compensated by light from the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding material.},

We investigate this in relation to the famous SN iPTF14hls, which received a lot of attention and multiple interpretations in the literature, however whose nature and source of energy still remains unknown. Aims. We demonstrate the great similarity between SN 2020faa and iPTF14hls during the first 6 months, and use this comparison both to forecast the evolution of SN 2020faa and to reflect on the less well observed early evolution of iPTF14hls. Methods. We present and analyse our observational data, consisting mainly of optical LCs from the Zwicky Transient Facility in the gri bands as well as a sequence of optical spectra. We construct colour curves, a bolometric LC, compare ejecta-velocity and Black-body radius evolutions for the two supernovae (SNe), as well as for more typical Type II SNe. Results. The LCs show a great similarity with those of iPTF14hls over the first 6 months, in luminosity, timescale and colours. Also the spectral evolution of SN 2020faa is that of a Type II SN, although it probes earlier epochs than those available for iPTF14hls. Conclusions. The similar LC behaviour is suggestive of SN 2020faa being a new iPTF14hls. We present these observations now to advocate follow-up observations, since most of the more striking evolution of SN iPTF14hls came later, with LC undulations and a spectacular longevity. On the other hand, for SN 2020faa we have better constraints on the explosion epoch than we had for iPTF14hls, and we have been able to spectroscopically monitor it from earlier phases than was done for the more famous sibling.},

abstract = {We perform a systematic study of the 56 Ni mass (M Ni) of 27 stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) with both well-constrained rise times and late-time coverage (>60 days) by modeling their light-curve tails. Based on this sample, we find that using "Arnett's rule" with observed peak times (t p) and luminosities (L p) will overestimate M Ni for SESN by a factor of ∼2. Recently, Khatami & Kasen (2019) presented a new analytic model relating t p and L p of a radioactive-powered SN to its M Ni that addresses several limitations of Arnett-like models, but depends on a dimensionless parameter $\beta$, which is sensitive to details of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. Using the observed t p , L p , and tail-measured M Ni values for the sample of SESN, we observationally calibrate $\beta$ for the first time-finding 0.0 < $\beta$ < 1.71 with a median value of 0.70. Despite scatter, we demonstrate that the model of Khatami & Kasen (2019) coupled with these empirically-calibrated $\beta$ values yields a significantly improved measurement of M Ni when only photospheric data is available. However, these observationally-constrained $\beta$ values are systematically lower than those inferred from numerical simulations, due primarily to the observed sample having significantly higher (0.2-0.4 dex) L p for a given M Ni. We investigate this discrepancy and find that while effects due to composition, mixing, and asymmetry can increase L p none can explain the systematically low $\beta$ values. However, the discrepancy with simulations can be alleviated if ∼7-50% of L p for the observed sample comes from sources other than the radioactive decay of 56 Ni. Either shock cooling or magnetar spin down could provide the requisite luminosity, with the former requiring that a substantive fraction of SESN undergo late-stage mass loss or envelope inflation. Finally, we find that even with our improved measurements, the M Ni values of SESN are a factor of ∼3 larger than those of hydrogen-rich Type II SN, indicating that these supernovae are inherently different in terms of their progenitor initial mass distributions or explosion mechanisms.},

abstract = {Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) present a unique opportunity for investigating the evolutionary channels and mechanisms governing the evolution of stripped-envelope SN progenitors due to a variety of observational constraints available. Comparison of these constraints with the full distribution of theoretical properties not only help ascertain the prevalence of observed properties in nature, but can also reveal currently unobserved populations. In this follow-up paper, we use the large grid of models presented in Sravan et al. (2019) to derive distributions of single and binary SNe IIb progenitor properties and compare them to constraints from three independent observational probes: multi-band SN light-curves, direct progenitor detections, and X-ray/radio observations. Consistent with previous work, we find that while current observations exclude single stars as SN IIb progenitors, SN IIb progenitors in binaries can account for them. We also find that the distributions indicate the existence of an unobserved dominant population of binary SNe IIb at low metallicity that arise due to mass transfer initiated on the Hertzsprung Gap. In particular, our models indicate the existence of a group of highly stripped (envelope mass ∼ 0.1 − 0.2M) progenitors that are compact (< 50R) and blue (T eff 10 5 K) with ∼ 10 4.5 − 10 5.5 L and low density circumstellar mediums. As discussed in Sravan et al. (2019), this group is necessary to account for SN IIb fractions and likely exist regardless of metallicity. The detection of the unobserved populations indicated by our models would support weak stellar winds and inefficient mass transfer in SN IIb progenitors.},

While the majority of stars above 9 M will become red supergiants (RSGs), the terminal state of these massive stars can be heavily influenced by their mass-loss histories. Periods of enhanced circumstellar wind activity can drive stars off the RSG branch of the HR Diagram. This phase, known as post-RSG evolution, may well be tied to high mass-loss events or eruptions as seen in the Luminous Blue Variables and other massive stars. This article highlights some of the recent observational and modeling studies that seek to characterize this unique class of stars, the post-RSGs, and link them to other massive objects on the HR Diagram such as LBVs, Yellow Hypergiants, and dusty RSGs.},

abstract = {We present a Monte Carlo radiative transfer technique for calculating synthetic spectropo-larimetry for multidimensional supernova explosion models. The approach utilizes 'virtual-packets' that are generated during the propagation of the Monte Carlo quanta and used to compute synthetic observables for specific observer orientations. Compared to extracting synthetic observables by direct binning of emergent Monte Carlo quanta, this virtual-packet approach leads to a substantial reduction in the Monte Carlo noise. This is not only vital for calculating synthetic spectropolarimetry (since the degree of polarization is typically very small) but also useful for calculations of light curves and spectra. We first validate our approach via application of an idealized test code to simple geometries. We then describe its implementation in the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS and present test calculations for simple models for Type Ia supernovae. Specifically, we use the well-known one-dimensional W7 model to verify that our scheme can accurately recover zero polarization from a spherical model, and to demonstrate the reduction in Monte Carlo noise compared to a simple packet-binning approach. To investigate the impact of aspherical ejecta on the polarization spectra, we then use ARTIS to calculate synthetic observables for prolate and oblate ellipsoidal models with Type Ia supernova compositions.},

abstract = {Context. Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) are rare, powerful explosions whose mechanism and progenitors remain elusive. Several studies have shown a preference for SLSNe I to occur in low-metallicity, actively star-forming dwarf galaxies. Aims. We investigate whether the host galaxies of SLSNe I show increased evidence for interaction. Galaxy interaction can trigger star formation and provide favourable conditions for these exceptional explosions to take place. Methods. Based on SLSN host galaxy images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we narrowed down a sample of 42 images obtained in the rest-frame ultraviolet over the redshift range between 0 < z < 2. The number of host galaxy companions was measured by counting the number of objects detected within a given projected radius from the host. As a comparison, we used two different Monte Carlo-based methods to estimate the expected average number of companion objects in the same HST images, as well as a sample of 32 dwarf galaxies that have hosted long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Results. About 50% of SLSN I host galaxies have at least one major companion (within a flux ratio of 1:4) within 5 kpc. The average number of major companions per SLSN I host galaxy is 0.70 +0.19 −0.14. Our two Monte Carlo comparison methods yield a lower number of companions for random objects of similar brightness in the same image or for the SLSN host after randomly redistributing the sources in the same image. The Anderson-Darling test shows that this difference is statistically significant (p-value < 10 −3) independent of the redshift range. The same is true for the projected distance distribution of the companions. The SLSN I hosts are, thus, found in areas of their images, where the object number density is greater than average. SLSN I hosts have more companions than GRB hosts (0.44 +0.25 −0.13 companions per host distributed over 25% of the hosts) but the difference is not statistically significant. The difference between their separations is, however, marginally significant with SLSN companions being closer, on average, than those of GRBs. Conclusions. The dwarf galaxies hosting SLSNe I are often part of interacting systems. This suggests that SLSNe I progenitors are formed after a recent burst of star formation. Low metallicity alone cannot explain this tendency.},

abstract = {Context. We present observations of SN 2019tsf (ZTF19ackjszs) and SN 2019oys (ZTF19abucwzt). These two stripped envelope (SE) Type Ib supernovae (SNe) suddenly showed a (re-)brightening in their late light curves. We investigate this in the context of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction with previously ejected material, a phenomenon that is unusual among SE SNe. Aims. We use our follow-up photometry and spectroscopy for these supernovae to demonstrate the presence of CSM interaction, estimate the properties of the CSM and discuss why the signals are so different for the two objects. Methods. We present and analyse observational data, consisting of optical light curves and spectra. For SN 2019oys we also have detections in radio as well as limits from UV and X-rays. Results. Both light curves show spectacular re-brightening after about 100 days. In the case of SN 2019tsf, the re-brightening is followed by a new period of decline, and the spectra never show signs of narrow emission lines that would indicate CSM interaction. On the contrary, SN 2019oys made a spectral makeover from a Type Ib to a spectrum clearly dominated by CSM interaction at the light curve brightening phase. Deep Keck spectra reveal a plethora of narrow high ionization lines, including coronal lines, and the radio observations show strong emission. Conclusions. The rather similar light curve behaviour-with a late linear rebrightening-of these two Type Ib SE SNe indicate CSM interaction as the powering source. For SN 2019oys the evidence for a phase where the ejecta hit H-rich material, likely ejected from the progenitor star, is conspicuous. We observe strong narrow lines of H and He, but also a plethora of high ionization lines, including coronal lines, revealing shock interaction. Spectral simulations of SN 2019oys show two distinct density components, one with density > ∼ 10 9 cm −3 , dominated by somewhat broader, low ionization lines of H I, He I, Na I and Ca II, and one with narrow, high ionization lines at a density ∼ 10 6 cm −3. The former is strongly affected by electron scattering, while the latter is unaffected by this. The evidence for CSM interaction in SN 2019oys is corroborated by detections in radio. On the contrary, for SN 2019tsf, we find little evidence in the spectra for any CSM interaction.},

The inference on R is further tested and refined by including direct information on the occurrence rate of gravitational collapse events in the Milky Way and in the Local Group, obtained from neutrino telescopes and electromagnetic surveys. A conservative treatment of the errors yields a combined rate R = 1.63 ± 0.46 (100 yr) −1 ; the corresponding time between core collapse supernova events turns out to be T = 61 +24 −14 yr.

Some of them rival supernovae in total radiative output, and the mass loss is crucial for subsequent evolution. Some are supernova impostors, including SN precursor outbursts, while others are true SN events shrouded by material that was ejected earlier. Luminous Blue Variable stars (LBV's) are traditionally cited in relation with giant eruptions, though this connection is not well established. After four decades of research, the fundamental causes of giant eruptions and LBV events remain elusive. This review outlines the basic relevant physics, with a brief summary of essential observational facts. Reasons are described for the spectrum and emergent radiation temperature of an opaque outflow. Many proposed mechanisms are noted for instabilities in the star's photosphere, in its iron opacity peak zones, and in its central region.

abstract = {The nature of the peculiar 'Ca-rich' SN 2019ehk in the nearby galaxy M100 remains unclear. Its origin has been debated as either a stripped core-collapse supernova or a thermonuclear helium detonation event. Here, we present very late-time photometry of the transient obtained with the Keck I telescope at ≈ 280 days from peak light. Using the photometry to perform accurate flux calibration of a contemporaneous nebular phase spectrum, we measure an [O I] luminosity of (0.23−0.78)×10 38 erg s −1 and [Ca II] luminosity of (3.4 − 9.1) × 10 38 erg s −1 over the range of the uncertain extinction along the line of sight. We use these measurements to derive lower limits on the synthesized oxygen mass of ≈ 0.005 − 0.05 M. The oxygen mass is a sensitive tracer of the progenitor mass for core-collapse supernovae, and our estimate is consistent with explosions of very low mass CO cores of 1.45 − 1.5 M , corresponding to He core masses of ≈ 1.8 − 2.0 M. We present high quality peak light optical spectra of the transient and highlight features of hydrogen in both the early ('flash') and photospheric phase spectra, that suggest the presence of 0.02 M of hydrogen in the progenitor at the time of explosion. The presence of H, together with the large [Ca II]/[O I] ratio (≈ 10 − 15) in the nebular phase is consistent with SN 2019ehk being a Type IIb core-collapse supernova from a stripped low mass (≈ 9−9.5 M) progenitor, similar to the Ca-rich SN IIb iPTF 15eqv. These results provide evidence for a likely class of 'Ca-rich' core-collapse supernovae from stripped low mass progenitors in star forming environments, distinct from the thermonuclear Ca-rich gap transients in old environments.},

Described are the specific characteristics, the evolutionary state and what they are connected to other phases and types of massive stars. Our current knowledge of LBVs is limited by the fact that in comparison to other stellar classes and phases only a few "true" LBVs are known. This results from the lack of a unique, fast and always reliable identification scheme for LBVs. It literally takes time to get a true classification of a LBV. In addition the short duration of the LBV phase makes it even harder to catch and identify a star as LBV. We summarize here what is known so far, give an overview of the LBV population and the list of LBV host galaxies. LBV are clearly an important and still not fully understood phase in the live of (very) massive stars, especially due to the large and time variable mass loss during the LBV phase. We like to emphasize again the problem how to clearly identify LBV and that there are more than just one type of LBVs: The giant eruption LBVs or $\eta$ Car analogs and the S Dor cycle LBVs.},

abstract = {Accepted-. Received-; in original form-ABSTRACT We present an analysis of the light curve (LC) decline rates (∆m 15) of 407 normal and peculiar supernovae (SNe) Ia and global parameters of their host galaxies. As previously known, there is a significant correlation between the ∆m 15 of normal SNe Ia and global ages (morphologies, colours, masses) of their hosts. On average, those normal SNe Ia that are in galaxies from the Red Sequence (early-type, massive, old hosts) have faster declining LCs in comparison with those from the Blue Cloud (late-type, less massive, younger hosts) of the colour-mass diagram. The observed correlations between the ∆m 15 of normal SNe Ia and hosts' parameters appear to be due to the superposition of at least two distinct populations of faster and slower declining normal SNe Ia from older and younger stellar components. We show, for the first time, that the ∆m 15 of 91bg-and 91T-like SNe, considered separately, are independent of host morphology and colour, but originate from different populations in the colour-mass diagram, diverging in age. 91bg-like (91T-like) SNe arise only from old (resp. young) stellar populations of hosts. On average, the youngest global ages of 02cx-like SNe hosts and their positions in the colour-mass diagram hint that these events likely originate from young stellar population, but they differ from 91T-like events in the LC decline rate. Finally, we discuss the possible explosion channels and present our favoured SN Ia models that have the potential to explain the observed SN-host relations.},

Jeffreys' scale of evidence is often used in the interpretation of evidence ratios. A natural question is, how often will you get it right when you choose on the basis of some threshold value of the evidence ratio? The evidence ratio will be different in different realizations of the data, and its utility can be examined in a Neyman-Pearson like way to see what the trade-offs are between statistical power (the chance of "getting it right") versus the false alarm rate, picking the alternative hypothesis when the null is actually true. I will show some simple examples which show that there can be a surprisingly large range for an evidence ratio under different realizations of the data. It seems best not to simply rely on Jeffrey's scale when decisions have to be taken, but also to examine the probability of taking the "wrong" decision if some evidence ratio is taken to be decisive. Interestingly, Turing knew this and applied it during WWII, although (like much else) he did not publish it.},

abstract = {The mass-loss rates of massive helium stars are one of the major uncertainties in modern astrophysics. Regardless of whether they were stripped by a binary companion or managed to peel off their outer layers by themselves, the influence and final fate of helium stars-in particular the resulting black hole mass-highly depends on their wind mass loss as stripped-envelope objects. While empirical mass-loss constraints for massive helium stars have improved over the last decades, the resulting recipes are limited to metallicities with the observational ability to sufficiently resolve individual stars. Yet, theoretical efforts have been hampered by the complexity of Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds arising from the more massive helium stars. In an unprecedented effort, we calculate next-generation stellar atmosphere models resembling massive helium main sequence stars with Fe-bump driven winds up to 500 M over a wide metallicity range between 2.0 and 0.02 Z. We uncover a complex $\Gamma$ e-dependency of WR-type winds and their metallicity-dependent breakdown. The latter can be related to the onset of multiple scattering, requiring higher L/M-ratios at lower metallicity. Based on our findings, we derive the first ever theoretically-motivated mass-loss recipe for massive helium stars. We also provide estimates for LyC and He ii ionizing fluxes, finding stripped helium stars to contribute considerably at low metallicity. In sharp contrast to OB-star winds, the mass loss for helium stars scales with the terminal velocity. While limited to the helium main sequence, our study marks a major step towards a better theoretical understanding of helium star evolution.},

abstract = {We present a public catalog of transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS), a magnitude-limited (m < 19 mag in either the g or r filter) survey for extragalactic transients in the ZTF public stream. We introduce cuts on survey coverage, sky visibility around peak light, and other properties unconnected to the nature of the transient, and show that the resulting statistical sample is spectroscopically 97% complete at <18 mag, 93% complete at <18.5 mag, and 75% complete at <19 mag. We summarize the fundamental properties of this population, identifying distinct duration-luminosity correlations in a variety of supernova (SN) classes and associating the majority of fast optical transients with well-established spectroscopic SN types (primarily SN Ibn and II/IIb). We measure the Type Ia SN and core-collapse (CC) SN rates and luminosity functions, which show good consistency with recent work. About 7% of CC SNe explode in very low-luminosity galaxies (M i > −16 mag), 10% in red-sequence galaxies, and 1% in massive ellipticals. We find no significant difference in the luminosity or color distributions between the host galaxies of Type II and Type Ib/c supernovae, suggesting that line-driven wind stripping does not play a major role in the loss of the hydrogen envelope from their progenitors.

ZTF18aalrxas was discovered while the optical emission was still rising towards the initial cooling peak (0.7 mag over 2 days). Our observations consist of multi-band (UV, optical) light-curves, and optical spectra spanning from ≈ 0.7 d to ≈ 180 d past the explosion. We use a Monte-Carlo based non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model, that simultanously reproduces both the 56 Ni powered bolometric light curve and our nebular spectrum. This model is used to constrain the synthesized radioactive nickel mass (0.17 M ⊙) and the total ejecta mass (1.7 M ⊙) of the SN. The cooling emission is modeled using semi-analytical extended envelope models to constrain the progenitor radius (790 − 1050 R ⊙) at the time of explosion. Our nebular spectrum shows signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), and this spetrum is modeled and analysed to constrain the amount of ejected oxygen (0.3 − 0.5 M ⊙) and the total hydrogen mass (≈ 0.15 M ⊙) in the envelope of the progenitor. The oxygen mass of ZTF18aalrxas is consistent with a low (12 − 13 M ⊙) Zero Age Main Sequence mass progenitor. The light curves and spectra of ZTF18aalrxas are not consistent with massive single star SN Type IIb progenitor models. The presence of an extended hydrogen envelope of low mass, the presence of a dense CSM, the derived ejecta mass, and the late-time oxygen emission can all be explained in a binary model scenario.},

The electromagnetic emission during the first minutes to hours after the emergence of the shock from the stellar surface conveys important information about the final evolution and structure of the exploding star 3-6. However, the unpredictable nature of supernova events hinders the detection of this brief initial phase 7-9. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of a newly born, normal type IIb supernova (SN 2016gkg) 10 , which reveals a rapid brightening at optical wavelengths of about 40 magnitudes per day. The very frequent sampling of the observations allowed us to study in detail the outermost structure of the progenitor of the supernova and the physics of the emergence of the shock. We develop hydrodynamical models of the explosion that naturally account for the complete evolution of the supernova over distinct phases regulated by different physical processes. This result suggests that it is appropriate to decouple the treatment of the shock propagation from the unknown mechanism that triggers the explosion. On 2016 September 20 (dates are given in ut throughout), amateur astronomer V.B. was testing a camera mounted on his 40-cm Newtonian telescope. He pointed the telescope at NGC 613, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 26.4 Mpc, because at that time it was located near the zenith. Over approximately 1.5 h he imaged the galaxy with a clear filter while a supernova was being born, using 20-s exposures to avoid saturation caused by the bright city sky. An initial series of 40 images obtained during 20 min showed no sign of the supernova. From the combined image we obtained a 5$\sigma$ detection limit of 19.4 mag converted to the V band (see Methods). When observations resumed, after an interval of 45 min, the supernova became visible. During the remaining 25 min of observations the supernova doubled its flux (Fig. 1, Methods). The deep detection limit and frequent sampling during the initial rise constitute an unprecedented set of observations for a supernova discovery. A linear fit to the discovery photometry yields a remarkably fast rise rate of 43 ± 6 mag d −1. An extrapolation of this linear rise back in time to the proposed brightness of the progenitor of V ≈ 24 mag (Methods) suggests that SN 2016gkg exploded some time between 2:50 ut and 5:35 ut. This constraint of less than 3 h on the explosion epoch is one of the most stringent available 11-15. The prompt discovery and announcement of SN 2016gkg 10 triggered extensive monitoring that began less than one day later, including Swift X-ray, ultraviolet and optical observations 16,17. This permitted excellent coverage of the subsequent evolution of the supernova. Consequently, the cooling peak, which lasted for about three days, is one of the best observed so far. Follow-up spectroscopy provided a classification of SN 2016gkg as a type IIb supernova 16. Our photometric and spectro-scopic monitoring, which began less than one day after discovery, is described in Methods. In addition to these observations, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive contained images of the site of the supernova, obtained with the WFPC2 camera in 2001. An object was identified at the location of the supernova in all three available optical bands (F450W, F606W and F814W). Our analysis of these data and inferences about the progenitor system are given in Methods 16,18. To interpret the physical process that governed the behaviour of the supernova at the time of discovery, we plot the luminosity versus the rise rate and compare these data with available early optical observations of other supernovae and transients (Fig. 2; see ref. 9 for a similar 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 100 Time after 2016 September 20 4:30 UT (min) V-band magnitude Figure 1 | Photometry of SN 2016gkg at discovery.

The inset images display a combination of the first series of 40 images (left) and a combination of the last series of 21 images (right). Photometry is shown for individual images (grey squares), combinations of 5 or 6 images (blue diamonds) and combinations of 17-21 images (red triangles). The dashed line is a linear fit to the blue diamonds, with a slope of 43 ± 6 mag d −1. Error bars are 1$\sigma$.

abstract = {We present an analysis of the early, rising light curves of 18 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory and the La Silla-QUEST variability survey. We fit these early data flux using a simple power law (f(t) = $\alpha$ × t n) to determine the time of first light (t 0), and hence the rise time (t rise) from first light to peak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise (n). We find a mean uncorrected rise time of 18.98 ± 0.54 d, with individual supernova (SN) rise times ranging from 15.98 to 24.7 d. The exponent n shows significant departures from the simple 'fireball model' of n = 2 (or f(t) ∝ t 2) usually assumed in the literature. With a mean value of n = 2.44 ± 0.13, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. This deviation has implications for the distribution of 56 Ni throughout the SN ejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56 Ni mixing. The range of n found also confirms that the 56 Ni distribution is not standard throughout the population of SNe Ia, in agreement with earlier work measuring such abundances through spectral modelling. We also show that the duration of the very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of its maximal value, does not correlate with the light-curve shape or stretch used to standardize SNe Ia in cosmological applications. This has implications for the cosmological fitting of SN Ia light curves.},

abstract = {Received ABSTRACT Some supernova (SN) explosions show evidence for interaction with pre-existing non-spherically symmetric circumstellar medium (CSM) in their light curves, spectral line profiles, and polarization signatures. The origin of this aspherical CSM is unknown, but binary interactions have often been implicated. To better understand the connection with binary stars and to aid in the interpretation of observations, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations where an expanding spherical SN ejecta initialized with realistic density and velocity profiles collide with various aspherical CSM distributions. We consider CSM in the form of a circumstellar disk, colliding wind shells in binary stars with different orientations and distances from the SN progenitor, and bipolar lobes representing a scaled down version of the Homunculus nebula of $\eta$ Car. We study how our simulations map onto observables, including approximate light curves, indicative spectral line profiles at late times, and estimates of polarization signature. We find that the SN-CSM collision layer is composed of normal and oblique shocks, reflected waves, and other hydrodynamical phenomena that lead to acceleration and shear instabilities. As a result, the total shock heating power fluctuates in time, although the emerging light curve might be smooth if the shock interaction region is deeply embedded in the SN envelope. SNe with circumstellar disks or bipolar lobes exhibit late-time spectral line profiles symmetric with respect to the rest velocity and relatively high polarization. In contrast, SNe with colliding wind shells naturally lead to line profiles with asymmetric and time-evolving blue and red wings and low polarization. Given the high frequency of binaries among massive stars, interaction of SN ejecta with a pre-existing colliding wind shell must occur and the observed signatures could be used to characterize the binary companion.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white-dwarf stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive. A few theoretical scenarios for the progenitor systems have been suggested, which have been shown to agree with some observational properties of SNe Ia. However, several computational challenges prohibit a robust comparison to the observations. We focus on the observed t 0 − M Ni56 relation, where t 0 (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with M Ni56 (the synthesized 56 Ni mass). Comparing to the t 0 − M Ni56 relation bypasses the need for radiation transfer calculations, as the value of t 0 can be directly inferred from the ejecta. We show that all known SNe Ia models fail to reproduce the observed t 0 − M Ni56 correlation. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive (see Maoz, Mannucci & Nelemans 2014, for a review). A few theoretical scenarios for the progenitor systems have been suggested, including a Chandrasekhar-mass (Ch) or sub-Chandrasekhar-mass (sCh) WD that ignites due to some external interaction, and direct collision of WDs. Although these models have been shown to agree with some observational properties of SNe Ia, a few computational challenges prohibit a robust comparison to observations, such as the calculation of the propagating burning wave (see, e.g., R{\"{o}}pke 2017; Kushnir & Katz 2020) and accurate radiation transfer calculations (see reviews, e.g. Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000; Noebauer & Sim 2019). An observational property that can be calculated more robustly is the $\gamma$-ray escape time, t 0 (Stritzinger, et al. 2006; Scalzo, et al. 2014; Wygoda et al. 2019a), defined by (Jeffery 1999) f dep (t) = t 2 0 t 2 , f dep ≪ 1, (1) where t is the time since explosion and f dep (t) is the $\gamma$-ray deposition function, which describes the fraction of the generated $\gamma$-ray energy that is deposited in the ejecta. For a small enough $\gamma$-ray optical depth, each $\gamma$-ray photon has a small chance of colliding with matter, such that the deposition function is proportional to the column density, which scales as t −2. The value of t 0 can be measured from a bolometric light curve to a few percent accuracy (Wygoda et al. 2019a; Sharon & Kushnir 2020) due to an integral relation derived by Katz, Kushnir & Dong (2013), independent of the supernova distance. Together with M Ni56 , the 56 Ni mass synthesized in the explosion, an observed t 0 − M Ni56 relation can be constructed (Wygoda et al. 2019a), see Figure 1. The accurate determination of t 0 by Sharon & Kushnir (2020) reveals a positive correlation between t 0 and M Ni56. The methods used in previous works did not allow a robust determination of such a correlation, although there were some hints for its existence (Stritzinger, et al. 2006; Scalzo, et al. 2014; Wygoda et al. 2019a). The observed t 0 − M Ni56 correlation is similar to the Phillips relation (Phillips 1993), which relates the maximum flux to the width of the light curve in some band. However, unlike the Phillips relation, comparing to the t 0 − M Ni56 relation bypasses the need for radiation transfer calculations, as the value of t 0 can be directly inferred from the ejecta.},

abstract = {We carry out a comprehensive analysis of supernova SN 2001em covering a period of 19 years since discovery. SN 2001em is the oldest supernova known to have undergone a metamorphosis from a stripped envelope to an interacting supernova. An early spectrum indicates it exploded as a Type Ib supernova. Later, the ejecta caught up with a dense circumstellar H-shell, ejected a few thousand years before the explosion, triggering interaction between the supernova ejecta and the dense shell, producing radio, X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission. We use archival data with the Very Large Array in radio bands and with Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT in X-ray bands, along with published H$\alpha$ measurements. We combine these data with our low radio frequency observations with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at two epochs covering three frequencies. While the observations missed the phase when the shock entered the dense shell, the X-rays indicate that the shock came out of the dense shell at around 1750 days. The data suggest a forward shock origin of the X-ray emission. Radio data show a spectral inversion at late epochs (> 5000 d) at around 3 GHz, which mimics the properties of the central absorbed component seen in SN 1986J. A possible explanation for this component is that the progenitor of SN 2001em was a massive binary system which had undergone a period of common envelope evolution.},

abstract = {We compute an extensive set of early-time spectra of supernovae interacting with cir-cumstellar material using the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Our models are applicable to events observed from 1 to a few days after explosion. Using these models, we constrain the progenitor and explosion properties of a sample of 17 observed interacting supernovae at early-times. Because massive stars have strong mass loss, these spectra provide valuable information about supernova progenitors, such as mass-loss rates, wind velocities, and surface abundances. We show that these events span a wide range of explosion and progenitor properties, exhibiting supernova luminosities in the 10 8 to 10 12 L range, temperatures from 10 000 to 60 000 K, progenitor mass-loss rates from a few 10 −4 up to 1 M yr −1 , wind velocities from 100 to 800 km s −1 , and surface abundances from solar-like to H-depleted. Our results suggest that many progenitors of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material have significantly increased mass-loss before explosion compared to what massive stars show during the rest of their lifetimes. We also infer a lack of correlation between surface abundances and mass-loss rates. This may point to the pre-explosion mass-loss mechanism being independent of stellar mass. We find that the majority of these events have CNO-processed surface abundances. In the single star scenario this points to a preference towards high-mass RSGs as progenitors of interacting SNe, while binary evolution could impact this conclusion. Our models are publicly available and readily applicable to analyze results from ongoing and future large scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Factory.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the assumption that the corrected luminosity of SN Ia would not evolve with redshift. Recently, our age dating of stellar populations in early-type host galaxies (ETGs) from high-quality spectra has shown that this key assumption is most likely in error. It has been argued though that the age-Hubble residual (HR) correlation from ETGs is not confirmed from two independent age datasets measured from multi-band optical photometry of host galaxies of all morphological types. Here we show, however, that one of them is based on highly uncertain and inappropriate luminosity-weighted ages derived, in many cases, under serious template mismatch. The other dataset employs more reliable mass-weighted ages, but the statistical analysis involved is affected by regression dilution bias, severely underestimating both the slope and significance of the age-HR correlation. Remarkably, when we apply regression analysis with a standard posterior sampling method to this dataset comprising a large sample (N = 102) of host galaxies, very significant (> 99.99%) correlation is obtained between the global population age and HR with the slope (−0.047± 0.011 mag/Gyr) highly consistent with our previous spectroscopic result from ETGs. For the local age of the environment around the site of SN, a similarly significant (> 99.96%) correlation is obtained with a steeper slope (−0.057 ± 0.016 mag/Gyr). Therefore, the SN luminosity evolution is strongly supported by the age dating based on multi-band optical photometry and can be a serious systematic bias in SN cosmology.},

These "flash ionization" features indicate the presence of a confined shell of material around the progenitor star. Here we present the first low-luminosity (LL) SN to show flash ionization features, SN2016bkv. This SN peaked at M V =−16 mag and has H$\alpha$ expansion velocities under 1350 km s −1 around maximum light, placing it at the faint/slow end of the distribution of SNeIIP (similar to SN 2005cs). The light-curve shape of SN2016bkv is also extreme among SNeIIP. A very strong initial peak could indicate additional luminosity from circumstellar interaction. A very small fall from the plateau to the nickel tail indicates unusually large production of radioactive nickel compared to other LL SNeIIP. A comparison between nebular spectra of SN2016bkv and models raises the possibility that SN2016bkv is an electron-capture supernova.},

abstract = {We compute an extensive set of early-time spectra of supernovae interacting with cir-cumstellar material using the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Our models are applicable to events observed from 1 to a few days after explosion. Using these models, we constrain the progenitor and explosion properties of a sample of 17 observed interacting supernovae at early-times. Because massive stars have strong mass loss, these spectra provide valuable information about supernova progenitors, such as mass-loss rates, wind velocities, and surface abundances. We show that these events span a wide range of explosion and progenitor properties, exhibiting supernova luminosities in the 10 8 to 10 12 L range, temperatures from 10 000 to 60 000 K, progenitor mass-loss rates from a few 10 −4 up to 1 M yr −1 , wind velocities from 100 to 800 km s −1 , and surface abundances from solar-like to H-depleted. Our results suggest that many progenitors of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material have significantly increased mass-loss before explosion compared to what massive stars show during the rest of their lifetimes. We also infer a lack of correlation between surface abundances and mass-loss rates. This may point to the pre-explosion mass-loss mechanism being independent of stellar mass. We find that the majority of these events have CNO-processed surface abundances. In the single star scenario this points to a preference towards high-mass RSGs as progenitors of interacting SNe, while binary evolution could impact this conclusion. Our models are publicly available and readily applicable to analyze results from ongoing and future large scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Factory.},

abstract = {We present the first quantitative spectroscopic modeling of an early-time supernova that interacts with its progenitor wind. Using the radiative transfer code CMFGEN, we investigate the recently-reported 15.5 h post-explosion spectrum of the type IIb SN 2013cu. For the first time, we are able to directly measure the chemical abundances of a SN progenitor and find a relatively H-rich wind, with H and He abundances (by mass) of X = 0.46 ± 0.2 and Y = 0.52 ± 0.2, respectively. The wind is enhanced in N and depleted in C relative to solar values (mass fractions of 8.2 × 10 −3 and 1.0 × 10 −5 , respectively). We obtain that a dense wind/circumstellar medium, with a mass-loss rate of ˙ M 3 × 10 −3 M yr −1 and v wind 100 km s −1 , surrounds the precursor at the pre-SN stage. These values are lower than previous analytical estimates, although we find ˙ M/$\upsilon$ ∞ consistent with previous work. We also compute a CMFGEN model to constrain the progenitor spectral type and find that the high ˙ M and low v wind imply that the star had an effective temperature of 8000 K immediately before the SN explosion. Our models suggest that the progenitor was either an unstable luminous blue variable or a yellow hypergiant undergoing an eruptive phase, and rule out a WR star. We classify the post-explosion spectra at 15.5 h as XWN5(h) and advocate for the use of the prefix 'X' (eXplosion) to avoid confusion between post-explosion, non-stellar spectra with those of massive stars. We show that the progenitor spectral type is significantly different than the early post-explosion spectral type owing to the huge differences in the ionization structure before and after the SN event. We find the following temporal evolution: LBV/YHG → XWN5(h) → SN IIb. Future early-time spectroscopy in the UV will give access to additional spectroscopic diagnostics and further constrain the properties of SN precursors, such as their metallicities.},

IceCube operates an online search for neutrino bursts, forwarding the directions of candidate events to a network of optical telescopes for immediate follow-up observations. If a supernova is identified from the optical observations, in addition to a directional coincidence a temporal $\gamma$-$\nu$ coincidence also needs to be established. To achieve this, we present a method for estimating the supernova explosion time from its light curve using a simple model.

The relationship was independently discovered by the American statistician and astronomer Bert Woodard Rust and the Soviet astronomer Yury Pavlovich Pskovskii in the 1970s. Using a limited sample of Type I supernovae they were able to show that the brighter the supernova is, the slower its luminosity declines after maximum. Only with the appearance of CCD cameras could Mark Phillips re-inspect this relationship on a new level of accuracy using a better sample of supernovae.

The nebular spectra are dominated by emission lines of [O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364 and [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7292, 7324. Other notable, albeit weaker, emission lines include Mg I] $\lambda$4571, [Fe II] $\lambda$7155, O I $\lambda$7774, Ca II triplet, and a broad, boxy feature at the location of H$\alpha$. Unlike in other stripped-envelope SNe, the [O I] doublet is clearly resolved due to the presence of strong narrow components. The doublet shows an unprecedented emission line profile consisting of at least three components for each [O I]$\lambda$6300, 6364 line: a broad component (width ∼ 2000 km s −1), and a pair of narrow blue and red components (width ∼ 300 km s −1) mirrored against the rest velocity. The narrow component appears also in other lines, and is conspicuous in [O I]. This indicates the presence of multiple distinct kinematic components of material at low and high velocities. The low-velocity components are likely to be produced by a dense, slow-moving emitting region near the center, while the broad components are emitted over a larger volume. These observations suggest an asymmetric explosion, supporting the idea of two-component ejecta that influence the resulting late-time spectra and light curves. SN 2016gkg thus presents striking evidence for significant asymmetry in a standard-energy SN explosion. The presence of material at low velocity, which is not predicted in 1D simulations, emphasizes the importance of multi-dimensional explosion modeling of SNe.},

abstract = {Analyses of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have found puzzling correlations between their standardised luminosities and host galaxy properties: SNe Ia in high-mass, passive hosts appear brighter than those in lower-mass, star-forming hosts. We examine the host galaxies of SNe Ia in the Dark Energy Survey three-year spectroscopically-confirmed cosmological sample, obtaining photometry in a series of 'local' apertures centred on the SN, and for the global host galaxy. We study the differences in these host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and rest-frame U − R colours, and their correlations with SN Ia parameters including Hubble residuals. We find all Hubble residual steps to be > 3$\sigma$ in significance, both for splitting at the traditional sample median and for the step of maximum significance. For stellar mass, we find a maximal local step of 0.098 ± 0.018 mag; ∼ 0.03 mag greater than the largest global stellar mass step in our sample (0.070 ± 0.017 mag). When splitting at the sample median, differences between local and global U − R steps are small, both ∼ 0.08 mag, but are more significant than the global stellar mass step (0.057 ± 0.017 mag). We split the data into sub-samples based on SN Ia light curve parameters: stretch (x 1) and colour (c), finding that redder objects (c > 0) have larger Hubble residual steps, for both stellar mass and U − R, for both local and global measurements, of ∼ 0.14 mag. Additionally, the bluer (star-forming) local environments host a more homogeneous SN Ia sample, with local U − R r.m.s. scatter as low as 0.084 ± 0.017 mag for blue (c < 0) SNe Ia in locally blue U − R environments.},

From such spectra ("flash spectroscopy"), we can measure various physical properties of the CSM, as well as the mass-loss rate of the progenitor during the year prior to its explosion. Searching through the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF and iPTF) SN spectroscopy databases from 2009 through 2014, we found 12 SNe II showing flash-ionized (FI) signatures in their first spectra. All are younger than 10 days. These events constitute 14% of all 84 SNe in our sample having a spectrum within 10 days from explosion, and 18% of SNeII observed at ages <5 days, thereby setting lower limits on the fraction of FI events. We classified as "blue/featureless" (BF) those events having a first spectrum that is similar to that of a blackbody, without any emission or absorption signatures. It is possible that some BF events had FI signatures at an earlier phase than observed, or that they lack dense CSM around the progenitor. Within 2 days after explosion, 8 out of 11 SNe in our sample are either BF events or show FI signatures. Interestingly, we found that 19 out of 21 SNe brighter than an absolute magnitude M R =−18.2 belong to the FI or BF groups, and that all FI events peaked above M R =−17.6 mag, significantly brighter than average SNeII.},

abstract = {Context. Reliable predictions of mass-loss rates are important for massive-star evolution computations. Aims. We aim to provide predictions for mass-loss rates and wind-momentum rates of O-type stars, carefully studying the behaviour of these winds as functions of stellar parameters like luminosity and metallicity. Methods. We use newly developed steady-state models of radiation-driven winds to compute the global properties of a grid of O-stars. The self-consistent models are calculated by means of an iterative solution to the equation of motion using full NLTE radiative transfer in the co-moving frame to compute the radiative acceleration. In order to study winds in different galactic environments, the grid covers main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants in the Galaxy and both Magellanic Clouds. Results. We find a strong dependence of mass-loss on both luminosity and metallicity. Mean values across the grid are ˙ M ∼ L 2.2 * and ˙ M ∼ Z 0.95 * , however we also find a somewhat stronger dependence on metallicity for lower luminosities. Similarly, the mass loss-luminosity relation is somewhat steeper for the SMC than for the Galaxy. In addition, the computed rates are systematically lower (by a factor 2 and more) than those commonly used in stellar-evolution calculations. Overall, our results agree well with observations in the Galaxy that account properly for wind-clumping, with empirical ˙ M vs. Z * scaling relations, and with observations of O-dwarfs in the SMC. Conclusions. Our results provide simple fit relations for mass-loss rates and wind momenta of massive O-stars stars as functions of luminosity and metallicity, valid in the range T eff = 28000 − 45000 K. Due to the systematically lower ˙ M, our new models suggest that new rates might be needed in evolution simulations of massive stars.},

We model this light curve by circumstellar interaction of a pulsational pair-instability (PPI) supernova (SN) model based on our PPISN models studied in previous work. We focus on the 42 M ⊙ He star (core of a 80 M ⊙ star) which has circumstellar matter of mass 0.50 M ⊙. With the parameterized mass cut and the kinetic energy of explosion E, we perform hydrodynamical calculations of nucleosynthesis and optical light curves of PPISN models. The optical light curve of the first ∼ 20 days of AT2018cow is well-reproduced by the shock heating of circumstellar matter for the 42 M ⊙ He star with E = 5 × 10 51 erg. After day 20, the light curve is reproduced by the radioactive decay of 0.6 M ⊙ 56 Co, which is a decay product of 56 Ni in the explosion. We also examine how the light curve shape depends on the various model parameters, such as CSM structure and composition. We also discuss (1) other possible energy sources and their constraints, (2) origin of observed high-energy radiation, and (3) how our result depends on the radiative transfer codes. Based on our successful model for AT2018cow and the model for SLSN with the CSM mass as large as 20 M ⊙), we propose the working hypothesis that PPISN produces SLSNe if CSM is massive enough and FBOTs if CSM is less than ∼ 1 M ⊙ .},

This study has its root in the hypothesized FRB-SLSN connection that states that magnetars born in SLSN can power FRBs. The wideband spectrum (0.6-15 GHz) of PTF10hgi presented here, provides strong evidence for the magnetar wind nebular origin of the radio emission. The same spectrum also enables us to make robust estimates of the radius and the magnetic field of the radio emitting region and demonstrates that the nebula is powered by the rotational energy of the magnetar. This spectrum is then compared with that of FRB121102 which we extend down to 400 MHz using archival data. The newly added measurements put very tight constraint on the emission models of the compact persistent source associated with FRB121102. We find that while both sources can be powered by the rotational energy of the underlying magnetar, the average energy injection rate is much higher in FRB121102. Hence, we hypothesise that, if PTF10hgi is indeed emitting fast radio bursts, those will be much weaker energetically than those from FRB121102.},

Carbon-oxygen WDs accreting a helium shell have the potential to explode in the sub-Chandrasekhar mass regime. Previous studies have shown how the ignition of a helium shell can either directly ignite the WD at the core-shell interface or propagate a shock wave into the the core causing a central ignition. We examine the explosions of WDs from 0.6 to 1.2 M e with helium shells of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.08 M e. Distinct observational signatures of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD explosions are predicted for two categories of shell size. Thicker-shell models show an early time flux excess, which is caused by the presence of radioactive material in the ashes of the helium shell, and red colors due to these ashes creating significant line blanketing in the UV through the blue portion of the spectrum. Thin shell models reproduce several typical Type Ia supernova signatures. We identify a relationship between Si II velocity and luminosity that, for the first time, identifies a subclass of observed supernovae that are consistent with these models. This subclass is further delineated by the absence of carbon in their atmospheres. We suggest that the proposed difference in the ratio of selective to total extinction between the high velocity and normal velocity Type Ia supernovae is not due to differences in the properties of the dust around these events, but is rather an artifact of applying a single extinction correction to two intrinsically different populations of supernovae.},

abstract = {The merger of two white dwarfs (WD) is a natural outcome from the evolution of many binary stars. Recently, a super-Chandrasekhar WD merger product, IRAS 00500+6713, was identified. IRAS 00500+6713 consists of a central star embedded in a circular nebula. The analysis of the optical spectrum of the central star revealed that it is hot, hydrogen and helium free, and drives an extremely fast wind with a record breaking speed. The nebula was first detected in infrared but it is not visible neither in the optical nor the UV. No nebula spectroscopy was obtained prior to our observations. Here we report the first deep X-ray imaging spectroscopic observations of IRAS 00500+6713. Both the central star and the nebula are detected in X-rays, heralding the WD merger products as a new distinct type of strong X-ray sources. Low-resolution X-ray spectra reveal large neon, magnesium, silicon, and sulfur enrichment of the central star and the nebula. We conclude that IRAS 00500+6713 resulted from a merger of an ONeMg and a CO WD, and that the merger was associated with an episode of carbon burning and possibly accompanied by a SN Iax. In X-rays, we observe the point source associated with the merger product while the surrownding diffuse nebula is a supernova remnant. IRAS 00500+6713 will likely terminate its evolution with another peculiar Type I supernova, where the final core collapse to a neutron star might be induced by electron captures, and possibly produce a milisecond pulsar.},

Here, we summarize new observational constraints, address recent progress in modeling Type Ia supernovae by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, and discuss several of the still open questions. It will be be shown that the new models have considerable predictive power which allows us to study observable properties such as light curves and spectra without adjustable non-physical parameters. This is a necessary requisite to improve our understanding of the explosion mechanism and to settle the question of the applicability of SNe Ia as distance indicators for cosmology. We explore the capabilities of the models by comparing them with observations and we show how such models can be applied to study the origin of the diversity of SNe Ia.},

abstract = {We present an extensive (∼ 1200 d) photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2012ab. After a rapid initial rise leading to a bright maximum (M R = −19.39 mag), the light curves show a plateau lasting about 2 months followed by a steep decline up to about 100 d. Only in the U band the decline is constant in the same interval. At later phases, the light curves remain flatter than the 56 Co decline suggesting the increasing contribution of the interaction between SN ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). Although heavily contaminated by emission lines of the host galaxy, the early spectral sequence (until 32 d) shows persistent narrow emissions, indicative of slow unshocked CSM, and the emergence of broad Balmer lines of hydrogen with P-Cygni profiles over a blue continuum, arising from a fast expanding SN ejecta. From about 2 months to ∼1200 d, the P-Cygni profiles are overcome by intermediate width emissions (FWHM ∼ 6000 km s −1), produced in the shocked region due to interaction. On the red wing a red bump appears after 76 d, likely a signature of the onset of interaction of the receding ejecta with the CSM. The presence of fast material both approaching and then receding is suggestive that we are observing the SN along the axis of a jet-like ejection in a cavity devoid of or uninterrupted by CSM in the innermost regions.},

abstract = {To use strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) for cosmology, a time-delay measurement between the multiple supernova (SN) images is necessary. The sharp rise and decline of SN Ia light curves make them promising for measuring time delays, but microlensing can distort these light curves and therefore add large uncertainties to the measurements. An alternative approach is to use color curves where uncertainties due to microlensing are significantly reduced for a certain period of time known as the achromatic phase. In this work, we investigate in detail the achromatic phase, testing four different SN Ia models with various microlensing configurations. We find on average an achromatic phase of around three rest-frame weeks or longer for most color curves but the spread in the duration of the achromatic phase (due to different microlensing maps and filter combinations) is quite large and an achromatic phase of just a few days is also possible. Furthermore, the achromatic phase is longer for smoother microlensing maps, lower macro-magnifications and larger mean Einstein radii of microlenses. From our investigations, we do not find a strong dependency on the model or on asymmetries in the SN ejecta. We find that six rest-frame LSST color curves exhibit features such as extreme points or turning points within the achromatic phase which make them promising for time-delay measurements, although only three of the color curves are independent. These curves contain combinations of rest-frame bands u, g, r, and i and to observe them for typical LSN Ia redshifts, it would be ideal to cover (observer-frame) filters r, i, z, y, J, and H. If follow-up resources are restricted, we recommend r, i, and z as the bare minimum for using color curves and/or light curves since LSNe Ia are bright in these filters and observational uncertainties are lower than in the infrared regime. With additional resources, infrared observations in y, J, and H would be useful for obtaining color curves of SNe, especially at redshifts above ∼ 0.8 when they become critical.},

Here, we present a systematic survey for such transient emission lines (Flash Spectroscopy) among Type II supernovae detected in the first year of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. We find that at least six out of ten events for which a spectrum was obtained within two days of estimated explosion time show evidence for such transient flash lines.

We use dimensionality reduction to identify the host galaxy properties that distinguish supernova classes. Our results suggest that the hosts of SLSNe, SNe Ia, and core collapse supernovae can be separated using host brightness information and extendedness measures derived from the host's light profile. Next, we train a random forest model with data from GHOST to predict supernova class using exclusively host galaxy information and the radial offset of the supernova. We can distinguish SNe Ia and core collapse supernovae with ∼ 70% accuracy without any photometric data from the event itself. Vera C.

Located in an extremely faint galaxy (M r = −10.3 mag), SN 2017ivv shows an unprecedented evolution during the two years of observations. At early times, the light curve shows a fast rise (∼ 6 − 8 days) to a peak of M max g = −17.84 mag, followed by a very rapid decline of 7.94 ± 0.48 mag per 100 days in the V−band. The extensive photometric coverage at late phases shows that the radioactive tail has two slopes, one steeper than that expected from the decay of 56 Co (between 100 and 350 days), and another slower (after 450 days), probably produced by an additional energy source. From the bolometric light curve, we estimated that the amount of ejected 56 Ni is ∼ 0.059 ± 0.003 M. The nebular spectra of SN 2017ivv show a remarkable transformation that allows the evolution to be split into three phases: (1) H$\alpha$ strong phase (< 200 days); (2) H$\alpha$ weak phase (between 200 and 350 days); and (3) H$\alpha$ broad phase (> 500 days). We find that the nebular analysis favours a binary progenitor and an asymmetric explosion. Finally, comparing the nebular spectra of SN 2017ivv to models suggests a progenitor with a zero-age main-sequence mass of 15-17 M .},

abstract = {We show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are formed within both very young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on the stellar mass and mean star formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies. Models in which the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are ruled out with >99% confidence. Our analysis is based on 100 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically classified events, all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0:2 < z < 0:75. We estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia host galaxies by fitting their broadband spectral energy distributions with the galaxy spectral synthesis code P{\'{E}} GASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the specific SFR of the parent galaxies-more vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later type galaxies seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple ''two-component'' model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of the host systems. We find that the SN Ia rate can be well represented as the sum of 5:3 AE 1:1 ; 10 {\`{A}}14 SNe yr {\`{A}}1 M {\`{A}}1 and 3:9 AE 0:7 ; 10 {\`{A}}4 SNe yr {\`{A}}1 (M yr {\`{A}}1) {\`{A}}1 of star formation. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally.

Such models were proposed as progenitors for both superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), and the Type Ic-BL supernovae (SNe) that are associated with them. Our findings suggest that whether these models produce a magnetar driven SLSN explosion or a near-critically rotating black hole (BH) is not a monotonic function of the initial mass. Rather, their explodability varies non-monotonically depending on the late core evolution, once chemical homogene-ity is broken. Using different explodability criteria we find that our models have a clear preference to produce SLSNe at lower masses, and lGRBs at higher masses; but find several exceptions, expecting lGRBs to form from stars as low as 10 M , and SLSNe with progenitors as massive as 30 M. In general, our models reproduce the predicted angular momenta, ejecta masses and magnetic field strengths at core collapse inferred for SLSNe and lGRBs, and suggest significant interaction with their circumstellar medium, particularly for explosions with low ejecta mass.},

All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmologi-cal parameters. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find H 0 = 73.3 +1.7 −1.8 km s −1 Mpc −1 , a 2.4% precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of H 0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in 3.1$\sigma$ tension with Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3$\sigma$ tension with Planck CMB deter-minations of H 0 in flat $\Lambda$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat $\Lambda$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H 0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cos-mological models, our combined inference on H 0 ranges from ∼ 73-78 km s −1 Mpc −1 , which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

We consider a stellar system in which star formation lasts for 10 Gyr with a constant rate, as well as a system in which the same amount of stars is formed in a single burst lasting for 1 Gyr. Evolution of the number of white dwarfs is confronted to the evolution of occurrence rate of events that usually are identified with SN Ia or accretion-induced collapses, i.e. with accumulation of Chandrasekhar mass by a white dwarf or a merger of a pair of CO white dwarfs with total mass not lower than the Chandrasekhar one. In the systems with a burst of star formation, at $t=$10 Gyr observed supersoft X-ray sources, most probably, are not precursors of SN Ia. The same is true for an overwhelming majority of the sources in the systems with constant star formation rate. In the systems of both kinds mergers of white dwarfs is the dominant SN Ia scenario. In symbiotic binaries, accreting CO-dwarfs do not accumulate enough mass for SN Ia explosion, while ONeMg-dwarfs finish their evolution by an accretion-induced collapse with formation of a neutron star.},

abstract = {We analyze the evolution of binary stars to calculate synthetic rates and delay times of the most promising Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) progenitors. We present and discuss evolutionary scenarios in which a white dwarf (WD) reaches the Chandrasekhar mass and potentially explodes in a SNe Ia. We consider Double Degenerate (DDS; merger of two WDs), Single Degenerate (SDS; WD accreting from H-rich companion), and AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn; WD accreting from He-rich companion) scenarios. The results are presented for two different star formation histories: burst (elliptical-like galaxies) and continuous (spiral-like galaxies). It is found that delay times for the DDS in our standard model (with common envelope efficiency $\alpha$ CE = 1) follow a power-law distribution. For the SDS we note a wide range of delay times, while AM CVn progenitors produce a short burst of SNe Ia at early times. The DDS median delay time falls between ∼0.5 and 1 Gyr; the SDS between ∼2 and 3 Gyr; and the AM CVn between ∼0.8 and 0.6 Gyr depending on the assumed $\alpha$ CE. For a Milky-Way-like (MW-like) galaxy, we estimate the rates of SNe Ia arising from different progenitors as: ∼10 −4 yr −1 for the SDS and AM CVn, and ∼10 −3 yr −1 for the DDS. We point out that only the rates for two merging carbon-oxygen WDs, the only systems found in the DDS, are consistent with the observed rates for typical MW-like spirals. We also note that DDS progenitors are the dominant population in elliptical galaxies. The fact that the delay time distribution for the DDS follows a power law implies more SNe Ia (per unit mass) in young rather than in aged populations. Our results do not exclude other scenarios, but strongly indicate that the DDS is the dominant channel generating SNe Ia in spiral galaxies, at least in the framework of our adopted evolutionary models. Since it is believed that WD mergers cannot produce a thermonuclear explosion given the current understanding of accreting WDs, either the evolutionary calculations along with accretion physics are incorrect, or the explosion calculations are inaccurate and need to be revisited.},

@article{Schneider,
abstract = {The era of large transient surveys, gravitational-wave observatories and multi-messenger astronomy has opened up new possibilities for our understanding of the evolution and final fate of massive stars. Most massive stars are born in binary or higher-order multiple systems and exchange mass with a companion star during their lives. In particular, the progenitors of a large fraction of compact object mergers, and Galactic neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been stripped off their envelopes by a binary companion. Here, we study the evolution of single and stripped binary stars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution code Mesa and their final fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We find that stripped binary stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures compared to genuine single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. The bases of these differences are already established by the end of core helium burning and are preserved up to core collapse. Consequently, we find that Case A & B stripped stars and single & Case C stripped stars develop qualitatively similar pre-SN core structures. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and BH formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and stripped binary stars. In terms of initial masses, single stars of 35 M all form BHs, while this transition is only at about 70 M in stripped stars. On average, stripped stars give rise to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion energies, higher kick velocities and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified population synthesis model, we show that our results lead to a significant reduction of the rates of BH-NS and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical assumptions made on NS and BH formation. Therefore, we predict lower detection rates of such merger events by, e.g., advanced LIGO than is often considered. We further show how certain features in the NS-BH mass distribution of single and stripped stars relate to the chirp-mass distribution of compact object mergers. Further implications of our findings are discussed with respect to the missing red-supergiant problem, a possible mass gap between NSs and BHs, X-ray binaries and observationally inferred nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP SNe.},

@article{Kushnir2020,
abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The outcome of this explosion is similar to a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD). While SCD is consistent with some observational properties of SNe Ia, several computational challenges prohibit a robust comparison to the observations. We focus on the observed t 0 − M Ni56 relation, where t 0 (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with M Ni56 (the synthesized 56 Ni mass). We apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate SCD and show that the calculated t 0 − M Ni56 relation, which does not require radiation transfer calculations, converges to an accuracy of a few percent. We find a clear tension between our calculations and the observed t 0 − M Ni56 relation. SCD predicts an anti-correlation between t 0 and M Ni56 , with t 0 ≈ 30 day for luminous (M Ni56 0.5 M ⊙) SNe Ia, while the observed t 0 is in the range of 35 − 45 day. We show that this tension is larger than the uncertainty of the results, and that it exists in all previous studies of the problem. Our results hint that more complicated models are required, but we argue that DDM is unlikely to resolve the tension with the observations.},

abstract = {We present an improved determination of the Hubble constant from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 70 long-period Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud. These were obtained with the same WFC3 photometric system used to measure ex-tragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of Type Ia supernovae. Gyroscopic control of HST was employed to reduce overheads while collecting a large sample of widely-separated Cepheids. The Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation provides a zeropoint-independent link with 0.4% precision between the new 1.2% geometric distance to the LMC from Detached Eclipsing Binaries (DEBs) measured by Pietrzy´nskiPietrzy´nski et al. (2019) and the lu-minosity of SNe Ia. Measurements and analysis of the LMC Cepheids were completed prior to knowledge of the new DEB LMC distance. Combined with a refined calibration of the count-rate linearity of WFC3-IR with 0.1% precision (Riess et al. 2019), these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the LMC from 2.5% to 1.3%. Using only the LMC DEBs to calibrate the ladder we find H 0 =74.22 ± 1.82 km s −1 Mpc −1 including systematic uncertainties, 3% higher than before for this particular anchor. Combining the LMC DEBs, masers in NGC 4258 and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H 0 = 74.03 ± 1.42 km s −1 Mpc −1 , including systematics, an uncertainty of 1.91%-15% lower than our best previous result. Removing any one of these anchors changes H 0 by less than 0.7%. The difference between H 0 measured locally and the value inferred from Planck CMB and $\Lambda$CDM is 6.6±1.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 or 4.4 $\sigma$ (P=99.999% for Gaussian errors) in significance, raising the discrepancy beyond a plausible level of chance. We summarize independent tests which show this discrepancy is not attributable to an error in any one source or measurement, increasing the odds that it results from a cosmological feature beyond $\Lambda$CDM.},

@article{Regan,
abstract = {We investigate the ab-initio formation of super-massive stars in a pristine atomic cooling halo. The halo is extracted from a larger self-consistent parent simulation. The halo remains metal-free and star formation is suppressed due to a combination of dynamical heating from mergers and a mild (J LW ∼ 2−10 J 21 (z)) Lyman-Werner (LW) background. We find that more than 20 very massive stars form with stellar masses greater than 1000 M. The most massive star has a stellar mass of over 6000 M. However, accretion onto all stars declines significantly after the first ∼ 100 kyr of evolution as the surrounding material is accreted and the turbulent nature of the gas causes the stars to move to lower density regions. We post-process the impact of ionising radiation from the stars and find that ionising radiation is not a limiting factor when considering SMS formation and growth. Rather the birth environments are highly turbulent and a steady accretion flow is not maintained within the timescale (2 Myr) of our simulations. As the massive stars end their lives as direct collapse black holes this will seed these embryonic haloes with a population of black holes with masses between approximately 300 M and 10,000 M. Afterwards they may sink to the centre of the haloes, eventually coalescing to form larger intermediate mass black holes whose in-situ mergers will be detectable by LISA.},

abstract = {Much difficulty has so far prevented the emergence of a consistent scenario for the origin of Type Ib and Ic supernovae (SNe). Either the SN rates, or the ejecta masses and composition were in tension with inferred properties from observations. Here, we follow a heuristic approach by examining the fate of helium stars in the mass range 4 to 12 M , which presumably form in interacting binaries. The helium stars are evolved using stellar wind mass loss rates that agree with observations, and which reproduce the observed luminosity range of galactic WR stars, leading to stellar masses at core collapse in the range 3 to 5.5 M. We then explode these models adopting an explosion energy proportional to the ejecta mass, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. We impose a fixed 56 Ni mass and strong mixing. The SN radiation from 3 to 100 d is computed self-consistently starting from the input stellar models using the time-dependent non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer code CMFGEN. By design, our fiducial models yield very similar light curves, with a rise time of about 20 d and a peak luminosity of ∼ 10 42.2 erg s −1 , in line with representative SNe Ibc. The less massive progenitors retain a He-rich envelope and reproduce the color, line widths, and line strengths of a representative sample of SNe Ib, while stellar winds remove most of the helium in the more massive progenitors, whose spectra match typical SNe Ic in detail. The transition between the predicted Ib-like and Ic-like spectra is continuous, but it is sharp, such that the resulting models essentially form a dichotomy. Further models computed with varying explosion energy, 56 Ni mass, and long-term power injection from the remnant show that a moderate variation of these parameters can reproduce much of the diversity of SNe Ibc. We conclude that stars stripped by a binary companion can account for the vast majority of ordinary Type Ib and Ic SNe, and that stellar wind mass loss is the key to remove the helium envelope in the progenitors of SNe Ic.},

It is shown using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that the original four groups in the Branch diagram are well-defined and robust in this parameterization. We find three continuous groups that describe the behavior of our sample in [M B , v Si II ] space. Extending the GMM into the full 4-D space yields a grouping system that only slightly alters group definitions in the [M B , v Si II ] projection, showing that most of the clustering information in [M B , v Si II ] is already contained in the 2-D GMM groupings. However, the full 4-D space does divide group membership for faster objects between core-normal and broad-line objects in the Branch diagram. A significant correlation between M B and pEW(Si II $\lambda$5972) is found, which implies that Branch group membership can be well-constrained by spectroscopic quantities alone. In general, we find that higher-dimensional GMMs reduce the uncertainty of group membership for objects between the originally defined Branch groups. We also find that the broad-line Branch group becomes nearly distinct with the inclusion of v Si II , indicating that this subclass of SNe Ia may be somehow different from the other groups.},

We build a sample of calibrating anchors consisting of 24 SNe hosted in galaxies having SBF distance measurements. Applying a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we calibrate the SNe luminosity and extend it into the Hubble flow by using a sample of 96 SNe Ia in the redshift range 0.02 < z < 0.075, extracted from the Combined Pantheon Sample. We estimate a value of H 0 = 70.50 ± 2.37(stat) ± 3.38(sys) km s −1 Mpc −1 (i.e. 3.4%stat, 4.8%sys), which is in agreement with the value obtained using the tip of the red giant branch calibration, and consistent within the errors with the value obtained from SNe Type Ia calibrated with Cepheids and the one inferred from the analysis of the cosmic microwave background. We find that the SNe Ia distance moduli calibrated with SBF are on average larger by 0.07 mag than the ones calibrated with Cepheids. Our results point to possible differences among SNe in different types of galaxies, which could originate from different local environments and/or SNe Ia progenitor properties. Sampling different host galaxy type, SBF offers a complementary approach to Cepheids which is important in addressing possible systematics. As the SBF method has the ability to reach larger distances than Cepheids, the impending entry of LSST and JWST into operation will increase the number of SNe Ia hosted in galaxies where SBF distances can be measured, making SBF measurements attractive for improving the calibration of SNe Ia, and in the estimation of H 0 .},

abstract = {Stripped envelope supernovae are a sub-class of core collapse supernovae showing several stages of H/He shell stripping that determines the class: H-free/He-poor SNe are classified as Type Ic, H-poor/He-rich are Type Ib, and H/He-rich are Type IIb. Stripping H/He with only stellar wind requires significantly higher mass loss rates than observed while binary-involved mass transfer may usually not strip enough to produce H/He free SNe. Type Ib/c SNe are sometimes found to include weak H/He transient lines as a product of a trace amount of H/He left over from stripping processes. The extent and mass of the H/He required to produce these lines is not well known. In this work, a 22 M ⊙ progenitor model is stripped of the H/He shells in five steps prior to collapse and then exploded at four explosion energies. Requiring both optical and NIR He i lines for helium identification does not allow much He mass to be hidden in SE-SNE. Increasing the mass of He above the CO core delays the visibility of O i 7774 in early spectra. Our SN Ib-like models are capable of reproducing the spectral evolution of a set of observed SNe with reasonable estimated E k accuracy. Our SN IIb-like models can partially reproduce low energy observed SN IIb, but we find no observed comparison for the SN IIb-like models with high E k .},

The observables of SN 2017ahn show a significant evolution over the 470 d of our follow-up campaign, first showing prominent, narrow Balmer lines and other high-ionization features purely in emission (i.e. flash spectroscopy features), which progressively fade and lead to a spectroscopic evolution similar to that of more canonical Type II supernovae. Over the same period, the decline of the light curves in all bands is fast, resembling the photometric evolution of linearly declining H-rich core-collapse supernovae. The modeling of the light curves and early flash spectra suggest a complex circumstellar medium surrounding the progenitor star at the time of explosion, with a first dense shell produced during the very late stages of its evolution being swept up by the rapidly expanding ejecta within the first ∼ 6 d of the supernova evolution, while signatures of interaction are observed also at later phases. Hydrodynamical models support the scenario in which linearly declining Type II supernovae are predicted to arise from massive yellow super/hyper giants depleted of most of their hydrogen layers.},

The V-band magnitude at the plateau phase is M V = −18.4 mag, which is much brighter than typical SNe IIP. We propose that its unusual properties can be naturally explained, if we assume that there was an super-Eddington energy injection into the envelope in the last few years of the evolution before the SN explosion. Using a progenitor model with such an pre-SN energy injection, we can fit the observational data of SN 2009kf with the reasonable explosion energy of E exp = 2.8 × 10 51 erg and the 56 Ni mass of 0.25M ⊙. Specifically, we injected the energy into the envelope at a constant rate of 3.0×10 39 erg s −1 in the last 3.0 years of evolution before the core collapse. We propose that some of the unusually bright SNe IIP might result from the pre-SN energy injection to the envelope.},

abstract = {Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are a rare class of stripped envelope supernovae interacting with a helium-rich circumstel-lar medium (CSM). The majority of the SNe Ibn reported in the literature display a surprising homogeneity in their fast-evolving lightcurves and are typically found in actively starforming spiral galaxies. Aims. We present the discovery and the study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a SN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive photometric and spectro-scopic data set. Methods. We compare the photometric and spectral evolution of SN 2020bqj with regular SNe Ibn from the literature, as well as with other outliers in the SN Ibn subclass. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with powering mechanism models such as radioactive decay and CSM interaction. We also model the host galaxy of SN 2020bqj. Results. The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier in the subclass based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and the low mass of its faint host galaxy. We show through modeling that the lightcurve of SN 2020bqj can be powered predominantly by shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM, combined with radioactive decay. The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj in terms of lightcurve and spectral evolution, suggesting a similar progenitor and CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual hydrogen. This scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN 2020bqj and the modeling results.},

abstract = {The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) LSQ14fmg exhibits exaggerated properties which may help to reveal the origin of the "super-Chandrasekhar" (or 03fg-like) group. The optical spectrum is typical of a 03fg-like SN Ia, but the light curves are unlike those of any SNe Ia observed. The light curves of LSQ14fmg rise extremely slowly. At −23 rest-frame days relative to B-band maximum, LSQ14fmg is already brighter than M V = −19 mag before host extinction correction. The observed color curves show a flat evolution from the earliest observation to approximately one week after maximum. The near-infrared light curves peak brighter than −20.5 mag in the J and H bands, far more luminous than any 03fg-like SNe Ia with near-infrared observations. At one month past maximum, the optical light curves decline rapidly. The early, slow rise and flat color evolution are interpreted to result from an additional excess flux from a power source other than the radioactive decay of the synthesized 56 Ni. The excess flux matches the interaction with a typical superwind of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in density structure, mass-loss rate, and duration. The rapid decline starting at around one month past B-band maximum may be an indication of rapid cooling by active carbon monoxide Corresponding author: E. Y.

abstract = {Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors have been discovered so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an outstanding open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations. In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the Palomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z ≈ 1. We present the photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The galaxy mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from 10 5 to 10 11.5 M , probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are less pronounced than previously thought. H-poor SLSNe and SNe Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above 10 10 M. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of < 0.4 and < 1 solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar population than all other classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low-metallicity and young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN progenitors.},

We analyze broad trends in these light curves and categorize them based on morphology. We find these morphological categories relate simply to the progenitor radius and the mass of the hydrogen envelope. We present a proof-of-concept sensitive-variable analysis, indicating that an important determining factor in the properties of a light curve within a given category is 56 Ni mass. We follow spectra from the photospheric to the nebular phase. These spectra show characteristic iron-line blanketing at short wavelengths and Doppler-shifted Fe II and Ti II absorption lines. To enable this analysis, we develop a first-of-its-kind pipeline from a massive progenitor model, through a self-consistent explosion in spherical symmetry, to electromagnetic counterparts. This opens the door to more detailed analyses of the collective properties of these observables.

abstract = {Context. The progenitor and explosion properties of type II supernovae (SNe II) are fundamental to understand the evolution of massive stars. Special interest has been given to the range of initial masses of their progenitors, but despite the efforts made, it is still uncertain. Direct imaging of progenitors in pre-explosion archival images point out an upper initial mass cutoff of ∼18 M. However, this is in tension with previous studies in which progenitor masses inferred by light curve modelling tend to favour high-mass solutions. Moreover, it has been argued that light curve modelling alone cannot provide a unique solution for the progenitor and explosion properties of SNe II. Aims. We develop a robust method which helps us to constrain the physical parameters of SNe II by fitting simultaneously their bolometric light curve and the evolution of the photospheric velocity to hydrodynamical models using statistical inference techniques. Methods. Pre-supernova red supergiant models were created using the stellar evolution code MESA, varying the initial progenitor mass. The explosion of these progenitors was then processed through hydrodynamical simulations, where the explosion energy, synthesised nickel mass, and the latter's spatial distribution within the ejecta were changed. We compare to observations via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results. We apply this method to a well-studied set of SNe with an observed progenitor in pre-explosion images and compare with results in the literature. Progenitor mass constraints are found to be consistent between our results and those derived by pre-SN imaging and the analysis of late-time spectral modelling. Conclusions. We have developed a robust method to infer progenitor and explosion properties of SN II progenitors which is consistent with other methods in the literature, which suggests that hydrodynamical modelling is able to accurately constrain physical properties of SNe II. This study is our starting point for a further analysis of a large sample of hydrogen-rich SNe.},

For the worst performing SN class (SNe Ibc), the completeness and purity fall to 37% and 21%, respectively. Our classifier provides 1257 newly classified SNe Ia, 521 SNe II, 298 SNe Ibc, 181 SNe IIn, and 58 SLSNe.

Photometric classification can enable real-time identification of interesting events for extended multi-wavelength follow-up, as well as archival population studies. Here we present the complete sample of 5,243 "SN-like" light curves (in g P1 r P1 i P1 z P1) from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1-MDS). The PS1-MDS is similar to the planned LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey in terms of cadence, filters and depth, making this a useful training set for the community. Using this dataset, we train a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm to photometrically classify 2,315 new SN-like light curves with host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts. Our algorithm consists of a random forest supervised classification step and a novel unsupervised step in which we introduce a recurrent autoencoder neural network (RAENN). Our final pipeline, dubbed SuperRAENN, has an accuracy of 87% across five SN classes (Type Ia, Ibc, II, IIn, SLSN-I). We find the highest accuracy rates for Type Ia SNe and SLSNe and the lowest for Type Ibc SNe. Our complete spectroscopically-and photometrically-classified samples breaks down into: 62.0% Type Ia (1839 ob-2 Villar et al. jects), 19.8% Type II (553 objects), 4.8% Type IIn (136 objects), 11.7% Type Ibc (291 objects), and 1.6% Type I SLSNe (54 objects).

In our scenario, the stripped-envelope supernova is the second supernova of the binary, in which the envelope of the secondary was removed during its red supergiant phase by the impact of the first supernova. Through 2D hydrodynamical simulations, we find that ∼50-90 % of the envelope can be unbound as long as the pre-supernova orbital separation is 5 times the stellar radius. Recombination energy plays a significant role in the unbinding, especially for relatively high mass systems (18 M). We predict that more than half of the unbound mass should be distributed as a one-sided shell at about ∼10-100 pc away from the second supernova site. We discuss possible applications to known supernova remnants such as Cas-siopeia A, RX J1713.7-3946, G11.2-0.3, and find promising agreements. The predicted rate is ∼0.35-1% of the core-collapse population.

We construct and analyze weakly compressible turbulence models with nuclear burning effects for car-bon/oxygen plasma at a density expected for deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) to occur. We observe formation of carbon deflagrations and transient carbon detonations at early times. As turbulence becomes increasingly inhomogeneous, sustained carbon detonations are initiated by the Zel'dovich reactivity gradient mechanism. The fuel is suitably preconditioned by the action of compressive turbulent modes with wavelength comparable to the size of resolved turbulent eddies; no acoustic wave is involved in this process. Oxygen detonations are initiated either aided by reactivity gradients or by collisions of carbon detonations. The observed evolutionary timescales are found sufficiently short for the above process to occur in the expanding, centrally ignited massive white dwarf. The inhomogeneous conditions produced prior to DDT might be of consequence for the chemical composition of the outer ejecta regions of SN Ia from the single degenerate channel, and offer potential for validation of the proposed model.},

These perturbations have a crucial and qualitative impact on the delayed neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism by increasing the total stress behind the stalled shock. In this paper, we investigate the properties of a 15 M model evolved in 1-,2-, and 3-dimensions (3D) for the final ∼424 seconds before gravitational instability and iron core-collapse using MESA and the FLASH simulation framework. We find that just before collapse, our initially perturbed fully 3D model reaches angle-averaged convective velocity magnitudes of ≈ 240-260 km s −1 in the Si-and O-shell regions with a Mach number ≈ 0.06. We find the bulk of the power in the O-shell resides at large scales, characterized by spherical harmonic orders () of 2-4, while the Si-shell shows broad spectra on smaller scales of ≈ 30 − 40. Both convective regions show an increase in power at = 5 near collapse. We show that the 1D MESA model agrees with the convective velocity profile and speeds of the Si-shell when compared to our highest resolution 3D model. However, in the O-shell region, we find that MESA predicts speeds approximately four times slower than all of our 3D models suggest.

The ALeRCE light curve classifier uses variability features computed from the ZTF alert stream, and colors obtained from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. We apply a Balanced Hierarchical Random Forest algorithm with a two-level scheme, where the top level classifies each source as periodic, stochastic, or transient, and the bottom level further resolve each hierarchical class, yielding a total of 15 classes. This classifier corresponds to the first attempt to classify multiple classes of stochastic variables (including nucleus-and host-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, young stellar objects, and cataclysmic variables) in addition to different classes of periodic and transient sources, using real data. We created a labeled set using various public catalogs (such as the Catalina Surveys and Gaia DR2 variable stars catalogs, and the Million Quasars catalog), and we classify all objects with ≥ 6 g-band or ≥ 6 r-band detections in ZTF (868,371 sources as of 2020/06/09), providing updated classifications for sources with new alerts every day.

abstract = {Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are a rare class of stripped envelope supernovae interacting with a helium-rich circumstel-lar medium (CSM). The majority of the SNe Ibn reported in the literature display a surprising homogeneity in their fast-evolving lightcurves and are typically found in actively starforming spiral galaxies. Aims. We present the discovery and the study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a SN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive photometric and spectro-scopic data set. Methods. We compare the photometric and spectral evolution of SN 2020bqj with regular SNe Ibn from the literature, as well as with other outliers in the SN Ibn subclass. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with powering mechanism models such as radioactive decay and CSM interaction. We also model the host galaxy of SN 2020bqj. Results. The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier in the subclass based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and the low mass of its faint host galaxy. We show through modeling that the lightcurve of SN 2020bqj can be powered predominantly by shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM, combined with radioactive decay. The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj in terms of lightcurve and spectral evolution, suggesting a similar progenitor and CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual hydrogen. This scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN 2020bqj and the modeling results.},

abstract = {Detonations in helium-rich envelopes surrounding white dwarfs have garnered attention as triggers of faint thermonuclear ".Ia" supernovae and double detonation Type Ia supernovae. However, recent studies have found that the minimum size of a hotspot that can lead to a helium detonation is comparable to, or even larger than, the white dwarf's pressure scale height, casting doubt on the successful ignition of helium detonations in these systems. In this paper, we examine the previously neglected effects of C/O pollution and a full nuclear reaction network, and we consider hotspots with spatially constant pressure in addition to constant density hotspots. We find that the inclusion of these effects significantly decreases the minimum hotspot size for helium-rich detonation ignition, making detonations far more plausible during turbulent shell convection or during double white dwarf mergers. The increase in burning rate also decreases the minimum shell mass in which a helium detonation can successfully propagate and alters the composition of the shell's burning products. The ashes of these low-mass shells consist primarily of silicon, calcium, and unburned helium and metals and may explain the high-velocity spectral features observed in most Type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {In the single-degenerate scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a white dwarf (WD) must gain a significant amount of matter from a companion star. Because the accreted mass carries angular momentum, the WD is likely to achieve fast spin periods, which can increase the critical mass, M crit , needed for explosion. When M crit is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD, the central regions of the WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces super-Chandrasekhar single-degenerate explosions, and a delay between the completion of mass gain and the time of the explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore has a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a density similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also, either by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion, the donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters, generally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star. Nevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive. Prior to explosion, progenitors can be super-M Ch WDs in either wide binaries with WD companions or cataclysmic variables. These systems can be discovered and studied through wide-field surveys. Post-explosion, the spin-up/spin-down model predicts a population of fast-moving WDs, low-mass stars, and even brown dwarfs. In addition, the spin-up/spin-down model provides a paradigm which may be able to explain both the similarities and the diversity observed among SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Thermonuclear explosions may arise in binary star systems in which a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes helium-rich material from a companion star. If the accretion rate allows a sufficiently large mass of helium to accumulate prior to ignition of nuclear burning, the helium surface layer may detonate, giving rise to an astrophysical transient. Detonation of the accreted helium layer generates shock waves that propagate into the underlying CO WD. This might directly ignite a detonation of the CO WD at its surface (an edge-lit secondary detonation) or compress the core of the WD sufficiently to trigger a CO detonation near the centre. If either of these ignition mechanisms works, the two detonations (helium and CO) can then release sufficient energy to completely unbind the WD. These 'double-detonation' scenarios for thermonuclear explosion of WDs have previously been investigated as a potential channel for the production of Type Ia supernovae from WDs of ∼1 M. Here we extend our 2D studies of the double-detonation model to significantly less massive CO WDs, the explosion of which could produce fainter, more rapidly evolving transients. We investigate the feasibility of triggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass CO WDs and the observable consequences of such a detonation. Our results suggest that core detonation is probable, even for the lowest CO core masses that are likely to be realized in nature. To quantify the observable signatures of core detonation, we compute spectra and light curves for models in which either an edge-lit or compression-triggered CO detonation is assumed to occur. We compare these to synthetic observables for models in which no CO detonation was allowed to occur. If significant shock compression of the CO WD occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the CO WD can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei to significantly affect the light curves. In particular, this can lead to relatively slow post-maximum decline. If the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the CO WD explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect the observables more subtly. In this case, near-infrared observations and detailed spectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether a core detonation occurred. We comment on the implications of our results for understanding peculiar astrophysical transients including SN 2002bj, SN 2010X and SN 2005E.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology, owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship between light-curve shape and peak brightness 1,2. The precision distance measurements enabled by SNe Ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe 3,4 , now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of a mysterious "dark" energy. General consensus holds that Type Ia SNe result from thermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (WD) in a binary system 5,6 ; however, little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physical properties of the progenitor system. Here we make use of extensive historical imaging obtained at the location of SN 2011fe/PTF11kly, the closest SN Ia discovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-light lumi-nosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits on other SN Ia progenitors. This directly rules out luminous red giants and the vast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the exploding white dwarf. Any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than 3.5 times the mass of the Sun. These observations favour a scenario where the exploding WD of SN 2011fe/PTF11kly accreted matter either from another WD, or by Roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star. SN 2011fe/PTF11kly (hereafter SN 2011fe) was discovered in the Pinwheel Galaxy (Messier 101; M101), a spiral galaxy at a distance 7,8 of 6.4 Megaparsec (Mpc), by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) collaboration on 2011 Aug. 24 UT 9. The galaxy was intensively monitored by our collaboration over the past decade and the site of SN 2011fe was fortuitously observed prior to the explosion by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on several occasions. Together, these archival data offer a unique opportunity to constrain the nature of the progenitor system of SN 2011fe. The absence of hydrogen and helium, coupled with the presence of silicon in the spectra of SNe Ia, are the distinguishing signatures of the class 10 and exclude most massive stars as SN Ia progenitors. This, taken with the significant inferred amount of synthesised radioactive 56 Ni (0.1-0.9 M) 11 created in the explosions, suggests that the majority of SNe Ia arise from rapid thermonuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) that is more massive than that made from single-star evolution (greater than 1 solar mass). A more massive WD also has the higher densities needed to ignite the runaway carbon fusion reaction and trigger the observed nucleosynthesis. Thus, a companion star that donates mass to the WD is required, even though fundamental questions remain as to how the accretion of matter leads to the explosion for each progenitor model. The broadly diverse progenitor models are organised into two classes: double degenerate (DD) and single degenerate (SD) 12,13. A DD model involves two WDs in a close binary system 6,14 ; due to the release of gravitational radiation, the orbit shrinks. Ultimately, the lighter object (secondary) is disrupted and accretion onto the primary 1},

abstract = {In the far future long after star formation has ceased the universe will be populated by sparse degenerate remnants, mostly white dwarfs, though their ultimate fate is an open question. These white dwarfs will cool and freeze solid into black dwarfs while pycnonuclear fusion will slowly process their composition to iron-56. However, due to the declining electron fraction the Chandrasekhar limit of these stars will be decreasing and will eventually be below that of the most massive black dwarfs. As such, isolated dwarf stars with masses greater than ∼ 1.2M ⊙ will collapse in the far future due to the slow accumulation of iron-56 in their cores. If proton decay does not occur then this is the ultimate fate of about 10 21 stars, approximately one percent of all stars in the observable universe. We present calculations of the internal structure of black dwarfs with iron cores as a model for progenitors. From pycnonuclear fusion rates we estimate their lifetime and thus delay time to be 10 1100 years. We speculate that high mass black dwarf supernovae resemble accretion induced collapse of O/Ne/Mg white dwarfs while later low mass transients will be similar to stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova, and may be the last interesting astrophysical transients to occur prior to heat death.},

abstract = {The Type IIn supernova (SN) 2005ip is one of the most well-studied and long-lasting examples of a SN interacting with its circumstellar environment. The optical light curve plateaued at a nearly constant level for more than five years, suggesting ongoing shock interaction with an extended and clumpy circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we present continued observations of the SN from ∼ 1000 − 5000 days post-explosion at all wavelengths, including X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and mid-infrared. The UV spectra probe the pre-explosion mass loss and show evidence for CNO processing. From the bolometric light curve, we find that the total radiated energy is in excess of 10 50 erg, the progenitor star's pre-explosion mass-loss rate was > ∼ 1 × 10 −2 M yr −1 , and the total mass lost shortly before explosion was > ∼ 1 M , though the mass lost could have been considerably larger depending on the efficiency for the conversion of kinetic energy to radiation. The ultraviolet through near-infrared spectrum is characterised by two high density components, one with narrow high-ionisation lines, and one with broader low-ionisation H I, He I, [O I], Mg II, and Fe II lines. The rich Fe II spectrum is strongly affected by Ly$\alpha$ fluorescence, consistent with spectral modeling. Both the Balmer and He I lines indicate a decreasing CSM density during the late interaction period. We find similarities to SN 1988Z, which shows a comparable change in spectrum at around the same time during its very slow decline. These results suggest that, at long last, the shock interaction in SN 2005ip may finally be on the decline.},

Our calculations continue the simulations for two red supergiant (RSG) and two blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors by Wongwathanarat et al., who investigated the growth of explosion asymmetries produced by hydrodynamic instabilities during the first second of the explosion and their later fragmentation by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We focus on the late time acceleration and inflation of the ejecta caused by the heating due to the radioactive decay of 56 Ni to 56 Fe and by a new outward-moving shock, which forms when the reverse shock from the He/H-shell interface compresses the central part of the ejecta. The mean velocities of the iron-rich ejecta increase between 100 km/s and 350 km/s (∼8-30%), and the fastest one percent of the iron accelerates by up to ∼1000 km/s (∼20-25%). This 'Ni-bubble effect', known from 1D models, accelerates the bulk of the nickel in our 3D models and causes an inflation of the initially over-dense Ni-rich clumps, which leads to underdense, extended fingers, enveloped by overdense skins of compressed surrounding matter. We also provide volume and surface filling factors as well as a spherical harmonics analysis to characterize the spectrum of Ni-clump sizes quantitatively. Three of our four models give volume filling factors larger than 0.3, consistent with what is suggested for SN 1987A by observations.},

abstract = {Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with disklike circumstellar matter (CSM) have been suggested as an explanation of some unusual Type II SNe, e.g., the so-called "impossible" SN, iPTF14hls. There are some radiation hydrodynamics simulations for such SNe interacting with a CSM disk. However, such disk interaction models so far have not included the effect of the ionization and recombination processes in the SN ejecta, i.e., the fact that the photosphere of Type IIP SNe between ∼ 10-∼ 100 days is regulated by the hydrogen recombination front. We calculate light curves for Type IIP SNe interacting with a CSM disk viewed from the polar direction, and examine the effects of the disk density and opening angle on their bolometric light curves. This work embeds the shock interaction model of Moriya, et al. (2013) within the Type IIP SN model of Kasen & Woosley (2009), for taking into account the effects of the ionization and recombination in the SN ejecta. We demonstrate that such interacting SNe show three phases with different photometric and spectroscopic properties, following the change in the energy source: First few tens days after explosion (Phase 1), ∼ 10− ∼ 100 days (Phase 2) and days after that (Phase 3). From the calculations, we conclude that such hidden CSM disk cannot account for overluminous Type IIP SNe. We find that the luminosity ratio between Phase 1 and Phase 2 has information on the opening angle of the CSM disk. We thus encourage early photometric and spectroscopic observations of interacting SNe for investigating their CSM geometry.},

abstract = {The gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) model has been proposed as a possible explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae in the single-degenerate evolution channel. It starts with ignition of a deflagration in a single off-centre bubble in a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. Driven by buoyancy, the deflagration flame rises in a narrow cone towards the surface. For the most part, the main component of the flow of the expanding ashes remains radial, but upon reaching the outer, low-pressure layers of the white dwarf, an additional lateral component develops. This causes the deflagration ashes to converge again at the opposite side, where the compression heats fuel and a detonation may be launched. We first performed five three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the deflagration phase in 1.4 M carbon/oxygen white dwarfs at intermediate-resolution (256 3 computational zones). We confirm that the closer the initial deflagration is ignited to the centre, the slower the buoyant rise and the longer the deflagration ashes takes to break out and close in on the opposite pole to collide. To test the GCD explosion model, we then performed a high-resolution (512 3 computational zones) simulation for a model with an ignition spot offset near the upper limit of what is still justifiable, 200 km. This high-resolution simulation met our deliberately optimistic detonation criteria, and we initiated a detonation. The detonation burned through the white dwarf and led to its complete disruption. For this model, we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10 6 tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network, and we present multi-band light curves and time-dependent optical spectra. We find that our synthetic observables show a prominent viewing-angle sensitivity in ultraviolet and blue wavelength bands, which contradicts observed SNe Ia. The strong dependence on the viewing angle is caused by the asymmetric distribution of the deflagration ashes in the outer ejecta layers. Finally, we compared our model to SN 1991T. The overall flux level of the model is slightly too low, and the model predicts pre-maximum light spectral features due to Ca, S, and Si that are too strong. Furthermore, the model chemical abundance stratification qualitatively disagrees with recent abundance tomography results in two key areas: our model lacks low-velocity stable Fe and instead has copious amounts of high-velocity 56 Ni and stable Fe. We therefore do not find good agreement of the model with SN 1991T.},

abstract = {We investigate whether pure deflagration models of Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars can account for one or more subclass of the observed population of Type Ia super-nova (SN Ia) explosions. We compute a set of 3D full-star hydrodynamic explosion models, in which the deflagration strength is parametrized using the multispot ignition approach. For each model, we calculate detailed nucleosynthesis yields in a post-processing step with a 384 nuclide nuclear network. We also compute synthetic observables with our 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for comparison with observations. For weak and intermediate deflagra-tion strengths (energy release E nuc 1.1 × 10 51 erg), we find that the explosion leaves behind a bound remnant enriched with 3 to 10 per cent (by mass) of deflagration ashes. However, we do not obtain the large kick velocities recently reported in the literature. We find that weak deflagrations with E nuc ∼ 0.5 × 10 51 erg fit well both the light curves and spectra of 2002cx-like SNe Ia, and models with even lower explosion energies could explain some of the fainter members of this subclass. By comparing our synthetic observables with the properties of SNe Ia, we can exclude the brightest, most vigorously ignited models as candidates for any observed class of SN Ia: their B − V colours deviate significantly from both normal and 2002cx-like SNe Ia and they are too bright to be candidates for other subclasses.},

By using the gravitatonal lensing of light or gravitational waves emitted by, and peculiar motion of, these systems we derive constraints on the sum of neu-trino masses, the equation of state of dark energy parametrised in the form w0 + wa(1 − a), along with the Hubble constant and cold dark matter density in the Universe. We show that even after marginalising over poorly constrained physical quantities, such as the sum of neutrino masses and the nature of dark energy, low-redshift gravitational wave observations, in combination with type IA supernovae, have the potential to rule out new physics as the underlying cause of the Hubble tension at 4-$\sigma$.},

However, the properties of He-shell flashes on the surface of ONe WDs are still not well understood. In this article, we aim to study He-shell flashes on the surface of ONe WDs in a systematic approach. We investigated the long-term evolution of ONe WDs accreting He-rich material with various constant mass-accretion rates by time-dependent calculations with the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), in which the initial ONe WD masses range from 1.1 to 1.35 M ⊙. We found that the mass-retention efficiency increases with the ONe WD mass and the mass-accretion rate, whereas both the nova cycle duration and the ignition mass decrease with the ONe WD mass and the mass-accretion rate. We also present the nuclear products in different accretion scenarios. The results presented in this article can be used in the future binary population synthesis studies of AIC events.},

abstract = {We present extensive observations of SN 2018zd covering the first ∼ 450 d after the explosion. This SN shows a possible shock-breakout signal ∼ 3.6 hr after the explosion in the unfiltered light curve, and prominent flash-ionisation spectral features within the first week. The unusual photospheric temperature rise (rapidly from ∼ 12, 000 K to above 18,000 K) within the earliest few days suggests that the ejecta were continuously heated. Both the significant temperature rise and the flash spectral features can be explained with the interaction of the SN ejecta with the massive stellar wind (0.18 +0.05 −0.10 M), which accounts for the luminous peak (L max = [1.36±0.63]×10 43 erg s −1) of SN 2018zd. The luminous peak and low expansion velocity (v ≈ 3300 km s −1) make SN 2018zd to be like a member of the LLEV (luminous SNe II with low expansion velocities) events originated due to circumstellar interaction. The relatively fast post-peak decline allows a classification of SN 2018zd as a transition event morphologically linking SNe IIP and SNe IIL. In the radioactive-decay phase, SN 2018zd experienced a significant flux drop and behaved more like a low-luminosity SN IIP both spectro-scopically and photometrically. This contrast indicates that circumstellar interaction plays a vital role in modifying the observed light curves of SNe II. Comparing nebular-phase spectra with model predictions suggests that SN 2018zd arose from a star of ∼ 12 M. Given the relatively small amount of 56 Ni (0.013 − 0.035M), the massive stellar wind, and the faint X-ray radiation, the progenitor of SN 2018zd could be a massive asymptotic giant branch star which collapsed owing to electron capture.},

In this toy model we use a template light curve from a different CCSN that is similar to SN 2018gk, but that has no rapid drop in its light curve. The bipolar morphology that we model with a polar ejecta and an equatorial ejecta increases the maximum luminosity and causes a steeper decline for an equatorial observer, relative to a similar spherical explosion. The total energy and mass of our toy model for SN 2018gk are E SN = 5 × 10 51 erg and M SN = 2.7M. This explosion energy is more than what a neutrino-driven explosion mechanism can supply, implying that jets exploded SN 2018gk. These energetic jets likely shaped the ejecta to a bipolar morphology, as our toy model requires. We crudely estimate that f ≈ 2 − 5% of all CCSNe show this behavior, most being hydrogen deficient (stripped-envelope) CCSNe, as we observe them from the equatorail plane. We estimate the overall fraction of CCSNe that have a pronounced bipolar morphology to be f bip ≈ 5 − 15% of all CCSNe.},

abstract = {We present nebular spectra (153 rest-frame days after peak brightness) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2019yvq, which had a bright flash of blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, after which it rose in a manner similar to other SNe Ia. Although SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare characteristics such as persistent high ejecta velocity near peak brightness, it was not especially peculiar and if the early "excess" emission were not observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux can be explained by several different physical models linked to the details of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. While the early-time data alone cannot distinguish between these models, each has unique predictions for the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular spectra, we detect strong [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291, 7324 and Ca NIR triplet emission, consistent with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I] emission, predictions for some single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up H or He is <2.8 × 10 −4 and 2.4 × 10 −4 M , respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq nebular spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape. The nebular lines are blueshifted relative to their rest-frame wavelengths, which is atypical for a high-velocity SN Ia like SN 2019yvq. Comparing to theoretical spectra of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf undergoing a double-detonation, we find close agreement with a model with a total progenitor mass of 1.15 M. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick He-shell double-detonations only account for 1.1 +2.1 −1.1 % of the total "normal" SN Ia rate. SN 2019yvq is one of the best examples yet that multiple progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce the full diversity of "normal" SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Observations of young supernova remnants (SNRs) in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays have provided conclusive evidence for particle acceleration to at least TeV energies. Analysis of high spatial resolution X-ray maps of young SNRs has indicated that the particle acceleration process is accompanied by strong non-adiabatic amplification of magnetic fields. If Fermi acceleration is the mechanism producing the energetic cosmic rays (CRs), the amplified magnetic field must be turbulent and CR-driven instabili-ties are among the most probable mechanisms for converting the shock ram pressure into the magnetic turbulence. The development and evolution of strong magnetic turbulence in the collisionless plasmas forming SNR shells are complicated phenomena which include the amplification of magnetic modes, anisotropic mode transformations at shocks, as well as the nonlinear physics of turbulent cascades. Polarized X-ray synchrotron radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons accelerated in the SNR shock is produced in a thin layer immediately behind the shock and is not subject to the Faraday depo-larization effect. These factors open possibilities to study some properties of magnetic turbulence and here we present polarized X-ray synchrotron maps of SNR shells assuming different models of magnetic turbulence cascades. It is shown that different models of the anisotropic turbulence can be distinguished by measuring the predominant polarization angle direction. We discuss the detection of these features in Tycho's SNR with the coming generation of X-ray polarimeters such as IXPE.},

The rising part of the light curve was monitored only in the R PTF filter band, and maximum in this band was reached ∼ 30 rest-frame days after the estimated explosion time. The light curve and spectra of PTF11rka are consistent with the core-collapse explosion of a ∼10 M carbon-oxygen core evolved from a progenitor of main-sequence mass 25-40 M , that liberated a kinetic energy E k ≈ 4 × 10 51 erg, expelled ∼ 8 M of ejecta, and synthesised ∼ 0.5 M of 56 Ni. The photospheric spectra of PTF11rka are characterised by narrow absorption lines that point to suppression of the highest ejecta velocities (∼ > 15, 000 km s −1). This would be expected if the ejecta impacted a dense, clumpy circumstellar medium. This in turn caused them to lose a fraction of their energy (∼ 5 × 10 50 erg), less than 2% of which was converted into radiation that sustained the light curve before maximum brightness. This is reminiscent of the superluminous SN 2007bi, the light-curve shape and spectra of which are very similar to those of PTF11rka, although the latter is a factor of 10 less luminous and evolves faster in time. PTF11rka is in fact more similar to gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) in luminosity, although it has a lower energy and a lower E k /M ej ratio.},

Therefore, we consider a CSI plus magnetar model with the gamma-rays/X-rays leakage effect to eliminate the late-time excess of the theoretical LC. We find that this revised model can reproduce the bolometric LC of ASASSN-15lh. Moreover, we construct a new hybrid model (i.e., the CSI plus fallback model), and find that it can also reproduce the bolometric LC of ASASSN-15lh. Assuming that the conversion efficiency ($\eta$) of fallback accretion to the outflow is typically ∼ 10 −3 , we derive that the total mass accreted is ∼ 3.9 M ⊙. The inferred CSM mass in the two models is rather large, indicating that the progenitor could have experienced an eruption of hydrogen-poor materials followed by an energetic core-collapse explosion leaving behind a magnetar or a black hole.},

abstract = {A trustworthy estimate of the redshift distribution n(z) is crucial for using weak gravitational lensing and large-scale structure of galaxy catalogs to study cosmology. Spectroscopic redshifts for the dim and numerous galaxies of next-generation weak-lensing surveys are expected to be unavailable, making photometric redshift (photo-z) probability density functions (PDFs) the next-best alternative for comprehensively encapsulating the nontrivial systematics affecting photo-z point estimation. The established stacked estimator of n(z) avoids reducing photo-z PDFs to point estimates but yields a systematically biased estimate of n(z) that worsens with decreasing signal-to-noise, the very regime where photo-z PDFs are most necessary. We introduce Cosmological Hierarchical Inference with Probabilistic Photometric Redshifts (CHIPPR), a statistically rigorous probabilistic graphical model of redshift-dependent photometry, which correctly propagates the redshift uncertainty information beyond the best-fit estimator of n(z) produced by traditional procedures and is provably the only self-consistent way to recover n(z) from photo-z PDFs. We present the chippr prototype code , noting that the mathematically justifiable approach incurs computational expense. The CHIPPR approach is applicable to any one-point statistic of any random variable, provided the prior probability density used to produce the posteriors is explicitly known; if the prior is implicit, as may be the case for popular photo-z techniques, then the resulting posterior PDFs cannot be used for scientific inference. We therefore recommend that the photo-z community focus on developing methodologies that enable the recovery of photo-z likelihoods with support over all redshifts, either directly or via a known prior probability density.},

Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of 0.9 M and 1.1 M combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color light curves of our merger, which produces about 0.62 M of 56 Ni, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia. Therefore, depending on the number of such massive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a small fraction to the observed population of normal SNe Ia.},

SN 2014ab was a luminous Type IIn SN (M V < −19.14 mag) discovered after peak brightness near the nucleus of its host galaxy, VV 306c. Prediscovery upper limits constrain the time of explosion to within 200 days prior to discovery. While SN 2014ab declined by ∼ 1 mag over the course of our observations, the observed spectrum remained remarkably unchanged. Spectra exhibit an asymmetric emission-line profile with a consistently stronger blueshifted component, suggesting the presence of dust or a lack of symmetry between the far side and near side of the SN. The Pa$\beta$ emission line shows a profile very similar to that of H$\alpha$, implying that this stronger blueshifted component is caused either through obscuration by large dust grains, occultation by optically thick material, or a lack of symmetry between the far side and near side of the interaction region. Despite these asymmetric line profiles, our spectropolarimetric data show that SN 2014ab has little detected polarization after accounting for the interstellar polarization. This suggests that we are seeing emission from a photosphere that has only small deviation from circular symmetry face-on. We are likely seeing a SN IIn with nearly circular symmetry in the plane normal to our line of sight, but with either large-grain dust or significant asymmetry in the density of circumstellar material or SN ejecta along our line of sight.

abstract = {We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed lightcurve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ∼ 12000-14500 km s −1. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong Fe and Fe absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5%). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio. Given the short time from the transient's proposed explosion epoch, the Fe cannot be 56 Fe resulting from the decay of radioactive 56 Ni synthesised in the explosion. Instead, we propose that this is stable 54 Fe, and that the transient is unusually rich in this isotope. We further identify an additional, high-velocity component of ejecta material at ∼ 20000-26000 km s −1 , which is mildly asymmetric and detectable through the Ca NIR triplet. We discuss our findings with reference to a range of plausible progenitor systems and compare with published theoretical work. We conclude that AT2018kzr is most likely the result of a merger between an ONe white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole. As such, it would be the second plausible candidate with a good spectral sequence for the electromagnetic counterpart of a compact binary merger, after AT2017gfo.},

abstract = {The activity of massive stars approaching core-collapse can strongly affect the appearance of the star and its subsequent supernova. Late-phase convective nuclear burning generates waves that propagate toward the stellar surface, heating the envelope and potentially triggering mass loss. In this work, we improve on previous one-dimensional models by performing two-dimensional simulations of the pre-supernova mass ejection phase due wave heat deposition. Beginning with stellar evolutionary models of a 15 M ⊙ red supergiant star during core O-burning, we treat the energy deposition rate and duration as model parameters and examine the mass-loss dependence and the pre-explosion morphology accordingly. Unlike one-dimensional models, density inversions due to wave heating are smoothed by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, and the primary effect of wave heating is to radially expand the star's hydrogen envelope. For low heating rates with long durations, the expansion is nearly homologous, whereas high but short-lived heating can generate a shock that drives envelope expansion and results in a qualitatively different density profile at the time of core-collapse. Asymmetries are fairly small, and large amounts of mass loss are unlikely unless the wave heating exceeds expectations. We discuss implications for pre-supernova stellar variability and supernovae light curves.},

Parameter inference depends on the criteria by which the analysis SN sample is selected. Only for the simplest selection criteria and population models can the likelihood be calculated analytically, otherwise it needs to be determined numerically, a process that inherently has error. Numerical errors in the likelihood lead to errors in parameter inference. This article presents toy examples where the distance modulus is inferred given a set of SNe at a single redshift. Parameter estimators and their uncertainties are calculated using Monte Carlo techniques. The relationship between the number of Monte Carlo realizations and numerical errors is presented. The procedure can be applied to more realistic models and used to determine the computational and data management requirements of the transient analysis pipeline.},

abstract = {Supernova spectral time series contain a wealth of information about the progenitor and explosion process of these energetic events. The modeling of these data requires the exploration of very high dimensional posterior probabilities with expensive radiative transfer codes. Even modest parametriza-tions of supernovae contain more than ten parameters and a detailed exploration demands at least several million function evaluations. Physically realistic models require at least tens of CPU minutes per evaluation putting a detailed reconstruction of the explosion out of reach of traditional methodology. The advent of widely available libraries for the training of neural networks combined with their ability to approximate almost arbitrary functions with high precision allows for a new approach to this problem. Instead of evaluating the radiative transfer model itself, one can build a neural network proxy trained on the simulations but evaluating orders of magnitude faster. Such a framework is called an emulator or surrogate model. In this work, we present an emulator for the tardis supernova radiative transfer code applied to Type Ia supernova spectra. We show that we can train an emulator for this problem given a modest training set of a hundred thousand spectra (easily calculable on modern su-percomputers). The results show an accuracy on the percent level (that are dominated by the Monte Carlo nature of tardis and not the emulator) with a speedup of several orders of magnitude. This method has a much broader set of applications and is not limited to the presented problem.},

abstract = {Following shock breakout, the emission from an astrophysical explosion is dominated by the radiation of shock heated material as it expands and cools, known as shock cooling emission (SCE). The luminosity of SCE is proportional to the initial radius of the emitting material, which makes its measurement useful for investigating the progenitors of these explosions. Recent observations have shown some transient events have especially prominent SCE, indicating a large radius that is potentially due to low mass extended material. Motivated by this, we present an updated analytic model for SCE that can be utilized to fit these observations and learn more about the origin of these events. This model is compared with numerical simulations to assess its validity and limitations. We also discuss SNe 2016gkg and 2019dge, two transients with large early luminosity peaks that have previously been attributed to SCE of extended material. We show that their early power-law evolution and photometry are well matched by our model, strengthening support for this interpretation.},

abstract = {Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide a better understanding of nearly every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to modern time-domain optical surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric monitoring (on the order of seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum light, using the fast imagers available on the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2 m telescope at Kryoneri Observatory in Greece. We applied differential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and we present reconstructed light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA, Kov{\'{a}}cs et al. 2005). TFA yielded the best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01 − 0.04 mag. We did not detect significant bumps with amplitudes greater than 0.05 mag in any of the SNe targets in the VR-, R-, and I-bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light curve, which ranges between-0.37−0.36 mag day −1 in broadband VR,-0.19−0.31 mag day −1 in R band, and-0.13−0.10 mag day −1 in I band. We used SNe light curve fitting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn to photometrically classify the light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order polynomial fit and SN 2018hhn for the first time. We conclude that optimal aperture photometry in combination with TFA provides the highest-precision light curves for SNe that are relatively well separated from the centers of their host galaxies. This work aims to inspire the use of ground-based, high-cadence and high-precision photometry to study SNe with the purpose of revealing clues and properties of the explosion environment of both core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, the explosion mechanisms, binary star interaction and progenitor channels. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence of hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor stars.},

This model suite comprises the first set of three-dimensional SN Ia simulations with detailed isotopic yield information. As such, it may serve as a data base for Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation model nucleosynthetic yields and for deriving synthetic observables such as spectra and light curves. We employ a physically motivated, stochastic model based on turbulent velocity fluctuations and fuel density to calculate in situ the deflagration-to-detonation transition probabilities. To obtain different strengths of the deflagration phase and thereby different degrees of pre-expansion, we have chosen a sequence of initial models with 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 1600 (two different realizations) ignition kernels in a hydrostatic white dwarf with a central density of 2.9 × 10 9 g cm −3 , as well as one high central density (5.5 × 10 9 g cm −3) and one low central density (1.0 × 10 9 g cm −3) rendition of the 100 ignition kernel configuration. For each simulation, we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10 6 tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network. All delayed-detonation models result in explosions unbinding the white dwarf, producing a range of 56 Ni masses from 0.32 to 1.11 M. As a general trend, the models predict that the stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes are not found at the lowest velocities, but rather at intermediate velocities (∼3000-10 000 km s −1) in a shell surrounding a 56 Ni-rich core. The models further predict relatively low-velocity oxygen and carbon, with typical minimum velocities around 4000 and 10 000 km s −1 , respectively.},

abstract = {In the single degenerate (SD) scenario of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the collision of the ejecta with its companion results in stripping hydrogen rich matter from the companion star. This hydrogen rich matter might leave its trace in the light curves and/or spectra. In this paper, we perform radiation hydrodynamical simulations of this collision for three binary systems. As a result, we find that the emission from the shock-heated region is not as strong as in the previous study. This weak emission, however, may be a result of our underestimate of the coupling between the gas and radiation in the shock interaction. Therefore, though our results suggest that the observed early light curves of SNe Ia can not rule out binary systems with a short separation as the progenitor system, more elaborate numerical studies will be needed to reach a fair conclusion. Alternatively, our results indicate that the feature observed in the early phase of a recent type Ia SN 2014J might result from interaction of the ejecta with a red giant companion star. We also discuss the dependence of spectral features of H$\alpha$ and Si II absorption lines on viewing angles and investigate whether they can constrain the event rate of the SD progenitor. 1},

abstract = {We measured the thermonuclear burning efficiency as a function of accretion rate for the Type I X-ray bursts of five low-mass X-ray binary systems. We chose sources with measured neutron star spins and a substantial population of bursts from a large observational sample. The general trend for the burst rate is qualitatively the same for all sources; the burst rate first increases with the accretion rate up to a maximum, above which the burst rate declines, despite the increasing accretion rate. At higher accretion rates, when the burst rate decreases, the $\alpha$-value (the ratio of accretion energy and burst energy) increases by up to a factor of 10 above that in the rising burst rate regime. These observations are contrary to the predictions of 1D numerical models, but can be explained as the consequence of a zone of stable burning on the neutron star surface, which expands with increasing accretion rate. The stable burning also "pollutes" the unstable burning layer with ashes, contributing to the change in burst properties measured in the falling burst rate regime. We find that the mass accretion rate at which the burst rate begins to decrease is anti-correlated with the spin of the neutron star. We conclude that the neutron star spin is a key factor, moderating the nuclear burning stability, via the local accretion rate and fuel composition over the star.},

abstract = {The amount of 56 Ni produced in type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion is probably the most important physical parameter underlying the observed correlation of SN Ia luminosities with their light curves. Based on an empirical relation between the 56 Ni mass and the light curve parameter △m 15 , we obtained rough estimates of the 56 Ni mass for a large sample of nearby SNe Ia with the aim of exploring the diversity in SN Ia. We found that the derived 56 Ni masses for different SNe Ia could vary by a factor of ten (e.g., M Ni = 0.1 − 1.3 M ⊙), which cannot be explained in terms of the standard Chandrasekhar-mass model (with a 56 Ni mass production of 0.4-0.8 M ⊙). Different explosion and/or progenitor models are clearly required for various SNe Ia, in particular, for those extremely nickel-poor and nickel-rich producers. The nickel-rich (with M Ni > 0.8 M ⊙) SNe Ia are very luminous and may have massive progenitors exceeding the Chandrasekhar-mass limit since extra progenitor fuel is required to produce more 56 Ni to power the light curve. This is also consistent with the finding that the intrinsically bright SNe Ia prefer to occur in stellar environments of young and massive stars. For example, 75% SNe Ia in spirals have ∆m 15 < 1.2 while this ratio is only 18% in E/S0 galaxies. On the other hand, the nickel-poor SNe Ia (with M Ni < 0.2 M ⊙) may invoke the sub-Chandrasekhar model, as most of them were found in early-type E/S0 galaxies dominated by the older and low-mass stellar populations. This indicates that SNe Ia in spiral and E/S0 galaxies have progenitors of different properties.},

The photometric data continue to favor low values of R V , though with large variations from event to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. We confirm the findings of other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derived reddening law, R V , and the color excess, E(B − V), such that larger E(B − V) tends to favor lower R V. The intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatter that cannot be explained by variations in R V or by the Goobar power-law for circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features of the supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.},

abstract = {Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe$\,$Ia) provide essential clues for understanding the progenitor system that gave rise to the terminal thermonuclear explosion. We present exquisite observations of SN$\,$2019yvq, the second observed SN$\,$Ia, after iPTF$\,$14atg, to display an early flash of emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that SN$\,$2019yvq was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was moderately underluminous for an SN$\,$Ia ($M_g \approx -18.5\,$mag at peak) yet featured very high absorption velocities ($v \approx 15,000\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ for Si II $\lambda$6355 at peak). We find that many of the observational features of SN$\,$2019yvq, aside from the flash, can be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ is relatively low (we measure $M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.31 \pm 0.05\,M_\odot$) and it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of the ejecta. To explain both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of SN$\,$2019yvq we consider four different models: interaction between the SN ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ in the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two white dwarfs. Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the observations; it is clear additional tuning is required to better match SN$\,$2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra of SN$\,$2019yvq will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion, strong [Ca II] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O I] emission, if it was due to a violent merger.},

abstract = {Type Ia Supernova(SN Ia) are a powerful, albeit not completely understood, tool for cosmology. Gaps in our understanding of their progenitors and detailed physics can lead to systematic errors in the cos-mological distances they measure. We use UV data in two context to help further our understanding of SN Ia progenitors and physics. We analyze a set of nearly 700 light curves, and find no signature of the shock heating of a red giant companion, predicted by Kasen (2010), casting doubt as to frequency of this SN Ia channel. We also use UV imaging of high redshift host galaxies of SN Ia to better understand the environments which SN Ia occur. We show that some high-z elliptical galaxies have current star formation, hindering efforts to use them as low-extinction environments. We show cosmo-logical scatter of SN distances at large effective radii in their hosts is significantly reduced, and argue this is due to the smaller amounts of dust affecting the SN Ia. Finally, we find a two component dependance of SN distance measurements as a function of their host galaxy's FUV-V color. This indicates that both the age and metallicity/mass of the host galaxy maybe important ingredients in measuring SN Ia distances.},

No evidence for shock emission is seen; however, the cadence and photometric noise could hide a weak shock signal. We simulate shocked light curves using SN Ia templates and a simple Gaussian shock model to emulate the noise properties of the SDSS-II sample and estimate the detectability of the shock interaction signal as a function of shock amplitude, shock width, and shock fraction. We find no direct evidence for shock interaction in the rest-frame B-band, but place an upper limit on the shock amplitude at 9% of SN peak flux (M B > −16.6 mag). If the single degenerate channel dominates type Ia progenitors, this result constrains the companion stars to be less than about 6 M on the main sequence and strongly disfavors red giant companions.},

abstract = {The most direct and strongest evidence for the presence of dark energy is provided by the measurement of galaxy distances using SNe Ia. This result is based on the assumption that the corrected brightness of SN Ia through the empirical standardization would not evolve with look-back time. Recent studies have shown, however, that the standardized brightness of SN Ia is correlated with host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate (SFR), suggesting a possible correlation with stellar population property. To understand the origin of these correlations, we have continued our spectroscopic observations to cover most of the reported nearby early-type host galaxies. From high-quality (signal-to-noise ratio ∼175) spectra, we obtained the most direct and reliable estimates of population age and metallicity for these host galaxies. Corresponding author: Young-Wook Lee ywlee2@yonsei.ac.kr 2 We find a significant correlation between SN luminosity (after the standardization) and stellar population age at a 99.5% confidence level. As such, this is the most direct and stringent test ever made for the luminosity evolution of SN Ia. Based on this result, we further show that the previously reported correlations with host morphology, host mass, and local SFR are most likely originated from the difference in population age. This indicates that the light-curve fitters used by the SNe Ia community are not quite capable of correcting for the population age effect, which would inevitably cause a serious systematic bias with look-back time. Notably, taken at face values, most of the Hubble residual used in the discovery of the dark energy appears to be affected by the luminosity evolution.},

abstract = {Numerical models of core-bounce supernovae with hydrogenless "Wolf-Rayet" progenitors are presented. The luminosity near peak light of these supernovae is provided by the escape of radioactive decay energy which accumulates in the optically thick interior and diffuses outward until it meets the inwardly moving photosphere (recombination front). It has been suggested that such stars are the source of Type lb supernovae. Type lb peak magnitudes and light curves have been collected from the literature, analyzed, and compared with the models. We find that the models have difficulty matching the observed decline in luminosity immediately after peak in SN 1983N, the prototypical Type lb supernova (SNIb). However, they may be able to fit the light curve of the unusual SNIb 1985F. If some or all Type lb progenitors are Wolf-Rayet-like stars, the widths of the supernova light curves constrain them to be between about 4 and 7 M 0 , originally 15-25 M G on the main sequence. Subject headings: stars: interiors-stars: supernovae I. INTRODUCTION Supernovae fall into two general classes: Type I (SNI), which do not have hydrogen in their spectra, and Type II (SNII), which do (Minkowski 1941). The Type IPs can be further divided into two subgroups (Barbon, Ciatti, and Rosino 1979): SNII-P, which have a plateau phase in their light curve, and SNII-L, which decline linearly from peak. Even within these subgroups, there is considerable variation in brightness, light curve, and spectrum. Type I supernovae, on the other hand, have traditionally formed a much more homogeneous class, but recent observations of SN 1983N and SN 1984L have resulted in the identification of a distinct new subclass, Type lb. While theorists have generally linked classical Type I super-novae (henceforth SNIa) to exploding white dwarfs (see Woosley and Weaver 1986 for a review), the origin of Type lb (SNIb) supernovae remains controversial (Wheeler and Lev-reault 1985; Chevalier 1986; Cameron and Iben 1986; Branch and Nomoto 1986; Uomoto 1986; Khokhlov and Ergma 1986; Iben et al 1987; Branch 1988). Their progenitors could be white dwarfs or other hydrogen-deficient objects, the most popular speculation in recent years being that they are "Wolf-Rayet" stars, massive stars which have completely lost their hydrogen envelopes before dying. Following a brief review of the observations and previous theoretical work, this paper will examine the massive-star hypothesis by comparing model light curves with observed Type lb light curves. A second paper in this series (Woosley and Weaver 1988) will describe in more detail the presupernova stars and the explosions, nucleo-synthesis, and dynamics of the models. Paper III (Pinto, Axelrod, and Woosley 1988) will examine constraints provided by spectra (see also Axelrod 1988).},

Here we use binary population synthesis models with a binary fraction that varies with initial mass to test the effects on resolved stellar pops and supernovae, and ask whether these can constrain the poorly-known binary fraction in different mass and metallicity regimes. We show that Wolf-Rayet star subtype ratios are valuable binary diagnostics, but require large samples to distinguish by models. Uncertainties in which stellar models would be spectroscopically classified as Wolf-Rayet stars are explored. The ratio of thermonuclear, stripped envelope and other core-collapse supernovae may prove a more accessible test and upcoming surveys will be sufficient to constrain both the high mass and low mass binary fraction in the z < 1 galaxy population.},

abstract = {We explore the physics of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves and spectra using the 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) time-dependent radiative-transfer code CMFGEN. Rather than adjusting ejecta properties to match observations, we select as input one 'standard' 1D Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation hydrodynamical model, and then explore the sensitivity of radiation and gas properties of the ejecta on radiative-transfer modelling assumptions. The correct computation of SN Ia radiation is not exclusively a solution to an 'opacity problem', characterized by the treatment of a large number of lines. We demonstrate that the key is to identify and treat important atomic processes consistently. This is not limited to treating line blanketing in non-LTE. We show that including forbidden-line transitions of metals, and in particular Co, is increasingly important for the temperature and ionization of the gas beyond maximum light. Non-thermal ionization and excitation are also critical since they affect the colour evolution and the M 15 decline rate of our model. While impacting little the bolometric luminosity, a more complete treatment of decay routes leads to enhanced line blanketing, e.g. associated with 48 Ti in the U and B bands. Overall, we find that SN Ia radiation properties are influenced in a complicated way by the atomic data we employ, so that obtaining converged results is a real challenge. Nonetheless, with our fully fledged CMFGEN model, we obtain good agreement with the golden standard Type Ia SN 2005cf in the optical and near-IR, from 5 to 60 d after explosion, suggesting that assuming spherical symmetry is not detrimental to SN Ia radiative-transfer modelling at these times. Multi-D effects no doubt matter, but they are perhaps less important than accurately treating the non-LTE processes that are crucial to obtain reliable temperature and ionization structures.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that Type Iax supernovae might be the result of thermonuclear deflagrations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in binary systems. We carry out Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations and predict spectropolarimetric features originating from the supernova explosion and subsequent ejecta interaction with the companion star. Specifically, we calculate viewing-angle dependent flux and polarisation spectra for a 3D model simulating the deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and, for a second model, simulating the ejecta interaction with a main-sequence star. We find that the intrinsic signal is weakly polarised and only mildly viewing-angle dependent, owing to the overall spherical symmetry of the explosion and the depolarising contribution of iron-group elements dominating the ejecta composition. The interaction with the companion star carves out a cavity in the ejecta and produces a detectable, but modest signal that is significant only at relatively blue wavelengths (5000 {\AA}). In particular, increasingly fainter and redder spectra are predicted for observer orientations further from the cavity, while a modest polarisation signal P ∼ 0.2 per cent is found at blue wavelengths for orientations 30 • and 45 • away from the cavity. We find a reasonable agreement between the interaction model viewed from these orientations and spectropolarimetric data of SN 2005hk and interpret the maximum-light polari-sation signal seen at blue wavelengths for this event as a possible signature of the ejecta-companion interaction. We encourage further polarimetric observations of SNe Iax to test whether our results can be extended and generalised to the whole SN Iax class.},

abstract = {Much uncertainty surrounds the origin of superluminous supernovae (SNe). Motivated by the discovery of the Type Ic SN 2007bi, we study its proposed association with a pair-instability SN (PISN). We compute stellar evolution models for primordial ∼200 M stars, simulating the implosion/explosion due to the pair-production instability, and use them as inputs for detailed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations that include non-local energy deposition and non-thermal processes. We retrieve the basic morphology of PISN light curves from red supergiant, blue supergiant and Wolf-Rayet (WR) star progenitors. Although we confirm that a progenitor 100 M helium core (PISN model He100) fits well the SN 2007bi light curve, the low ratios of its kinetic energy and 56 Ni mass to the ejecta mass, similar to standard core-collapse SNe, conspire to produce cool photospheres, red spectra subject to strong line blanketing and narrow-line profiles, all conflicting with SN 2007bi observations. He-core models of increasing 56 Ni-to-ejecta mass ratio have bluer spectra, but still too red to match SN 2007bi, even for model He125-the effect of 56 Ni heating is offset by the associated increase in blanketing. In contrast, the delayed injection of energy by a magnetar represents a more attractive alternative to reproduce the blue, weakly blanketed and broad-lined spectra of superluminous SNe. The extra heat source is free of blanketing and is not explicitly tied to the ejecta. Experimenting with an ∼9 M WR-star progenitor, initially exploded to yield an ∼1.6 B SN Ib/c ejecta but later influenced by tunable magnetar-like radiation, we produce a diversity of blue spectral morphologies reminiscent of SN 2007bi, the peculiar Type Ib SN 2005bf and superluminous SN 2005ap-like events.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of mixing of radioactive nickel (56 Ni) on the early-time color evolution of Type Ib and Ic supernovae (SNe Ib/Ic) using multigroup radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We consider both helium-rich and helium-poor progenitors. Mixing of 56 Ni is parameterized using a Gaussian distribution function. We find that the early-time color evolution with a weak 56 Ni mixing is characterized by three different phases: initial rapid reddening, blueward evolution due to the delayed effect of 56 Ni heating, and redward evolution thereafter until the transition to the nebular phase. With a strong 56 Ni mixing, the color evolution is characterized by a monotonic reddening. We compare our models with the early-time color evolution of several SNe Ib/Ic (SN 1999ex, SN 2008D, SN 2009jf, iPTF13bvn, SN 1994I, SN 2007gr, SN 2013ge, and 2017ein) and find signatures of relatively weak and strong 56 Ni mixing for SNe Ib and SNe Ic, respectively. This suggests that SNe Ib progenitors are distinct from SN Ic progenitors in terms of helium content and that 56 Ni mixing is generally stronger in the carbon-oxygen core and weaker in the helium-rich envelope. We conclude that the early-time color evolution is a powerful probe of 56 Ni mixing in SNe Ib/Ic.},

We demonstrate that, in the optically thin case, these low dust masses are robust despite significant observational and model uncertainties. For a sample of 11 well-observed CCSNe, no plausible model reaches carbon dust masses above 10 −4 M , or silicate masses above ∼ 10 −3 M. Optically thick models can accommodate larger dust masses, but the dust must be clumped and have a low (< 0.1) covering fraction to avoid conflict with data at optical wavelengths. These values are insufficient to reproduce the observed infrared fluxes, and the required covering fraction varies not only between SNe but between epochs for the same object. The difficulty in reconciling large dust masses with early-time observations of CCSNe, combined with well-established detections of comparably large dust masses in supernova remnants, suggests that a mechanism for late-time dust formation is necessary.},

abstract = {Models of pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) predict a gap in black hole (BH) masses between ∼ 45M − 120M , which is referred to as the upper BH mass-gap. With the advent of gravitational-wave astrophysics it has become possible to test this prediction, and there is an important associated effort to understand what theoretical uncertainties modify the boundaries of this gap. In this work we study the impact of rotation on the hydrodynamics of PISNe, which leave no compact remnant, as well as the evolution of pulsational-PISNe (PPISNe), which undergo thermonuclear eruptions before forming a compact object. We perform simulations of non-rotating and rapidly-rotating stripped helium stars in a metal poor environment (Z /50) in order to resolve the lower edge of the upper mass-gap. We find that the outcome of our simulations is dependent on the efficiency of angular momentum transport, with models that include efficient coupling through the Spruit-Tayler dynamo shifting the lower edge of the mass-gap upwards by ∼ 4%, while simulations that do not include this effect shift it upwards by ∼ 15%. From this, we expect the lower edge of the upper mass-gap to be dependent on BH spin, which can be tested as the number of observed BH mergers increases. Moreover, we show that stars undergoing PPISNe have extended envelopes (R ∼ 10 − 1000 R) at iron-core collapse, making them promising progenitors for ultra-long gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {We show that the luminous supernovae associated with ultra-long gamma-ray bursts can be caused by the slow adiabatic cooling of hydrogen-free progenitors extended by pulsational pair-instability. In the accompanying paper (Marchant & Moriya 2020), we have shown that some rapidly-rotating hydrogen-free gamma-ray burst progenitors that experience pulsational pair-instability can keep an extended structure caused by pulsational pair-instability until the core collapse. Such progenitors have large radii exceeding 10 R ⊙ and they sometimes reach beyond 1000 R ⊙ at the time of the core collapse. They are, therefore, promising progenitors of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts. We here perform the light-curve modeling of the explosions of one extended hydrogen-free progenitor with a radius of 1962 R ⊙. Thanks to the large progenitor radius, the ejecta experience slow adiabatic cooling and they become rapidly evolving (10 days) luminous (10 43 erg s −1) supernovae even without the energy input from the 56 Ni nuclear decay. They also have fast photospheric velocity above 10,000 km s −1 and hot photospheric temperature above 10,000 K at around the peak luminosity. We find that SN 2011kl, which is associated with the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB 111209A, can be explained by the adiabatic cooling phase of the extended progenitor. The ultra-long gamma-ray burst progenitors proposed in Marchant & Moriya (2020) can explain both the ultra-long gamma-ray burst duration and the accompanying supernova properties. When the gamma-ray burst jet is off-axis or choked, the luminous supernovae could be observed as fast blue optical transients without accompanying gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the final data release of the Carnegie Supernova Project I, focusing on the absolute calibration of the luminosity-decline rate relation for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using new intrinsic color relations with respect to the color-stretch parameter, s BV , enabling improved dust extinction corrections. We investigate to what degree the so-called fast-declining SNeIa can be used to determine accurate extragalactic distances. We estimate the intrinsic scatter in the luminosity-decline rate relation and find it ranges from ±0.13 mag to ±0.18 mag with no obvious dependence on wavelength. Using the Cepheid variable star data from the SH0ES project, the SNIa distance scale is calibrated and the Hubble constant is estimated using our optical and near-infrared sample, and these results are compared to those determined exclusively from a near-infrared subsample. The systematic effect of the supernova's host galaxy mass is investigated as a function of wavelength and is found to decrease toward redder wavelengths, suggesting this effect may be due to dust properties of the host. Using estimates of the dust extinction derived from optical and near-infrared wavelengths and applying these to the H band, we derive a Hubble constant H 73.2 2.3 km s Mpc 0 1 1 = +-, whereas using a simple B−V color correction applied to the B band yields H 72.7 2.1 km s Mpc 0 1 1 = +-. Photometry of two calibrating SNeIa from the CSP-II sample, SN2012ht and SN2015F, is presented and used to improve the calibration of the SNIa distance ladder.},

abstract = {Mixing of 56 Ni, whose nuclear decay energy is a major luminosity source in stripped-envelope supernovae, is known to affect the observational properties of stripped-envelope supernovae such as light-curve and color evolution. Here we systematically investigate the effect of 56 Ni mixing on the photospheric velocity evolution in stripped-envelope supernovae. We show that 56 Ni mixing significantly affects the early photospheric velocity evolution. The photospheric velocity, which is often used to constrain the ejecta mass and explosion energy, significantly varies by just changing the degree of 56 Ni mixing. In addition, the models with a small degree of 56 Ni mixing show a flattening in the early photospheric velocity evolution, while the fully mixed models show a monotonic decrease. The velocity flattening appears in both helium and carbon+oxygen progenitor explosions with a variety of ejecta mass, explosion energy, and 56 Ni mass. Some stripped-envelope supernovae with early photospheric velocity information do show such a flattening. We find that Type Ib SN 2007Y, which has early photospheric velocity information, has a signature of a moderate degree of 56 Ni mixing in the photospheric velocity evolution and about a half of the ejecta is mixed in it. The immediate spectroscopic follow-up observations of stripped-envelope supernovae shortly after the explosion providing the early photospheric evolution give an important clue to constrain 56 Ni mixing in the ejecta.},

abstract = {We propose a robust, quantitative method to compare the synthetic light curves of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion model with a large set of observed SNe Ia, and derive a figure of merit for the explosion model's agreement with observations. The synthetic light curves are fit with the data-driven model SALT2 which returns values for stretch, color, and magnitude at peak brightness, as well as a goodness-of-fit parameter. Each fit is performed multiple times with different choices of filter bands and epoch range in order to quantify the systematic uncertainty on the fitted parameters. We use a parametric population model for the distribution of observed SN Ia parameters from large surveys, and extend it to represent red, dim, and bright outliers found in a low-redshift SN Ia data set. We discuss the potential uncertainties of this population model and find it to be reliable given the current uncertainties on cosmological parameters. Using our population model, we assign each set of fitted parameters a likelihood of being observed in nature, and a figure of merit based on this likelihood. We define a second figure of merit based on the quality of the light curve fit, and combine the two measures into an overall figure of merit for each explosion model. We compute figures of merit for a variety of one-, two-, and three-dimensional explosion models and show that our evaluation method allows meaningful inferences across a wide range of light curve quality and fitted parameters.},

abstract = {From Sloan Digital Sky Survey u g r i z imaging, we estimate the stellar masses of the host galaxies of 70 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia, 0.015 < z < 0.08) from the hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. These nearby SNe were discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SNe discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). Testing four separate light curve fitters, we detect ∼2.5$\sigma$ correlations of Hubble residuals with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SNe Ia occurring in physically larger, more massive hosts are ∼10% brighter after light curve correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the correlations cannot be attributed to a light-curve-dependent calibration error. Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SNe with 30 nearby SNe whose host masses are less than 10 10.8 M in a cosmology fit yields 1 + w = 0.22 +0.152 −0.108 , while a combination where the 30 nearby SNe instead have host masses greater than 10 10.8 M yields 1 + w = −0.03 +0.217 −0.143. Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. Host galaxy measurements will yield improved distances to SNe Ia.},

However, evolutionary effects reduce the number of X-ray binary candidates with low-mass black holes, consistent with the dearth of such systems in the observed sample. We further find that this prescription is consistent with the formation of heavier binary neutron stars such as GW190425, but over-predicts the masses of Galactic double neutron stars. The revised natal kicks, particularly increased ultra-stripped supernova kicks, do not directly explain the observed Galactic double neutron star orbital period-eccentricity distribution. Finally, this prescription allows for the formation of systems similar to the recently discovered extreme mass ratio binary GW190814, but only if we allow for the survival of binaries in which the common envelope is initiated by a donor crossing the Hertzsprung gap, contrary to our standard model.},

We present results of radiation hydrodynamics modelling of SN Refsdal.

For practicality, these models are parameterized with a limited number of parameters and are trained using linear or nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This work focuses on the related problem of estimating the number of parameters underlying SN Ia spectral variation (the dimensionality). I present a technique for using the properties of high-dimensional space and the counting statistics of "twin" SNe Ia to estimate this dimensionality. Applying this method to the supernova pairings from Fakhouri et al. (2015) shows that a modest number of parameters (three to five, not including extinction) explain those data well. The analysis also finds that the intrinsic parameters are approximately Gaussian-distributed. The limited number of parameters hints that improved SED models are possible that may enable substantial reductions in SN cosmological uncertainties with current and near-term datasets.},

At its core, deepSIP consists of three convolutional neural networks trained on a substantial fraction of all publicly-available low-redshift SN Ia optical spectra, onto which we have carefully coupled photometrically-derived quantities. We describe the accumulation of our spectroscopic and photometric datasets, the cuts taken to ensure quality, and our standardised technique for fitting light curves. These considerations yield a compilation of 2754 spectra with photometrically characterised phases and light-curve shapes. Though such a sample is significant in the SN community, it is small by deep-learning standards where networks routinely have millions or even billions of free parameters. We therefore introduce a data-augmentation strategy that meaningfully increases the size of the subset we allocate for training while prioritising model robustness and telescope agnosticism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models by deploying them on a sample unseen during training and hyperparameter selection, finding that Model I identifies spectra that have a phase between −10 and 18 d and light-curve shape, pa-rameterised by ∆m 15 , between 0.85 and 1.55 mag with an accuracy of 94.6%. For those spectra that do fall within the aforementioned region in phase-∆m 15 space, Model II predicts phases with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.00 d and Model III predicts ∆m 15 values with an RMSE of 0.068 mag.},

We present a set of 1-D steady-state non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of type II SNe at 300 d after explosion. Guided by results for a large set of stellar evolution simulations, we craft ejecta models for type II SNe from the explosion of a 12, 15, 20, and 25 M star. The ejecta density structure and kinetic energy, the 56 Ni mass, and the level of chemical mixing are parametrized. Our model spectra are sensitive to the adopted line Doppler width, a phenomenon we associate with the overlap of Fe ii and O i lines with Ly $\alpha$ and Ly $\beta$. Our spectra show a strong sensitivity to 56 Ni mixing since it determines where decay power is absorbed. Even at 300 d after explosion, the H-rich layers reprocess the radiation from the inner metal rich layers. In a given progenitor model, variations in 56 Ni mass and distribution impact the ejecta ionization, which can modulate the strength of all lines. Such ionization shifts can quench Ca ii line emission. In our set of models, the [O i] $\lambda$$\lambda$ 6300, 6364 doublet strength is the most robust signature of progenitor mass. However, we emphasize that convective shell merging in the progenitor massive star interior can pollute the O-rich shell with Ca, which will weaken the O i doublet flux in the resulting nebular SN II spectrum. This process may occur in Nature, with a greater occurrence in higher mass progenitors, and may explain in part the preponderance of progenitor masses below 17 M inferred from nebular spectra.},

abstract = {In studies on intermediate-and high-resolution spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), some objects exhibit narrow Na I D absorptions often blueshifted with respect to the rest wavelength within the host galaxy. The absence of these in other SNe Ia may reflect that the explosions have different progenitors: blueshifted Na I D features might be explained by the outflows of 'single-degenerate' systems (binaries of a white dwarf with a non-degenerate companion). In this work, we search for systematic differences among SNe Ia for which the Na I D characteristics have been clearly established in previous studies. We perform an analysis of the chemical abundances in the outer ejecta of 13 'spectroscopically normal' SNe Ia (five of which show blueshifted Na lines), modelling time series of photospheric spectra with a radiative-transfer code. We find only moderate differences between 'blueshifted-Na', 'redshifted-Na' and 'no-Na' SNe Ia, so that we can neither conclusively confirm a 'one-scenario' nor a 'two-scenario' theory for normal SNe Ia. Yet, some of the trends we see should be further studied using larger observed samples: models for blueshifted-Na SNe tend to show higher photospheric velocities than no-Na SNe, corresponding to a higher opacity of the envelope. Consistently, blueshifted-Na SNe show hints of a somewhat larger iron-group content in the outer layers with respect to the no-Na subsample (and also to the redshifted-Na subsample). This agrees with earlier work where it was found that the light curves of no-Na SNe-often appearing in elliptical galaxies-are narrower, that is, decline more rapidly.},

abstract = {NGC 6946 is a high star formation rate face-on spiral galaxy that has hosted ten supernovae since 1917. Not surprisingly, a large number of supernova remnants and candidates have been identified either as optical nebulae with high [S II]:H$\alpha$ line ratios (147) or as compact non-thermal radio sources (35). However, there are only seven overlaps between these two samples. Here, we apply [Fe II] 1.644 µm emission as a new diagnostic to search for supernova remnants in an attempt to resolve this discrepancy. [Fe II] is expected to be relatively strong in the radiative shocks of supernova remnants and almost absent in H II regions. It is less susceptible to the effects of absorption along the line of sight than the optical lines normally used to identify remnants. Using data from the WFC3 camera on HST, we identify 132 [Fe II] emission nebulae in NGC 6946 as likely supernova remnants. Of these, 54 align with previously known optical supernova remnants. The remaining 78 objects are new; of these 44 are visible in new HST imagery in H$\alpha$ and [S II]. This brings the total number of supernova remnant candidates (from optical and/or IR data) in NGC 6946 to 225. A total of 14 coincidences with radio supernova remnant candidates (out of 30 in our search area) are found in this expanded list. The identification of so many new remnant candidates validates the use of [Fe II] imagery for finding remnants, and suggests that previous remnant searches in other galaxies may be far from complete.},

The secondary's mass falls into the mass-gap regime, which refers to the scarcity of compact objects in the mass range of 2-5 M. The first clue to the formation of the GW190814 lies in the fact that the primary is a very massive BH. We suggest that the secondary was born as a neutron star (NS) where a significant amount of the supernova ejecta mass from its formation remained bound to the binary due to the presence of the massive BH companion. The bound mass forms a circumbinary accretion disk, and its accretion onto the NS created a mass-gap object. In this scenario, LIGO/Virgo will only detect mass-gap objects in binary mergers with an extreme mass ratio. We also predict a correlation between the mass of the secondary and the mass of the primary in such asymmetric mergers. Our model can be tested with future data from the LVC's third-observing run.},

But this can be highly challenging due to numerous candidates of galaxies in the GW localization area. We point out that the number of candidates can be reduced by orders of magnitude for strongly lensed GW events, due to extra observational constraints. For the next-generation GW detectors like Einstein Telescope (ET), we estimate that this number is usually significantly less than one, as long as the GW localization uncertainty is better than ∼ 10 deg 2. This implies that the unique identification of the host galaxy of lensed GW event detected by ET and Cosmic Explorer (CE) is possible. This provides us a promising opportunity to measure the redshift of the GW event and facilitate the standard siren cosmology. We also discuss its potential applications in understanding the evolution process and environment of the GW event.},

However, working with NIR observed and i-band rest-frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated the development of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyze both the low-z and high-z CSP sample. We present in this paper the methods used to generate uBVgriYJH light-curve templates based on a sample of 24 high-quality low-z CSP SNe. We also present two methods for determining the distances to the hosts of SN Ia events. A larger sample of 30 low-z SNe Ia in the Hubble flow is used to calibrate these methods. We then apply the method and derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motions are not dominated by the Hubble flow.},

abstract = {ASASSN-18am/SN 2018gk is a newly discovered member of the rare group of luminous, hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) with a peak absolute magnitude of M V ≈ −20 mag that is in between normal core-collapse SNe and superluminous SNe. These SNe show no prominent spectroscopic signatures of ejecta interacting with circumstellar material (CSM), and their powering mechanism is debated. ASASSN-18am declines extremely rapidly for a Type II SN, with a photospheric-phase decline rate of ∼ 6.0 mag (100 d) −1. Owing to the weakening of H and the appearance of He in its later phases, ASASSN-18am is spectroscopically a Type IIb SN with a partially stripped envelope. However, its photometric and spectroscopic evolution show significant differences from typical SNe IIb. Using a radiative diffusion model, we find that the light curve requires a high synthesised 56 Ni mass M Ni ∼ 0.4 M and ejecta with high kinetic energy E kin = (5 − 9) × 10 51 erg. Introducing a magnetar central engine still requires M Ni ∼ 0.3 M and E kin = 3×10 51 erg. The high 56 Ni mass is consistent with strong iron-group nebular lines in its spectra, which are also similar to several SNe Ic-BL with high 56 Ni yields. The earliest spectrum shows "flash ionisation" features, from which we estimate a mass-loss rate of M ≈ 2 × 10 −4 M yr −1. This wind density is too low to power the luminous light curve by ejecta-CSM interaction. We measure expansion velocities as high as 17, 000 km s −1 for H$\alpha$, which is remarkably high compared to other SNe II. We estimate an oxygen core mass of 1.7-3.1 M using the [O ] luminosity measured from a nebular-phase spectrum, implying a progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of 19-24 M .},

The spherically symmetric shape of any star is deformed via rotation around an arbitrary axis or by the presence of an external tidal field. We compute the ellipticity of such a stellar object and show that rotation can be treated analogously to tidal effects caused by an external field, which induces a quadrupole moment. The detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger (GW170817) in 2017 set constraints on the tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$ and on equations of state for compact stars. We derive the corresponding formalism classically and show that the Newtonian limit taken via general relativity is justified. The compressibility and the compactness C = M/R of matter are discussed classically and compared to the relativistic approach. We find that relativistically the main influence on tidal deformability is related to the star's compactness C.},

abstract = {SN 2018hti is a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN I) with an absolute g-band magnitude of −22.2 at maximum brightness, discovered in a metal-poor galaxy at a redshift of 0.0612. We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of this supernova, covering the phases from ∼ −35 days to more than +340 days from the r-band maximum. Combining our BVgri-band photometry with Swift UVOT optical/ultraviolet photometry, we calculated the peak luminosity as ∼ 3.5 × 10 44 erg s −1. Modeling the observed light curve reveals that the luminosity evolution of SN 2018hti can be produced by an ejecta mass of 5.8 M and a magnetar with a magnetic field of B = 1.8 × 10 13 G having an initial spin period of P 0 = 1.8 ms. Based on such a magnetar-powered scenario and a larger sample, a correlation between the spin of the magnetar and the kinetic energy of the ejecta can be inferred for most SLSNe I, suggesting a self-consistent scenario. Like for other SLSNe I, the host galaxy of SN 2018hti is found to be relatively faint (M g = −17.75 mag) and of low metallicity (Z = 0.3 Z), with a star-formation rate of 0.3 M yr −1. According to simulation results of single-star evolution, SN 2018hti could originate from a massive, metal-poor star with a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of 25-40 M , or from a less massive rotating star with M ZAMS ≈ 16-25 M. For the case of a binary system, its progenitor could also be a star with M ZAMS 25 M .},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the energy density of the Universe was dominated by radiation between reheating after inflation and the onset of matter domination 54,000 years later. While the abundance of light elements indicates that the Universe was radiation dominated during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is scant evidence that the Universe was radiation dominated prior to BBN. It is therefore possible that the cosmological history was more complicated, with deviations from the standard radiation domination during the earliest epochs. Indeed, several interesting proposals regarding various topics such as the generation of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, or microhalos during a nonstandard expansion phase have been recently made. In this paper, we review various possible causes and consequences of deviations from radiation domination in the early Universe-taking place either before or after BBN-and the constraints on them, as they have been discussed in the literature during the recent years.},

abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared (ugriY JH) photometry of host galaxies of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project-I. We determine host galaxy stellar masses and, for the first time, study their correlation with SN Ia standardized luminosity across optical and near-infrared (uBgV riY JH) bands. In the individual bands, we find that SNe Ia are more luminous in more massive hosts with luminosity offsets ranging between −0.07±0.03 mag to −0.15±0.04 mag after light-curve standardization. The slope of the SN Ia Hubble residual-host mass relation is negative across all uBgV riY JH bands with values ranging between −0.036±0.025 mag/dex to −0.097±0.027 mag/dex-implying that SNe Ia in more massive galaxies are brighter than expected. The near-constant observed correlations across optical and near-infrared bands indicate that dust may not play a significant role in the observed luminosity offset-host mass correlation. We measure projected separations between SNe Ia and their host centers, and find that SNe Ia that explode beyond a projected 10 kpc have a 30% to 50% reduction of the dispersion in Hubble residuals across all bands-making them a more uniform subset of SNe Ia. Dust in host galaxies, peculiar velocities of nearby SN Ia, or a combination of both may drive this result as the color excesses of SNe Ia beyond 10 kpc are found to be generally lower than those interior, but there is also a diminishing trend of the dispersion as we exclude nearby events. We do not find that SN Ia average luminosity varies significantly when they are grouped in various host morphological types. Host galaxy data from this work will be useful, in conjunction with future high-redshift samples, in constraining cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {Recent observations have shown a remarkable diversity of the observational behaviors and explosion mechanisms in thermonuclear supernovae (SNe). An emerging class of peculiar type Ia SNe, called type Iax, show distinct photometric and spectroscopic behaviors. Their origin remains highly controversial , but pure turbulent deflagration of white dwarfs (WDs) has been regarded as the leading formation theory. The large population of type Iax indicates the existence of unidentified Galactic type Iax supernova remnants (SNRs). We report evidence that SNR Sgr A East in the Galactic center resulted from a pure turbulent deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen WD, an explosion mechanism used for type Iax SNe. Our X-ray spectroscopic study of Sgr A East using 3 Ms Chandra data shows a low ratio of intermediate-mass elements to Fe, and large Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios. This abundance pattern does not accord with the core-collapse or normal type Ia models. Sgr A East is thus the first Galactic SNR for which a likely type Iax origin has been proposed, and the nearest target to study this peculiar class. We compared Sgr A East with the Fe-rich SNRs 3C 397 and W49B, which also have high Mn and Cr abundances and were claimed to result from deflagration-to-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass WDs (although with disputes). Our study shows that they have distinct abundance patterns. The X-ray spectroscopic studies of thermonuclear SNRs provide observational evidence for the theories that there are diverse explosion channels and various metal outputs for Chandrasekhar-mass WDs.},

abstract = {Low-luminosity type II supernovae (LL SNe II) make up the low explosion energy end of core-collapse SNe, but their study and physical understanding remain limited. We present SN 2016aqf, a LL SN II with extensive spectral and photometric coverage. We measure a V-band peak magnitude of −14.58 mag, a plateau duration of ∼100 days, and an inferred 56 Ni mass of 0.008 ± 0.002 M. The peak bolometric luminosity, L bol ≈ 10 41.4 erg s −1 , and its spectral evolution is typical of other SNe in the class. Using our late-time spectra, we measure the [O i] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364 lines, which we compare against SN II spectral synthesis models to constrain the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass. We find this to be 12 ± 3 M. Our extensive late-time spectral coverage of the [Fe ii] $\lambda$7155 and [Ni ii] $\lambda$7378 lines permits a measurement of the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, a parameter sensitive to the inner progenitor structure and explosion mechanism dynamics. We measure a constant abundance ratio evolution of 0.081 +0.009 −0.010 , and argue that the best epochs to measure the ratio are at ∼200-300 days after explosion. We place this measurement in the context of a large sample of SNe II and compare against various physical, light-curve and spectral parameters, in search of trends which might allow indirect ways of constraining this ratio. We do not find correlations predicted by theoretical models; however, this may be the result of the exact choice of parameters and explosion mechanism in the models, the simplicity of them and/or primordial contamination in the measured abundance ratio.},

abstract = {Context. The nucleus of the planetary nebula Hen 2-428 is a short orbital-period (4.2 h), double-lined spectroscopic binary, whose status as a potential supernova type Ia progenitor has raised some controversy in the literature. Aims. With the aim of resolving this debate, we carried out an in-depth reanalysis of the system. Methods. Our approach combines a refined wavelength calibration, thorough line-identifications, improved radial-velocity measurements , non-LTE spectral modeling, as well as multi-band light-curve fitting. Our results are then discussed in view of state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary models. Results. Besides systematic zero-point shifts in the wavelength calibration of the OSIRIS spectra which were also used in the previous analysis of the system, we found that the spectra are contaminated with diffuse interstellar bands. Our Voigt-profile radial velocity fitting method, which considers the additional absorption of these diffuse interstellar bands, reveals significantly lower masses (M 1 = 0.66 ± 0.11 M ⊙ and M 2 = 0.42 ± 0.07 M ⊙) than previously reported and a mass ratio that is clearly below unity. Our spectral and light curve analyses lead to consistent results, however, we find higher effective temperatures and smaller radii than previously reported. Moreover, we find that the red-excess that was reported before to prove to be a mere artifact of an outdated reddening law that was applied. Conclusions. Our work shows that blends of He ii $\lambda$ 5412 {\AA} with diffuse interstellar bands have led to an overestimation of the previously reported dynamical masses of Hen 2-428. The merging event of Hen 2-428 will not be recognised as a supernova type Ia, but most likely leads to the formation of a H-deficient star. We suggest that the system was formed via a first stable mass transfer episode, followed by common envelope evolution, and it is now composed of a post-early asymptotic giant branch star and a reheated He-core white dwarf.},

abstract = {We report the discovery and panchromatic followup observations of the young Type Ic supernova, SN 2020oi, in M100, a grand design spiral galaxy at a mere distance of 14 Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray and optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The optical behaviour of the supernova is similar to those of other normal Type Ic supernovae. The event was not detected in the X-ray band but our radio observation revealed a bright mJy source (L $\nu$ ≈ 1.2 × 10 27 erg s −1 Hz −1). Given, the relatively small number of stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio dataset we obtained. The radio emitting electrons initially experience a phase of inverse Compton cooling which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the radio emission. Our analysis of the cooling frequency points to a large deviation from equipartition at the level of e // B 200, similar to a few other cases of stripped envelope SNe. Our modeling of the radio data suggests that the shockwave driven by the SN ejecta into the circumstellar matter (CSM) is moving at 2 ∼ 3×10 4 km s −1. Assuming a constant mass-loss from the stellar progenitor, we find that the mass-loss rate is ˙ M ≈ 1.4 × 10 −4 M yr −1 , for an assumed wind velocity of 1000 km s −1. The temporal evolution of the radio emission suggests a radial CSM density structure steeper than the standard r −2 .},

abstract = {We analyze 99 Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) observed in H band (1.6-1.8 µm) and find that SNeIa are intrinsically brighter in H-band with increasing host galaxy stellar mass. We find that SNeIa in galaxies more massive than 10 10.44 M are brighter in H than SNeIa in less massive galaxies by 0.18 ± 0.05 mag. The same set of SNeIa observed at optical wavelengths, after width-color-luminosity corrections, exhibit a 0.17 ± 0.05 mag offset in the Hubble residuals. Removing two significant outliers reduces the step in H band to 0.10 ± 0.04 mag but has no effect on the optical mass step size. An analysis based on information criteria supports a step function with a break at 10 10.44 M over a constant model with and without outliers for NIR and optical residuals. Less massive galaxies preferentially host more higher-stretch SNeIa, which are intrinsically brighter and bluer. It is only after correction for width-luminosity and color-luminosity relationships that SNeIa have brighter optical Hubble residuals in more massive galaxies. Thus the finding that SNeIa are intrinsically brighter in H in more massive galaxies is a significant and opposite correlation as the intrinsic optical brightness. If dust and the treatment of intrinsic color variation were the main driver of the host galaxy mass correlation, we would not expect a correlation of brighter H-band SNeIa in more massive galaxies. The correlation we find thus suggests that dust is not the main explanation of the observed correlation between Hubble residual and host galaxy stellar mass.},

For many, (un)conscious bias is still the main hurdle to achieving excellence, as the most diverse talents encounter bigger challenges and difficulties to reach the same milestones than their more privileged colleagues. Over the past few years, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) has constructed tools to raise awareness of (un)conscious bias and has designed guidelines and goals to increase diversity representation and outcome in its scientific activities, including career-related matters and STScI sponsored fellowships, conferences, workshops, and colloquia. STScI has also addressed (un)conscious bias in the peer-review process by anonymizing submission and evaluation of Hubble Space Telescope (and soon to be James Webb Space Telescope) observing proposals.

However, so far only one event, PTF10hgi has been identified with He features in its photospheric spectra (Quimby et al. 2018). At z = 0.0866, ZTF19aawfbtg (SN2019hge) has more than 10 optical spectra at phases from −41 to +103 days. Most of these spectra match well with that of PTF10hgi, suggesting SN2019hge as the second case of a He-rich SLSN-I. Confirmation comes from its near-IR spectrum taken at +34 days, revealing He I features with P-Cygni profiles at 1.083 2 Yan et al. and 2.058 µm. Using the optical spectra of PTF10hgi and SN2019hge as templates, we examine 70 SLSN-I discovered by ZTF in the first two years of operation and found additional five SLSN-I with distinct He-features, yielding a lower limit to the He-rich fraction of ∼ 9%. It is suggested that the excitation of He I atoms requires non-thermal radiation. These He-rich events can not be explained by traditional 56 Ni mixing model because of their blue spectra, high peak luminosity and slow rising time scales. Magne-tar models offer a possible solution since pulsar winds naturally generate high energy particles as sources of non-thermal excitation. However, how the magnetar energy is transported to the outer layers is unclear. An alternative model is ejecta interaction with H-poor CSM which may be supported by the observed light curve undulations.},

SALT2X separates the light-curve-shape parameter x 1 into an x r 1 and x f 1 for the rise and fall portions of the light curve. Using the Joint Lightcurve Analysis SN sample, we assess the importance of the rising and falling portions of the light curve for cosmological standardization using a modified version of the Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type Ia cosmologY (UNITY) framework. We find strong evidence that x r 1 has a stronger correlation with peak magnitude than x f 1. We see evidence that standardizing on the rise affects the color standardization relation, and reduces the size of the host-galaxy standardization and the unexplained ("intrinsic") luminosity dispersion. Since SNe Ia generally rise more quickly than they decline, a faster observing cadence in future surveys will be necessary to maximize the gain from this work and to continue to explore the impacts of decoupling the rising and falling portions of SN Ia light curves.},

abstract = {Observations of SN 2011fe at early times reveal an evolution analogous to a fireball model of constant colour. In contrast, our unmixed delayed detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (DDC series) exhibit a faster brightening concomitant with a shift in colour to the blue. In this paper, we study the origin of these discrepancies. We find that strong chemical mixing largely resolves the photometric mismatch at early times, but it leads to an enhanced line broadening that contrasts, for example, with the markedly narrow Si II 6355 {\AA} line of SN 2011fe. We also explore an alternative configuration with pulsational-delayed detonations (PDDEL model series). Because of the pulsation, PDDEL models retain more unburnt carbon, have little mass at high velocity, and have a much hotter outer ejecta after the explosion. The pulsation does not influence the inner ejecta, so PDDEL and DDC models exhibit similar radiative properties beyond maximum. However, at early times, PDDEL models show bluer optical colours and a higher luminosity, even for weak mixing. Their early-time radiation is derived primarily from the initial shock-deposited energy in the outer ejecta rather than radioactive-decay heating. Furthermore, PDDEL models show short-lived C II lines, reminiscent of SN 2013dy. They typically exhibit lines that are weaker, narrower, and of near-constant width, reminiscent of SN 2011fe. In addition to multidimensional effects, varying configurations for such 'pulsations' offer a source of spectral diversity amongst Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). PDDEL and DDC models also provide one explanation for low-and high-velocity-gradient SNe Ia.},

abstract = {To date no metal-free stars have been identified by direct observations. The most common method of constraining their properties is searching the spectra of the most metal-poor stars for the chemical elements created in the first stars and their su-pernova. In this approach, modelled supernova yields are compared to the observed abundance patterns in extremely metal-poor stars. The method typically only uses the abundance ratios, i.e., the yields are diluted to the observed level. Following the usual assumption of spherical symmetry we compute a simple lower limit of the mass a supernova can mix with and find that it is consistent with all published simulations of early chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. For three different cases, we demonstrate that this dilution limit can change the conclusions from the abundance fitting. There is a large discrepancy between the dilution found in simulations of SN explosions in minihaloes and the dilution assumed in many abundance fits. Limiting the dilution can significantly alter the likelihood of which supernovae are possible progenitors of observed CEMP-no stars. In particular, some of the faint, very low-yield SNe, which have been suggested as models for the abundance pattern of SMSS0313-6708, cannot explain the measured metal abundances, as their predicted metal yields are too small by two orders of magnitude. Altogether, the new dilution model presented here emphasizes the need to better understand the mixing and dilution behaviour of aspherical SNe.},

abstract = {Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are an important sub-luminous class of SNe Ia. However, their progenitors and explosion mechanism have not been understood yet. It has been suggested that SNe Iax may be produced from weak deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems with a helium (He) star donor. In such progenitor systems, the stripped He companion material caused by the ejecta-companion interaction is expected to present some He features in their late-time spectra. However, the detection of He lines in late-time spectra of SNe Iax has not yet been successful, which gives an upper limit on the amount of stripped He mass of 2 × 10 −3 − 0.1 M. In this work, we study the interaction between SN Iax ejecta and a He star companion by performing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a weak pure deflagration explosion model. We find that about 4 × 10 −3 M of He material can be stripped off from the companion star by SN explosion, which is very close to (or lower than) the observational upper-limit on the total stripped He mass in SNe Iax. We, therefore, conclude that non-detection of He lines in late-time spectra of SNe Iax could be reasonably explained if they are indeed resulted from weak pure deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass WDs in progenitor systems with a He star donor.},

AT 2020blt shares several features in common with afterglows to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): (1) an optical light curve well-described by a broken power-law with a break at t j = 1 d (observer-frame); (2) a luminous (L X = 10 46 erg s −1) X-ray counterpart; and (3) luminous (L $\nu$ = 4 × 10 31 erg s −1 Hz −1 at 10 GHz) radio emission. However, no GRB was detected in the 0.74 d between the last ZTF non-detection (r > 20.64) and the first ZTF detection (r = 19.57), with an upper limit on the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy release of E $\gamma$,iso < 7 × 10 52 erg. AT 2020blt is thus the third afterglow-like transient discovered without a detected GRB counterpart (after PTF11agg and ZTF19abvizsw) and the second (after ZTF19abvizsw) with a redshift measurement. We conclude that the 2 Ho et al. properties of AT 2020blt are consistent with a classical (initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ 0 100) on-axis GRB that was missed by high-energy satellites. Furthermore, by estimating the rate of transients with light curves similar to that of AT 2020blt in ZTF high-cadence data, we agree with previous results that there is no evidence for an afterglow-like phenomenon that is significantly more common than classical GRBs.

abstract = {We introduce , a technique to systematically compute stellar structure models in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium based on 3 structural properties-core mass M core , envelope mass M env and core composition. This approach allows us to connect these properties of stellar interiors to the luminosity and effective temperature T eff in a more systematic way than with stellar evolution models. We compute core-H burning models with total masses of M total = 8 to 60M and central H mass fractions from 0.70 to 0.05. Using these, we derive an analytical relationship between M core , M total and central H abundance that can be readily used in rapid stellar evolution algorithms. In contrast, core-He burning stars can have a wide range of combinations of M core , M env and core compositions. We compute core-He burning models with M core = 2 − 9M , M env = 0 − 50M and central He mass fractions of 0.50 and 0.01. Models with M core /M total from 0.2 to 0.8 have convective envelopes, low T eff and will appear as red supergiants. For a given M core , they exhibit a small variation in luminosity (0.02 dex) and T eff (∼ 400 K) over a wide range of M env (∼ 2 − 20 M). This means that it is not possible to derive red supergiant masses from luminosities and T eff alone. We derive the following relationship between M core and the total luminosity of a red supergiant during core He burning: log M core 0.44 log L/L − 1.38. At M core /M total ≈ 0.2, our models exhibit a bi-stability and jump from a RSG to a BSG structure. Our models with M core /M total > 0.8, which correspond to stripped stars produced by mass loss or binary interaction, show that T eff has a strong dependence on M env , M core and the core composition. We constrain the mass of one of these stripped stars in a binary system, HD 45166, and find it to be less than its estimated dynamical mass. When a large observational sample of stripped stars becomes available, our results can be used to constrain their M core , M env , mass-loss rates and the physics of binary interaction.},

SN 2015ap is one of the bright (M V = −18.04 mag) Type Ib while SN 2016P lies at an average value among the Type Ic SNe (M V = −17.53 mag). Bolometric light curve modelling of SNe 2015ap and 2016P indicates that both the SNe are powered by 56 Ni + magnetar model with 56 Ni masses of 0.01 M and 0.002 M , ejecta masses of 3.75 M and 4.66 M , spin period P 0 of 25.8 ms and 36.5 ms and magnetic field B p of 28.39 × 10 14 Gauss and 35.3 × 10 14 Gauss respectively. The early spectra of SN 2015ap shows prominent lines of He with a "W" feature due to Fe complexes while other lines of Mg II, Na I and Si II are present in both SNe 2015ap and 2016P. Nebular phase [O I] profile indicates an asymmetric profile in SN 2015ap. The [O I]/[Ca II] ratio and nebular spectral modelling of SN 2015ap hints towards a progenitor mass between 12 − 20 M .},

abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used to measure distances in the Universe. Despite the recent progress achieved in SN Ia standardisation, the Hubble diagram still shows some remaining intrinsic dispersion. The remaining scatter in supernova luminosity could be due to the environmental effects that are not yet accounted for by the current standardisation methods. In this work we compare the local and global colour (U − V), the local star formation rate, and the host stellar mass to the host galaxy morphology. The observed trends suggest that the host galaxy morphology is a good parameter to characterize the SN Ia environment. Therefore, we study the influence of host galaxy morphology on light-curve parameters of SNe Ia for the Pantheon cosmological supernova sample. We determine the Hubble morphological type of host galaxies for a sub-sample of 330 SNe Ia. We confirm that the SALT2 stretch parameter x 1 depends on the host morphology with the p-value ∼ 10 −14. The supernovae with lower stretch value are hosted mainly by elliptical and lenticular galaxies. No correlation for the SALT2 colour parameter c is found. We also examine Hubble diagram residuals for supernovae hosted by the "Early-type" and "Late-type" morphological groups of galaxies. The analysis reveals that the mean distance modulus residual in early-type galaxies is smaller than the one in late-type galaxies, which means that early-type galaxies contain brighter supernovae. However, we do not observe any difference in the residual dispersion for these two morphological groups. The obtained results are in the line with other analyses showing environmental dependence of SN Ia light-curve parameters and luminosity. We confirm the importance of including a host galaxy parameter into the standardisation procedure of SNe Ia for further cosmological studies.},

We also present mid-infrared photometry obtained by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite extending from 56 days prior to the optical discovery to over 1600 days. The light curve of SN 2014ab evolves slowly, while the spectra exhibit strong emission features produced from the interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and dense circumstellar matter. The light curve and spectral properties are very similar to those of SN 2010jl. The estimated mass-loss rate of the progenitor of SN 2014ab is of the order of 0.1 M ⊙ yr −1 under the assumption of spherically symmetric circumstellar matter and steady mass loss. Although the mid-infrared luminosity increases due to emission from dust, which is characterized by a blackbody temperature close to the dust evaporation temperature (∼ 2000 K), no clear signatures of in situ dust formation within the cold dense shell located behind the forward shock are observed in SN 2014ab in early phases. Mid-infrared emission of SN 2014ab may originate from pre-existing dust located within dense circumstellar matter that is heated by the SN shock or shock-driven radiation. Finally, for the benefit of the community, we also present in an Appendix five near-infrared spectra of SN 2010jl obtained between 450 to 1300 days post discovery.},

Its elongated morphology and proximity to a molecular cloud are suggestive of a core-collapse (CC) SN origin, yet recent X-ray studies of heavy metals show chemical yields and line centroid energies consistent with a Type Ia SN. In this paper, we analyze the full X-ray spectrum from 0.7−10 keV of 3C 397 observed with Suzaku and compare the line centroid energies, fluxes, and elemental abundances of intermediate-mass and heavy metals (Mg to Ni) to Type Ia and CC hydrodynamical model predictions. Based on the results, we conclude that 3C 397 likely arises from an energetic Type Ia explosion in a high-density ambient medium, and we show that the progenitor was a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf.},

abstract = {White dwarfs are routinely observed to have polluted atmospheres, and sometimes significant infrared excesses, that indicate ongoing accretion of circumstellar dust and rocky debris. Typically this debris is assumed to be in the form of a (circular) disc, and to originate from asteroids that passed close enough to the white dwarf to be pulled apart by tides. However, theoretical considerations suggest that the cir-cularisation of the debris, which initially occupies highly eccentric orbits, is very slow. We therefore hypothesise that the observations may be readily explained by the debris remaining on highly eccentric orbits, and we explore the properties of such debris. For the generic case of an asteroid originating at several au from the white dwarf, we find that all of the tidal debris is always bound to the white dwarf and that the orbital energy distribution of the debris is narrow enough that it executes similar elliptical orbits with only a narrow spread. Assuming that the tidal field of the white dwarf is sufficient to minimise the effects of self-gravity and collisions within the debris, we estimate the time over which the debris spreads into a single elliptical ring, and we generate toy spectra and lightcurves from the initial disruption to late times when the debris distribution is essentially time steady. Finally we speculate on the connection between these simple considerations and the observed properties of these systems, and on additional physical processes that may change this simple picture.},

A possible origin via a violent late thermal pulse or binary interactions have been suggested to explain this very unusual photospheric composition. We report the additional detection of carbon, sodium, and aluminium in far-ultraviolet and optical follow-up spec-troscopy. No iron-group elements are detected, with tight upper limits on iron, cobalt and nickel, suggesting that the star underwent partial oxygen burning, but failed to ignite silicon burning. Modelling the spectral energy distribution and adopting the distance based on the Gaia parallax, we infer a low white dwarf mass, M wd = 0.41 ± 0.05 M ⊙. The large space velocity of SDSS J1240+6710, computed from the Gaia proper motion and its radial velocity, is compatible with a Galactic rest-frame velocity of ≃ 250 km/s in the opposite direction with respect to the Galactic rotation, strongly supporting a binary origin of this star. We discuss the properties of SDSS J1240+6710 in the context of the recently identified survivors of thermonuclear supernovae, the D 6 and LP 40-365 stars, and conclude that it is unlikely related to either of those two groups.

Our observations show that the end of the plateau is extended to 140 days since the explosion, indicating that this SN takes one of the longest times to finish the plateau phase among Type IIP SNe (SNe IIP), including LL SNe IIP. The line velocities of various ions at the middle of the plateau phase are as low as 1000-1500kms −1 , which is the lowest even among LL SNe IIP. These measurements imply that the ejecta mass in SN2016bkv is larger than that of the well-studied LL IIP SN2003Z. In the early phase, SN2016bkv shows a strong bump in the light curve. In addition, the optical spectra in this bump phase exhibit a blue continuum accompanied by a narrow H$\alpha$ emission line. These features indicate an interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM) as in SNe IIn. Assuming the ejecta-CSM interaction scenario, the mass loss rate is estimated to be $\sim$ ´- M 1.7 10 2 yr −1 within a few years before the SN explosion. This is comparable to or even larger than the largest mass loss rate observed for the Galactic red supergiants ($\sim$- M 10 3 yr −1 for VYCMa). We suggest that the progenitor star of SN2016bkv experienced a violent mass loss just before the SN explosion.},

While the +545 day spectra is similar to spectra taken between days +400 and +493, the +900 day spectrum shows dramatic changes both in spectral features and emission line profiles. The H$\alpha$ emission is flat-topped and box-like with sharp blue and red profile velocities of −8000 and +7500 km s −1.

A double neutron star (DNS) binary is believed to be left after the explosion, which will emit the gravitational wave later at the coalescence. Recent detections of a few candidates for the ultra-stripped SN have constrained the properties of the explosion and the progenitor, but little information is given as to whether the remnant DNS binary will merge within the cosmic age. A large fraction of the material stripped away from the helium star through the binary interaction is expected to escape from the system and form circumstellar material (CSM). The CSM should be traced by radio emission induced by the collision with the SN ejecta. Based on the stellar evolution models previously developed, we calculate the expected radio luminosities from ultra-stripped SNe. We find that high radio luminosity at its maximum can be an indicator of small separation of a DNS binary leading to its merger within the cosmic age. Our results can be used to optimize the strategy for the radio follow-up observations such as observational epochs and frequencies.},

abstract = {Context. Some massive stars experience episodic and intense mass loss phases with fluctuations in the luminosity. Ejected material forms circumstellar matter around the star, and the subsequent core-collapse results in a type IIn supernova which is characterized by interaction between supernova ejecta and the circumstellar matter. The energy source which triggers these mass eruptions and dynamics of the outflow have not been clearly explained. Moreover, the mass eruption itself can alter the density structure of the envelope and affect the dynamics of the subsequent mass eruption if these events repeat. In fact, a large amount of observational evidence suggests multiple mass eruptions prior to core-collapse. Aims. We investigate the density structure of the envelope altered by the first mass eruption and the nature of the subsequent second mass eruption event in comparison with the first one. Methods. We deposited an extra energy twice at the bottom of the hydrogen envelope and calculate the time evolution by our radiation hydrodynamical simulation code. We do not deal with the origin of the energy source but focus on the dynamics of repeated mass eruptions from a single massive star. Results. There are significant differences between the first and second mass eruptions in terms of the luminosity, color, amount of produced circumstellar matter. The second eruption leads to a redder burst event with the associated brightening phase lasting longer than the first one. The amount of ejected matter is different even with the same deposited energy in the first and second event, but the difference depends on the density structure of the progenitor star. Conclusions. Upcoming high cadence and deep transient surveys will provide us a lot of detailed pre-supernova activities, and some of them would show multi-peaked light curves. They should be interpreted taking the effect of density structure altered by the preceding outburst events into consideration.},

abstract = {Multi-dimensional fluid flow plays a paramount role in the explosions of massive stars as core-collapse supernovae. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) simulations of these phenomena have matured significantly. Considerable progress has been made towards identifying the ingredients for shock revival by the neutrino-driven mechanism, and successful explosions have already been obtained in a number of self-consistent 3D models. These advances also bring new challenges, however. Prompted by a need for increased physical realism and meaningful model validation, supernova theory is now moving towards a more integrated view that connects multi-dimensional phenomena in the late convective burning stages prior to collapse, the explosion engine, and mixing instabilities in the supernova envelope. Here we review our current understasnding of multi-D fluid flow in core-collapse supernovae and their progenitors. We start by outlining specific challenges faced by hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and of the late convective burning stages. We then discuss recent advances and open questions in theory and simulations.},

abstract = {Simulations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) surveys are a critical tool for correcting biases in the analysis of SNe Ia to infer cosmological parameters. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations include a thorough treatment of observation history, measurement noise, intrinsic scatter models, and selection effects. In this Letter, we improve simulations with a robust technique to evaluate the underlying populations of SN Ia color and stretch that correlate with luminosity. In typical analyses, the standardized SN Ia brightness is determined from linear "Tripp" relations between the light curve color and luminosity and between stretch and luminosity. However, this solution produces Hubble residual biases because intrinsic scatter and measurement noise result in measured color and stretch values that do not follow the Tripp relation. We find a 10$\sigma$ bias (up to 0.3 mag) in Hubble residuals versus color and 5$\sigma$ bias (up to 0.2 mag) in Hubble residuals versus stretch in a joint sample of 920 spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia from PS1, SNLS, SDSS, and several low-z surveys. After we determine the underlying color and stretch distributions, we use simulations to predict and correct the biases in the data. We show that removing these biases has a small impact on the low-z sample, but reduces the intrinsic scatter $\sigma$ int from 0.101 to 0.083 in the combined PS1, SNLS, and SDSS sample. Past estimates of the underlying populations were too broad, leading to a small bias in the equation of state of dark energy w of $\Delta$w = 0.005.},

This paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures, and uses detailed Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effects of Malmquist bias and spectroscopic sampling. Such sampling effects are found to become apparent at z ∼ 0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia sample toward brighter values for z 0.75.

abstract = {Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are an important sub-luminous class of SNe Ia. However, their progenitors and explosion mechanism have not been understood yet. It has been suggested that SNe Iax may be produced from weak deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems with a helium (He) star donor. In such progenitor systems, the stripped He companion material caused by the ejecta-companion interaction is expected to present some He features in their late-time spectra. However, the detection of He lines in late-time spectra of SNe Iax has not yet been successful, which gives an upper limit on the amount of stripped He mass of 2 × 10 −3 − 0.1 M. In this work, we study the interaction between SN Iax ejecta and a He star companion by performing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a weak pure deflagration explosion model. We find that about 4 × 10 −3 M of He material can be stripped off from the companion star by SN explosion, which is very close to (or lower than) the observational upper-limit on the total stripped He mass in SNe Iax. We, therefore, conclude that non-detection of He lines in late-time spectra of SNe Iax could be reasonably explained if they are indeed resulted from weak pure deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass WDs in progenitor systems with a He star donor.},

abstract = {Progressive increases in the precision of the Hubble-constant measurement via Cepheid-calibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have shown a discrepancy of ∼ 4.4$\sigma$ with the current value inferred from Planck satellite measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This disagreement does not appear to be due to known systematic errors and may therefore be hinting at new fundamental physics. Although all of the current techniques have their own merits, further improvement in constraining the Hubble constant requires the development of as many independent methods as possible. In this work, we use SNe II as standardisable candles to obtain an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Using 7 SNe II with host-galaxy distances measured from Cepheid variables or the tip of the red giant branch, we derive H 0 = 75.8 +5.2 −4.9 km s −1 Mpc −1 (statistical errors only). Our value favours that obtained from the conventional distance ladder (Cepheids + SNe Ia) and exhibits a difference of 8.4 km s −1 Mpc −1 from the Planck +$\Lambda$CDM value. Adding an estimate of the systematic errors (2.8 km s −1 Mpc −1) changes the ∼ 1.7$\sigma$ discrepancy with Planck +$\Lambda$CDM to ∼ 1.4$\sigma$. Including the systematic errors and performing a bootstrap simulation, we confirm that the local H 0 value exceeds the value from the early Universe with a confidence level of 95%. As in this work we only exchange SNe II for SNe Ia to measure extragalactic distances, we demonstrate that there is no evidence that SNe Ia are the source of the H 0 tension.},

Here we present nebular phase spectra of SN 2017eaw at +545 and +900 days post-max, extending approximately 50-400 days past the epochs of previously published spectra. While the +545 day spectra is similar to spectra taken between days +400 and +493, the +900 day spectrum shows dramatic changes both in spectral features and emission line profiles. The H$\alpha$ emission is flat-topped and box-like with sharp blue and red profile velocities of −8000 and +7500 km s −1. These late-time spectral changes indicate strong circumstellar interaction with a mass-loss shell, expelled ∼ 1700 years before explosion. SN 2017eaw's +900 day spectrum is similar to those seen for SN 2004et and SN 2013ej observed 2-3 years after explosion.

abstract = {This study investigates the expansion properties of nickel bubbles in Type Ia supernovae due to radioactive heating from the 56 Ni ! 56 Co ! 56 Fe decay sequence, under the spherically symmetric approximation. An exponentially declining medium is considered as the ejecta substrate, allowing for the density gradient expected in a Type Ia su-pernova. The heating gives rise to an inflated Ni bubble, which induces a forward shock that compresses the outer ambient gas into a shell. In the adiabatic case (in which no radiative energy diffuses across the shell) the structure of the shell can be approximately described by a self-similar solution that is determined by the expansion rate and ambient density gradient of the shell. In the radiative case, the shell expansion weakens but the frozen-in velocity remains comparable. The thickness of the shell is $1% of the radius of the bubble, and the density contrast across the shell reaches k100 in a narrow region that is limited by numerical resolution. The inferred ejecta clump (shell component) is denser than that given by the model using a uniform ejecta substrate. For the ejecta knots present at the edges of Tycho's remnant, explosion conditions similar to those of successful explosion models are found, including the deflagration W7 and the delayed detonation yield with sufficient velocities and timely clump-remnant interaction; the luminous helium detonations and the low-energy Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are unfavorable. The clump speed can be increased as the initial density contrast of 56 Ni, 0:5 P ! < 1, is reduced, because of a realistic elemental distribution. In all cases, the initiation of the clump-remnant interaction is expected in under 2000 yr after the supernova explodes.},

Three originate from M Ch delayed detonation models , and the fourth is a sub-M Ch detonation model. Ejecta masses are 1.02, 1.04, 1.40 and 1.70 M , and all models have 0.62 M of 56 Ni. Sub-M Ch model light curves evolve faster, reaching bolometric maximum 2-3 d earlier and having 3-4 d shorter bolometric half-light widths. The models vary by ∼12 per cent at maximum bolometric luminosity and by 0.17 mag in B max. While M 15 (B) increases with ejecta mass, it only varies by ∼5 per cent around 1 mag. Sub-M Ch models are 0.25 mag bluer in B − R at B max. Optical spectra share many similarities, but lower mass models exhibit less UV line blanketing during the photospheric phase. At nebular times, significant near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic differences are seen. In particular, emission lines of the Ca II NIR triplet; [S III] $\lambda$$\lambda$9068,9530; [Ca II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7291,7324; [Ar III] $\lambda$$\lambda$7135,7751 and [Ni II] 1.939 µm are stronger in higher mass models. The [Ni II] 1.939 µm line is absent in the sub-M Ch detonation model, and provides a valuable potential tool to distinguish sub-M Ch explosions from M Ch explosions. In general, the nebular phase models are too highly ionized. We attribute this to the neglect of clumping and/or the distribution of intermediate mass and iron group elements. The two sub-M Ch models, while exploded by different mechanisms, can be distinguished in the J and H bands at late times (e.g. +200 d).},

As cosmic star formation density increases with redshift, the prompt component should begin to dominate. We use a two-component model to predict that the average light curve width should increase by 6% from to 1.5. Using data from various searches, we find an 8.1% z p 0 2.7% increase in average light curve width for non-subluminous SNe Ia from to 1.12, corresponding z p 0.03 to an increase in the average intrinsic luminosity of 12%. To test whether there is any bias after supernovae are corrected for light curve shape we use published data to mimic the effect of population evolution and find no significant difference in the measured dark energy equation of state parameter, w. However, future measurements of time-variable w will require standardization of SN Ia magnitudes to 2% up to , and it is not yet possible z p 1.7 to assess whether light curve shape correction works at this level of precision.

abstract = {Context. Use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as distance indicators has proven to be a powerful technique for measuring the dark-energy equation of state. However, recent studies have highlighted potential biases correlated with the global properties of their host galaxies, large enough to induce systematic errors into such cosmological measurements if not properly treated. Aims. We study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to SNe Ia in order to analyze relations between the properties of SN Ia events and environments where their progenitors most likely formed. In this paper we focus on local H$\alpha$ emission as an indicator of young progenitor environments. Methods. The Nearby Supernova Factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia using integral field spectroscopy. These observations enabled the simultaneous measurement of the SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measured or set limits on H$\alpha$ emission, used as a tracer of ongoing star formation, within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This constitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sample of SNe Ia with accurate luminosity, color, and stretch measurements. Results. Our local star formation measurements provide several critical new insights. We find that SNe Ia with local H$\alpha$ emission are redder by 0.036 ± 0.017 mag, and that the previously noted correlation between stretch and host mass is driven entirely by the SNe Ia coming from locally passive environments, in particular at the low-stretch end. There is no such trend for SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments. Our most important finding is that the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local H$\alpha$ emission is 0.094 ± 0.031 mag fainter on average than for those without. This offset arises from a bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, with one mode being shared by SNe Ia in all environments and the other one exclusive to SNe Ia in locally passive environments. This structure also explains the previously known host-mass bias. We combine the star formation dependence of this bimodality with the cosmic star formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia brightness and the host-mass bias. The strong change predicted is confirmed using high-redshift SNe Ia from the literature. Conclusions. The environmental dependences in SN Ia Hubble residuals and color found here point to remaining systematic errors in the standardization of SNe Ia. In particular, the observed brightness offset associated with local H$\alpha$ emission is predicted to cause a significant bias in current measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Recognition of these effects offers new opportunities to improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes. For instance, we note that the SNe Ia associated with local H$\alpha$ emission are more homogeneous, resulting in a brightness dispersion of only 0.105 ± 0.012 mag.

abstract = {Several stars detected moving at velocities near to or exceeding the Galactic escape speed likely originated in the Milky Way disc. We quantitatively explore the 'binary supernova scenario' hypothesis, wherein these stars are ejected at large peculiar velocities when their close, massive binary companions undergo a core-collapse super-nova and the binary is disrupted. We perform an extensive suite of binary population synthesis simulations evolving massive systems to determine the assumptions and parameters which most impact the ejection rate of fast stars. In a simulation tailored to eject fast stars, we find hyper-runaway star progenitor binaries composed of a massive (∼30 M) primary and a ∼3 − 4 M companion on an orbital period that shrinks to 1 day prior to the core collapse following a common envelope phase. The black hole remnant formed from the primary must receive a natal kick 1000 km s −1 to disrupt the binary and eject the companion at a large velocity. We compare the fast stars produced in these simulations to a contemporary census of early-type Milky Way hyper-runaway star candidates. We find that these rare objects may be produced in sufficient number only when poorly-constrained binary evolution parameters related to the strength of post-core collapse black hole natal kicks and common envelope efficiency are adjusted to values currently unsupported-but not excluded-by the literature. We discuss observational implications that may constrain the existence of these putative progenitor systems.},

After reviewing the construction of the theory and a consistent matter coupling, we analyze the dynamics of cosmology at the levels of both background and perturbations, and present a concrete example of the theory with a 3-parameter family of the function f. Finally, we compare this example model to Planck data as well as some later-time probes, showing that such a realization of f (H) theories fits the data significantly better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, in particular by modifying gravity at intermediate redshifts, z 743.},

abstract = {The cosmic curvature, a fundamental parameter for cosmology could hold deep clues to inflation and cosmic origins. We propose an improved model-independent method to constrain the cosmic curvature by combining the constructed Hubble diagram of high-redshift quasars with galactic-scale strong lensing systems expected to be seen by the forthcoming LSST survey. More specifically, the most recent quasar data are used as a new type of standard candles in the range 0.036 < z < 5.100, whose luminosity distances can be directly derived from the non-linear relation between X-ray and UV luminosities. Compared with other methods, the proposed one involving the quasar data achieves constraints with higher precision (∆Ω k ∼ 10 −2) at high redshifts (z ∼ 5.0). We also investigate the influence of lens mass distribution in the framework of three types of lens models extensively used in strong lensing studies (SIS model, power-law spherical model, and extended power-law lens model), finding the strong correlation between the cosmic curvature and the lens model parameters. When the power-law mass density profile is assumed, the most stringent constraint on the cosmic curvature Ω k can be obtained. Therefore, the issue of mass density profile in the early-type galaxies is still a critical one that needs to be investigated further.},

abstract = {The 'Red Supergiant Problem' describes the claim that the brightest Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitors to type II-P supernovae are significantly fainter than RSGs in the field. This mis-match has been interpreted by several authors as being a manifestation of the mass threshold for the production of black holes (BHs), such that stars with initial masses above a cutoff of M hi = 17M ⊙ and below 25M ⊙ will die as RSGs, but with no visible SN explosion as the BH is formed. However, we have previously cautioned that this cutoff is more likely to be higher and has large uncertainties (M hi = 19 +4 −2 M ⊙), meaning that the statistical significance of the RSG Problem is less than 2$\sigma$. Recently, Kochanek (2020) has claimed that our work is statistically flawed, and with their analysis has argued that the upper mass cutoff is as low as M hi = 15.7 ± 0.8M ⊙ , giving the RSG Problem a significance of > 10$\sigma$. In this letter, we show that Kochanek's low cutoff is caused by a statistical misinterpretation, and the associated fit to the progenitor mass spectrum can be ruled out at the 99.6% confidence level. Once this problem is remedied, Kochanek's best fit becomes M hi = 19 +4 −2 M ⊙ , in excellent agreement with our work. Finally, we argue that, in the search for a RSG 'vanishing' as it collapses directly to a BH, any such survey would have to operate for decades before the absence of any such detection became statistically significant.},

abstract = {One of the key methods for determining the unknown nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the search for traces of interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar structures at the resulting supernova remnants (SNRs Ia). So far, the observables that we receive from well-studied SNRs Ia cannot be explained self-consistently by any model presented in the literature. In this study, we suggest that the circumstellar medium (CSM) being observed to surround several SNRs Ia was mainly shaped by planetary nebulae (PNe) that originated from one or both progenitor stars. Performing two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the ambient medium shaped by PNe can account for several properties of the CSM that have been found to surround SNe Ia and their remnants. Finally, we model Kepler's SNR considering that the SN explosion occurred inside a bipolar PN. Our simulations show good agreement with the observed morphological and kinematic properties of Kepler's SNR. In particular, our model reproduces the current expansion parameter of Kepler's SNR, the partial interaction of the remnant with a dense CSM at its northern region and finally the existence of two opposite protrusions ('ears') at the equatorial plane of the SNR.},

abstract = {Ejecta velocity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is one powerful tool to differentiate between progenitor scenarios and explosion mechanisms. Here we revisit the relation between photospheric Si ii $\lambda$6355 velocities (v Si ii) and host-galaxy properties with ∼280 SNe Ia. A more stringent criterion on the phase of SN spectra is adopted to classify SNe Ia in terms of their photospheric velocities. We find significant trend that SNe Ia with faster Si ii $\lambda$6355 (high-v Si ii SNe Ia) tend to explode in massive environments, whereas their slower counterparts can be found in both lower-mass and massive environments. This trend is further supported by the direct measurements on host gas-phase metallicities. We suggest this relation is likely caused by at least two populations of SNe Ia. Since stars of higher metallicity (at a given mass) generally form less massive white dwarfs (WDs), our results support some theoretical models that high-v Si ii SNe Ia may originate from sub-Chandrasekhar class of explosions. Previous observations also showed some evidence that high-v Si ii SNe Ia could be related to the single degenerate systems. However, we find high-v Si ii SNe Ia do not come from particularly young populations. We conclude metallicity is likely the dominant factor in forming high-v Si ii SNe Ia. This also implies their potential evolution with redshift and impact on the precision of SN Ia cosmology.},

The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two subsamples split by v Si II (defined as "Normal" and "High-Velocity"). We verify this result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when extremely reddened events (E(B − V) > 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that (1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ∼0.06 mag to the red from the Normal subsample in the (B max − V max)-M V plane, (2) the B max − V max cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ∼0.07 mag to the red in B max − V max , and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are ∼0.10 mag redder than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag for SNe Ia with A V 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R V found in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular focus on the design of WFIRST.},

We examine the evolution of the [Co III] $\lambda$5893 emission complex during the nebular phase for SNe Ia with multiple nebular spectra and show that the line flux follows the square of the mass of 56 Co as a function of time. This result indicates both efficient local energy deposition from positrons produced in 56 Co decay and long-term stability of the ionization state of the nebula. We compile SN Ia nebular spectra from the literature and present 21 new late-phase spectra of 7 SNe Ia, including SN 2014J. From these we measure the flux in the [Co III] $\lambda$5893 line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer the initial mass of 56 Ni (M Ni) produced in the explosion. We then examine 56 Ni yields for different SN Ia ejected masses (M ej-calculated using the relation between light-curve width and ejected mass) and find that the 56 Ni masses of SNe Ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (low stretch s ∼ 0.7-0.9), M Ni is clustered near M Ni ≈ 0.4 M and shows a shallow increase as M ej increases from ∼1 to 1.4 M ; at high stretch, M ej clusters at the Chandrasekhar mass (1.4 M) while M Ni spans a broad range from 0.6 to 1.2 M. This could constitute evidence for two distinct SN Ia explosion mechanisms.},

Bayesian inference, central to linking astronomical data to nonlinear astrophysical models, addresses problems in solar physics, properties of star clusters, and exoplanet systems. Likelihood-free methods are growing in importance. Detection of faint signals in complicated noise is needed to find periodic behaviors in stars and detect explosive gravi-tational wave events. Open issues concern treatment of heteroscedastic measurement errors and understanding probability distributions characterizing astrophysical systems. The field of astrostatistics needs increased collaboration with statisticians in the design and analysis stages of research projects, and to jointly develop new statistical methodolo-gies.

abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-scale radio pulses, which originate in distant galaxies and are produced by unknown sources. The mystery remains partially because of the typical difficulty in localising FRBs to host galaxies. Accurate localisations delivered by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey now provide an opportunity to study the host galaxies and potential transient counterparts of FRBs at a large range of wavelengths. In this work, we investigate whether the first three FRBs accurately localised by CRAFT have supernova-like transient counterparts. We obtained two sets of imaging epochs with the Very Large Telescope for three host galaxies, one soon after the burst detection and one several months later. After subtracting these images no optical counterparts were identified in the associated FRB host galaxies, so we instead place limits on the brightness of any potential optical transients. A Monte Carlo approach, in which supernova light curves were modelled and their base properties randomised, was used to estimate the probability of a supernova associated with each FRB going undetected. We conclude that Type Ia and IIn supernovae are unlikely to accompany every apparently non-repeating FRB.},

Early-time (<4 d after explosion) photometry reveal evidence of shock cooling from an extended helium-rich envelope of ∼ 0.1 M located at ∼ 3 × 10 12 cm from the progenitor. Early-time He II line emission and subsequent spectra show signatures of interaction with helium-rich circumstellar material, which extends from 5 × 10 13 cm to 2 × 10 16 cm. We interpret SN2019dge as a helium-rich supernova from an ultra-stripped progenitor, which originates from a close binary system consisting of a mass-losing helium star and a low-mass main sequence star or a compact object (i.e., a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole). We infer that the local volumetric birth rate of 19dge-like ultra-stripped SNe is in the range of 1400-8200 Gpc −3 yr −1 (i.e., 2-12% of core-collapse supernova rate).

abstract = {The true nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains largely unknown, and as survey statistics increase, the question of astrophysi-cal systematic uncertainties rises, notably that of the SN Ia population evolution. In this paper, we study the dependence with redshift of the SN Ia SALT2.4 lightcurve stretch, a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch has been shown to strongly correlate with the SN environment, notably with stellar age tracers. We model the underlying stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution of fraction of young and old SNe Ia as predicted by Rigault et al. (2018), and assuming constant underlying stretch distribution for each age population made of Gaussian mixtures. We test our prediction against published samples chosen to have negligible magnitude selection effects, so that any observed change is indeed of astrophysical and not observational origin. We clearly demonstrate that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution is evolving as a function of redshift, and that the young/old drifting model is a much better description of the data than any time-constant model, including the sample-based asymmetric distributions usually used to correct Malmquist bias. The favored underlying stretch model is the bimodal one derived from Rigault et al. (2018): a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch mode exclusive to old environments. The precise impact of the redshift evolution of the SN Ia population intrinsic properties on cosmology remains to be studied. Yet, the astrophysical drift of the SN stretch distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections and thereby distances derived from SN affected by selection effects. We highlight that such a bias will increase with surveys covering increasingly larger redshift ranges, which is particularly important for LSST.},

abstract = {While undertaking the next phase of analysis of the correlation of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) brightnesses with properties of their local host environments, we discovered a software error affecting the measurements used in Rigault et al. (2013). The measurements of host-galaxy H$\alpha$ emission, $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ , and resulting local star formation rate, LSFR, measured for the environment surrounding each SN in Rigault et al. (2013) where not in units of M yr −1 kpc −2 , as intended, but rather in units of M yr −1 arcsec −2 averaged over a 1 kpc aperture. Here we provide corrected values for several key quantities, finding that these do not significantly change the main conclusions of the original paper. At our typical redshift of z ∼ 0.05, the 1 kpc aperture used in Rigault et al. (2013) has a projected angular size of ∼1 arcsec, so the overall scale of the measurements is unchanged. Measurements for SNe Ia spanning our lowest to highest redshift, i.e., 0.03 < z < 0.08, have scale ranges from 1.65 arcsec per kpc to 0.66 arcsec per kpc, changing $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ by at most ±0.4 dex at the red-shift extremes and producing an RMS change of 0.2 dex. This is to be compared to the nearly 3 dex range spanned by $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$. In Rigault et al. (2013) the sample was divided evenly between SNe Ia in local environments above (Ia$\alpha$) or below (Ia) log($\Sigma$ H$\alpha$) = 38.35 dex. There we further identified two grouping of SNe Ia: M 1 were those fainter than average and having $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ values spanning the full observed range, while M 2 were those brighter and having $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ values below our $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ threshold. With the corrections here, this boundary shifts by −0.03 dex, to log($\Sigma$ H$\alpha$) = 38.32 dex. While the boundary barely moves, some SNe Ia cross the boundary. In particular, two overly bright SNe Ia formerly assigned to the Ia group move into the Ia$\alpha$ group. These SNe Ia were part of a group of three cases discussed in Sect. 7.3 of Rigault et al. (2013), where we explored the impact of moving the $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ threshold and the potential impact of misassociations for Ia with the Ia$\alpha$ group due to boosting by the warm interstel-lar medium (WIM) or accidental projection onto H II regions. One of these is just below our original inclination cut, reinforcing projection as an issue for this case. We originally decided that these SNe Ia belong to the M 2 group and they lie more than 4 $\sigma$ from the M 1 group, so we retain them in the M 2 group even though their corrected $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ values are now slightly higher. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Hubble residuals with the corrected $\Sigma$ H$\alpha$ values, to be compared with the top and bottom panels of Fig. 6 in the original paper. The two SNe Ia mentioned above are highlighted using a lighter shading to fill their markers. It is apparent that the bimodality originally discovered in Rigault et al. (2013) is still present.

abstract = {Ultracompact accreting binary systems each consist of a stellar remnant accreting helium-enriched material from a compact donor star. Such binaries include two related sub-classes, AM CVn-type binaries and helium cataclysmic variables, in both of which the central star is a white dwarf. We present a spectroscopic and photo-metric study of six accreting binaries with orbital periods in the range of 40-70 min, including phase-resolved VLT spectroscopy and high-speed ULTRACAM photometry. Four of these are AM CVn systems and two are helium cataclysmic variables. For four of these binaries we are able to identify orbital periods (of which three are spectro-scopic). SDSS J1505+0659 has an orbital period of 67.8 min, significantly longer than previously believed, and longer than any other known AM CVn binary. We identify a WISE infrared excess in SDSS J1505+0659 that we believe to be the first direct detection of an AM CVn donor star in a non-direct impacting binary. The mass ratio of SDSS J1505+0659 is consistent with a white dwarf donor. CRTS J1028−0819 has an orbital period of 52.1 min, the shortest period of any helium cataclysmic variable. MOA 2010-BLG-087 is co-aligned with a K-class star that dominates its spectrum. ASASSN-14ei and ASASSN-14mv both show a remarkable number of echo outbursts following superoutbursts (13 and 10 echo outbursts respectively). ASASSN-14ei shows an increased outburst rate over the years following its superoutburst, perhaps resulting from an increased accretion rate.},

abstract = {Context. Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has rapidly reached maturity becoming a fundamental observing window for modern astrophysics. The coalescences of a few tens of black hole (BH) binaries have been detected, while the number of events possibly including a neutron star (NS) is still limited to a few. On 2019 August 14, the LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected a high-significance event labelled S190814bv. Preliminary analysis of the GW data suggests that the event was likely due to the merger of a compact binary system formed by a BH and a NS, although the lighter object could still be consistent with being a low-mass BH. Aims. In this paper, we present our extensive search campaign aimed at uncovering the potential optical/near infrared electromagnetic counterpart of S190814bv. We found no convincing electromagnetic counterpart in our data. We therefore use our non-detection to place limits on the properties of the putative outflows that could have been produced by the binary during and after the merger. Methods. Thanks to the three-detector observation of S190814bv, and given the characteristics of the signal, the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations delivered a relatively narrow localisation in low latency-a 50% (90%) credible area of 5 deg 2 (23 deg 2)-despite the relatively large distance of 267 ± 52 Mpc. ElectromagNetic counterparts of GRAvitational wave sources at the VEry Large Telescope (ENGRAVE) collaboration members carried out an intensive multi-epoch, multi-instrument observational campaign to identify the possible optical/near infrared counterpart of the event. In addition, the ATLAS, GOTO, GRAWITA-VST, Pan-STARRS and VIN-ROUGE projects also carried out a search on this event. In this paper, we describe the combined observational campaign of these groups. Results. Our observations allow us to place limits on the presence of any counterpart and discuss the implications for the kilonova (KN) possibly generated by this NS-BH merger, and for the strategy of future searches. The typical depth of our wide-field observations , which cover most of the projected sky localisation probability (from 33% to 99.8%, depending on the night and filter considered), is r ∼ 22 (resp. K ∼ 21) in the optical (resp. near infrared). We reach deeper limits in a subset of our galaxy-targeted observations, which cover a total ∼ 50% of the galaxy-mass-weighted localisation probability. Altogether, our observations allow us to exclude a KN with large ejecta mass M 0.1 M to a high (> 90%) confidence, and we place meaningful limits on a larger portion of the ejecta mass parameter space. This disfavours the tidal disruption of the neutron star during the merger. Conclusions. Despite the sensitive instruments involved in the campaign, given the distance of S190814bv we could not reach sufficiently deep limits to constrain a KN comparable in luminosity to AT 2017gfo on a large fraction of the localisation probability. This suggests that future (likely common) events at a few hundreds Mpc will be detected only by large facilities with both high sensitivity and large field of view. Galaxy-targeted observations can reach the needed depth over a relevant portion of the localisation probability with a smaller investment of resources, but the number of galaxies to be targeted in order to get a fairly complete coverage is large, even in the case of a localisation as good as that of this event.},

abstract = {J-Branch Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) stars are a photometrically well-defined population of extremely red, intermediate-age AGB stars that are found to have tightly-constrained luminosities in the near-infrared. Based on JK photometry of some 3,300 JAGB stars in the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we find that these very red AGB stars have a constant absolute magnitude of < M J >= −6.22 mag, adopting the Detached Eclipsing Binary (DEB) distance to the LMC of 18.477 ± 0.004 (stat) ± 0.026 (sys). Undertaking a second, independent calibration in the SMC, which also has a DEB geometric distance, we find < M J >= −6.18± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.05 (sys) mag. The scatter is ±0.27 mag for single-epoch observations, (falling to ±0.15 mag for multiple observations averaged over a window of more than one year). We provisionally adopt < M J >= −6.20 mag ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.04 (sys) mag for the mean absolute magnitude of JAGB stars. Applying this calibration to JAGB stars recently observed in the galaxy NGC 253, we determine a distance modulus of 27.66 ± 0.01(stat) ± 0.04 mag (syst), corresponding to a distance of 3.40 ± 0.06 Mpc (stat). This is in excellent agreement with the averaged TRGB distance modulus of 27.68 ± 0.05 mag, assuming M I =-4.05 mag for the TRGB zero point.},

abstract = {We apply the near-infrared J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) method, recently introduced by Madore & Freedman (2020), to measure the distances to 14 nearby galaxies out to 4 Mpc. We use the geometric detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances to the LMC and SMC as independent zero-point calibrators. We find excellent agreement with previously published distances based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB): the JAGB distance determinations (including the LMC and SMC) agree in the mean to within ∆(JAGB − T RGB) =+0.025 ± 0.013 mag, just over 1%, where the TRGB I-band zero point is M I =-4.05 mag. With further development and testing, the JAGB method has the potential to provide an independent calibration of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), especially with JW ST. The JAGB stars (with M J = −6.20 mag) can be detected farther than the fainter TRGB stars, allowing greater numbers of calibrating galaxies for the determination of H 0. Along with the TRGB and Cepheids, JAGB stars are amenable to theoretical understanding and further refined empirical calibration. A preliminary test shows little dependence, if any, of the JAGB magnitude with metallicity of the parent galaxy. These early results suggest that the JAGB method has considerable promise for providing high-precision distances to galaxies in the local universe that are independent of distances derived from the Leavitt Law and/or the TRGB method; and it has numerous and demonstrable advantages over the possible use of Mira variables.},

abstract = {With the distance sum rule in the Friedmann-Lema{\^{i}}tre-Robertson-Walker metric, model-independent constraints on both the Hubble constant H 0 and spatial curvature Ω K can be obtained using strong lensing time-delay data and Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosity distances. This method is limited by the relative low redshifts of SNe Ia, however. Here, we propose using quasars as distance indicators, extending the coverage to encompass the redshift range of strong lensing systems. We provide a novel and improved method of determining H 0 and Ω K simultaneously. By applying this technique to the time-delay measurements of seven strong lensing systems and the known ultraviolet versus X-ray luminosity correlation of quasars, we constrain the possible values of both H 0 and Ω K , and find that H 0 = 75.3 +3.0 −2.9 km s −1 Mpc −1 and Ω K = −0.01 +0.18 −0.17. The measured Ω K is consistent with zero spatial curvature, indicating that there is no significant deviation from a flat universe. If we use flatness as a prior, we infer that H 0 = 75.3 +1.9 −1.9 km s −1 Mpc −1 , representing a precision of 2.5%. If we further combine these data with the 1048 current Pantheon SNe Ia, our model-independent constraints can be further improved to H 0 = 75.3 +3.0 −2.9 km s −1 Mpc −1 and Ω K = 0.05 +0.16 −0.14. In every case, we find that the Hubble constant measured with this technique is strongly consistent with the value (∼ 74 km s −1 Mpc −1) measured using the local distance ladder, as opposed to the value optimized by Planck.},

A spherical model of the H$\alpha$ emission from the CS shell that takes into account a preshock gas acceleration by a supernova radiation permits us to successfully reproduce the H$\alpha$ profile. Principal factors responsible for the H$\alpha$ asymmetry are the high velocity of the accelerated CS preshock gas (∼ 3000 km s −1) and a low H$\alpha$ Sobolev optical depth in a combination with an occultation of the H$\alpha$ emission by the photosphere.},

abstract = {Despite vast improvements in the measurement of the cosmological parameters, the nature of dark energy and an accurate value of the Hubble constant (H 0) in the Hubble-LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre law remain unknown. To break the current impasse, it is necessary to develop as many independent techniques as possible, such as the use of Type II supernovae (SNe II). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of SNe II for deriving accurate extragalactic distances, which will be an asset for the next generation of telescopes where more-distant SNe II will be discovered. More specifically, we present a sample from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisting of 15 SNe II with photometric and spectroscopic information spanning a redshift range up to 0.35. Combining our DES SNe with publicly available samples, and using the standard candle method (SCM), we construct the largest available Hub-ble diagram with SNe II in the Hubble flow (70 SNe II) and find an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag. We demonstrate that adding a colour term to the SN II standardisation does not reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram. Although SNe II are viable as distance indicators, this work points out important issues for improving their utility as independent extragalactic beacons: find new correlations, define a more standard subclass of SNe II, construct new SN II templates, and dedicate more observing time to high-redshift SNe II. Finally, for the first time, we perform simulations to estimate the redshift-dependent distance-modulus bias due to selection effects.},

abstract = {Despite their importance, details of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remain elusive. X-ray measurements of the element distributions in supernova remnants (SNRs) offer important clues to understanding the explosion and nucleosynthesis mechanisms for SNe Ia. However, it has been challenging to observe the entire ejecta mass in X-rays for young SNRs, because the central ejecta may not have been heated by the reverse shock yet. Here we present over 200-ks Chandra observations of the Type Ia SNR G344.7-0.1, whose age is old enough for the reverse shock to have reached the SNR center, providing an opportunity to investigate the distribution of the entire ejecta mass. We reveal a clear stratification of heavy elements with a centrally-peaked distribution of the Fe ejecta surrounded by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs: Si, S, Ar Ca) with an arc-like structure. The centroid energy of the Fe K emission is marginally lower in the central Fe-rich region than in the outer IME-rich regions, suggesting that the Fe ejecta were shock heated more recently. These results are consistent with a prediction of standard SN Ia models, where the heavier elements are synthesized in the interior of an exploding white dwarf. We find, however, that the peak location of the Fe K emission is slightly offset to the west with respect to the geometric center of the SNR. This apparent asymmetry is likely due to the inhomogeneous density distribution of the ambient medium, consistent with our radio observations of the ambient molecular and neutral gas.},

abstract = {While ancient scientists often had patrons to fund their work, peer review of proposals for the allocation of resources is a foundation of modern science. A very common method is that proposals are evaluated by a small panel of experts (due to logistics and funding limitations) nominated by the grant-giving institutions. The expert panel process introduces several issues-most notably: 1) biases introduced in the selection of the panel. 2) experts have to read a very large number of proposals. Distributed Peer Review promises to alleviate several of the described problems by distributing the task of reviewing among the proposers. Each proposer is given a limited number of proposals to review and rank. We present the result of an experiment running a machine-learning enhanced distributed peer review process for allocation of telescope time at the European Southern Observatory. In this work, we show that the distributed peer review is statistically the same as a 'traditional' panel, that our machine learning algorithm can predict expertise of reviewers with a high success rate, and we find that seniority and reviewer expertise have an influence on review quality. The general experience has been overwhelmingly praised from the participating community (using an anonymous feedback mechanism).},

This sample consists of five H/He-rich SNe, six H-poor/He-rich SNe, three narrow lined SNe Ic, and four broad lined SNe Ic. The peak luminosity and characteristic timescales of the bolometric light curves are calculated, and the light curves modelled to derive 56 Ni and ejecta masses (M Ni and M ej). Additionally, the temperature evolution and spectral line velocity curves of each SN are examined. Analysis of the [O I] line in the nebular phase of eight SNe suggests their progenitors had initial masses <20 M. The bolometric light curve properties are examined in combination with those of other SE events from the literature. The resulting data set gives the M ej distribution for 80 SE-SNe, the largest such sample in the literature to date, and shows that SNe Ib have the lowest median M ej , followed by narrow-lined SNe Ic, H/He-rich SNe, broad-lined SNe Ic, and finally gamma-ray burst SNe. SNe Ic-6/7 show the largest spread of M ej ranging from ∼1.2-11 M , considerably greater than any other subtype. For all SE-SNe <M ej > = 2.8 ± 1.5 M which further strengthens the evidence that SE-SNe arise from low-mass progenitors which are typically <5 M at the time of explosion, again suggesting M ZAMS <25 M. The low <M ej > and lack of clear bimodality in the distribution implies <30 M progenitors and that envelope stripping via binary interaction is the dominant evolutionary pathway of these SNe.},

abstract = {This work presents the observations and analysis of ATLAS19dqr/SN 2019bkc, an extraordinary rapidly evolving transient event located in an isolated environment, tens of kiloparsecs from any likely host. Its light curves rise to maximum light in 5−6 d and then display a decline of ∆m 15 ∼ 5 mag. With such a pronounced decay, it has one of the most rapidly evolving light curves known for a stellar explosion. The early spectra show similarities to normal and "ultra-stripped" type Ic SNe, but the early nebular phase spectra, which were reached just over two weeks after explosion, display prominent calcium lines, marking SN 2019bkc as a Ca-rich transient. The Ca emission lines at this phase show an unprecedented and unexplained blueshift of 10 000-12 000 km s −1. Modelling of the light curve and the early spectra suggests that the transient had a low ejecta mass of 0.2−0.4 M and a low kinetic energy of (2−4) × 10 50 erg, giving a specific kinetic energy E k /M ej ∼ 1 [10 51 erg]/M. The origin of this event cannot be unambiguously defined.

abstract = {Context. Distance measurements of supernova remnants (SNRs) are essential and important. Accurate estimates of physical size, dust masses, and some other properties of SNRs depend critically on accurate distance measurements. However, the determination of SNR distances is still a tough task. Aims. Red clump stars (RCs) have a long history been used as standard candles. In this work, we take RCs as tracers to determine the distances to a large group of SNRs in the inner disk. Methods. We first select RC stars based on the near-infrared (IR) color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Then, the distance to and extinction of RC stars are calculated. To extend the measurable range of distance, we combine near-IR photometric data from the 2MASS survey with the deeper UKIDSS and VVV surveys. With the help of the Gaia parallaxes, we also remove contaminants including dwarfs and giants. Because an SN explosion compresses the surrounding interstellar medium, the SNR region would become denser and exhibit higher extinction than the surroundings. The distance of a SNR is then recognized by the position where the extinction and its gradient is higher than that of the ambient medium. Results. A total of 63 SNRs' distances in the Galactic inner disk are determined and divided into three Levels A, B, and C with decreasing reliability. The distances to 43 SNRs are well determined with reliability A or B. The diameters and dust masses of SNRs are estimated with the obtained distance and extinction.},

abstract = {Redshifts used in current cosmological supernova samples are measured using two primary techniques, one based on well-measured host galaxy spectral lines and the other based on supernova-dominated spectra. Here, we construct an updated Pantheon catalog with revised redshifts, redshift sources and estimated uncertainties for the entire sample to investigate whether these two techniques yield consistent results. The best-fit cosmological parameters using these two measurement techniques disagree , and we explore several possible sources of bias which could result from using the lower-precision supernova-dominated redshifts. In a pilot study, we show that using a host redshift-only subsample of the Pantheon catalog will result in lower Ω m and matter density Ω m h 2 and slightly higher H 0 than previous analysis which, among other possibilities, could result in supernova and CMB measurements agreeing on Ω m h 2 despite tension in H 0. To obtain rigorous results, though, the Pantheon catalog should be improved by obtaining host spectra for supernova that have faded and future surveys should be designed to use host galaxy redshifts rather than lower-precision methods.},

abstract = {We explore the prospects of detecting of Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries with the space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory TianQin. In this work we analyse both a sample of currently known and a realistic synthetic population of DWDs to assess the number of guaranteed detections and the full capacity of the mission. We find that TianQin can detect 12 out of ∼ 100 known DWDs; GW signals of these binaries can be modelled in detail ahead of the mission launch, and therefore they can be used as verification sources. Besides we estimate that TianQin has potential to detect as many as 10 4 DWDs in the Milky Way. TianQin is expected to measure their orbital periods and amplitudes with accuracy of ∼ 10 −7 and ∼ 0.2 respectively, and to localize on the sky a large fraction (39%) of the detected population to better than 1 deg 2. We conclude that TianQin has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge on Galactic DWDs by increasing the sample up to 2 orders of magnitude, and will allow their multi-messenger studies in combination with electromagnetic telescopes. We also test the possibilities of different configuration of TianQin: 1) the same mission with a different orientation, 2) two perpendicular constellations combined into a network, and 3) the combination of the network with the ESA-lead Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We find that the network of detectors boosts the accuracy on the measurement of source parameters by 1 − 2 orders of magnitude, with the improvement on sky localization being the most significant.},

In general, many explosions spanning the parameter space of progenitors can yield excellent lightcurve and Fe line velocity agreement, demonstrating the success of scaling laws in motivating models which match plateau properties for a given radius and highlighting the degeneracy between plateau luminosity and velocity in models and observed events, which can span over 50% in ejecta mass, radius, and explosion energy. This can help explain disagreements in explosion properties reported for the same event using different model calculations. Our calculations yield explosion properties when combined with pre-explosion progenitor radius measurements or a robust understanding of the outermost < 0.1 M of material that quantifies the progenitor radius from SN observations a few days after explosion.},

We used multi-filter Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of massive galaxy clusters with sufficient cadence to make the observed SN Ia light curves suitable for a cosmological probe of dark energy at z > 0.5. As part of the See Change programme , we obtained ground-based spectroscopy of each discovered transient and/or its host galaxy. Here we present Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectra of See Change transient host galaxies, deriving their redshifts, and host parameters such as stellar mass and star formation rate. Of the 39 See Change transients/hosts that were observed with the VLT, we successfully determined the redshift for 26, including 15 SNe Ia at z > 0.97. This new sample of SNe Ia with multi-colour light curves is the largest to date at these redshifts. We show that even in passive environments, it is possible to recover secure redshifts for the majority of SN hosts out to z = 1.5. We find that with typical exposure times of 3 − 4 hrs on an 8m-class telescope we can recover ∼75% of SN Ia redshifts in the range of 0.97 < z < 1.5. Furthermore, we show that the combination of HST photometry and VLT spectroscopy is able to provide estimates of host galaxy stellar mass that are sufficiently accurate for use in a mass-step correction in the cosmological analysis.},

The molecular gas mass of the host galaxy is M gas = (4.8 ± 0.3) × 10 9 M ⊙ , placing it on the sequence of normal star-forming galaxies in an M gas-star-formation rate (SFR) plane. The molecular hydrogen column density at the location of SN 2017egm is higher than that of the Type II SN PTF10bgl, which is also located in the same host galaxy, and those of other Type II and Ia SNe located in different galaxies, suggesting that SLSNe-I have a preference for a dense molecular gas environment. On the other hand, the column density at the location of SN 2017egm is comparable to those of Type Ibc SNe. The surface densities of molecular gas and the SFR at the location of SN 2017egm are consistent with those of spatially resolved local star-forming galaxies and follow the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. These facts suggest that SLSNe-I can occur in environments with the same star-formation mechanism as in normal star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {The diffusion of elements is a key process in understanding the unusual surface composition of white dwarfs stars and their spectral evolution. The diffusion coefficients of Paquette et al. (1986) have been widely used to model diffusion in white dwarfs. We perform new calculations of the coefficients of inter-diffusion and ionic thermal diffusion with 1) a more advanced model that uses a recent modification of the calculation of the collision integrals that is more suitable for the partially ionized, partially degenerate and moderately coupled plasma, and 2) classical molecular dynamics. The coefficients are evaluated for silicon and calcium in white dwarf envelopes of hydrogen and helium. A comparison of our results with Paquette et al. shows that the latter systematically underestimates the coefficient of inter-diffusion yet provides reliable estimates for the relatively weakly coupled plasmas found in nearly all types of stars as well as in white dwarfs with hydrogen envelopes. In white dwarfs with cool helium envelopes (T eff < 15000 K), the difference grows to more than a factor of two. We also explored the effect of the ionization model used to determine the charges of the ions and found that it can be a substantial source of discrepancy between different calculations. Finally, we consider the relative diffusion time scales of Si and Ca in the context of the pollution of white dwarf photospheres by accreted planetesimals and find factor of ∼ > 3 differences between calculations based on Paquette et al. and our model.},

abstract = {AT 2018cow was the nearest and best studied example of a new breed of extra-galactic, luminous and rapidly-evolving transient. Both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of these rapid transients remain a mystery-the energetics, spectral signatures , and timescales make them challenging to interpret in established classes of super-novae and tidal disruption events. The rich, multi-wavelength data-set of AT 2018cow has still left several interpretations viable to explain the nature of this event. In this paper we analyse integral-field spectroscopic data of the host galaxy, CGCG 137-068, to compare environmental constraints with leading progenitor models. We find the explosion site of AT 2018cow to be very typical of core-collapse supernovae (known to form from stars with M ZAMS ∼ 8 − 25 M), and infer a young stellar population age at the explosion site of few ×10 Myr, at slightly sub-solar metallicity. When comparing to expectations for exotic intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption events, we find no evidence for a potential host system of the IMBH. In particular, there are no abrupt changes in metallicity or kinematics in the vicinity of the explosion site, arguing against the presence of a distinct host system. The proximity of AT 2018cow to strong star-formation in the host galaxy makes us favour a massive stellar progenitor for this event.},

abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN Ib 2019ehk. We show that it evolved to a Ca-rich transient according to its spectral properties and evolution in late phases. It, however, shows a few distinguish-able properties from the canonical Ca-rich transients: a short-duration first peak in the light curve, high peak luminosity, and association with a star-forming environment. Indeed, some of these features are shared with iPTF14gqr and iPTF16hgs, which are candidates for a special class of core-collapse SNe (CCSNe): the so-called ultra-stripped envelope SNe, i.e., a relatively low-mass He (or C+O) star explosion in a binary as a precursor of double neutron star binaries. The estimated ejecta mass (0.43M ⊙) and explosion energy (1.7×10 50 erg) are consistent with this scenario. The analysis of the first peak suggests existence of dense circumstellar material in the vicinity of the progenitor, implying a CCSN origin. Based on these analyses, we suggest SN 2019ehk is another candidate for an ultra-stripped envelope SN. These ultra-stripped envelope SN candidates seem to form a subpopulation among Ca-rich transients, associated with young population. We propose that the key to distinguishing this population is the early first peak in their light curves.},

abstract = {The use of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological tools has motivated significant effort to: understand what drives the intrinsic scatter of SN Ia distance modulus residuals after standardization, characterize the distribution of SN Ia colors, and explain why properties of the host galaxies of the SNe correlate with SN Ia distance modulus residuals. We use a compiled sample of ∼ 1450 spectroscopically confirmed, photometric light-curves of SN Ia and propose a solution to these three problems simultaneously that also explains an empirical 11$\sigma$ detection of the dependence of Hubble residual scatter on SN Ia color. We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with extrinsic dust-like colors (E(B − V)) with a wide range of extinction parameter values (R V). This model captures the observed trends of Hubble residual scatter and indicates that the dominant component of SN Ia intrinsic scatter is from variation in R V. We also find that the recovered E(B − V) and R V distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains the observed correlation ($\gamma$) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in past analyses as well as an observed 4.5$\sigma$ dependence of $\gamma$ on SN Ia color. This finding removes any need to prescribe different intrinsic luminosities to different progenitor systems. Finally we measure biases in the equation-of-state of dark energy (w) up to |∆w| = 0.04 by replacing previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.},

abstract = {The light curve of the explosion of a star with a radius 10-100 R is powered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally, such events are dominated by hydrogen-deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae (SNe I), i.e., white dwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia), and core collapses of hydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ib/c). Current transient surveys are finding SNe I in increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be studied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize the physics that produces their rising light curves and discuss ways in which observations can be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered light curves probe the shallowest deposits of 56 Ni. If the amount of 56 Ni mixing in the outermost layers of the star can be deduced, then it places important constraints on the progenitor and properties of the explosive burning. In practice, we find that it is difficult to determine the level of mixing because it is hard to disentangle whether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing radioactive heating near the surface or whether the explosion began in the past and the radioactive heating is deeper in the ejecta. In the latter case, there is a "dark phase" between the moment of explosion and the first observed light emitted once the shallowest layers of 56 Ni are exposed. Because of this, simply extrapolating a light curve from radioactive heating back in time is not a reliable method for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly identify the moment of explosion, either through observing shock breakout (in X-ray/UV) or the cooling of the shock-heated surface (in UV/optical), so that the depth being probed by the rising light curve is known. However, since this is typically not available, we identify and discuss a number of other diagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion occurred. As an example, we apply these arguments to the recent SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We demonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and temperature during the rise places interesting constraints on its explosion time, radius, and level of 56 Ni mixing.},

abstract = {The carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) + He star channel has been thought to be one of the promising scnarios to produce young type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Previous studies found that if the mass-accretion rate is greater than a critical value, the He-accreting CO WD will undergo inwardly propagating (off-centre) carbon ignition when it increases its mass close to the Chandrasekhar limit. The inwardly propagating carbon flame was supposed to reach the centre by previous works, leading to the production of an oxygen-neon (ONe) WD that may collapse into a neutron star but not an SN Ia. However, it is still uncertain how the carbon flame propagates under the effect of mixing mechanisms. In the present work, we aim to investigate the off-centre carbon burning of the He-accreting CO WDs by considering the effect of convective mixing. We found that the temperature of the flame is high enough to burn the carbon into silicon-group elements in the outer part of the CO core even if the convective overshooting is considered, but the flame would quench somewhere inside the WD, resulting in the formation of a CO -Si WD. Owing to the inefficiency of thermohaline mixing, the CO -Si WD may explode as an SN Ia if it continues to grow in mass. Our radiation transfer simulations show that the SN ejecta with the silicon-rich outer layer will form high-velocity absorption lines in Si II, leading to some similarities to a class of the high-velocity SNe Ia in the spectral evolution. We estimate that the birthrate of SNe Ia with Si-rich envelope is ∼1 × 10 −4 yr −1 in our galaxy.},

abstract = {A statistical study of intermediate Palomar Transient Factory supernovae (SNe) in Type 1 AGN has shown a major deficit of supernovae around Type 1 AGN host galaxies, with respect to Type 2 AGN hosts. The aim of this work is to test whether there is any preference for Type 1 AGN to host SN of a specific kind. Through the analysis of SN occurrence and their type (thermonuclear vs core-collapse), we can directly link the type of stars producing the SN events, thus this is an indirect way to study host galaxies in Type 1 AGN. We examine the detection fractions of SNe, the host galaxies and compare the sample properties to typical host galaxies in the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC; Guillochon et al. 2017). The majority of the host galaxies in the AGN sample are late-type, similar to typical galaxies hosting SN within the OSC. The findings are supportive of a deficiency of SNe near Type 1 AGN, although we cannot with certainty assess the overall detection fractions of SNe in Type 1 AGN relative to other SN host galaxies. We can state that Type 1 AGN has equal detection fractions of thermonuclear vs core-collapse SNe. However, we note the possibility of a higher detection rate of core-collapse supernovae in Type-1 AGN with insecure AGN classifications.},

abstract = {The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) scenario was proposed 40 years ago as an evolutionary end state of oxygen-neon white-dwarfs (ONe WDs), linking them to the formation of neutron star (NS) systems. However, there has been no direct detection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists a lot of indirect observational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS formation through AIC are still not well investigated. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e., the single-degenerate model (including the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and the CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model (including the double CO WD channel, the double ONe WD channel and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on these progenitor models is reviewed , including the binary evolutionary scenarios, the initial parameter space and the related objects. For the single-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems could potentially be identified as cataclysmic variables, symbiotics and supersoft X-ray sources, whereas the post-AIC systems could potentially be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray bi-naries and the resulting low-/intermediate-mass binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For the double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems are close double WDs, whereas the post-AIC systems are isolated NSs that may correspond to a specific kind of NSs with peculiar properties. We also review the predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs produced via AIC, and the gravitational wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources in the Galaxy in the context of future space-based GW detectors. Some theoretical and observational constraints on the detection of AIC events are summarized. In order to confirm the existence of the AIC process, and resolve this long-term issue presented by current stellar evolution theories, more numerical simulations and observational identifications are required.},

abstract = {We present panchromatic observations and modeling of the Calcium-rich supernova (SN) 2019ehk in the star-forming galaxy M100 (d≈16.2 Mpc) starting 10 hours after explosion and continuing for ∼ 300 days. SN 2019ehk shows a double-peaked optical light curve peaking at t = 3 and 15 days. The first peak is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying Swift-XRT discovered X-ray emission (L x ≈ 10 41 erg s −1 at 3 days; L x ∝ t −3), and a Shane/Kast spectral detection of narrow H$\alpha$ and He emission lines (v ≈ 500 km s −1) originating from pre-existent circumstellar material (CSM). We attribute this phenomenology to radiation from shock interaction with extended, dense material surrounding the progenitor star at r < 10 15 cm and the resulting cooling emission. We calculate a total CSM mass of ∼ 7 × 10 −3 M (M He /M H ≈ 6) with particle density n ≈ 10 9 cm −3. Radio observations indicate a significantly lower density n < 10 4 cm −3 at larger radii r > (0.1 − 1) × 10 17 cm. The photometric and spectroscopic properties during the second light curve peak are consistent with those of Ca-rich transients (rise-time of t r = 13.4 ± 0.210 days and a peak B-band magnitude of M B = −15.1 ± 0.200 mag). We find that SN 2019ehk synthesized (3.1 ± 0.11) × 10 −2 M of 56 Ni and ejected M ej = (0.72 ± 0.040) M total with a kinetic energy E k = (1.8 ± 0.10) × 10 50 erg. Finally, deep HST pre-explosion imaging at the SN site constrains the parameter space of viable stellar progenitors to massive stars in the lowest mass bin (∼ 10 M) in binaries that lost most of their He envelope or white dwarfs (WDs). The explosion and environment properties of SN 2019ehk further restrict the potential WD progenitor systems to low-mass hybrid HeCO WD + CO WD binaries.},

Early photometry and spectroscopy reveal evidence of shock cooling from an extended helium-rich envelope of ∼ 0.1 M located at ∼ 3 × 10 12 cm from the progenitor. Early-time He II line emission suggests that the envelope might have a lower-density optically thin extension to 5 × 10 13 cm. Subsequent spectra show signatures of interaction with helium-rich circumstellar material, which extends to ∼ 2 × 10 16 cm. We interpret SN2019dge as the first helium-rich supernova from an ultra-stripped progenitor, which originates from a close binary system consisting of a mass-losing helium star and a compact object (i.e., a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole). The remnants of 19dge-like ultra-stripped SNe are probably compact neutron star binaries, some of which can merge within the age of the Universe. We infer that the ratio of the rate of 19dge-like ultra-stripped SNe to core-collapse SNe is 2-12%, corresponding to a local rate density R dge in the range of 1400-8200 Gpc −3 yr −1. Ultra-stripped SNe and dynamical capture in globular clusters are two channels to form double neutron star systems. We should be able to address which one is the dominant channel by comparing the ultra-stripped SN rate estimated from future high-cadence optical surveys with the coalescence rate of local double neutron stars constrained by future LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave experiments.},

abstract = {The explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the double detonation scenario is a potential explanation for type Ia super-novae. In this scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a lower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses, we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models, ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M with corresponding shell masses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M. This implies that, as soon as a detonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, a subsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable.},

abstract = {For carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting hydrogen or helium at rates in the range ∼(1-10) ×10 −8 M yr −1 , a variety of explosive outcomes is possible well before the star reaches the Chandrasekhar mass. These outcomes are surveyed for a range of white dwarf masses (0.7-1.1 M), accretion rates ((1-7) × 10 −8 M yr −1), and initial white dwarf temperatures (0.01 and 1 L). The results are particularly sensitive to the convection that goes on during the last few minutes before the explosion. Unless this convection maintains a shallow temperature gradient and unless the density is sufficiently high, the accreted helium does not detonate. Below a critical helium ignition density, which we estimate to be (5-10) × 10 5 g cm −3 , either helium novae or helium deflagrations result. The hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, light curves, and spectra of a representative sample of detonating and deflagrating models are explored. Some can be quite faint indeed, powered at peak for a few days by the decay of 48 Cr and 48 V. Only the hottest, most massive white dwarfs considered with the smallest helium layers, show reasonable agreement with the light curves and spectra of common Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). For the other models, especially those involving lighter white dwarfs, the helium shell mass exceeds 0.05 M and the mass of the 56 Ni that is synthesized exceeds 0.01 M. These explosions do not look like ordinary SNe Ia or any other frequently observed transient.},

abstract = {The double-detonation explosion model has been considered a candidate for explaining astrophysical transients with a wide range of luminosities. In this model, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a surface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is the presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface helium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the optical depths of important He I lines in the ejecta of double-detonation models. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the He I lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion simulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the near-infrared 10830 \AA$\sim$and 2 $\mu$m lines of He I. We first consider a double detonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This model has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 $M_{\odot}$ and our calculations suggest that the 2 $\mu$m feature is expected to be very weak but that the 10830 \AA$\sim$feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta. Consequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 \AA$\sim$feature may be expected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum light. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model ($\sim 19,000$$\sim$km$\sim$s$^{-1}$) mean that the He I 10830 \AA$\sim$feature may be confused or blended with the C I 10690$\sim$\AA$\sim$line forming at lower velocities. We also present calculations for the He I 10830 \AA$\sim$and 2 $\mu$m lines for a lower mass (low luminosity) double detonation model, which has a post-explosion He mass of 0.077 $M_{\odot}$. In this case, both the He I features we consider are strong and can provide a clear observational signature of the double-detonation mechanism.},

abstract = {Ejecta velocity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is one powerful tool to differentiate between progenitor scenarios and explosion mechanisms. Here we revisit the relation between photospheric Si ii $\lambda$6355 velocities (v Si ii) and host-galaxy properties with ∼280 SNe Ia. A more stringent criterion on the phase of SN spectra is adopted to classify SNe Ia in terms of their photospheric velocities. We find significant trend that SNe Ia with faster Si ii $\lambda$6355 (high-v Si ii SNe Ia) tend to explode in massive environments, whereas their slower counterparts can be found in both lower-mass and massive environments. This trend is further supported by the direct measurements on host gas-phase metallicities. We suggest this relation is likely caused by at least two populations of SNe Ia. Since stars of higher metallicity (at a given mass) generally form less massive white dwarfs (WDs), our results support some theoretical models that high-v Si ii SNe Ia may originate from sub-Chandrasekhar class of explosions. Previous observations also showed some evidence that high-v Si ii SNe Ia could be related to the single degenerate systems. However, we find high-v Si ii SNe Ia do not come from particularly young populations. We conclude metallicity is likely the dominant factor in forming high-v Si ii SNe Ia. This also implies their potential evolution with redshift and impact on the precision of SN Ia cosmology.},

So far, the observables that we receive from well-studied SNRs Ia cannot be explained self-consistently by any model presented in the literature. In this study, we suggest that the circumstellar medium (CSM) being observed to surround several SNRs Ia was mainly shaped by planetary nebulae (PNe) that originated from one or both progenitor stars. Performing two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the ambient medium shaped by PNe can account for several properties of the CSM that have been found to surround SNe Ia and their remnants. Finally, we model Kepler's SNR considering that the SN explosion occurred inside a bipolar PN. Our simulations show good agreement with the observed morphological and kinematic properties of Kepler's SNR. In particular, our model reproduces the current expansion parameter of Kepler's SNR, the partial interaction of the remnant with a dense CSM at its northern region and finally the existence of two opposite protrusions ('ears') at the equatorial plane of the SNR.},

abstract = {The distribution of stars in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram (HRD) for a stellar conglomeration represents a snapshot of its evolving stellar population. Some of the supergiant stars may transit the HRD from blue to red and then again to blue during their late evolutionary stages, as exemplified by the progenitor of SN 1987A. Others may transit a given part of the HRD more than twice in a "blue loop" and end up as red supergiants before they explode. Since stars in blue loops spend a considerable part of their lives there, these stages may change the relative number of modeled supergiants in the HRD. Their lifetimes in turn depend upon the initial mass of the star, how convection in its interior is modeled, and how much mass loss takes place during its evolution. The observed ratio of the number of blue to red supergiants and yellow to red supergiants sensitively test the stellar evolution theory. We compare modeled number ratios of these supergiants with observed data from the Large Magellanic Cloud as it has a metallicity very similar to that of the environment of SN 2013ej. We successfully model these by taking into account moderate (exponential) convective overshooting. We explore its effect on the final radius and mass of the star prior to core collapse. The radius differs dramatically with overshoot. These factors controlling pre-supernova structure may affect the post-explosion optical/IR light curves and spectral development.},

In our sample, there are 67 SN host galaxies in the field of view of MaNGA, including 32 Type Ia, 29 CCSNe, 1 super-luminous SN (SLSN), 1 Type I and 4 unclassified type of SNe, with which we can perform the K-S test for analysis and derive statistically robust results. Due to the limited sample size, we couldn't remove the mass dependence in this work, which is likely the true driver of the trends for the properties presented in this work. The global star formation rate (SFR) and EW(H$\alpha$) for SN Ia hosts is slightly lower than that for CCSN hosts on average. SN Ia host galaxies are ∼ 0.3 dex more massive than CCSN hosts, which implies that the number ratio of CCSNe to Type Ia SNe will decrease with the increasing of stellar mass of host galaxies. The stellar population age of SN Ia host galaxies is older than that of CCSN hosts on average. There is no significant difference between different types of SN hosts for some properties, including local SFR density ($\Sigma$SFR), local and global gas-phase oxygen abundance. For most galaxies in our sample, the global gas-phase oxygen abundance estimated from the integrated spectra of SN hosts can represent the local gas-phase oxygen abundance at the SN explosion sites with small bias.},

This eliminates most instrumental systematics and provides light curves in a stable and well-understood photometric system. Having the same host galaxy also eliminates systematics due to distance and peculiar velocity, providing an opportunity to directly test the relative precision of SNe Ia as standard candles. The two SNe have nearly identical decline rates, negligible reddening, and remarkably similar spectra and, at a distance of $\sim 20$ Mpc, are ideal as potential calibrators for the absolute distance using primary indicators such as Cepheid variables. We discuss to what extent these two SNe can be considered twins and compare them with other supernova "siblings" in the literature and their likely progenitor scenarios.

We explore the evolution of the post-impact remnants using the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that the luminosity and radius of the remnant star dramatically increase just after the impact. After the explosion, post-impact companions continue to expand on a progenitor-dependent timescale of ∼ 10 2.5−3 yr before contracting. It is found that the time evolution of the remnant star is dependent not only on the amount of energy absorbed, but also on the depth of the energy deposition. We examine the viability of the candidate star Tycho G as the possible remnant companion in Tycho's supernova by comparing it to the evolved post-impact remnant stars in our simulations. The closest model in our simulations has a similar effective temperature, but the luminosity and radius are twice as large. By examining the angular momentum distribution in our simulations, we find that the surface rotational speed could drop to ∼ 10 km s −1 if the specific angular momentum is conserved during the post-impact evolution, implying that Tycho G cannot be completely ruled out because of its low surface rotation speed.},

abstract = {Analytic solutions for light curves, effective temperatures, and broad-band colors of Type I supemovae are presented. The method is generalized to include effects of finite (large) initial radius and increasing transparency to y-rays and to thermal photons. A theoretical construct, the "blackbody supernova," is introduced. Many observed features of Type I supemovae are shown to be reproduced by the theory. For a given composition it is shown that the homogeneity of spectral evolution is a necessary consequence of the thermonuclear model but only a possible consequence of the gravita-tional collapse model. Comparison with 1970J and 1972e suggests a variation in explosion energy of a factor of 2, and a corresponding variation in intrinsic luminosity at maximum light; such variation can be identified in a distance-independent way.},

abstract = {Context. Tracing unstable isotopes produced in supernova nucleosynthesis provides a direct diagnostic of supernova explosion physics. Theoretical models predict an extensive variety of scenarios, which can be constrained through observations of the abundant isotopes 56 Ni and 44 Ti. Direct evidence of the latter was previously found only in two core-collapse supernova events, and appears to be absent in thermonuclear supernovae. Aims. We aim to to constrain the supernova progenitor types of Cassiopeia A, SN 1987A, Vela Jr., G1.9+0.3, SN1572, and SN1604 through their 44 Ti ejecta masses and explosion kinematics. Methods. We analyzed INTEGRAL/SPI observations of the candidate sources utilizing an empirically motivated high-precision background model. We analyzed the three dominant spectroscopically resolved de-excitation lines at 68, 78, and 1157 keV emitted in the decay chain of 44 Ti → 44 Sc → 44 Ca. The fluxes allow the determination of the production yields of 44 Ti. Remnant kinematics were obtained from the Doppler characteristics of the lines. Results. We find a significant signal for Cassiopeia A in all three lines with a combined significance of 5.4$\sigma$. The fluxes are (3.3 ± 0.9) × 10 −5 ph cm −2 s −1 , and (4.2 ± 1.0) × 10 −5 ph cm −2 s −1 for the 44 Ti and 44 Sc decay, respectively. This corresponds to a mass of (2.4 ± 0.7) × 10 −4 M and (3.1 ± 0.8) × 10 −4 M , respectively. We obtain higher fluxes for 44 Ti with our analysis of Cassiopeia A than were obtained in previous analyses. We discuss potential differences. We interpret the line width from Doppler broadening as expansion velocity of (6400 ± 1900) km s −1. We do not find any significant signal for any other candidate sources. Conclusions. We obtain a high 44 Ti ejecta mass for Cassiopeia A that is in disagreement with ejecta yields from symmetric 2D models. Upper limits for the other core-collapse supernovae are in agreement with model predictions and previous studies. The upper limits we find for the three thermonuclear supernovae (G1.9+0.3, SN1572 and SN1604) consistently exclude the double detonation and pure helium deflagration models as progenitors.},

abstract = {During the first several days after explosion, Type Ia supernova light curves probe the outer layers of the exploding star, and therefore provide important clues for identifying their progenitors. We investigate how both the shallow 56 Ni distribution and the presence of circumstellar material shape these early light curves. This is performed using a series of numerical experiments with parameterized properties for systematic exploration. Although not all of the considered models may be realized in nature (and indeed there are arguments why some of them should not occur), the spirit of this work is to provide a broader exploration of the diversity of possibilities. We find that shallower 56 Ni leads to steeper, bluer light curves. Differences in the shape of the rise can introduce errors in estimating the explosion time, and thus impact efforts to infer upper limits on the progenitor or companion radius from a lack of observed shock cooling emission. Circumstellar material can lead to significant luminosity during the first few days, but its presence can be difficult to identify depending on the degree of nickel mixing. In some cases, the hot emission of circumstellar material may even lead to a signature similar to an interaction with a companion, and thus in the future additional diagnostics should be gathered for properly assessing early light curves.},

abstract = {The progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not yet fully understood. The two leading progenitor scenarios are the single-degenerate (SD) scenario and the double-degenerate scenario. In the SD scenario, the collision of the SN Ia ejecta with its companion star is expected to produce detectable ultraviolet (UV) emission in the first few days after the SN explosion within certain viewing angles. A strong UV flash has recently been detected in an SN 2002es-like peculiar SN Ia iPTF14atg by Cao et al., which is interpreted as evidence of an early-time UV signature due to SN ejecta interacting with its companion star, supporting the SD scenario. In this paper, we present the expected luminosity distributions of early-time UV emission arising from SN Ia ejecta-companion interaction by performing binary population synthesis calculations for different progenitor systems in the SD scenario. Our theoretical predictions will be helpful for future early-time observations of SNe Ia to constrain their possible progenitors. Assuming the observed strong UV pulse of iPTF14atg was indeed produced by the SN ejecta-companion interaction, our population synthesis model suggests that the progenitor system of iPTF14atg is most likely a red-giant donor binary system, and it is unlikely to have been a main-sequence or helium-star donor system.},

abstract = {We present very early, high-cadence photometric observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2017cbv. The light curve is unique in that it has a blue bump during the first five days of observations in the U, B, and g bands, which is clearly resolved given our photometric cadence of 5.7 hr during that time span. We model the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component. Our best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 solar radii from the exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent. While this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the observed flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not a blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it could point to another physical explanation for the optical blue bump, such as interaction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution. Early optical spectra of SN 2017cbv show strong carbon absorption up through day -13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system contains a significant amount of unburned material. These early results on SN 2017cbv illustrate the power of early discovery and intense follow-up of nearby supernovae to resolve standing questions about the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia.},

@article{Kasen2010,
abstract = {The progenitors of Type Ia and some core collapse supernovae are thought to be stars in binary systems, but little direct observational evidence exists to confirm the hypothesis. We show that the collision of the supernova ejecta with its companion star should produce detectable emission in the hours and days following the explosion. The interaction occurs at distances 10 11-1013 cm and shocks the impacting supernova debris, dissipating kinetic energy and re-heating the gas. Initially, some radiation may escape promptly through the evacuated region of the shadowcone, producing a bright X-ray (0.1-2 keV) burst lasting minutes to hours with luminosity L 1044 ergs s-1. Continuing radiative diffusion from deeper layers of shock-heated ejecta produces a longer lasting optical/UV emission, which exceeds the radioactively powered luminosity of the supernova for the first few days after the explosion. These signatures are prominent for viewing angles looking down upon the shocked region, or about 10% of the time. The properties of the emission provide a straightforward measure of the separation distance between the stars and hence (assuming Roche lobe overflow) the companion's radius. Current optical and UV data sets likely already constrain red giant companions. By systematically acquiring early time data for many supernovae, it may eventually be possible to empirically determine how the parameters of the progenitor system influence the outcome of the explosion. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique probe of their progenitor systems and explosion physics. Here we report the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) discovery of an extraordinarily young SN Ia, iPTF 16abc. By fitting a power law to our early light curve, we infer that first light for the SN, that is when the SN could have first been detected by our survey, occurred only 0.15± 0.15 0.07 days before our first detection. In the ∼24 hr after discovery, iPTF 16abc rose by ∼2 mag, featuring a near-linear rise in flux for 3 days. Early spectra show strong C II absorption, which disappears after ∼7 days. Unlike the extensivelyobserved SN Ia SN 2011fe, the (B − V) 0 colors of iPTF 16abc are blue and nearly constant in the days after explosion. We show that our early observations of iPTF 16abc cannot be explained by either SN shock breakout and the associated, subsequent cooling or the SN ejecta colliding with a stellar companion. Instead, we argue that the early characteristics of iPTF 16abc, including (i) the rapid, near-linear rise, (ii) the nonevolving blue colors, and (iii) the strong C II absorption, are the result of either ejecta interaction with nearby, unbound material or vigorous mixing of radioactive 56 Ni in the SN ejecta, or a combination of the two. In the next few years, dozens of very young normal SNe Ia will be discovered, and observations similar to those presented here will constrain the white dwarf explosion mechanism.},

At this redshift, the energy released during the transient event was 2.8 × 10 46 erg in the 0.3-10 keV energy band (in the source rest frame).

Our observations show that SN 2020bvc shares several properties in common with 2 Ho et al. the Ic-BL SN 2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio light curve is on the faint end of LLGRB-SNe (L radio ≈ 10 37 erg s −1): we model our VLA observations (spanning 13-43 d) as synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic (v 0.3c) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra we detect X-ray emission (L X ≈ 10 41 erg s −1) that is not naturally explained as inverse Compton emission or as part of the same synchrotron spectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence (6×/night) data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) shows a double-peaked optical light curve, the first peak from shock-cooling emission from extended low-mass material (mass M < 10 −2 M at radius R > 10 12 cm) and the second peak from the radioactive decay of 56 Ni. SN 2020bvc is the first confirmed double-peaked Ic-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, and shows X-ray and radio emission similar to LLGRB-SNe: this is consistent with models in which the same mechanism produces both the LLGRB and the shock-cooling emission. For four of the five other nearby (z 0.05) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data, we rule out a first peak like that seen in SN 2006aj and SN 2020bvc, i.e. that lasts ≈ 1 d and reaches a peak luminosity M ≈ −18. X-ray and radio follow-up observations of future such events will establish whether double-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray and radio emission.},

abstract = {The use of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological tools has motivated significant effort to: understand what drives the intrinsic scatter of SN Ia distance modulus residuals after standardization, characterize the distribution of SN Ia colors, and explain why properties of the host galaxies of the SNe correlate with SN Ia distance modulus residuals. We use a compiled sample of ∼ 1450 spectroscopically confirmed, photometric light-curves of SN Ia and propose a solution to these three problems simultaneously that also explains an empirical 11$\sigma$ detection of the dependence of Hubble residual scatter on SN Ia color. We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with extrinsic dust-like colors (E(B − V)) with a wide range of extinction parameter values (R V). This model captures the observed trends of Hubble residual scatter and indicates that the dominant component of SN Ia intrinsic scatter is from variation in R V. We also find that the recovered E(B − V) and R V distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains the observed correlation ($\gamma$) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in past analyses as well as an observed 4.5$\sigma$ dependence of $\gamma$ on SN Ia color. This finding removes any need to prescribe different intrinsic luminosities to different progenitor systems. Finally we measure biases in the equation-of-state of dark energy (w) up to |∆w| = 0.04 by replacing previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.},

They are all consistent with being SN SBOs, but some may be misiden-tified Galactic foreground sources or other extragalactic objects.

However, a few could be SBOs from Wolf-Rayet stars surrounded by dense circumstellar media, whereas two are more naturally explained as SBOs from red supergiants.

abstract = {We report the results from spectroscopic observations of the multiple images of the strongly lensed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), iPTF16geu, obtained with ground based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we can resolve spectra of individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, ∆t = 1.4 ± 5.0 days, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the light-curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the SN Ia host galaxy at z = 0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z = 0.2163. We detect strong Na absorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying "anomalously" large Na column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$ = 129 ± 4 km s −1 , which significantly constrains the lens model. Since the time-delay between the SN images is negligible, we can use unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ∼ 70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal SN Ia, indistinguishable from well-studied ones in the local universe, providing support for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.},

In the scenario of $\Lambda$CDM model, a closed universe is preferred by the Pantheon sample, which is consistent with that from the Planck CMB spectra. However, the uncertainty of Ω k0 from the Pantheon SNe sample is about 8 times larger than that from the Planck data, so the former one supports a closed universe at a much lower CL than that from the latter one. An open unverse is supported by the Pantheon sample at ∼32% and ∼78% CLs, respectively, in the $\omega$CDM and $\omega$ 0 $\omega$ a CDM models. Among these models, the $\phi$CDM model is the one which supports the flat universe most strongly. It shows that Ω k0 is significantly dependent on the adopted model of dark energy, and there is a negative correlation between Ω k0 and the equation of state of DE.},

abstract = {Using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream, we are conducting a large campaign to spectroscop-ically classify all transients occurring in galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) catalog. The aim of the experiment is to construct a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of transients coincident within 100 of CLU galaxies out to 200 Mpc, and to a depth of 20 mag. We describe the survey design and spectroscopic completeness from the first 16 months of operations. We present results from a systematic search for Calcium rich gap transients in the sample of 22 low luminosity (peak absolute magnitude M > −17), hydrogen poor events found in the experiment (out of 754 spectroscopically classified SNe). We report the detection of eight Calcium rich gap transients, and place a lower limit on the volumetric rate of these events to be ≈ 15 ± 5% of the SN Ia rate. Combining this sample with ten events from the literature, we find evidence of a likely continuum of spectroscopic properties ranging from events with SN Ia-like features (Ca-Ia objects) to SN Ib/c-like features (Ca-Ib/c objects) at peak light. Within the Ca-Ib/c events, we find two populations of events distinguished by their red (g − r ≈ 1.5 mag) or green (g − r ≈ 0.5 mag) spectral colors at r-band peak. Red Ca-Ib/c events are characterized by strongly line-blanketed spectra, systematically slower light curves, weaker and slower (by ≈ 3000 km s −1) He lines and lower [Ca II]/[O I] flux ratio (by a factor of ≈ 2) in the nebular phase compared to the green Ca-Ib/c objects. Ca-Ia objects show typically more luminous light curves (M r ≈ −16.9 mag at peak) than Ca-Ib/c objects, strong line blanketing signatures with intermediate red colors (g − r ≈ 1 mag at r-band peak), slow light curves, and weak or no [O I] in the nebular phase. Together, we find that the continuum of spectroscopic properties and the correlations thereof, the volumetric rates and striking old environments of these events are consistent with progenitor channels involving the explosive burning of He shells on low mass white dwarfs over a range of shell and core masses. We posit that the Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects are broadly consistent with scenarios invoking the double detonation of He shells on white dwarfs with high He burning efficiency, while green Ca-Ib/c objects could arise from He shell explosions with lower He burning efficiency such as detonations in lower density He shells or He shell deflagrations.},

abstract = {The nature and role of the binary companion of carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that explode as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not yet fully understood. Past detections of circumstellar material (CSM) that contain hydrogen for a small number of SN Ia progenitor systems suggest that at least some have a nondegenerate companion. In order to constrain the prevalence, location, and quantity of CSM in SN Ia systems, we performed a near-ultraviolet (NUV) survey with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to look for the high-energy signature of SN Ia ejecta interacting with CSM. Our survey revealed that SN 2015cp, a SN 1991T-like overluminous SN Ia, was experiencing late-onset interaction between its ejecta and surrounding CSM at 664 days after its light-curve peak. We present ground-and space-based follow-up observations of SN 2015cp that reveal optical emission lines of H and Ca, typical signatures of ejecta-CSM interaction. We show how SN 2015cp was likely similar to the well-studied SN Ia-CSM event PTF11kx, making it the second case in which an unambiguously classified SN Ia was observed to interact with a distant shell of CSM that contains hydrogen (R CSM 10 16 cm). The remainder of our HST NUV images of SNe Ia were nondetections that we use to constrain the occurrence rate of observable late-onset CSM interaction. We apply theoretical models for the emission from ejecta-CSM interaction to our NUV nondetections, and place upper limits on the mass and radial extent of CSM in SN Ia progenitor systems.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$-ray deposition history in an expanding supernova (SN) ejecta has been mostly used to constrain models for Type Ia SN. Here we expand this methodology to core-collapse SNe, including stripped envelope (SE; Type Ib/Ic/IIb) and Type IIP SNe. We construct bolometric light curve using photometry from the literature and we use the Katz integral to extract the $\gamma$-ray deposition history. We recover the tight range of $\gamma$-ray escape times, t 0 ≈ 30 − 45 day, for Type Ia SNe, and we find a new tight range t 0 ≈ 80 − 140 day, for SE SNe. Type IIP SNe are clearly separated from other SNe types with t 0 400 day, and there is a possible negative correlation between t 0 and the synthesized 56 Ni mass. We find that the typical masses of the synthesized 56 Ni in SE SNe are larger than those in Type IIP SNe, in agreement with the results of Kushnir (2015). This disfavors progenitors with the same initial mass range for these explosions. We recover the observed values of ET, the time-weighted integrated luminosity from cooling emission, for Type IIP, and we find hints of non zero ET values in some SE SNe. We apply a simple $\gamma$-ray radiation transfer code to calculate the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories of models from the literature, and we show that the observed histories are a powerful tool for constraining models.},

abstract = {Some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit blueshifted broad absorption lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display broad emission lines (BELs). Similar phenomenology is observed in quasars and accreting white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as an orientation effect associated with line formation in an accretion disc wind.We propose and explore a similar unification scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc and wind-hosting TDEs, produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. Our models cover a wide range of disc wind geometries and kinematics. Such winds naturally reproduce both BALs and BELs. In general, sight lines looking into the wind cone preferentially produce BALs, while other orientations preferentially produce BELs. We also study the effect of wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances on the observed spectra. Clumpy winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and absorption lines, because clumping increases both the emission measure and the abundances of the relevant ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization state of the outflow. The main effect of adopting CNO-processed abundances is a weakening of C 1550 {\AA} and an enhancement of N 1240 {\AA} in the spectra. We conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative number of BAL and BEL TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the outflow. The models in this work are publicly available online and upon request.},

LSQ13ddu displayed a rapid rise of just 4.8±0.9 d to reach a peak brightness of −19.70±0.02 mag in the LSQgr band. Early spectra of LSQ13ddu showed the presence of weak and narrow He i features arising from interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). These interaction signatures weakened quickly, with broad features consistent with those seen in stripped-envelope SNe becoming dominant around two weeks after maximum. The narrow He i velocities are consistent with the wind velocities of luminous blue variables but its spectra lack the typically seen hydrogen features. The fast and bright early light curve is inconsistent with radioactive 56 Ni powering but can be explained through a combination of CSM interaction and an underlying 56 Ni decay component that dominates the later time behaviour of LSQ13ddu. Based on the strength of the underlying broad features, LSQ13ddu appears deficient in He compared to standard SNe Ib.},

abstract = {The possible detection of a compact object in the remnant of SN 1987A presents an unprecedented opportunity to follow its early evolution. The suspected detection stems from an excess of infrared emission from a dust blob near the compact object's predicted position. The infrared excess could be due to the decay of isotopes like 44 Ti, accretion luminosity from a neutron star or black hole, magnetospheric emission or a wind originating from the spindown of a pulsar, or to thermal emission from an embedded, cooling neutron star (NS 1987A). It is shown that the latter possibility is the most plausible as the other explanations are disfavored by other observations and/or require fine-tuning of parameters. Not only are there indications the dust blob overlaps the predicted location of a kicked compact remnant, but its excess luminosity also matches the expected thermal power of a 30 year old neutron star. Furthermore, models of cooling neutron stars within the Minimal Cooling paradigm readily fit both NS 1987A and Cas A, the next-youngest known neutron star. If correct, NS 1987A likely has a light-element envelope and a relatively small crustal n-1 S 0 superfluid gap. If the locations don't overlap, then pulsar spindown or accretion might be more likely, but the pulsar's period and magnetic field or the accretion rate must be rather finely tuned. In this case, NS 1987A may have enhanced cooling and/or a heavy-element envelope.},

Therefore, any observed sample of massive stars or associated transients is likely to be significantly influenced by the effects of binarity. Here, we focus on the relationship between massive binary evolution and core-collapse supernova events. In the vast majority of the cases, the first core-collapse event happening in a binary system unbinds the two stars. Studying the population of companion stars, either at the supernova site, or as "widowed" stars long after the explosion, can be used to constrain the previous orbital evolution of the binary progenitor, and explosion physics of their former companion. Specifically, the population of "widowed" stars might provide statistical constraints on the typical amplitude of black hole natal kicks without seeing neither the black holes nor the transient possibly associated to their formation. Binarity also has a large impact on the predicted population of supernova sub-types, including hydrogen-rich type II supernovae, with a significant fraction of hydrogen-rich stars at explosions being either merger products or accretors.},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are almost unequivocally associated with very energetic, broad-lined supernovae (SNe) of Type Ic-BL. While the gamma-ray emission is emitted in narrow jets, the SN emits radiation isotropically. Therefore, some SN Ic-BL not associated with GRBs have been hypothesised to arise from events with inner engines such as off-axis GRBs or choked jets. Here we present observations of the nearby (d = 120 Mpc) SN 2020bvc (ASAS-SN 20bs) which provide direct and compelling evidence for this scenario. Swift UVOT observations reveal an early decline (up to two days after explosion) while optical spectra classify it as a SN Ic-BL with very high expansion velocities (≈ 70,000 km/s), similar to that found for the jet-cocoon emission in SN 2017iuk associated with GRB 171205A. Moreover, decaying Swift X-Ray Telescope and CXO X-ray Observatory X-ray emission is detected (from three days and onwards), attributable to an afterglow component. Cocoon and X-ray emission are both signatures of jet-powered GRBs. In the case of SN 2020bvc, we find that the jet is off axis (by ≈23 degrees) as indicated by the lack of early (≈ 1 day) X-ray emission which explains why no coincident GRB was detected promptly or in archival data. Thus, SN 2020bvc is the first orphan GRB detected through its associated SN emission.},

We find a total (SN ejecta + CSM) mass likely exceeding 50 − 100 M , with energy 10 52 erg, consistent with some models of pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) or pulsational PISNe-theoretically-predicted thermonuclear explosions from helium cores > 50 M. Independent of the explosion mechanism, this event demonstrates the existence of extremely energetic stellar explosions, detectable at very high redshifts, and provides insight into dense CSM formation in the most massive stars. SN2016aps (internal designation, PS16aqy) was discovered by the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients [9] on 2016 February 22 UT with an apparent magnitude m = 18.12 ± 0.08 mag in the i band (7545{\AA}7545˚7545{\AA}). We selected this target for spectroscopic follow-up due to its large brightness contrast relative to the previously undetected host galaxy, with m 23.5 mag in Pan-STARRS1 1},

abstract = {Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that occur on the surfaces of white dwarf stars in interacting binary systems1. It has long been thought that the lumi- nosity of classical novae is powered by continued nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf after the initial runaway2. However, recent observations of GeV $\gamma$- rays from classical novae have hinted that shocks internal to the nova ejecta may dominate the nova emission. Shocks have also been suggested to power the luminos- ity of events as diverse as stellar mergers3, supernovae4, and tidal disruption events5, but observational confirmation has been lacking. Here we report simultaneous space- based optical and $\gamma$-ray observations of the 2018 nova V906 Carinae (ASASSN-18fv), revealing a remarkable series of distinct correlated flares in both bands. The optical and $\gamma$-ray flares occur simultaneously, implying a common origin in shocks. During the flares, the nova luminosity doubles, implying that the bulk of the luminosity is shock-powered. Furthermore, we detect concurrent but weak X-ray emission from deeply embedded shocks, confirming that the shock power does not appear in the X- ray band and supporting its emergence at longer wavelengths. Our data, spanning the spectrum from radio to $\gamma$-ray, provide direct evidence that shocks can power sub- stantial},

The large inferred quantity of ejecta is best understood as originating in an outflow from the accretion disk surrounding the newly-formed black hole 6-9 , the same engine that was likely responsible for the GRB jet. Similar accretion flows accompany the collapse of rotating massive stars 10 ('collapsars'), powering the class of long GRBs and their associated supernovae. Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers , the much greater accreted mass in collapsars-and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta-implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe 11 which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical 1},

abstract = {At the age of about 1 year, the spectra of most Type Ia supernovae are dominated by strong forbidden nebular emission lines of Fe II and Fe III. Later observations (at about 2 years) of the nearby SN 2011fe showed an unexpected shift of ionization to Fe I and Fe II. Spectra of the very nearby SN Ia 2014J at an intermediate phase (1-1.5 years) that are presented here show a progressive decline of Fe III emission, while Fe I is not yet strong. The decrease in ionization can be explained if the degree of clumping in the ejecta increases significantly at ∼ 1.5 years, at least in the Fe-dominated zone. Models suggest that clumps remain coherent after about one year, behaving like shrapnel. The high density in the clumps, combined with the decreasing heating rate, would then cause recombination. These data may witness the phase of transition from relatively smooth ejecta to the very clumpy morphology that is typical of SN remnants. The origin of the increased clumping may be the development of local magnetic fields.},

abstract = {We investigate the brightness distribution expected for thermonuclear explosions that might result from the ignition of a detonation during the violent merger of white dwarf (WD) bina-ries. Violent WD mergers are a subclass of the canonical double degenerate scenario where two carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs merge when the larger WD fills its Roche-lobe. Determining their brightness distribution is critical for evaluating whether such an explosion model could be responsible for a significant fraction of the observed population of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We argue that the brightness of an explosion realised via the violent merger model is mainly determined by the mass of 56 Ni produced in the detonation of the primary CO WD. To quantify this link, we use a set of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD detonation models to derive a relationship between primary WD mass (m WD) and expected peak bolometric brightness (M bol). We use this m WD-M bol relationship to convert the masses of merging primary WDs from binary population models to a predicted distribution of explosion brightness. We also investigate the sensitivity of our results to assumptions about the conditions required to realise a detonation during violent mergers of WDs. We find a striking similarity between the shape of our theoretical peak-magnitude distribution and that observed for SNe Ia: our model produces a M bol distribution that roughly covers the range and matches the shape of the one observed for SNe Ia. However, this agreement hinges on a particular phase of mass accretion during binary evolution: the primary WD gains ∼0.15 − 0.35 M ⊙ from a slightly-evolved helium star companion. In our standard binary evolution model, such an accretion phase is predicted to occur for about 43% of all binary systems that ultimately give rise to binary CO WD mergers. We also find that with high probability, violent WD mergers involving the most massive primaries (∼ > 1.3M ⊙ , which should produce bright SNe) have delay times ∼ <500 Myr.},

abstract = {Explaining the observed diversity of supernovae (SNe) and the physics of explosion requires knowledge of their progenitor stars, which can be obtained by constraining the circumstellar medium (CSM). Models of the SN ejecta colliding with CSM are necessary to infer the structure of the CSM and tie it back to a progenitor model. Recent SNe I revealed CSM concentrated at a distance r ∼ 10 16 cm, for which models of SN interaction are extremely limited. In this paper, we assume the concentrated region is a "wall" representing swept-up material, and unswept material lies outside the wall. We simulate one-dimensional hydrodynamics of SNe Ia & Ib impacting 300 unique CSM configurations using RT1D, which captures the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We find that the density ratio between the wall and ejecta-denoted A 0 or "wall height"-is key, and higher walls deviate more from self-similar evolution. Functional fits accounting for A 0 are presented for the forward shock radius evolution. We show that higher walls have more degeneracy between CSM properties in the deceleration parameter, slower shocks, deeper-probing reverse shocks, slower shocked ejecta, less ejecta mass than CSM in the shock, and more mixing of ejecta into the CSM at early times. We analyze observations of SN 2014C (Type Ib) and suggest that it had a moderately high wall (10 A 0 200) and wind-like outer CSM. We also postulate an alternate interpretation for the radio data of SN 2014C, that the radio rise occurs in the wind rather than the wall. Finally, we find that hydrodynamic measurements at very late times cannot distinguish the presence of a wall, except perhaps as an anomalously wide shock region.},

abstract = {The single-degenerate scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) should yield metal-rich ejecta that enclose some stripped material from the non-degenerate H-rich companion star. We present a large grid of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium steady-state radiative transfer calculations for such hybrid ejecta and provide analytical fits for the H$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width. Our set of models covers a range of masses for 56 Ni and the ejecta, for the stripped material (M st), and post-explosion epochs from 100 to 300 d. The brightness contrast between stripped material and metal-rich ejecta challenges the detection of H i and He i lines prior to ∼ 100 d. Intrinsic and extrinsic optical depth effects also influence the radiation emanating from the stripped material. This inner denser region is marginally thick in the continuum and optically thick in all Balmer lines. The overlying metal-rich ejecta blanket the inner regions, completely below about 5000 {\AA}, and more sparsely at longer wavelengths. As a consequence, H$\beta$ should not be observed for all values of M st through at least 300 days, while H$\alpha$ should be observed after ∼ 100 d for all M st ≥ 0.01 M. Observational non-detections capable of limiting the H$\alpha$ equivalent width to < 1 {\AA} set a formal upper limit of M st < 0.001 M. This contrasts with the case of circumstellar (CSM) interaction, not subject to external blanketing, which should produce H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines with a strength dependent primarily on CSM density. We confirm previous analyses that suggest low values of order 0.001 M for M st to explain the observations of the two SNe Ia with nebular-phase H$\alpha$ detection, in conflict with the much greater stripped mass predicted by hydrodynamical simulations for the single-degenerate scenario. A more likely solution is the double-degenerate scenario, together with CSM interaction, or enclosed material from a tertiary star in a triple system or from a giant planet.},

abstract = {The majority of thermonuclear explosions in the Universe seem to proceed in a rather standardised way, as explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs in binary systems, leading to 'normal' Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, over the years a number of objects have been found which deviate from normal SNe Ia in their observational properties, and which require different and not seldom more extreme progenitor systems. While the 'traditional' classes of peculiar SNe Ia-luminous '91T-like' and faint '91bg-like' objects-have been known since the early 1990s, other classes of even more unusual transients have only been established 20 years later, fostered by the advent of new wide-field SN surveys such as the Palomar Transient Factory. These include the faint but slowly declining '02es-like' SNe, 'Ca-rich' transients residing in the luminosity gap between classical novae and supernovae, extremely short-lived, fast-declining transients, and the very luminous so-called 'super-Chandrasekhar' SNe Ia. Not all of them are necessarily thermonuclear explosions, but there are good arguments in favour of a thermonuclear origin for most of them. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the zoo of potentially thermonuclear transients, reviewing their observational characteristics and discussing possible explosion scenarios.},

Despite PS15br peak luminosity is fainter than the other two objects, the spectrophotometric evolution is similar to SN2013hx and different than any other supernova in a similar luminosity space. We group all of them as SLSNe II and hence distinct from the known class of SLSN IIn. Both transients show a strong, multi-component H$\alpha$ emission after 200 days past maximum which we interpret as an indication of interaction of the ejecta with an asymmetric, clumpy circumstellar material. The spectra and photometric evolution of the two objects are similar to type II super-novae, although they have much higher luminosity and evolve on slower timescales. This is qualitatively similar to how SLSNe I compare with normal type Ic in that the former are brighter and evolve more slowly. We apply a magnetar and an interaction semi-analytical codes to fit the light curves of our two objects and SN2008es. The overall observational dataset would tend to favour the magnetar, or central engine, model as the source of the peak luminosity although the clear signature of late-time interaction indicates that interaction can play a role in the luminosity evolution of SLSNe II at some phases.},

Our analysis is performed comparing SN II spectral and photometric parameters and estimating the influence of metallicity (inferred from host luminosity differences) on SN II transient properties. We measure the SN absolute magnitude at maximum, the light-curve plateau duration, the optically thick duration, and the plateau decline rate in the V −band, together with expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent-widths (pEWs) of several absorption lines in the SN spectra. For the SN host galaxies, we estimate the absolute magnitude and the stellar mass, a proxy for the metallicity of the host galaxy. SNe II exploding in low luminosity galaxies display weaker pEWs of Fe ii $\lambda$5018, confirming the theoretical prediction that metal lines in SN II spectra should correlate with metallicity. We also find that SNe II in low-luminosity hosts have generally slower declining light curves and display weaker absorption lines. We find no relationship between the plateau duration or the expansion velocities with SN environment, suggesting that the hydrogen envelope mass and the explosion energy are not correlated with the metallicity of the host galaxy. This result supports recent predictions that mass-loss for red supergiants is independent of metallicity.},

SN 2015F is a slightly sub-luminous SN Ia with a decline rate of ∆m 15 (B) = 1.35 ± 0.03 mag, placing it in the region between normal and SN 1991bg-like events. Our densely-sampled photometric data place tight constraints on the epoch of first light and form of the early-time light curve. The spectra exhibit photospheric C ii $\lambda$6580 absorption until −4 days, and high-velocity Ca ii is particularly strong at < −10 days at expansion velocities of ≃23000 km s −1. At early times, our spectral modelling with syn++ shows strong evidence for iron-peak elements (Fe ii, Cr ii, Ti ii, and V ii) expanding at velocities > 14000 km s −1 , suggesting mixing in the outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Although unusual in SN Ia spectra, including V ii in the modelling significantly improves the spectral fits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature at ∼6800 {\AA} that persists until maximum light. Our favoured explanation for this line is photospheric Al ii, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although detached high-velocity C ii material could also be responsible. In both cases the absorbing material seems to be confined to a relatively narrow region in velocity space. The nucleosynthesis of detectable amounts of Al ii would argue against a low-metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800 {\AA} feature is weakly present in other normal SN Ia events, and common in the SN 1991bg-like sub-class.},

An observational test of this assumption is suggested here, based upon the likelihood that SN atmospheres are scattering dominated and the fact that light from an unresolved, asymmetric, scattering atmosphere is linearly polarized. We have calculated the linear polarization of SN light which a nonspherical, scattering-dominated, SN atmosphere would produce as a function of its asphericity. The effect of asphericity on the inferred total luminosity of the SN has been calculated as well. We have considered Thomson scattering, resonance scattering, and a mixture of scattering and absorption. The last of these cases can yield a significantly higher degree of polarization than that expected from the classical, pure scattering atmosphere. The effects of interstellar matter on the observed SN polarization have been included. Interstellar dust not only changes the observed linear polarization but converts hnearly polarized light into circularly polarized light as well, as a result of its linear birefringence. Existing, preliminary observations of supernova polarization are reviewed in the light of these results. Suggestions are made for future observation.},

abstract = {While many studies have shown a correlation between properties of the light curves of Type Ia SN (SNe Ia) and properties of their host galaxies, it remains unclear what is driving these correlations. We introduce a new direct method to study these correlations by analyzing `parent' galaxies that host multiple SNe Ia 'siblings'. Here, we search the Dark Energy Survey SN sample, one of the largest samples of discovered SNe, and find 8 galaxies that hosted two likely Type Ia SNe. Comparing the light-curve properties of these SNe and recovered distances from the light curves, we find no better agreement between properties of SNe in the same galaxy as any random pair of galaxies, with the exception of the SN light-curve stretch. We show at $2.8\sigma$ significance that at least 1/2 of the intrinsic scatter of SNe Ia distance modulus residuals is not from common host properties. We also discuss the robustness with which we could make this evaluation with LSST, which will find $100\times$ more pairs of galaxies, and pave a new line of study on the consistency of Type Ia supernovae in the same parent galaxies. Finally, we argue that it is unlikely some of these SNe are actually single, lensed SN with multiple images.},

We apply this framework to specific examples of tidal disruption events and the formation of a black hole by a massive star, as well as discuss other applications such as deriving observables from detailed hydrodynamic simulations.

SALT2X separates the light-curve-shape parameter x1 into an x1r and x1f for the rise and fall portions of the light curve. Using the Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA) SN sample, we assess the importance of the rising and falling portions of the light curve for cosmological standardization using a modified version of the Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type Ia cosmologY (UNITY) framework. We find strong evidence that x1r has a stronger correlation with peak magnitude than x1f. We see evidence that standardizing on the rise affects the color standardization relation, and reduces the size of the host-galaxy standardization and the unexplained ("intrinsic") luminosity dispersion. Since SNe Ia generally rise more quickly than they decline, a faster observing cadence in future surveys will be necessary to maximize the gain from this work, and to continue to explore the impacts of decoupling the rising and falling portions of SN Ia light curves.},

abstract = { Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are manifestations of stars that are deficient in hydrogen and helium, and disrupt in a thermonuclear runaway. While explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are thought to account for the majority of events, part of the observed diversity may be due to varied progenitor channels. We demonstrate that helium stars with masses between ∼1.8 and 2.5 M ⊙ may evolve into highly degenerate cores with near-Chandrasekhar mass and helium-free envelopes that subsequently ignite carbon and oxygen explosively at densities of ∼(1.8−5.9) × 10 9 g cm −3 . This occurs either due to core growth from shell burning (when the core has a hybrid CO/NeO composition), or following ignition of residual carbon triggered by exothermic electron captures on 24 Mg (for a NeOMg-dominated composition). We argue that the resulting thermonuclear runaway is likely to prevent core collapse, leading to the complete disruption of the star. The available nuclear energy at the onset of explosive oxygen burning suffices to create ejecta with a kinetic energy of ∼10 51 erg, as in typical SNe Ia. Conversely, if these runaways result in partial disruptions, the corresponding transients would resemble SN Iax events similar to SN 2002cx. If helium stars in this mass range indeed explode as SNe Ia, then the frequency of events would be comparable to the observed SN Ib/c rates, thereby sufficing to account for the majority of SNe Ia in star-forming galaxies. },

This event has a number of features in common with the groundbreaking transient AT2018cow: blue colors at peak ($g-r\approx-0.5$), a short rise time from half-max of under two days, a decay time of only three days, a high optical luminosity ($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx-20.8$), a hot ($\gtrsim 40,000\,$K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart ($\nu L_\nu \gtrsim 10^{40}\,$erg sec$^{-1}$ at 10 GHz). The radio luminosity of ZTF18abvkwla exceeds that of AT2018cow by an order of magnitude, and the late-time ($\Delta t\gtrsim80\,$days) light curve resembles that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy ($M\approx5\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$, $\mathrm{SFR}\approx7\,M_\odot\,$year$^{-1}$) that is moderately metal-enriched ($\log\mathrm{[O/H]} \approx 8.5$), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving collimated ejecta and the optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material ($<0.07\,M_\odot$ in $\sim 10^{15}\,$cm). Compiling transients in the literature with $t_\mathrm{rise} <5\,$days and $M_\mathrm{peak}<-20$, we find that a significant number are engine-powered,and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.},

To this end, we present a Monte Carlo code designed to model the light curves of radioactively driven, hydrogen-free transients from explosion to approximately maximum light. In this initial study, we have used a parametrised description of the ejecta in SNe Ia, and performed a parameter study of the effects of the 56Ni distribution on the observed colours and light curves for a fixed 56Ni mass of 0.6 M{\textperiodcentered}. For a given density profile, we find that models with 56Ni extending throughout the entirety of the ejecta are typically brighter and bluer shortly after explosion. Additionally, the shape of the density profile itself also plays an important role in determining the shape, rise time, and colours of observed light curves. We find that the multi-band light curves of at least one SNe Ia (SN 2009ig) are inconsistent with less extended 56Ni distributions, but show good agreement with models that incorporate 56Ni throughout the entire ejecta. We further demonstrate that comparisons with full UV OIR colour light curves are powerful tools in discriminating various 56Ni distributions, and hence explosion models.},

abstract = {Sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs accreting a helium shell on a carbon-oxygen core are potential progenitors of normal Type Ia supernovae. This work focuses on the details of the onset of the carbon detonation in the double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar model. In order to simulate the influence of core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its detonation are followed with an increased resolution compared to the rest of the star treating the propagation of the detonation wave more accurately. This significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields from the helium burning. The simulations were carried out with the AREPO code. A carbon-oxygen core with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped to three dimensions. We ensured the stability of the white dwarf with a relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started. Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS. An ignition mechanism of the carbon detonation was observed, which received little attention before. In this "scissors mechanism", the impact the helium detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite to its ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible in a carbon enriched transition region between the core and shell. The detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive to details of the core-shell transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell mixing taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition mechanism differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the synthetic observables are not significant. Though they do not fit observations better than previous simulations, they illustrate the need for multi-dimensional simulations.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown how the distribution of 56 Ni within the ejected material of type Ia supernovae can have profound consequences on the observed light curves. Observations at early times can therefore provide important details on the explosion physics in thermonuclear supernovae, which are poorly constrained. To this end, we present a series of radiative transfer calculations that explore variations in the 56 Ni distribution. Our models also show the importance of the density profile in shaping the light curve, which is often neglected in the literature. Using our model set, we investigate the observations that are necessary to determine the 56 Ni distribution as robustly as possible within the current model set. We find that this includes observations beginning at least ∼14 days before B -band maximum, extending to approximately maximum light with a relatively high (≲3 day) cadence, and in at least one blue and one red band (such as B and R , or g and r ) are required. We compare a number of well-observed type Ia supernovae that meet these criteria to our models and find that the light curves of ∼70–80% of objects in our sample are consistent with being produced solely by variations in the 56 Ni distributions. The remaining supernovae show an excess of flux at early times, indicating missing physics that is not accounted for within our model set, such as an interaction or the presence of short-lived radioactive isotopes. Comparing our model light curves and spectra to observations and delayed detonation models demonstrates that while a somewhat extended 56 Ni distribution is necessary to reproduce the observed light curve shape, this does not negatively affect the spectra at maximum light. Investigating current explosion models shows that observations typically require a shallower decrease in the 56 Ni mass towards the outer ejecta than is produced for models of a given 56 Ni mass. Future models that test differences in the explosion physics and detonation criteria should be explored to determine the conditions necessary to reproduce the 56 Ni distributions found here.},

In this article, we report early-phase observations of seven photometrically normal SNe Ia (six early detections and one deep non-detection limit) at the COSMOS field through a half-year transient survey as a part of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP). In particular, a blue light-curve excess was discovered for HSC17bmhk, a normal SN Ia with rise time longer than 18.8 days, during the first four days after the discovery. The blue early excess in optical wavelength can be explained not only by interactions with a non-degenerate companion or surrounding dense circumstellar matter but also radiation powered by radioactive decays of $^{56}$Ni at the surface of the SN ejecta. Given the growing evidence of the early-excess discoveries in normal SNe Ia that have longer rise times than the average and a similarity in the nature of the blue excess to a luminous SN Ia subclass, we infer that early excess discovered in HSC17bmhk and other normal SNe Ia are most likely attributed to radioactive $^{56}$Ni decay at the surface of the SN ejecta. In order to successfully identify normal SNe Ia with early excess similar to that of HSC17bmhk, early UV photometries or high-cadence blue-band surveys are necessary.},

abstract = {We present the complete set of ultra-violet, optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy for SN 2012ca, covering the period from 6 d prior to maximum light, until 531 d after maximum. The spectroscopic time series for SN 2012ca is essentially unchanged over 1.5 yr, and appear to be dominated at all epochs by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) rather than the underlying supernova (SN). SN 2012ca is a member of the set of type of the ambiguous IIn/Ia-CSM SNe, the nature of which have been debated extensively in the literature. The two leading scenarios are either a Type Ia SN exploding within a dense CSM from a non-degenerate, evolved companion, or a core-collapse SN from a massive star. While some members of the population have been unequivocally associated with Type Ia SNe, in other cases the association is less certain. While it is possible that SN 2012ca does arise from a thermonuclear SN, this would require a relatively high (between 20 and 70 per cent) efficiency in converting kinetic energy to optical luminosity, and a massive ($\sim$2.3-2.6 M⊙) circumstellar medium. On the basis of energetics, and the results of simple modelling, we suggest that SN 2012ca is more likely associated with a core-collapse SN. This would imply that the observed set of similar SNe to SN 2012ca is in fact originated by two populations, and while these are drawn from physically distinct channels, they can have observationally similar properties.},

In this paper, we present high-quality light curves of 127 SNe Ia discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in 2018. We describe our method to perform forced point-spread function photometry, which can be applied to other types of extragalactic transients. With a planned cadence of six observations per night (three g + three r ), all of the 127 SNe Ia are detected in both g and r bands more than 10 days (in the rest frame) prior to the epoch of g -band maximum light. The redshifts of these objects range from z = 0.0181 to 0.165; the median redshift is 0.074. Among the 127 SNe, 50 are detected at least 14 days prior to maximum light (in the rest frame), with a subset of nine objects being detected more than 17 days before g -band peak. This is the largest sample of young SNe Ia collected to date; it can be used to study the shape and color evolution of the rising light curves in unprecedented detail. We discuss six peculiar events in this sample: one 02cx-like event ZTF18abclfee (SN 2018crl), one Ia-CSM SN ZTF18aaykjei (SN 2018cxk), and four objects with possible super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors: ZTF18abhpgje (SN 2018eul), ZTF18abdpvnd (SN 2018dvf), ZTF18aawpcel (SN 2018cir), and ZTF18abddmrf (SN 2018dsx).},

abstract = {We propose a wind-driven model for peculiar transients, and apply the model to AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. In the wind-driven model, we assume that a continuous outflow like a stellar wind is injected from a central system. While these transients have different observational properties, this unified model can explain their photometric properties which are not reproduced by a supernova-like instantaneous explosion. Furthermore, the model predicts characteristic spectral features and evolution, which are well in line with those of AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. Despite the different observational properties, the wind model shows that they have some common features; the large mass-loss rates (up to $\sim 20M_{\odot}{\rm \simyr^{-1}}$ for AT2018cow and $\sim 30M_{\odot}{\rm \simyr^{-1}}$ for iPTF14hls), the characteristic radii of $\sim 10^{13}{\rm \simcm}$ for the launch of the wind, and the kinetic energies of $\sim 10^{51}{\rm \simerg}$. It would indicate that both may be related to events involving a red super giant (RSG), in which the RSG envelope is rapidly ejected by an event at a stellar core scale. On the other hand, the main differences are time scales and the total ejected mass. We then suggests that iPTF14hls may represent a dynamical common-envelope evolution induced by massive binary systems ($\sim 50M_{\odot}$ each). AT2018cow may be either a tidal disruption event of a low-mass RSG by a black hole (BH), or a BH-forming failed supernova.},

abstract = {The merging of double white-dwarfs (WDs) may produce the events of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) and form single neutron stars (NSs). Meanwhile , it is also notable that the recently proposed WD+He subgiant scenario has a significant contribution to the production of massive double WDs, in which the primary WD grows in mass by accreting He-rich material from a He subgiant companion. In this work, we aim to study the binary population synthesis (BPS) properties of AIC events from the double WD mergers by considering the classical scenarios and also the contribution of the WD+He subgiant scenario to the formation of double WDs. Firstly, we provided a dense and large model grid of WD+He star systems for producing AIC events through the double WD merger scenario. Secondly, we performed several sets of BPS calculations to obtain the rates and single NS number in our Galaxy. We found that the rates of AIC events from the double WD mergers in the Galaxy are in the range of 1.4−8.9×10 −3 yr −1 for all ONe/CO WD+ONe/CO WD mergers, and in the range of 0.3−3.8 × 10 −3 yr −1 when double CO WD mergers are not considered. We also found that the number of single NSs from AIC events in our Galaxy are in the range of 0.1−5.9 × 10 6. The chirp mass of double WDs for producing AIC events distribute in the range of 0.55−1.25 M ⊙. We estimated that more than half of double WDs for producing AIC events are capable to be observed by the future space-based gravitational wave detectors.},

This is the first spectropolarimetric observation for SLSNe at late phases. We find that the degree of the polarization in the late phase significantly changes from that measured at the earlier phase. The spectrum at the late phase shows a strong Ca emission line and therefore we reliably estimate the interstellar polarization component assuming that the emission line is intrinsically unpolarized. By subtracting the estimated interstellar polarization, we find that the intrinsic polarization at the early phase is only ∼ 0.2 %, which indicates an almost spherical photosphere, with an axial ratio ∼ 1.05. The intrinsic polarization at the late phase increases to ∼ 0.8 %, which corresponds to the photosphere with an axial ratio ∼ 1.2. A nearly constant position angle of the polarization suggests the inner ejecta are almost axisymmetric. By these observations, we conclude that the inner ejecta are more aspherical than the outer ejecta. This may suggest the presence of a central energy source producing aspherical inner ejecta.},

abstract = {Neutrino-driven convection plays a crucial role in the development of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. However, the complex mechanism that triggers the shock revival and the subsequent explosion has remained inscrutable for many decades. Multidimensional simulations suggest that the growth of fluid instabilities and the development of turbulent convection will determine the morphology of the explosion. We have performed 3D simulations using spherical-polar coordinates covering a reduced angular extent (90 • computational domain), and with angular resolutions of 2 • , 1 • , 1/2 • , and 1/4 • , to study the development of turbulence in core-collapse supernova explosions on a time scale of order 100 ms. We have employed the multi-physics Chimera code that includes detailed nuclear physics and spectral neutrino transport. Coarse resolution models do not develop an inertial range, presumably due to the bottleneck effect, such that the energy is prevented from cascading down to small scales and tends to accumulate at large scales. High-resolution models instead, start to recover the k −5/3 scaling 2 Jordi Casanova et al. of Kolmogorov's theory. Stochasticity and few simulation samples limit our ability to predict the development of explosions. Over the simulated time period, our models show no clear trend in improving (or diminishing) conditions for explosion as the angular resolution is increased. However, we find that turbulence provides an effective pressure behind the shock (∼40-50% of the thermal pressure), which can contribute to the shock revival and be conducive for the development of the explosion. Finally, we show that the turbulent energy power spectrum of reduced angular extent and full 4$\pi$ models are consistent, thus indicating that a 90 • computational domain is an adequate configuration to study the character of turbulence in CCSNe.},

abstract = {We explore the potential of current and future liquid scintillator neutrino detectors of O(10) kt mass to localize a pre-supernova neutrino signal in the sky. In the hours preceding the core collapse of a nearby star (at distance D 1 kpc), tens to hundreds of inverse beta decay events will be recorded, and their reconstructed topology in the detector can be used to estimate the direction to the star. Although the directionality of inverse beta decay is weak (∼ 8% forward-backward asymmetry for currently available liquid scintillators), we find that for a fiducial signal of 200 events (which is realistic for Betelgeuse), a positional error of ∼ 60 • can be achieved, resulting in the possibility to narrow the list of potential stellar candidates to less than ten, typically. For a configuration with improved forward-backward asymmetry (∼ 40%, as expected for a lithium-loaded liquid scintillator), the angular sensitivity improves to ∼ 15 • , and-when a distance upper limit is obtained from the overall event rate-it is in principle possible to uniquely identify the progenitor star. Any localization information accompanying an early supernova alert will be useful to multi-messenger observations and to particle physics tests using collapsing stars.},

Systems will be identified 11.7 +29.8 −9.3 days before the final explosion. We then explore the possibility of constraining progenitor models with early phase observations for Type IIP and Type Ia SNe in LSST discovered systems. Using a simulated Type IIP explosion, we predict that the shock breakout in one trailing image per year will peak at 24.1 mag (23.3) in the B-band (F218W), however evolving over a timescale of ∼ 30 minutes. Using an analytic model of Type Ia companion interaction, we find that in the B-band we should observe at least one shock cooling emission event per year that peaks at 26.3 mag (29.6) assuming all Type Ia gLSNe have a 1 M red giant (main sequence) companion. We perform Bayesian analysis to investigate how well deep observations with 1 hour exposures on the European Extremely Large Telescope would discriminate between Type Ia progenitor populations. We find that if all Type Ia SNe evolved from the double-degenerate channel, then observations of the lack of early blue flux in 10 (50) trailing images would rule out more than 27% (19%) of the population having 1 M main sequence companions at 95% confidence.},

Here, we present optical and UV data and analysis of iPTF16asu, a luminous, rapidly-evolving, high velocity, stripped-envelope supernova. With a rest-frame rise-time of just 4 days and a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{\rm g}=-20.4$ mag, the light curve of iPTF16asu is faster and more luminous than previous rapid transients. The spectra of iPTF16asu show a featureless, blue continuum near peak that develops into a Type Ic-BL spectrum on the decline. We show that while the late-time light curve could plausibly be powered by $^{56}$Ni decay, the early emission requires a different energy source. Non-detections in the X-ray and radio strongly constrain any associated gamma-ray burst to be low-luminosity. We suggest that the early emission may have been powered by either a rapidly spinning-down magnetar, or by shock breakout in an extended envelope of a very energetic explosion. In either scenario a central engine is required, making iPTF16asu an intriguing transition object between superluminous supernovae, Type Ic-BL supernovae, and low-energy gamma-ray bursts.},

No radio emission is detected, constraining the 8.5 GHz luminosities of SN\,1972E and SN\,1895B to be L$_{\nu,8.5\rm{GHz}}$ $<$ 6.0 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ 45 years post-explosion and L$_{\nu,8.5\rm{GHz}}$ $<$ 8.9 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ 121 years post-explosion, respectively. These limits imply a clean circumstellar medium (CSM), with $n$ $<$ 0.9 cm$^{-3}$ out to radii of a few $\times$ 10$^{18}$ cm, if the SN blastwave is expanding into uniform density material. Due to the extensive time coverage of our observations, we also constrain the presence of CSM shells surrounding the progenitor of SN\,1972E. We rule out essentially all medium and thick shells with masses of 0.05$-$0.3 M$_\odot$ at radii between $\sim$10$^{17}$ and 10$^{18}$ cm, and thin shells at specific radii with masses down to $\lesssim$0.01 M$_\odot$. These constraints rule out swaths of parameter space for a range of single and double degenerate progenitor scenarios, including recurrent nova, core-degenerate objects, ultra-prompt explosions and white dwarf (WD) mergers with delays of a few hundred years between the onset of merger and explosion. Allowed progenitors include WD-WD systems with a significant ($>$ 10$^{4}$ years) delay from the last episode of common envelope evolution and single degenerate systems undergoing recurrent nova, provided that the recurrence timescale i short and the system has been in the nova phase for $\gtrsim$10$^{4}$ yr, such that a large ($>$ 10$^{18}$ cm) cavity has been evacuated.

abstract = {(ABRIDGED) We show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are formed within both very young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on the stellar mass and mean star-formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies. Models where the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are ruled out with 99% confidence. Our analysis is based on 100 spectroscopically-confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events, all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0.2<z<0.75. Using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia host galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions with the galaxy spectral synthesis code, PEGASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the specific SFR of the parent galaxies -- more vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later-type galaxies seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple "two-component" model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of the host systems. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally. Passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially host faster-declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are only found in systems with ongoing star-formation. We model the light-curve width distribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and an old component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {We present late-time multi-wavelength observations of Swift J1644+57, suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (TDF). Our observations extend to >4 years from discovery, and show that 1.4 years after outburst the relativistic jet switched-off on a timescale less than tens of days, corresponding to a power-law decay faster than $t^{-70}$. Beyond this point weak X-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of $L_X \sim 5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and are marginally inconsistent with a continuing decay of $t^{-5/3}$, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off. Host photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of $M_{BH}=3 \times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, consistent with the late time X-ray luminosity arising from sub-Eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusually optically faint AGN or a slowly varying phase of the transient. Optical/IR observations show a clear bump in the light curve at timescales of 30-50 days, with a peak magnitude (corrected for host galaxy extinction) of $M_R \sim -22-23$. The luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other, non-relativistic TDFs and does not match any re-brightening seen at X-ray or radio wavelengths. Its luminosity, light curve shape and spectrum are broadly similar to those seen in superluminous SNe, although subject to large uncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction.

abstract = {Early-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are essential to constrain their progenitor properties. In this paper, we present high-quality light curves of 127 SNe Ia discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in 2018. We describe our method to perform forced point spread function (PSF) photometry, which can be applied to other types of extragalactic transients. With a planned cadence of six observations per night ($3g+3r$), all of the 127 SNe Ia are detected in both $g$ and $r$ band more than 10\,d (in the rest frame) prior to the epoch of $g$-band maximum light. The redshifts of these objects range from $z=0.0181$ to 0.165; the median redshift is 0.074. Among the 127 SNe, 50 are detected at least 14\,d prior to maximum light (in the rest frame), with a subset of 9 objects being detected more than 17\,d before $g$-band peak. This is the largest sample of young SNe Ia collected to date; it can be used to study the shape and color evolution of the rising light curves in unprecedented detail. We discuss six peculiar events in this sample, including one 02cx-like event ZTF18abclfee (SN\,2018crl), one Ia-CSM SN ZTF18aaykjei (SN\,2018cxk), and four objects with possible super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors: ZTF18abhpgje (SN\,2018eul), ZTF18abdpvnd (SN\,2018dvf), ZTF18aawpcel (SN\,2018cir) and ZTF18abddmrf (SN\,2018dsx).},

abstract = {Host galaxy identification is a crucial step for modern supernova (SN) surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will discover SNe by the thousands. Spectroscopic resources are limited, so in the absence of real-time SN spectra these surveys must rely on host galaxy spectra to obtain accurate redshifts for the Hubble diagram and to improve photometric classification of SNe. In addition, SN luminosities are known to correlate with host-galaxy properties. Therefore, reliable identification of host galaxies is essential for cosmology and SN science. We simulate SN events and their locations within their host galaxies to develop and test methods for matching SNe to their hosts. We use both real and simulated galaxy catalog data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys General Catalog and MICECATv2.0, respectively. We also incorporate "hostless" SNe residing in undetected faint hosts into our analysis, with an assumed hostless rate of 5%. Our fully automated algorithm is run on catalog data and matches SNe to their hosts with 91% accuracy. We find that including a machine learning component, run after the initial matching algorithm, improves the accuracy (purity) of the matching to 97% with a 2% cost in efficiency (true positive rate). Although the exact results are dependent on the details of the survey and the galaxy catalogs used, the method of identifying host galaxies we outline here can be applied to any transient survey.},

abstract = {Active galactic nuclei are supermassive black holes surrounded by an accretion disk, two populations of clouds, bipolar jets, and a dusty torus. The clouds move in Keplerian orbits at high velocities. In particular, the broad-line region (BLR) clouds have velocities ranging from $1000$ to $10000$ km s$^{-1}$. Given the extreme proximity of these clouds to the supermassive black hole, frequent collisions with the accretion disk should occur. The impact of BLR clouds onto the accretion disk can produce strong shock waves where particles might be accelerated. The goal of this work is to investigate the production of relativistic particles, and the associated non-thermal radiation in these events. In particular, we apply the model we develop to the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. We analyze the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration in the shock of colliding clouds of the BLR with the accretion disk. We calculate the spectral energy distribution of photons generated by the relativistic particles and estimate the number of simultaneous impacts needed to explain the gamma radiation observed by the Fermi satellite in Seyfert galaxies. We find that is possible to understand the measured gamma emission in terms of the interaction of clouds with the disk if the hard X-ray emission of the source is at least obscured between $20\%$ and $40\%$. The total number of clouds contained in the BLR region might be between $3\times10^{8}$ and $6\times10^{8}$, which are values in good agreement with the observational evidence. The maximum energy achieved by the protons ($\sim$ PeV) in this context allows the production of neutrinos in the observing range of IceCube.},

abstract = {Helium that accretes onto a Carbon/Oxygen white dwarf in the double white dwarf AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) binaries undergoes unstable thermonuclear flashes when the orbital period is in the 3.5-25 minute range. At the shortest orbital periods (and highest accretion rates, Mdot > 10^-7 Msol/yr), the flashes are weak and likely lead to the Helium equivalent of classical nova outbursts. However, as the orbit widens and Mdot drops, the mass required for the unstable ignition increases, leading to progressively more violent flashes up to a final flash with Helium shell mass $\sim$ 0.02-0.1 Msol. The high pressures of these last flashes allow the burning to produce the radioactive elements 48Cr, 52Fe, and 56Ni that power a faint (M_V in the range of -15 to -18) and rapidly rising (few days) thermonuclear supernova. Current galactic AM CVn space densities imply one such explosion every 5,000-15,000 years in 10^11 Msol of old stars ($\sim$ 2-6% of the Type Ia rate in E/SO galaxies). These ".Ia" supernovae (one-tenth as bright for one-tenth the time as a Type Ia supernovae) are excellent targets for deep (e.g. V=24) searches with nightly cadences, potentially yielding an all-sky rate of 1,000 per year.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the outcome of supernovae (SNe, either core collapse or thermonuclear). The remnant results from the interaction between the stellar ejecta and the ambient medium around the progenitor star. Young SNRs are characterized by strong shocks that heat and ionize the gas, generate magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, and accelerate particles to relativistic energies. They radiate at all wavelengths, especially in the X-ray domain, where spectro-imaging observations can provide a wealth of information. This paper presents recent progress in the modeling of SNRs, particularly by means of numerical simulations, and with a focus on three-dimensional aspects. In the first part we will consider SNRs as producers of cosmic rays (CRs). If SNRs are accelerators efficient enough to power the Galactic component of CRs, this must have a visible impact on their dynamics and, therefore, on the thermal emission from the plasma, as well as on their non-thermal emission. In the second part we will consider SNRs as probes of the explosion mechanism. The time has come to connect multidimensional simulations of SNe and simulations of SNRs, opening the possibility to study the explosion mechanism via the dynamics and morphology of SNRs.},

abstract = {We present multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019ein, a High Velocity Type Ia supernova discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5353 with a two day non-detection limit. SN 2019ein exhibited some of the highest measured expansion velocities of any Type Ia supernovae, with a Si II absorption minimum blueshifted by 24,000 km s$^{-1}$ at 14 days before peak brightness. More unusually, we observed the emission components of the P Cygni profiles to be blueshifted upwards of 10,000 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxy redshift before B-band maximum light. This blueshift, among the highest in a sample of other Type Ia supernovae, is greatest at our earliest spectroscopic epoch and subsequently decreases toward maximum light. We discuss models of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that could explain these extreme absorption and emission velocities. Radio observations beginning 14 days before B-band maximum light yield non-detections at the position of SN 2019ein, which rules out symbiotic progenitor systems, most models of white dwarfs powering fast optically-thick accretion winds, and optically thin shells of mass $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ at radii $< 100$ AU. Comparing our spectra to models and observations of other High Velocity Type Ia supernovae, we find that the observational properties of SN 2019ein match those of a delayed detonation explosion. We propose that the high velocity ejecta and blueshifted emission may be the result of abundance enhancements due to ejecta mixing in an asymmetric explosion, or optical depth effects in the photosphere of the ejecta at early times. These findings may provide evidence for common explosion mechanisms and ejecta geometries among High Velocity Type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {Near maximum brightness, the spectra of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) present typical absorption features of Silicon II observed at roughly 6100A and 5750A. The 2-D distribution of the pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs) of these features is a useful tool for classifying SNe Ia spectra (Branch plot). Comparing the observed distribution of SNe on the Branch plot to results of simulated explosion models, we find that 1-D models fail to cover most of the distribution. In contrast, we find that TARDIS radiative transfer simulations of the WD head-on collision models along different lines of sight almost fully cover the distribution. We use several simplified approaches to explain this result. We perform order-of-magnitude analysis and model the opacity of the Si lines using LTE and NLTE approximations. Introducing a simple toy model of spectral feature formation, we show that the pEW is a good tracer for the extent of the absorption region in the ejecta. Using radiative transfer simulations of synthetic SNe ejecta, we reproduce the observed Branch plot distribution by varying the luminosity of the SN and the Si density profile of the ejecta. We deduce that the success of the collision model in covering the Branch plot is a result of its asymmetry, which allows for a significant range of Si density profiles along different viewing angles, uncorrelated with a range of $^{56}$Ni yields that cover the observed range of SNe Ia luminosity. We use our results to explain the shape and boundaries of the Branch plot distribution.},

We aim to asses the potential of asteroseismology to distinguish between the hot flasher and the very-late thermal pulse scenarios for the formation of low-mass hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs. We compute the evolution of low-mass hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs from the zero-age main sequence in the context of the two evolutionary scenarios. We explore the pulsation properties of the resulting models for effective temperatures characterizing the instability strip of pulsating helium-rich white dwarfs. We find that there are significant differences in the periods and in the period spacings associated with low radial-order ($k\lesssim 10$) gravity modes for white-dwarf models evolving within the instability strip of the hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs. The measurement of the period spacings for pulsation modes with periods shorter than $\sim500\,$s may be used to distinguish between the two scenarios. Moreover, period-to-period asteroseismic fits of low-mass pulsating hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs can help to determine their evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) makes use of the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average, 0.08 mag (≃4.0$\sigma$) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich) and galaxies with low specific star formation rates (sSFR). These trends do not depend on any assumed cosmological model, and are independent of the SN light-curve width: both fast and slow-declining events show the same trends. SNe Ia in galaxies with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope ('$\beta$') between their luminosities and colours with ∼2.7$\sigma$ significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble diagrams (at 95 per cent confidence), though the significance of these effects is dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator using galaxy mass-metallicity relations, the luminosity trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable to the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w, the equation of state of dark energy. We show that the use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass (metal-rich) galaxies and the other for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies, adequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these terms give a significant reduction in $\chi$2 (3.8$\sigma$-4.5$\sigma$); linear corrections based on host parameters do not perform as well. We conclude that all future SN Ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar) form to control demographic shifts in the underlying galaxy population. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {We develop a new model for X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs), applying stationary general relativistic ``slim disk'' accretion solutions to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and then ray-tracing the photon trajectories from the image plane to the disk surface, including gravitational redshift, Doppler, and lensing effects self-consistently. We simultaneously and successfully fit the multi-epoch XMM-{\it Newton} X-ray spectra for two TDEs: ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi. We test explanations for the observed, unexpectedly slow X-ray brightening of ASASSN-15oi, including delayed disk formation and variable obscuration by a reprocessing layer. We propose a new mechanism that better fits the data: a ``Slimming Disk'' scenario in which accretion onto an edge-on disk slows, reducing the disk height and exposing more X-rays from the inner disk to the sightline over time. For ASASSN-15oi, we constrain the SMBH mass to $4.0^{+2.5}_{-3.1} \times 10^6M_\odot$. For ASASSN-14li, the SMBH mass is $10^{+1}_{-7}\times 10^6M_\odot$ and the spin is $0.998^{+0}_{-0.7}$. For both TDEs, our fitted masses are consistent with independent estimates; for ASASSN-14li, application of the external mass constraint narrows our spin constraint to $0.998^{+0}_{-0.15}$. The mass accretion rate of ASASSN-14li decays slowly, as $\propto t^{-1.1}$, perhaps due to inefficient debris circularization. Over $\approx$1100 days, its SMBH has accreted $\Delta M \approx 0.17 M_\odot$, implying a progenitor star mass of $> 0.34 M_\odot$, i.e., no ``missing energy problem.'' For both TDEs, the hydrogen column density declines to the host galaxy plus Milky Way value after a few hundred days, suggesting a characteristic timescale for the depletion or removal of obscuring gas.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of the final stages of massive star evolution is largely incomplete, particularly in low metallicity environments. To improve upon this, we investigate the behavior of a suspected LBV in one of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies, PHL 293B. Excitingly, we find the sudden disappearance of the LBV signature from our spectra obtained in 2019. Spectroscopic observations of PHL 293B between 2001 and 2009 consistently revealed both narrow and broad strong emission components in the hydrogen Balmer lines, with minimal variation between observations. These broad components combined with P Cygni profiles have been associated with a massive Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star. However, such features are absent from our spectra obtained in 2019 with the ESPRESSO and X-shooter instruments of the ESO's VLT, as well as archival data from 2011 and 2016. We compute radiative transfer models using CMFGEN that fit the observed spectrum of the LBV. This reveals that during 2001-2009 the LBV had a luminosity $L_* = 2.5-5.0 \times 10^6 L_{\odot}$, a mass-loss rate $\dot{M} = 0.005-0.020 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, a stellar wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$, and an effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff} = 6000-6800$ K. These values indicate an eruptive state. We consider two main hypotheses for the absence of the broad emission components from the spectra obtained since 2011. One possibility is that we are seeing the end of an LBV eruption of a surviving star, with a mild drop in luminosity, a shift to hotter effective temperatures, and some dust obscuration. Alternatively, the LBV could have collapsed to a massive black hole without the production of a bright supernova.},

abstract = {We present a new method to photometrically delineate between various sub-types of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the color-stretch parameters, $s_{BV}$ or $s_{gr}$, and the time of i-band primary maximum relative to the B-band or g-band maximum it is demonstrated that 2003fg-like, 1991bg-like, and 2002cx-like SNe Ia can readily be identified. In the cases of these extreme SNe Ia, their primary i-band maximum occurs after the time of the B or g band maxima. We suggest that the timing of the i-band maximum can reveal the physical state of the SN Ia explosion as it traces: i) the speed of the recombination front of iron group elements in the ejecta, ii) the temperature evolution and rate of adiabatic cooling in the ejecta and, iii) the presence of interaction with a stellar envelope. This photometric sub-typing can be used in conjunction with other SNe analysis, such as the Branch diagram, to examine the physics and diversity of SNe Ia. The results here can also be used to screen out non-Ia SNe from cosmological samples that do not have complete spectroscopic typing. Finally, as future surveys like LSST create large databases of light curves of many objects this photometric identification can be used to readily identify and study the rates and bulk properties of peculiar SNe Ia.},

abstract = {We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient (FBOT) CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t=69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray ($L_x\sim5\times 10^{39}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) and radio ($L_{\nu}\sim10^{29}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}Hz^{-1}}$) emission. The radio emission peaked at $\sim$100 days post transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blastwave. CSS161010 launched a relativistic outflow with velocity $\Gamma\beta c\ge0.55c$ at $\sim$100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT2018cow ($\Gamma\beta c\sim0.1c$) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla ($\Gamma\beta c\ge0.3c$ at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 ($E_k\gtrsim10^{51}$ erg) is comparable to that of long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the relativistic outflow is significantly larger ($\sim0.01-0.1\,M_{\odot}$). This is consistent with the lack of observed $\gamma$-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at $\sim$150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass $M_{*}\sim10^{7}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and specific star formation rate 0.3 $Gyr^{-1}$. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host-galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally-located intermediate mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate <0.25% the core-collapse supernova rate at z$\sim$0.2) H-rich transients that can launch relativistic outflows.},

abstract = {Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are the ultimate cosmic lighthouses, capable of being observed at z<25 and revealing the properties of primordial stars at cosmic dawn. But it is now understood that the spectra and light curves of these events evolved with redshift as the universe became polluted with heavy elements because chemically enriched stars in this mass range typically lose most of their hydrogen envelopes and explode as bare helium cores. The light curves of such transients can be considerably dimmer in the near infrared (NIR) today than those of primordial PISNe of equal energy and progenitor mass. Here, we calculate detection rates for PISNe whose progenitors lost their outer layers to either line-driven winds or rotation at z<10, their detection limit in redshift for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that JWST may be able to detect only Pop II (metal-poor) PISNe over the redshift range of z<4, but not their Pop III (metal-free) counterparts.},

abstract = {We present very early, high-cadence photometric observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2017cbv. The light curve is unique in that it has a blue bump during the first five days of observations in the U, B, and g bands, which is clearly resolved given our photometric cadence of 5.7 hr during that time span. We model the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component. Our best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 solar radii from the exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent. While this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the observed flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not a blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it could point to another physical explanation for the optical blue bump, such as interaction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution. Early optical spectra of SN 2017cbv show strong carbon absorption up through day -13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system contains a significant amount of unburned material. These early results on SN 2017cbv illustrate the power of early discovery and intense follow-up of nearby supernovae to resolve standing questions about the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia.},

Here we apply spherically symmetric SNR evolution models to these 15 remnants to obtain estimates for ages, explosion energies, circum-stellar medium densities and profiles (uniform or wind-type).From the distribution of ages we obtain a supernova birth rate and estimate incompleteness. The energies and densities can be well fit with log-normal distributions. The distribution of explosion energies is very similar to that of SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), suggesting SN explosions in the LMC and in the Galaxy are very similar. The density distribution has higher mean density for Galactic SNRs than for LMC SNRs, by a factor $\sim$2.5.},

We performed a systematic search for rapidly evolving transients using the deep data taken with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Transient Survey. By measuring the timescales of the light curves of 1824 transients, we identified 5 rapidly evolving transients. Our samples are found in a wide range of redshifts (0.3 $\le$ z $\le$ 1.5) and peak absolute magnitudes ($-$17 $\ge$ $M_i$ $\ge$ $-$20). The properties of the light curves are similar to those of the previously discovered rapidly evolving transients. They show a relatively blue spectral energy distribution, with the best-fit blackbody of 8,000 - 18,000 K. We show that some of the transients require power sources other than the radioactive decays of $^{56}$Ni because of their high peak luminosities and short timescales. The host galaxies of all the samples are star-forming galaxies, suggesting a massive star origin for the rapidly evolving transients. The event rate is roughly estimated to be $\sim$4,000 events yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$, which is about 1 $\%$ of core-collapse supernovae.},

abstract = {From Sloan Digital Sky Survey u′g′r′i′z′ imaging, we estimate the stellar masses of the host galaxies of 70 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa, 0.015 <z< 0.08) from the hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. These nearby SNe were discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SNe discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). Testing four separate light curve fitters, we detect ∼ 2.5$\sigma$ correlations of Hubble residuals with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SNeIa occurring in physically larger, more massive hosts are 10% brighter after light curve correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the correlations cannot be attributed to a light-curve-dependent calibration error. Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SNe with 30 nearby SNe whose host masses are less than 1010.8 M ⊙ in a cosmology fit yields 1 + w = 0.22+0.152-0.108, while a combination where the 30 nearby SNe instead have host masses greater than 1010.8 M ⊙ yields 1 + w = -0.03+0.217-0.143. Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. Host galaxy measurements will yield improved distances to SNeIa. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.},

No detections were made. With standard assumptions for the energy densities of relativistic electrons going into a power-law energy distribution, and the magnetic field strength (epsilon_e = epsilon_B = 0.1), we arrive at the upper limits on mass-loss rate for the progenitor system of SN 2013dy (2016coj, 2018gv, 2018pv, 2019np), to be less than 12 (2.8,1.3, 2.1, 1.7)EE(-8) solar masses per year (for a wind speed of 100 km/s). To SNe 2016coj, 2018gv, 2018pv and 2019np we add radio data for 17 other nearby SNe Ia, and model their non-detections. With the same model as described, all 21 SNe Ia have mass-loss rates less than 4EE(-8) solar masses per year (for a wind speed of 100 km/s). We compare those limits with the expected mass loss rates in different single-degenerate progenitor scenarios. We also discuss how information on epsilon_e and epsilon_B can be obtained from late observations of SNe Ia and the youngest SN Ia remnant detected in radio, G1.9+0.3, as well as stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe. We highlight SN 2011dh, and argue for epsilon_e approximately equal to 0.1 and epsilon_B approximately equal to 0.0033. Finally, we discuss strategies to observe at radio frequencies to maximize the chance of detection, given the time since explosion, the distance to the supernova and the telescope sensitivity.},

abstract = {Any abundance of black holes that was present in the early universe will evolve as matter, making up an increasingly large fraction of the total energy density as space expands. This motivates us to consider scenarios in which the early universe included an era that was dominated by low-mass ($M < 5\times 10^8$ g) black holes which evaporate prior to primordial nucleosynthesis. In significant regions of parameter space, these black holes will become gravitationally bound within binary systems, and undergo mergers before evaporating. Such mergers result in three potentially observable signatures. First, any black holes that have undergone one or more mergers will possess substantial angular momentum, causing their Hawking evaporation to produce significant quantities of high-energy gravitons. These products of Hawking evaporation are predicted to constitute a background of hot ($\sim$eV-keV) gravitons today, with an energy density corresponding to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.01-0.03$. Second, these mergers will produce a stochastic background of high-frequency gravitational waves. And third, the energy density of these gravitational waves can be as large as $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.3$, depending on the length of time between the mergers and evaporation. These signals are each potentially within the reach of future measurements.},

abstract = {This paper describes the data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey conducted between 2005 and 2007. Light curves, spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variable and transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised of all transient sources brighter than r ≃ 22.5 mag with no history of variability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed on a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient host galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric classifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light curves that were not observed spectroscopically, using host galaxy redshift information when available. From these observations, 4607 transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae, making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We present a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy properties including stellar masses, star formation rates, and the average stellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2 distance moduli for a total of 1364 SNIa with spectroscopic redshifts as well as photometric redshifts for a further 624 purely photometric SNIa candidates. Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SNIa sample and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we determine $\Omega$M = 0.315 ± 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant at 5.7$\sigma$.},

abstract = {SN 2014C was an unprecedented supernova (SN) that displayed a metamorphosis from Type Ib to Type IIn over ∼200 days. This transformation is consistent with a helium star having exploded in a cavity surrounded by a dense shell of the progen-itor{\^{a}} ˘ A ´ Zs stripped hydrogen envelope. For at least 5 years post-explosion, the ejecta continued to interact with an outer, extended component of circumstellar medium (CSM) that was ejected even before the dense shell. It is still unclear, however, what kind of progenitor could have undergone such a complicated mass-loss history before it produced this peculiar SN. In this paper, we report a new analysis of SN 2014C's host star cluster based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). By carefully fitting its spectral energy distribution (SED), we derive a precise cluster age of 20.0 +3.5 −2.6 Myr, which corresponds to the progenitor's lifetime assuming coevolution. Combined with binary stellar evolution models, we find that SN 2014C's progenitor may have been an ∼11-M star in a relatively wide binary system. The progenitor's envelope was partially stripped by Case C or Case BC mass transfer via binary interaction, followed by a violent eruption that ejected the last hydrogen layer before terminal explosion. Thus, SN 2014C, in common with SNe 2006jc and 2015G, may be a third example that violent eruptions, with mass-loss rates matching luminous blue variable (LBV) giant eruptions, can also occur in much lower-mass massive stars if their envelopes are partially or completely stripped in interacting binaries.},

abstract = {Massive binaries that merge as compact objects are the progenitors of gravitational-wave sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more phases of mass transfer, during which one of the stars loses part or all of its outer envelope and becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size of these stripped stars is crucial in determining whether they experience further interactions and their final fate. We present new calculations of stripped-envelope stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We use these to investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and metallicity. We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped stars. At high metallicity we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich envelope is removed, in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors with initial masses below 10\Msun expand to large radii (up to 100\Rsun), while more massive progenitors stay compact. At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors can, in principle, expand to giant sizes (> 400\Rsun), for all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew. We show that the prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis models underestimate the stellar radii by up to two orders of magnitude. We expect that this has consequences for the predictions for gravitational-wave sources from double neutron star mergers, in particular for their metallicity dependence.},

abstract = {We propose a robust, quantitative method to compare the synthetic light curves of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion model with a large set of observed SNe Ia, and derive a figure of merit for the explosion model's agreement with observations. The synthetic light curves are fit with the data-driven model SALT2 which returns values for stretch, color, and magnitude at peak brightness, as well as a goodness-of-fit parameter. Each fit is performed multiple times with different choices of filter bands and epoch range in order to quantify the systematic uncertainty on the fitted parameters. We use a parametric population model for the distribution of observed SN Ia parameters from large surveys, and extend it to represent red, dim, and bright outliers found in a low-redshift SN Ia data set. We discuss the potential uncertainties of this population model and find it to be reliable given the current uncertainties on cosmological parameters. Using our population model, we assign each set of fitted parameters a likelihood of being observed in nature, and a figure of merit based on this likelihood. We define a second figure of merit based on the quality of the light curve fit, and combine the two measures into an overall figure of merit for each explosion model. We compute figures of merit for a variety of one-, two-, and three-dimensional explosion models and show that our evaluation method allows meaningful inferences across a wide range of light curve quality and fitted parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013.

Our data represents the lowest frequency observations of the SN beyond 1000 days with a frequency range of 0.33-25 GHz and a temporal range of ∼ 8 to 1136 days post-explosion. The observations are best represented by a model of synchrotron emission from a shocked circumstellar shell initially suppressed by synchrotron self-absorption. Assuming equipartition of energy between relativistic particles and magnetic fields, we estimate the velocity and radius of the blast wave to be v ∼ 0.15c and r ∼ 3.4 × 1015 cm respectively at t0 ∼ 8 days post-explosion. We infer the total internal energy of the radio-emitting material evolves as E ∼ 0.37 × 1047(t/t0)0.65 erg. We determine the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star to be $\dot{M} \sim (0.4-3.2) \times 10^{-5} M_{\odot }\rm yr^{-1}$ at various epochs post-explosion, consistent with the mass-loss rate of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars.

abstract = {Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important distance indicators, element factories, cosmic-ray accelerators, kinetic-energy sources in galaxy evolution, and endpoints of stellar binary evolution. It has long been clear that a SN Ia must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered: single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a non-degenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of their sites, pre- and post-explosion, from analysis of the explosions themselves, and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive, and sometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that DD progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

abstract = {Metallicity is known to significantly affect the radial expansion of a massive star: the lower the metallicity the more compact the star, especially during its post-MS evolution. We study the impact of this effect in the context of binary evolution. Using the stellar-evolution code MESA, we compute evolutionary tracks of stars at different metallicities, exploring variations of factors known to affect the radial expansion (eg. semiconvection, overshooting, rotation). We find observational support for evolution in which already at metallicity $0.2Z_{\odot}$ massive stars stay relatively compact during the Hertzprung-Gap phase (HG) and most of their expansion happens during core-helium burning (CHeB). Consequently, we show that metallicity has a strong influence on the type of mass transfer evolution in binary systems. At solar metallicity a case-B mass transfer is initiated shortly after the end of MS and a giant donor is almost always a rapidly-expanding HG star. At lower metallicity the parameter space for mass transfer from a more evolved CHeB star increases dramatically. This means that envelope stripping and formation of helium stars in low metallicity environments happens later during the evolution of the donor, implying a much shorter duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase (even by an order of magnitude) and higher final core masses. This metallicity effect is independent of the impact of metallicity-dependent stellar winds. At very low metallicities a significant fraction of massive stars engage in their first episode of mass transfer very late into their evolution, when they already have a well developed CO core. The remaining lifetime ($< 10^4$ yr) is unlikely to be enough to strip the entire H-rich envelope. We also briefly discuss the extremely small parameter space for mass transfer from massive convective-envelope donors in the context of binary black hole merger formation.},

abstract = {White dwarfs are dense, cooling stellar embers consisting mostly of carbon and oxygen1, or oxygen and neon (with a few per cent carbon) at higher initial stellar masses2. These stellar cores are enveloped by a shell of helium, which in turn, is usually surrounded by a layer of hydrogen, generally prohibiting direct observation of the interior composition. However, carbon is observed at the surface of a sizeable fraction of white dwarfs3,4, sometimes with traces of oxygen, and is thought to be dredged up from the core by a deep helium convection zone5,6. In these objects, only traces of hydrogen are found7,8, as large masses of hydrogen are predicted to inhibit hydrogen–helium convective mixing within the envelope9. We report the identification of WD J055134.612+413531.09, an ultra-massive (1.14 solar masses (M⊙)) white dwarf with a unique carbon–hydrogen mixed atmosphere (atomic ratio C∕H = 0.15). Our analysis of the envelope and interior indicates that the total hydrogen and helium mass fractions must be several orders of magnitude lower than predictions of single-star evolution10: less than 10−9.5 and 10−7.0, respectively. Due to the fast kinematics (129 ± 5 km s−1 relative to the local standard of rest), large mass and peculiar envelope composition, we argue that WD J0551+4135 is consistent with formation from the merger of two white dwarfs in a tight binary system11–14.},

We introduce a new direct method to study these correlations by analyzing `parent' galaxies that host multiple SNe Ia 'siblings'. Here, we search the Dark Energy Survey SN sample, one of the largest samples of discovered SNe, and find 8 galaxies that hosted two likely Type Ia SNe. Comparing the light-curve properties of these SNe and recovered distances from the light curves, we find no better agreement between properties of SNe in the same galaxy as any random pair of galaxies, with the exception of the SN light-curve stretch. We show at $2.8\sigma$ significance that at least 1/2 of the intrinsic scatter of SNe Ia distance modulus residuals is not from common host properties. We also discuss the robustness with which we could make this evaluation with LSST, which will find $100\times$ more pairs of galaxies, and pave a new line of study on the consistency of Type Ia supernovae in the same parent galaxies. Finally, we argue that it is unlikely some of these SNe are actually single, lensed SN with multiple images.},

abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used as standard candles to probe the Universe. However, how these fierce explosions are produced itself is still a highly debated issue. There are mainly two popular models for SNe Ia, i.e. the double-degenerate scenario and the single-degenerate scenario. The double-degenerate scenario suggests that SNe Ia are produced by the coalescence of two degenerate white dwarfs, while the single-degenerate scenario suggests that the continuous accretion of a single degenerate white dwarf from its normal stellar companion will finally lead to a disastrous explosion when it is over-massive, resulting in an SN Ia. The rapid development of the gravitational wave astronomy sheds new light on the nature of SNe Ia. In this study, we calculate the gravitational wave emissions of double white dwarf coalescences and compare them with the sensitivities of several upcoming detectors. It is found that the gravitational wave emissions from double white dwarf mergers in the locale universe are strong enough to be detected by LISA. We argue that LISA-like gravitational wave detectors sensitive in the frequency range of 0.01 - 0.1 Hz will be a powerful tool to test the double-degenerate model of SNe Ia, and also to probe the Universe.},

abstract = {While shedding light on green space propulsion, the development of non-toxic hypergolic bipropellants has provided alternatives to the conventional, highly toxic propellants. Non-toxic energetic hydrocarbon fuels promoted by sodium borohydride were produced, and their hypergolicity with rocket grade hydrogen peroxide was confirmed. Ignition delays ranged from 4 ms to 17 ms, depending on the oxidizer concentration. A 500 N scale thruster utilizing a non-toxic hypergolic bipropellant combination was also developed. With an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of 5.48, the injector was designed with pentad unlike-impinging jets, one fuel jet orifice and four oxidizer jet orifices for enhancing the mix and atomization of the hypergolic propellants. The operation test was performed, and burning time was established to be 3.5 s. For the demonstrator, the rising time was approximately 158 ms, and the pressure oscillation inside the combustion chamber was approximately ±7.69%. These results indicate the feasibility of this novel concept engine for future space missions.},

abstract = {The reactions of N2H4 with N2O4 isomers have been investigated at the G2M(CC3)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) level. The results show that the reactions of N2H4 with sym-N2O4 (D2h), cis-ONONO2 (Cs), and NO2 have to overcome 14.2, 10.6, and 7.6kcal/mol barriers, respectively. However, N2H4 can react spontaneously with trans-ONONO2 (Cs) and cis-ONONO2 (C1) to produce HONO2+H2NN(H)NO with the near gas-kinetic rate constant, 4×10−10cm3molecule−1s−1 above 250K. The H2NN(H)NO thus formed can rapidly fragment to give reactive N2H3 radical with rate constant >1×107s−1 at 1000K, which is fast enough to initiate the hypergolic chain reactions with NO2 and N2O4.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {In this second paper in a series studying galaxy–galaxy lensing signals using Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), we present our measurement and modeling of the lensing signals around groups of galaxies. We divide the groups into four halo mass bins and measure the signals around four different halo-center tracers: brightest central galaxies (BCGs), luminosity-weighted centers, number-weighted centers, and X-ray peak positions. For groups cross-identified in both X-ray and SDSS DR7, we further split the groups into low and high X-ray emission subsamples, both of which are assigned to two halo-center tracers, BCGs and X-ray peak positions. The galaxy–galaxy lensing signals show that BCGs, among the four candidates, are the best halo-center tracers. We model the lensing signals using a combination of four contributions: the off-center NFW host halo profile, subhalo contribution, stellar contribution, and projected two-halo term. We sample the posterior of five parameters, i.e., the halo mass, concentration, off-centering distance, subhalo mass, and fraction of subhalos, via a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) package using the galaxy–galaxy lensing signals. After taking into account the sampling effects (e.g., Eddington bias), we found that the best-fit halo masses obtained from lensing signals are quite consistent with those obtained in the group catalog based on an abundance matching method, except in the lowest mass bin.}

This depression is most pronounced at the void radius, in agreement with analytical models of void matter profiles.

We consider two models: a ‘thick’-filament model constructed from ray-tracing simulations for Λ cold dark matter model, and a ‘thin’-filament model which models the filament by a string of haloes along the line connecting the two LRGs. We show that the filament lensing signal is in nice agreement with the thick simulation filament, while strongly disfavouring the thin model. The magnitude of the lensing shear due to the filament is below 10−4. Employing the likelihood ratio test, we find a 4.5σ significance for the detection of the filament lensing signal, corresponding to a null hypothesis fluctuation probability of 3 × 10−6.

    abstract = "{Cosmic voids are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information about the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an increasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void studies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position errors of ≥50 Mpc h−1which can render many voids undetectable. We present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys, validate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-z redMaGiC galaxy sample of the DES Science Verification data. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding voids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the line-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-z scatter, the number of voids found in simulated spectroscopic and photometric galaxy catalogues is within 20 per cent for all transverse void sizes, and indistinguishable for the largest voids (Rv ≥ 70 Mpc h−1). The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric voids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the algorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range 0.2 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.8, we identify 87 voids with comoving radii spanning the range 18–120 Mpc h−1, and carry out a stacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of 4.4σ, the lensing measurement confirms that the voids are truly underdense in the matter field and hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics in the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the viability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.}",

abstract = {Low-density regions are less affected by the nonlinear structure formation and baryonic physics. They are ideal places for probing the nature of dark energy, a possible explanation for the cosmic acceleration. Unlike void lensing, which requires identifications of individual voids, we study the stacked lensing signals around the low-density positions (LDPs), defined as places that are devoid of foreground bright galaxies in projection. The method allows a direct comparison with numerical results by drawing correspondence between the bright galaxies with halos. It leads to lensing signals that are significant enough for differentiating several dark energy models. In this work, we use the CFHTLenS catalog to define LDPs, as well as measuring their background lensing signals. We consider several different definitions of the foreground bright galaxies (redshift range and magnitude cut). Regarding the cosmological model, we run six simulations: the first set of simulations have the same initial conditions, with wde = −1, −0.5, −0.8, −1.2; the second set of simulations include a slightly different ΛCDM model and a w(z) model from Zhao et al. The lensing results indicate that the models with wde = −0.5, −0.8 are not favored, and the other four models all achieve comparable agreement with the data.}

abstract = {The concentration–mass (c–M) relation encodes key information about the assembly history of dark matter halos. However, its behavior at the high mass end has not been measured precisely in observations yet. In this paper, we report the measurement of the halo c–M relation with the galaxy–galaxy lensing method, using the shear catalog of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) Data Release 8, which covers a sky area of 9500 deg2. The foreground lenses are selected from the redMaPPer, LOWZ, and CMASS catalogs, with halo masses ranging from 1013 to 1015  M ⊙ and redshifts ranging from z = 0.08 to z = 0.65. We find that the concentration decreases with the halo mass from 1013 to 1014  M ⊙, but shows a trend of upturn after the pivot point of ∼1014  M ⊙. We fit the measured c–M relation with the concentration model , and we get the values (C 0, γ, log10(M 0)) = (5.119−0.185 0.183, , ) and (, , ) for halos with 0.08 ≤ z &lt; 0.35 and 0.35 ≤ z &lt; 0.65, respectively. We also show that the model including an upturn is favored over a simple power-law model. Our measurement provides important information for the recent argument over the massive cluster formation process.}

The characteristic depletion radius is found to be roughly 2.5 times the virial radius and 1.7–3 times the splashback radius, in line with an approximately universal outer density profile, and the average enclosed density within the characteristic depletion radius is found to be roughly 29 times the mean matter density of the Universe in our sample. When binning haloes by both mass and a proxy for halo concentration, we do not detect a significant variation of the depletion radius with concentration, on which the simulation prediction is also sensitive to the choice of concentration proxy. We also confirm that the measured splashback radius varies with concentration differently from simulation predictions.}",

Here, the background shear signals are obtained based on the DECaLS survey shape catalog, derived with the Fourier_Quad method. We divide the lens samples into five equispaced redshift bins and seven mass bins, which allow us to probe the redshift and mass dependence of the lensing signals, and hence the resulting halo properties. In addition to these sample selections, we also check the signals around different group centers, e.g., the brightest central galaxy, the luminosity-weighted center, and the number-weighted center. We use a lensing model that includes off-centering to describe the lensing signals that we measure for all mass and redshift bins. The results demonstrate that our model predictions for the halo masses, biases, and concentrations are stable and self-consistent among different samples for different group centers. Taking advantage of the very large and complete sample of groups/clusters, as well as the reliable estimations of their halo masses, we provide measurements of the cumulative halo mass functions up to redshift z = 0.6, with a mass precision at 0.03 ∼ 0.09 dex.}

The third moment is measured with a significance of 2σ. The combined constraint on Σ8 = σ8(Ωm/0.27)α is improved by 10 per cent, in comparison to the second-order only, and the allowed ranges for Ωm and σ8 are substantially reduced. Including general triangles of the lensing bispectrum yields tighter constraints compared to probing mainly equilateral triangles.

For a model with free curvature, the joint CFHTLenS–Planck result is Ωm = 0.28 ± 0.02 (68 per cent confidence), which is an improvement of 43 per cent compared to Planck alone. We test how our results are potentially subject to three astrophysical sources of contamination: source-lens clustering, the intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes, and baryonic effects.

This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using peak statistics in cosmological studies. For our measurements, we considered peaks with signal-to-noise ratio in the range of ν = [3, 6]. For a flat Λ cold dark matter model with only (Ωm, σ8) as free parameters, we constrained the parameters of the following relation Σ8 = σ8(Ωm/0.27)α to be Σ8 = 0.82 ± 0.03 and α = 0.43 ± 0.02. The α value found is considerably smaller than the one measured in two-point and three-point cosmic shear correlation analyses, showing a significant complement of peak statistics to standard weak lensing cosmological studies. The derived constraints on (Ωm, σ8) are fully consistent with the ones from either WMAP9 or Planck. From the weak lensing peak abundances alone, we obtained marginalized mean values of \\$\\Omega \_\\{\\rm m\\}=0.38^\\{+0.27\\}\_\\{-0.24\\}\\$ and σ8 = 0.81 ± 0.26.

We measure high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR: ν) weak lensing convergence peaks in the range of 3 \\&lt; ν \\&lt; 5, and employ theoretical models to derive expected values. These models are validated using a suite of simulations. We take into account two major systematic effects, the boost factor and the effect of baryons on the mass–concentration relation of dark matter haloes. In addition, we investigate the impacts of other potential astrophysical systematics including the projection effects of large-scale structures, intrinsic galaxy alignments, as well as residual measurement uncertainties in the shear and redshift calibration.

The difference between the power index of S8 and in Σ8 indicates that combining cosmic shear with peak statistics has the potential to break the degeneracy in σ8 and Ωm.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown the great power of peak counts in weak-lensing maps. In this work, we apply the inverse-Gaussianization method proposed in Yu et al. to produce weak-lensing convergence maps quickly and investigate the peak statistics, including the peak height counts and peak steepness counts in these mocks. The distributions of peak height and steepness are in good agreement with the simulation results. The difference is ≲20% for these peak statistics in the maps at source redshift zs = 1. Also, the loss of off-diagonal elements in the peak covariance motivates us to consider the super-sample variance in weak-lensing peak statistics. We propose four correction methods to effectively recover the (anti)correlation among different bins by adding different scatters in the mean value of these mocks. Finally, as an example of the application, we adopt the improved inverse-Gaussianization method to quickly generate 40,000 mocks to calculate precision matrices for the power spectrum and peak-statistics joint analysis.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) is a dominant source of systematics in weak lensing (WL) studies. In this paper, by employing large simulations with semianalytical galaxy formation, we investigate the IA effects on WL peak statistics. Different simulated source galaxy samples of different redshift distributions are constructed, where both WL shear and IA signals are included. Convergence reconstruction and peak statistics are then performed for these samples. Our results show that the IA effects on peak abundances mainly consist of two aspects. One is the additional contribution from IA to the shape noise. The other is from the satellite IA that can affect the peak signals from their host clusters significantly. The latter depends on the level of inclusion in a shear sample of the satellite galaxies of the clusters that contribute to WL peaks and thus is sensitive to the redshift distribution of source galaxies. We pay particular attention to satellite IA and adjust it artificially in the simulations to analyze the dependence of the satellite IA impacts on its strength. This information can potentially be incorporated into the modeling of WL peak abundances, especially for high peaks physically originated from massive clusters of galaxies, and thus mitigate the IA systematics on the cosmological constraints derived from WL peaks.}}

The effective area used in our analyses after field selection, masking, and boundary exclusions is \\$\\sim 58 \\deg ^2\\$. The source galaxies are divided into low- and high-redshift bins, with 0.2 ≤ zp ≤ 0.85 and 0.85 ≤ zp ≤ 1.5, respectively. We utilize our halo-based theoretical peak model, including the projection effect of large-scale structures, to derive cosmological constraints from the observed tomographic high-peak abundances with the signal-to-noise ratio in the range of νN = [3.5, 5.5]. These high peaks are closely associated with the lensing effects of massive clusters of galaxies. Thus, the inclusion of their member galaxies in the shear catalogue can lead to significant source clustering and dilute their lensing signals. We account for this systematic effect in our theoretical modelling. In addition, the impacts of baryonic effects, galaxy intrinsic alignments, as well as residual uncertainties in shear and photometric redshift calibrations are also analysed. Within the flat ΛCDM model, the derived constraint is \\$S\_8=\\sigma \_8(\\Omega \_\\{\\rm m\\}/0.3)^\\{0.5\\} =0.758\_\\{-0.076\\}^\\{+0.033\\}\\$ and \\$0.768\_\\{-0.057\\}^\\{+0.030\\}\\$ with the source clustering information measured from the two cluster catalogues CAMIRA and WZL, respectively. The asymmetric uncertainties are due to the different degeneracy direction of (Ωm, σ8) from high-peak abundances compared with that from the cosmic shear two-point correlations, which gives rise to the power index α ≈ 0.5. Fitting to our constraints, we obtain α ≈ 0.38 and \\$\\Sigma \_8=\\sigma \_8(\\Omega \_\\{\\rm m\\}/0.3)^\\{\\alpha \\}=0.772\_\\{-0.032\\}^\\{+0.028\\}\\$ (CAMIRA) and \\$0.781\_\\{-0.033\\}^\\{+0.028\\}\\$ (WZL).

title = {Intrinsic Alignments of Galaxies and Their Effects on Weak-Lensing Detections of Mass Concentrations},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {In this paper we analyze the number counts of false peaks resulting from intrinsic ellipticities in lensing convergence maps, including the alignment of source galaxies. The full noise variance in convergence κ-maps can be written as σ = σ + σ, where σ is the noise contributed from randomly oriented source galaxies and σ denotes the additional noise from intrinsic alignments. However, it is observationally difficult to measure σ, and usually only σ can be estimated in weak-lensing observations. Thus, the observational signal-to-noise ratio is often defined with respect to σ0ran, which we denote as νran. The true signal-to-noise ratio ν in terms of σ0 is then ν = νran/(1 + σ/σ)1/2. Given a detection threshold on νran, a larger value of σ/σ leads to a lower threshold on ν and therefore a larger expected number of false peaks. With σ/σ ~ 10%, the average number of false peaks with νran ≥ 3.5 nearly doubles compared to that without considering the alignment, and for νran ≥ 5, the number is tripled. As a result, the efficiency of weak-lensing cluster detection declines significantly. The increase of the number of false peaks also affects the likelihood of the existence of dark clumps. On the other hand, if one can observationally distinguish false peaks and true peaks, the number of false peaks can be used to tightly constrain the level of intrinsic alignments. The CFHTLS Deep survey's 3.61 deg2 lensing observations and follow-up studies find that 5 out of the 14 peaks with νran &gt; 3.5 are likely to be false peaks, giving rise to a constraint of σ ≤ 1.6 × 10-5 (1 σ) at the angular scale of 1' for galaxies at redshift z ~ 1. The corresponding limit on the correlation of intrinsic ellipticities is 3.2 × 10-5.}

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing, the deflection of light by mass, is one of the best tools to constrain the growth of cosmic structure with time and reveal the nature of dark energy. I discuss the sources of systematic uncertainty in weak lensing measurements and their theoretical interpretation, including our current understanding and other options for future improvement. These include long-standing concerns such as the estimation of coherent shears from galaxy images or redshift distributions of galaxies selected on the basis of photometric redshifts, along with systematic uncertainties that have received less attention to date because they are subdominant contributors to the error budget in current surveys. I also discuss methods for automated systematics detection using survey data of the 2020s. The goal of this review is to describe the current state of the field and what must be done so that if weak lensing measurements lead toward surprising conclusions about key questions such as the nature of dark energy, those conclusions will be credible.},

abstract = {We investigate biases induced by the conversion between the observed image shape and shear distortion in current weak-lensing analysis methods. Such overall calibration biases cannot be detected by the standard tests such as E/B decomposition or calibration with stars. We find that the non-Gaussianity of the point spread function has a significant effect and can lead to an error of up to 15 per cent on the linear amplitude of fluctuations $\sigma$8, depending on the method of analysis. This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent amplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre expansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method that reduces the error to a calibration error of the order of 1 per cent, even for poorly resolved galaxies. We also discuss a new type of shear selection bias, which results in up to roughly an 8 per cent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift, inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for. Understanding and correcting for such effects is crucial if weak lensing is to become a high-precision probe of cosmology.},

The scientific aims of the CFHTLenS team are weak gravitational lensing studies supported by photometric redshift estimates for the galaxies. This paper presents our data processing of the complete CFHTLenS data set. We were able to obtain a data set with very good image quality and high-quality astrometric and photometric calibration. Our external astrometric accuracy is between 60 and 70 mas with respect to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and the internal alignment in all filters is around 30 mas. Our average photometric calibration shows a dispersion of the order of 0.01-0.03 mag for gâ²râ²iâ² zâ² and about 0.04 mag for u* with respect to SDSS sources down to iSDSS â¤ 21. We demonstrate in accompanying papers that our data meet necessary requirements to fully exploit the survey for weak gravitational lensing analyses in connection with photometric redshift studies. In the spirit of the CFHTLS, all our data products are released to the astronomical community via the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre at http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc. gc.ca/community/CFHTLens/query.html.

abstract = {We present cosmological constraints from 2D weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) which spans 154 deg2 in five optical bands. Using accurate photometric redshifts and measured shapes for 4.2 million galaxies between redshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute the 2D cosmic shear correlation function over angular scales ranging between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. Using nonlinear models of the dark-matter power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters by exploring the parameter space with Population Monte Carlo sampling. The best constraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scale density-fluctuations amplitude $\sigma$8 scaled with the total matter density $\Omega$m. For a flat $\Lambda$cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model we obtain $\Sigma$8($\Omega$m/0.27)0.6 = 0.79 Â± 0.03. We combine the CFHTLenS data with 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO): SDSS-III (BOSS) and a Hubble Space Telescope distance-ladder prior on the Hubble constant to get joint constraints. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $\Omega$m = 0.283 Â± 0.010 and $\Sigma$8 = 0.813 Â± 0.014. In the case of a curved wCDM universe, we obtain $\Omega$m = 0.27 Â± 0.03, $\Sigma$8 = 0.83 Â± 0.04, w0 = -1.10 Â± 0.15 and $\Omega$k = 0.006+0.006-0.004. We calculate the Bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved $\Lambda$CDM and dark-energy CDM models. From the combination of all four probes, we find models with curvature to be at moderately disfavoured with respect to the flat case. A simple dark-energy model is indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM. Our results therefore do not necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmological model. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {We report the detection of a significant (5.5 $\delta$) excess of correlations between galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes. This detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure was made using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin2 obtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) with the UH8K and CFH12K panoramic CCD cameras. The amplitude of the excess correlation is 2.2 Â± 0.2{\%} at 1 arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lensing effect induced by large-scale structure. We provide a quantitative analysis of systematics which could contribute to the signal and show that the net effect is small and can be corrected for. In particular, we show that the spurious excess of correlations caused by the residual of the anisotropic Point Spread Function (PSF) correction is well below the measured signal. We show that the measured ellipticity correlations behave as expected for a gravitational shear signal. The relatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints on cosmological models. However the data are in favor of cluster normalized cosmological models, and marginally reject Cold Dark Matter models with ($\Omega$ = 0.3, $\sigma$8 {\textless} 0.6) or ($\Omega$ = 1, $\sigma$8 = 1). The detection of cosmic shear demonstrates the technical feasibility of using weak lensing surveys to measure dark matter clustering and the potential for cosmological parameter measurements, in particular with upcoming wide field CCD cameras.},

abstract = {The mass function of galaxy clusters is an important cosmological probe. Differences in the selection method could potentially lead to biases when determining the mass function. From the optical and X-ray data of the XMM-Newton Follow-Up Survey, we obtained a sample of galaxy cluster candidates using weak gravitational lensing, the optical Postman matched filter method, and a search for extended X-ray sources. We developed our weak-lensing search criteria by testing the performance of the aperture mass statistic on realistic ray-tracing simulations matching our survey parameters and by comparing two filter functions. We find that the dominant noise source for our survey is shape noise at almost all significance levels and that spurious cluster detections due to projections of large-scale structures are negligible, except possibly for highly significantly detected peaks. Our full cluster catalog has 155 cluster candidates, 116 found with the Postman matched filter, 59 extended X-ray sources, and 31 shear selected potential clusters. Most of these cluster candidates were not previously known. The present catalog will be a solid foundation for studying possible selection effects in either method. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

The primary goal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchers outside the shear measurement community. Six GREAT08 Team methods were presented at the launch of the Challenge and five additional groups submitted results during the 6-month competition. Participants analyzed 30 million simulated galaxies with a range in signal-to-noise ratio, point spread function ellipticity, galaxy size and galaxy type. The large quantity of simulations allowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracy suitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the first time. Different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameter space and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. A number of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the Challenge including a re-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies, which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. The image simulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future GREAT Challenges, meanwhile the GREAT08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additional developments in shear measurement algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Weak lensing observations measure the shear field and hence the gradient of the dimensionless surface density {\$}\backslashkappa{\$}. We present several new algorithms to recover {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} {\{}{\}}from shear estimates on a finite region and compare how they perform with realistically noisy data. The reconstruction methods studied here are divided into 2 classes: direct reconstruction and regularized inversion. Direct reconstruction techniques express {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} as a 2D integral of the shear field. This yields an estimator for {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} as a discrete sum over background galaxy ellipticities which is straightforward to implement, and allows a simple estimate of the noise. We study 3 types of direct reconstruction methods: 1) {\$}\backslashkappa{\$}-estimators that measure the surface density at any given target point relative to the mean value in a reference region 2) a method that explicitly attempts to minimize the rotational part of {\$}\backslashnabla \backslashkappa{\$} that is due to noise and 3) a novel, exact Fourier-space inverse gradient operator. We also develop two `regularized maximum likelihood' methods, one of which employs the conventional discrete Laplacian operator as a regularizer and the other uses regularization of all components in Fourier space. We compare the performance of all the estimators by means of simulations and noise power analysis. A general feature of these unbiased methods is an enhancement of the low frequency power which, for some of the methods, can be quite severe. We find the best performance is provided by the maximum likelihood method with Fourier space regularization although some of the other methods perform almost as well.},

Four different decomposition procedures are investigated which make improvements to sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard SDSS procedures that lead to more robust structural parameters and integrated galaxy magnitudes and colors, especially in crowded environments. We use a set of science-based quality assurance metrics, namely, the disk luminosity-size relation, the galaxy color-magnitude diagram, and the galaxy central (fiber) colors to show the robustness of our structural parameters. The best procedure utilizes simultaneous, two-bandpass decompositions. Bulge and disk photometric errors remain below 0.1mag down to bulge and disk magnitudes of g â 19 and r â 18.5.

abstract = {We present first results from the third GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT3) challenge, the third in a sequence of challenges for testing methods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from simulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three specific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying shear fields. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by {\~{}}1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy type as measured by the S{\'{e}}rsic index, are quantified for the first time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities to galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and defocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in which additive shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.},

abstract = {The wealth of incoming and future cosmological observations will allow us to map out the structure and evolution of the observable universe to an unprecedented level of precision. Among these observations is the weak gravitational lensing of galaxies, e.g.,cosmic shear that measures the minute distortions of background galaxy images by intervening cosmic structure. Weak lensing and cosmic shear promise to be a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology, constraining models of dark energy, measuring the evolution of structure in the universe, and testing theories of gravity on cosmic scales. However, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies-their shape and orientation before being lensed-may pose a great challenge to the use of weak gravitational lensing as an accurate cosmological probe, and has been identified as one of the primary physical systematic biases in cosmic shear studies. Correlations between this intrinsic alignment and the lensing signal can persist even for large physical separations, and isolating the effect of intrinsic alignment from weak lensing is not trivial. A great deal of work in the last two decades has been devoted to understanding and characterizing this intrinsic alignment, which is also a direct and complementary probe of structure formation and evolution in its own right. In this review, we report in a systematic way the state of our understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, with a particular emphasis on its large-scale impact on weak lensing measurements and methods for its isolation or mitigation. We begin with an introduction to the use of cosmic shear as a probe for cosmology and describe the various physical contributions by intrinsic alignment to the shear or convergence 2- and 3-point correlations. We then review developments in the modeling of the intrinsic alignment signal, including a trend toward attempting to incorporate more accurate nonlinear and single halo effects. The impact on cosmological constraints by the intrinsic alignment of galaxies is also outlined based on these models. We then summarize direct measurements of the large-scale intrinsic alignment signal in various surveys and discuss their constraints on models of intrinsic alignment, as well as progress in utilizing numerical simulations of structure formation to further our understanding of intrinsic alignment. Finally, we outline the development of a variety of mitigation techniques for reducing the impact of the intrinsic alignment contamination on weak lensing signals both within a galaxy data set and between complementary probes of gravitational lensing. The methodology and projected impact of these techniques are discussed for both 2- and 3-point correlations. We conclude by presenting a summary and outlook on the state of intrinsic alignment study and its impact on ongoing and planned weak lensing surveys.},

abstract = {Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmological parameters, but its potential can be fully utilized only if galaxy shapes are measured with great accuracy. Two major effects have been identified which are likely to account for most of the bias seen for maximum likelihood methods in recent shear measurement challenges. Model bias occurs when the true galaxy shape is not well represented by the fitted model. Noise bias occurs due to the non-linear relationship between image pixels and galaxy shape. In this paper we investigate the potential interplay between these two effects when an imperfect model is used in the presence of high noise. We present analytical expressions for this bias, which depends on the residual difference between the model and real data. They can lead to biases not accounted for in previous calibration schemes. By measuring the model bias, noise bias and their interaction, we provide a complete statistical framework for measuring galaxy shapes with model fittingmethods from GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT)-like images. We demonstrate the noise and model interaction bias using a simple toy model, which indicates that this effect can potentially be significant. Using real galaxy images from the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) we quantify the strength of the model bias, noise bias and their interaction. We find that the interaction term is often of a similar size to the model bias term, and is smaller than the requirements of current and near future galaxy surveys. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {The GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 3 (GREAT3) challenge is the third in a series of image analysis challenges, with a goal of testing and facilitating the development of methods for analyzing astronomical images that will be used to measure weak gravitational lensing. This measurement requires extremely precise estimation of very small galaxy shape distortions, in the presence of far larger intrinsic galaxy shapes and distortions due to the blurring kernel caused by the atmosphere, telescope optics, and instrumental effects. The GREAT3 challenge is posed to the astronomy, machine learning, and statistics communities, and includes tests of three specific effects that are of immediate relevance to upcoming weak lensing surveys, two of which have never been tested in a community challenge before. These effects include many novel aspects including realistically complex galaxy models based on high-resolution imaging from space; a spatially varying, physically motivated blurring kernel; and a combination of multiple different exposures. To facilitate entry by people new to the field, and for use as a diagnostic tool, the simulation software for the challenge is publicly available, though the exact parameters used for the challenge are blinded.

abstract = {Precision weak gravitational lensing experiments require measurements of galaxy shapes accurate to {\textless}1 part in 1000. We investigate measurement biases, noted by Voigt {\&} Bridle and Melchior et al., that are common to shape measurement methodologies that rely upon fitting elliptical-isophote galaxy models to observed data. The first bias arises when the true galaxy shapes do not match the models being fit. We show that this 'underfitting bias' is due, at root, to these methods' attempts to use information at high spatial frequencies that have been destroyed by the convolution with the point spread function (PSF) and/or by sampling. We propose a new shape-measurement technique that is explicitly confined to observable regions of k-space. A second bias arises for galaxies whose ellipticity varies with radius. For most shape-measurement methods, such galaxies are subject to 'ellipticity gradient bias'. We show how to reduce such biases by factors of 20-100 within the new shape-measurement method. The resulting shear estimator has multiplicative errors {\textless}1 part in 103 for high signal-to-noise ratio images, even for highly asymmetric galaxies. Without any training or recalibration, the new method obtains Q = 3000 in the GREAT08 Challenge of blind shear reconstruction on low-noise galaxies, several times better than any previous method. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {Most of the matter in the Universe is not luminous, and can be observed only through its gravitational influence on the appearance of luminous matter. Weak gravitational lensing is a technique that uses the distortions of the images of distant galaxies as a tracer of dark matter: such distortions are induced as the light passes through large-scale distributions of dark matter in the foreground. The patterns of the induced distortions reflect the density of mass along the line of sight and its distribution, and the resulting 'cosmic shear' can be used to distinguish between alternative cosmologies. But previous attempts to measure this effect have been inconclusive. Here we report the detection of cosmic shear on angular scales of up to half a degree using 145,000 galaxies and along three separate lines of sight. We find that the dark matter is distributed in a manner consistent with either an open universe, or a flat universe that is dominated by a cosmological constant. Our results are inconsistent with the standard cold- dark-matter model.},

We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogues trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and twodimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40 per cent larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of S8 = $\sigma$8 â $\Omega$m/0.3 compared to Planck Collaboration XIII reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (r {\textless} 10 h-1 Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos and modifications to general relativity on $\Delta$$\Sigma$ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effect of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing shear has the potential to be the most powerful tool for constraining the nature of dark energy. However, accurate measurement of galaxy shear is crucial and has been shown to be non-trivial by the Shear TEsting Programme. Here, we demonstrate a fundamental limit to the accuracy achievable by model-fitting techniques, if oversimplistic models are used. We show that even if galaxies have elliptical isophotes, model-fitting methods which assume elliptical isophotes can have significant biases if they use the wrong profile. We use noisefree simulations to show that on allowing sufficient flexibility in the profile the biases can be made negligible. This is no longer the case if elliptical isophote models are used to fit galaxies made up of a bulge plus a disc, if these two components have different ellipticities. The limiting accuracy is dependent on the galaxy shape, but we find the most significant biases ({\~{}}1 per cent of the shear) for simple spiral-like galaxies. The implications for a given cosmic shear survey will depend on the actual distribution of galaxy morphologies in the Universe, taking into account the survey selection function and the point spread function. However, our results suggest that the impact on cosmic shear results from current and near future surveys may be negligible. Meanwhile, these results should encourage the development of existing approaches which are less sensitive to morphology, as well as methods which use priors on galaxy shapes learnt from deep surveys. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Weak lensing by large-scale structure is an invaluable cosmological tool given that most of the energy density of the concordance cosmology is invisible. Several large ground-based imaging surveys will attempt to measure this effect over the coming decade, but reliable control of the spurious lensing signal introduced by atmospheric turbulence and telescope optics remains a challenging problem. We address this challenge with a demonstration that point spread function (PSF) effects on measured galaxy shapes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) can be corrected with existing analysis techniques. In this work, we co-add existing SDSS imaging on the equatorial stripe in order to build a data set with the statistical power to measure cosmic shear, while using a rounding kernel method to null out the effects of the anisotropic PSF. We build a galaxy catalogue from the combined imaging, characterize its photometric properties and show that the spurious shear remaining in this catalogue after the PSF correction is negligible compared to the expected cosmic shear signal.We identify a new source of systematic error in the shear-shear autocorrelations arising from selection biases related to masking. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which this method is expected to be useful for upcoming ground-based surveys that have lensing as one of the science goals, and identify the systematic errors that can reduce its efficacy. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Weak lensing experiments are a powerful probe into cosmology through their measurement of the mass distribution of the universe. A challenge for this technique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes of distant galaxies. In this paper, we investigate noise bias, a systematic error that arises from second-order noise terms in the shape measurement process. We first derive analytical expressions for the bias of general maximum-likelihood estimators in the presence of additive noise. We then find analytical expressions for a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modelled and fitted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for this very simple case we find a significant effect. We also extend our analysis to a more realistic six-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We find that the noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies of SNR 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the systematic requirements for future all-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this effect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an associated paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

It fits PSF-convolved two-component (disc plus bulge) models to measure the ellipticity of each galaxy, with Bayesian marginalization over model nuisance parameters of galaxy position, size, brightness and bulge fraction. The method allows optimal joint measurement of multiple, dithered image exposures, taking into account imaging distortion and the alignment of the multiple measurements. We discuss the effects of noise bias on the likelihood distribution of galaxy ellipticity. Two sets of image simulations that mirror the observed properties of CFHTLenS have been created to establish the method's accuracy and to derive an empirical correction for the effects of noise bias. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (http://legacysurvey.org/) are a combination of three public projects (the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the BeijingâArizona Sky Survey, and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image â14,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 Î¼m) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.}

abstract = {To reach the full potential for the next generation of weak lensing surveys, it is necessary to mitigate the contamination of intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies in the observed cosmic shear signal. The self calibration (SC) of intrinsic alignments provides an independent method to measure the IA signal from the survey data and the photometric redshift information. It operates differently from the marginalization method based on IA modeling. In this work, we present the first application of SC to the KiDS450 data and the KV450 data, to split directly the intrinsic shape - galaxy density (Ig) correlation signal and the gravitational shear - galaxy density (Gg) correlation signal, using the information from photometric redshift (photo-z). We achieved a clear separation of the two signals and performed several validation tests. Our measured signals are found to be in general agreement with the KiDS450 cosmic shear best-fit cosmology, for both lensing and IA measurements. For KV450, we use partial (high-z) data, and our lensing measurements are also in good agreement with KV450 cosmic shear best-fit, however, our IA signal suggests a larger IA amplitude. We discussed the impact of photo-z quality on IA detection and several other potential systematic biases. Finally, we discuss the potential application of the information extracted for both the lensing signal and the IA signal in future surveys.},

abstract = {The GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2008 (GREAT08) Challenge focuses on a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations in cosmology. The shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine the properties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from those galaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. The observed galaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes must be precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution and noise. The worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significant progress in techniques to measure these distortions via the Shear TEsting Program (STEP). Via STEP, we have run challenges within our own community, and come to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideally matched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computational learning. Thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we are seeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities.

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

abstract = {We report the detection of a significant (5.5 $\delta$) excess of correlations between galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes. This detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure was made using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin2 obtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) with the UH8K and CFH12K panoramic CCD cameras. The amplitude of the excess correlation is 2.2 Â± 0.2{\%} at 1 arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lensing effect induced by large-scale structure. We provide a quantitative analysis of systematics which could contribute to the signal and show that the net effect is small and can be corrected for. In particular, we show that the spurious excess of correlations caused by the residual of the anisotropic Point Spread Function (PSF) correction is well below the measured signal. We show that the measured ellipticity correlations behave as expected for a gravitational shear signal. The relatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints on cosmological models. However the data are in favor of cluster normalized cosmological models, and marginally reject Cold Dark Matter models with ($\Omega$ = 0.3, $\sigma$8 {\textless} 0.6) or ($\Omega$ = 1, $\sigma$8 = 1). The detection of cosmic shear demonstrates the technical feasibility of using weak lensing surveys to measure dark matter clustering and the potential for cosmological parameter measurements, in particular with upcoming wide field CCD cameras.},

abstract = {Most of the matter in the Universe is not luminous, and can be observed only through its gravitational influence on the appearance of luminous matter. Weak gravitational lensing is a technique that uses the distortions of the images of distant galaxies as a tracer of dark matter: such distortions are induced as the light passes through large-scale distributions of dark matter in the foreground. The patterns of the induced distortions reflect the density of mass along the line of sight and its distribution, and the resulting 'cosmic shear' can be used to distinguish between alternative cosmologies. But previous attempts to measure this effect have been inconclusive. Here we report the detection of cosmic shear on angular scales of up to half a degree using 145,000 galaxies and along three separate lines of sight. We find that the dark matter is distributed in a manner consistent with either an open universe, or a flat universe that is dominated by a cosmological constant. Our results are inconsistent with the standard cold- dark-matter model.},

The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, $\Omega$b h 2, $\Omega$c h 2, and $\Omega$$\Lambda$, are each determined to a precision of â¼1.5{\%}. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3{\%}, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5$\sigma$ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their $\Lambda$CDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r {\textless} 0.13 (95{\%} CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to ; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to âm $\nu$ {\textless} 0.44 eV (95{\%} CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 Â± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We present first results from the third GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT3) challenge, the third in a sequence of challenges for testing methods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from simulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three specific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying shear fields. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by {\~{}}1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy type as measured by the S{\'{e}}rsic index, are quantified for the first time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities to galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and defocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in which additive shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between galaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial radii of galaxy haloes, independent of the details of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7.We generalize the approach of Baldauf et al. to remove small-scale information (below 2 and 4 h-1 Mpc for lensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient differs from unity.We derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131 deg2, containing 69 150, 62 150 and 35 088 galaxies with mean redshifts of 0.11, 0.28 and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations.When we vary both s8 and $\Omega$m (and marginalize over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat $\lambda$ cold dark matter model, the bestconstrained quantity is s8($\Omega$m/0.25)0.57 = 0.80 Â± 0.05 (1$\sigma$, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors (photometric redshift and shear calibration) have comparable contributions, and we have fixed ns = 0.96 and h = 0.7. These strong constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, constraints on $\sigma$8, $\Omega$m, H0, wde and âmv become 30-80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break several parameter degeneracies. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps of projected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. We use data from the 154 deg2 covered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary approach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that of traditional two-point statistical analysis techniques. Using a series of numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing conditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the projected matter distribution of large-scale structure. We validate our analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that the two-point correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed in the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement of the third-order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth-order moment. Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3Â° on the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps are not only consistent with the results obtained by the traditional shear approach, but they also appear promising for new techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the projected dark matter distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 Â± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 Â± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 Â± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 Â± 3.4 kms-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Luminous tracers have been used extensively to map the large-scale matter distribution in the Universe. Similarly the dynamics of stars or galaxies can be used to estimate masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. However, assumptions need to be made about the dynamical state or how well galaxies trace the underlying dark matter distribution. The gravitational tidal field affects the paths of photons, leading to observable effects. This phenomenon, gravitational lensing, has become an important tool in cosmology because it probes the mass distribution directly. In these lecture notes we introduce the main relevant quantities and terminology, but the subsequent discussion is mostly limited to weak gravitational lensing, the small coherent distortion of the shapes of distant galaxies by intervening structures. We focus on some of the issues in measuring accurate shapes and review the various applications of weak gravitational lensing, as well as some recent results.},

abstract = {Metacalibration is a new technique for measuring weak gravitational lensing shear that is unbiased for isolated galaxy images. In this work we test metacalibration with overlapping, or âblendedâ galaxy images. Using standard metacalibration, we find a few percent bias for galaxy densities relevant for current surveys, and that this bias increases with increasing galaxy number density. We show that this bias is not due to blending itself, but rather to shear-dependent object detection. If object detection is shear independent, no deblending of images is needed, in principle. We demonstrate that detection biases are accurately removed when including object detection in the metacalibration process, a technique we call metadetection. This process involves applying an artificial shear to images of small regions of sky, and performing detection and measurement on the sheared images in order to calculate a shear response. We show that the method works up to second-order shear effects even in highly blended scenes. However, because the space between objects is sheared coherently in metadetection, the accuracy is ultimately limited by how closely this process matches real data, in which some, but not all, galaxies images are sheared coherently. We find that even for the worst case scenario, in which the space between objects is completely unsheared, the bias is at most a few tenths of a percent for future surveys. We show that the primary technical challenge for metadetection, deconvolution using a spatially varying point-spread-function, does not result in a significant bias for typical imaging surveys. Finally, we discuss additional technical challenges that must be met in order to implement metadetection for real surveys.},

In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4Âµm, 4.6Âµm, 12Âµm and 22Âµm) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

abstract = {If there is one key element in the social psychology of behaviour that is still missing from Stern's ABC model, it is the role of habit. Stern (2000) acknowledges this and proposes that an integrated model of environmentally signififile:///C:/Users/SK-VI/Desktop/è¡¥åreference/0112441.pdfcant behaviour would consist of four factors: 1) attitudes; 2) contextual factors; 3) personal capabilities; and 4) habits. The general thrust of Stern's suggestion is very similar to an attempt made almost thirty years ago by social psychologist Harry Triandis to develop an integrated model of 'interpersonal' behaviour. Triandis recognised the key role played by both social factors and emotions in forming intentions. He also highlighted the importance of past behaviour on the present. On the basis of these observations, Triandis proposed a Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (Figure 4) in which intentions â as in many of the other models â are immediate antecedents of behaviour. But crucially, habits also mediate behaviour. And both these influences are moderated by facilitating conditions. Behaviour in any situation is, according to Triandis, a function partly of the intention, partly of the habitual responses, and partly of the situational constraints and conditions. The intention is influenced by social and affective factors as well as by rational deliberations. One is neither fully deliberative, in Triandis' model, nor fully automatic. One is neither fully autonomous nor entirely social. Behaviour is influenced by moral beliefs, but the impact of these is moderated both by emotional drives and cognitive limitations. Social factors include norms, roles and self-concept. Norms are the social rules about what should and should not be done. Roles are 'sets of behaviours that are considered appropriate for persons holding particular positions in a group' (Triandis, 1977). Self-concept refers to the idea that a person has of his/herself, the goals that it is appropriate for the person to pursue or to eschew, and the behaviours that the person does or does not engage in. Emotional responses to a decision or to a decision situation are assumed distinct from rational-instrumental evaluations of consequences, and may include both positive and negative emotional responses of varying strengths. Affect has a more or less unconscious input to decision-making, and is governed by instinctive behavioural responses to particular situations. Figure 3 Triandis' Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour Triandis offers an explicit role for affective factors on behavioural intentions. In more recent writings, the attempt to incorporate emotional antecedents into a model of action has received a lot of support (Bagozzi et al., 2002, Steg et al., 2001). Triandis theory of interpersonal behaviour captures many of the criticisms levelled at rational choice theory in a way that is not done by some of the other models. It also can be, and has been, used as a framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. It also can be, and has been, used as the framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. Far less use has been made of Triandis work than was made of the Ajzen-Fishbein work. However, where it has been used, it appears to have additional explanatory value over Ajzen's model, in particular, by including role beliefs and habits. Affect},

abstract = {The distortion field defined by the ellipticities of galaxy shapes projected on the sky can be uniquely decomposed into a gradient and a curl component. If the observed ellipticities are induced by weak gravitational lensing, then the distortion field is curl free. Here we show that, in contrast, the distortion field resulting from intrinsic spin alignments is not curl free. This provides a powerful discriminant between lensing and intrinsic contributions to observed ellipticity correlations. We also show how these contributions can be disentangled statistically from the ellipticity correlations or computed locally from circular integrals of the ellipticity field. This allows for an unambiguous detection of intrinsic galaxy alignments in the data. When the distortions are dominated by lensing, as occurs at high redshifts, the decomposition provides a valuable tool for understanding properties of the noise and systematic errors. These techniques can be applied equally well to the polarization of the microwave background, where it can be used to separate curl-free scalar perturbations from those produced by gravity waves or defects.},

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the large scale structure can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in the Universe directly and thus to probe cosmological models. The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has demonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In the currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the shear field contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to be unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an intrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may signify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this paper we show that B-modes in fact are produced by lensing itself. The effect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in particular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift. After presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field into E- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation functions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical estimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting B-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its relative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with comparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. The relevance of this effect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed; it can not account for the apparent detection of a B-mode contribution on large angular scales in the cosmic shear analysis of van Waerbeke et al. (2002).},

abstract = {For cosmic shear to become an accurate cosmological probe, systematic errors in the shear measurement method must be unambiguously identified and corrected for. Previous work of this series has demonstrated that cosmic shears can be measured accurately in Fourier space in the presence of background noise and finite pixel size, without assumptions on the morphologies of galaxy and PSF. The remaining major source of error is source Poisson noise, due to the finiteness of source photon number. This problem is particularly important for faint galaxies in space-based weak lensing measurements, and for ground-based images of short exposure times. In this work, we propose a simple and rigorous way of removing the shear bias from the source Poisson noise. Our noise treatment can be generalized for images made of multiple exposures through MultiDrizzle. This is demonstrated with the SDSS and COSMOS/ACS data. With a large ensemble of mock galaxy images of unrestricted morphologies, we show that our shear measurement method can achieve sub-percent level accuracy even for images of signal-to-noise ratio less than 5 in general, making it the most promising technique for cosmic shear measurement in the ongoing and upcoming large scale galaxy surveys.},

abstract = {The tilt, rotation, or offset of each CCD with respect to the focal plane, as well as the distortion of the focal plane itself, cause shape distortions to the observed objects, an effect typically known as field distortion (FD). We point out that FD provides a unique way of quantifying the accuracy of cosmic shear measurement. The idea is to stack the shear estimators from galaxies that share similar FD-induced shape distortions. Given that the latter can be calculated with parameters from astrometric calibrations, the accuracy of the shear estimator can be directly tested on real images. It provides a way to calibrate the multiplicative and additive shear recovery biases within the scientific data itself, without requiring simulations or any external data sets. We use the CFHTLenS images to demonstrate the accuracy of the Fourier{\_}Quad shear recovery method. We highlight some details in our image processing pipeline, including background removal, source identification and deblending, astrometric calibration, star selection for PSF reconstruction, noise reduction, etc.. We show that in the shear ranges of -0.005 {\textless} g{\_}1 {\textless} 0.005 and -0.008 {\textless} g{\_}2 {\textless} 0.008, the multiplicative biases are at the level of {\textless} 0.04. Slight additive biases on the order of 5E-4 (6 sigma) are identified for sources provided by the official CFHTLenS catalog (not using its shear catalog), but are minor (4 sigma) for source catalog generated by our Fourier{\_}Quad pipeline.},

abstract = {Neglecting the second order corrections in weak lensing measurements can lead to a few percent uncertainties on cosmic shears, and becomes more important for cluster lensing mass reconstructions. Existing methods which claim to measure the reduced shears are not necessarily accurate to the second order when a point spread function (PSF) is present. We show that the method of Zhang (2008) exactly measures the reduced shears at the second order level in the presence of PSF. A simple theorem is provided for further confirming our calculation, and for judging the accuracy of any shear measurement method at the second order based on its properties at the first order. The method of Zhang (2008) is well defined mathematically. It does not require assumptions on the morphologies of galaxies and the PSF. To reach a sub-percent level accuracy, the CCD pixel size is required to be not larger than 1/3 of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF, regardless of whether the PSF has a power-law or exponential profile at large distances. Using a large ensemble (107) of mock galaxies of unrestricted morphologies, we study the shear recovery accuracy under different noise conditions. We find that contaminations to the shear signals from the noise of background photons can be removed in a well defined way because they are not correlated with the source shapes. The residual shear measurement errors due to background noise are consistent with zero at the sub-percent level even when the amplitude of such noise reaches about 1/10 of the source flux within the half-light radius of the source. This limit can in principle be extended further with a larger galaxy ensemble in our simulations. On the other hand, the source Poisson noise remains to be a cause of systematic errors. For a sub-percent level accuracy, our method requires the amplitude of the source Poisson noise to be less than 1/80 â¼ 1/100 of the source flux within the half-light radius of the source, corresponding to collecting roughly 104 source photons. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

abstract = {A long-standing problem in weak lensing is about how to construct cosmic shear estimators from galaxy images. Conventional methods average over a single quantity per galaxy to estimate each shear component. We show that any such shear estimators must reduce to a highly non-linear form when the galaxy image is described by three parameters (pure ellipse), even in the absence of the point spread function (PSF). In the presence of the PSF, we argue that this class of shear estimators are not likely to exist. Alternatively, we propose a new way of measuring the cosmic shear: instead of averaging over a single value from each galaxy, we average over two numbers, and then take the ratio to estimate the shear component. In particular, the two numbers correspond to the numerator and denominator that generate the quadrupole moments of the galaxy image in Fourier space, as proposed by Zhang. This yields a statistically unbiased estimate of the shear component. Consequently, measurements of the n-point spatial correlations of the shear fields should also be modified: one needs to derive the ratio of the two correlation functions to get the desired unbiased shear correlation. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {The aperture mass statistic is a common tool used in weak lensing studies. By convolving lensing maps with a filter function of a specific scale, chosen to be larger than the scale on which the noise is dominant, the lensing signal may be boosted with respect to the noise. This allows for detection of structures at increased fidelity. Furthermore, higher order statistics of the aperture mass (such as its skewness or kurtosis), or counting of the peaks seen in the resulting aperture mass maps, provide a convenient and effective method to constrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we more fully explore the formalism underlying the aperture mass statistic. We demonstrate that the aperture mass statistic is formally identical to a wavelet transform at a specific scale. Further, we show that the filter functions most frequently used in aperture mass studies are not ideal, being non-local in both real and Fourier space. In contrast, the wavelet formalism offers a number of wavelet functions that are localized both in real and Fourier space, yet similar to the optimal aperture mass filters commonly adopted. Additionally, for a number of wavelet functions, such as the starlet wavelet, very fast algorithms exist to compute the wavelet transform. This offers significant advantages over the usual aperture mass algorithm when it comes to image processing time, demonstrating speed-up factors of {\~{}}5-1200 for aperture radii in the range 2-64pixels on an image of 1024 Ã 1024pixels. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Context. We present the CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey (CARS). It is a virtual, multi-colour survey that is based on public archive images from the Deep and Wide components of the CFHT-Legacy-Survey (CFHTLS). Our main scientific interests in the CFHTLS Wide-part of CARS are optical searches for galaxy clusters from low to high redshift and their subsequent study with photometric and weak-gravitational lensing techniques. Aims. As a first step in the CARS project, we present multi-colour catalogues from 37 sq. degrees of the CFHTLS-Wide component. Our aims are first to create astrometrically and photometrically well-calibrated co-added images from publicly available CFHTLS data. Second, we offer five-band (u*gâ²râ²iâ²zâ²) multi-band catalogues with an emphasis on reliable estimates for object colours. These are subsequently used for photometric redshift estimates. Methods. We consider all those CFHTLS-Wide survey pointings that were publicly available on January 2008 and that also have fiveband coverage in u *gâ²râ²iâ²zâ². The data were calibrated and processed with our GaBoDS/THELI image processing pipeline. The quality of the resulting images was thoroughly checked against the Sloan-Digital-Sky Survey (SDSS) and already public high-end CFHTLS data products. From the co-added images we extracted source catalogues and determined photometric redshifts using the public code Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ). Fifteen of our survey fields directly overlap with public spectra from the VIMOS VLT deep (VVDS), DEEP2 and SDSS redshift surveys, which we used for calibration and verification of our redshift estimates. Furthermore we applied a novel technique, based on studies of the angular galaxy cross-correlation function, to quantify the reliability of photo-z's. Results. With this paper we present 37 sq. degrees of homogeneous and high-quality five-colour photometric data from, the CFHTLS-Wide survey. The median seeing of our data is better than 0â³9 in all bands and our catalogues reach a 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of about iâ²AB â 24.5. Comparisons with the SDSS indicate that most of our survey fields are photometrically calibrated to an accuracy of 0.04 mag or better. This allows us to derive photometric redshifts of homogeneous quality over the whole survey area. The accuracy of our high-confidence photo-z sample (10-15 galaxies per sq. arcmin) is estimated with external spectroscopic data to $\sigma$ $\Delta$z/(1+z) â 0.04-0.05 up to iâ²AB {\textless} 24 with typically only 1-3{\%} outliers. In the spirit of the Legacy Survey we make our catalogues available to the astronomical community. Our products consist of multi-colour catalogues and supplementary information, such as image masks and JPEG files to visually inspect our catalogues. Interested users can obtain the data by request to the authors. {\textcopyright} ESO 2009.},

abstract = {We propose easy ways of correcting for the systematic errors caused by the photon noise and the pixelation effect in cosmic shear measurements. Our treatment of noise can reliably remove the noise contamination to the cosmic shear even when the flux density of the noise is comparable with those of the sources. For pixelated images, we find that one can accurately reconstruct their corresponding continuous images by interpolating the logarithms of the pixel readouts with either the Bicubic or the Bicubic Spline method as long as the pixel size is about less than the scale size of the point spread function (PSF; including the pixel response function), a condition which is almost always satisfied in practice. Our methodology is well defined regardless of the morphologies of the galaxies and the PSF. Despite that our discussion is based on the shear measurement method of Zhang, our way of treating the noise can in principle be considered in other methods, and the interpolation method that we introduce for reconstructing continuous images from pixelated ones is generally useful for digital image processing of all purposes. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

    abstract = "{We present cosmological parameter constraints from a tomographic weak gravitational lensing analysis of â¼450 deg2 of imaging data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). For a flat Î cold dark matter (ÎCDM) cosmology with a prior on H0 that encompasses the most recent direct measurements, we find \\$S\_8\\equiv \\sigma \_8\\sqrt\\{\\Omega \_\\{\\rm m\\}/0.3\\}=0.745\\pm 0.039\\$. This result is in good agreement with other low-redshift probes of large-scale structure, including recent cosmic shear results, along with pre-Planck cosmic microwave background constraints. A 2.3Ï tension in S8 and âsubstantial discordanceâ in the full parameter space is found with respect to the Planck 2015 results. We use shear measurements for nearly 15 million galaxies, determined with a new improved âself-calibratingâ version of lensfit validated using an extensive suite of image simulations. Four-band ugri photometric redshifts are calibrated directly with deep spectroscopic surveys. The redshift calibration is confirmed using two independent techniques based on angular cross-correlations and the properties of the photometric redshift probability distributions. Our covariance matrix is determined using an analytical approach, verified numerically with large mock galaxy catalogues. We account for uncertainties in the modelling of intrinsic galaxy alignments and the impact of baryon feedback on the shape of the non-linear matter power spectrum, in addition to the small residual uncertainties in the shear and redshift calibration. The cosmology analysis was performed blind. Our high-level data products, including shear correlation functions, covariance matrices, redshift distributions, and Monte Carlo Markov chains are available at http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl.}",

    abstract = "{We measure cosmic weak lensing shear power spectra with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey first-year shear catalog covering 137âdeg2 of the sky. Thanks to the high effective galaxy number density of â¼17âarcminâ2, even after conservative cuts such as a magnitude cut of i \\&lt; 24.5 and photometric redshift cut of 0.3 â¤ z â¤ 1.5, we obtain a high-significance measurement of the cosmic shear power spectra in four tomographic redshift bins, achieving a total signal-to-noise ratio of 16 in the multipole range 300 â¤ â â¤ 1900. We carefully account for various uncertainties in our analysis including the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, scatters and biases in photometric redshifts, residual uncertainties in the shear measurement, and modeling of the matter power spectrum. The accuracy of our power spectrum measurement method as well as our analytic model of the covariance matrix are tested against realistic mock shear catalogs. For a flat Î cold dark matter model, we find \\$S\\,\_\\{8\\}\\equiv \\sigma \_8(\\Omega \_\\{\\rm m\\}/0.3)^\\alpha =0.800^\\{+0.029\\}\_\\{-0.028\\}\\$ for Î± = 0.45 (\\$S\\,\_8=0.780^\\{+0.030\\}\_\\{-0.033\\}\\$ for Î± = 0.5) from our HSC tomographic cosmic shear analysis alone. In comparison with Planck cosmic microwave background constraints, our results prefer slightly lower values of S8, although metrics such as the Bayesian evidence ratio test do not show significant evidence for discordance between these results. We study the effect of possible additional systematic errors that are unaccounted for in our fiducial cosmic shear analysis, and find that they can shift the best-fit values of S8 by up to â¼0.6âÏ in both directions. The full HSC survey data will contain several times more area, and will lead to significantly improved cosmological constraints.}",

	abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing observations probe the spectrum and evolution of density fluctuations and the cosmological parameters that govern them. The nonlinear evolution of large-scale structure produces a non-Gaussian signal that is potentially observable in galaxy shear data. We study the three-point statistics of the convergence, specifically the bispectrum, using the dark matter halo approach, which describes the density field in terms of correlations between and within dark matter halos. Our approach allows us to study the effect of the mass distribution in observed fields, in particular the bias induced by the lack of rare massive halos (clusters) in observed fields. We show that the convergence skewness is primarily due to rare and massive dark matter halos, with skewness converging to its mean value only if halos of mass M > 1015 Mâ?are present. This calculational method can in principle be used to correct for such a bias as well as to search for more robust statistics related to the two- and three-point correlations.}

    abstract = "{Weak-lensing searches for galaxy clusters are plagued by low completeness and purity, severely limiting their usefulness for constraining cosmological parameters with the cluster mass function. A significant fraction of âfalse positivesâ?are due to projection of large-scale structure and as such carry information about the matter distribution. We demonstrate that by constructing a âpeak functionâ? in analogy to the cluster mass function, cosmological parameters can be constrained. To this end, we carried out a large number of cosmological N-body simulations in the Î©mâÏ? plane to study the variation of this peak function. We demonstrate that the peak statistics is able to provide constraints competitive with those obtained from cosmic-shear tomography from the same data set. By taking the full cross-covariance between the peak statistics and cosmic shear into account, we show that the combination of both methods leads to tighter constraints than either method alone can provide.}",

    "abstract": "We present a novel, web-based visual eye-tracking analytics tool called Gazealytics. Our open-source toolkit features a unified combination of gaze analytics features that support flexible exploratory analysis, along with annotation of areas of interest (AOI) and filter options based on multiple criteria to visually analyse eye tracking data across time and space. Gazealytics features coordinated views unifying spatiotemporal exploration of fixations and scanpaths for various analytical tasks. A novel matrix representation allows analysis of relationships between such spatial or temporal features. Data can be grouped across samples, user-defined AOIs or time windows of interest (TWIs) to support aggregate or filtered analysis of gaze activity. This approach exceeds the capabilities of existing systems by supporting flexible comparison between and within subjects, hypothesis generation, data analysis and communication of insights. We demonstrate in a walkthrough that Gazealytics supports multiple types of eye tracking datasets and analytical tasks.",

\label{sec:intro}

% This is my intro.

% Many MAS areas deal with infrastructure on top of agents instead of actual agent algorithms.


% Challenges: the real ``sim to real". Players are not as clean as agents. Must account for some error.

Understanding how individuals learn to coordinate and cooperate is an important problem in multiagent systems (MAS)~\cite{DafoeNature2021}.
Humans demonstrate effective teamwork in many aspects of daily life to achieve their goals, one of the best examples being in team sports.
In this paper, we advocate for using MAS to extend advanced analytics for real-world sports which, in turn, will help researchers understand how teamwork evolves, the conditions under which it succeeds, and support future multiagent research.
While there has been momentum to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into sports~\cite{tuyls2021game}, this paper articulates the unique position of MAS to address problems of interest in both the AI and sports communities.


In 2002, the Oakland Athletics adopted a new approach to constructing and managing baseball teams, a revolution in sports analytics hence known as Moneyball~\cite{lewis2004moneyball}: using empirical statistics as a basis for roster management.
Two decades later, most baseball teams employ a staff of analysts that support roster and strategic decisions with quantitative data~\cite{elitzur2020data}.
Baseball is classified as a ``striking game'' due to it's episodic and repetitive structure, allowing for relatively easily collected data that lends itself nicely to statistics.
However, statistics alone is unable to fully capture the complexity of ``invasion games'', defined by using a goal or hoop where attacks rely on invading opponent territory and players can interact anywhere on a playing surface (e.g., soccer, ice hockey, and basketball~\cite{ellis1983similarities}).
We argue that MAS is to invasion games what statistics is to striking games.
% , and that MAS is necessary to make significant advances in sports analytics, an industry expected to reach revenues of \$16.5 billion by 2030~\cite{analyticsMarket}.
Invasion games are well suited for the advancement of multiagent research by providing enclosed, structured environments with an abundance of data collection.
% to study and develop new models of coordination, strategic reasoning, and value decomposition.


% has only recently become advanced enough to support the growing analytics industry, estimated to reach revenues of \$16.5 billion by 2030~\cite{analyticsMarket}.
% Furthermore, statistics alone is unable to capture the high complexity of interactions in invasion games, since players are free to intermix and interact anywhere on the playing surface.
% however, the widespread adoption of analytics is not yet fully realized in ``invasion games'' which are defined by a scoring target (goal/hoop) with strategic characteristics of invading an opponent's territory for attacks, such as soccer, ice hockey, and basketball~\cite{ellis1983similarities}.
% This data collection has unlocked tremendous potential to support the growing analytics industry, estimated to reach revenues of \$16.5 billion by 2030~\cite{analyticsMarket}.
% Extending baseball's analytic approach to invasion sports is challenging due to the heightened complexity of player interactions and data collection.
% New data collection techniques that have emerged in recent years have demonstrated potential for more accurate player interaction modeling to support the sports analytics industry, estimated to reach revenues of \$16.5 billion by 2030~\cite{analyticsMarket}.
% Although there has been interest in using AI to progress analytics~\cite{tuyls2021game}, sports analytics has not yet become a significantly used real-world research domain within the specific field of MAS.
% The motivation of this paper is to contend that the field of analytics, specifically for invasion games, is a specifically well suited domain to implement and showcase existing MAS models, and support the development of new approaches to multiagent problems.
% requires significant involvement and advances in conjunction with MAS research.
% This includes studying the complexity of inter-player interactions and various game theoretical and economic strategies while deeply analyzing how successful human teams operate~\cite{lennartsson2015game}.
% Invasion sports analytics is poised to benefit from MAS to better model inter-player interactions.



Although there is ongoing investment in using AI in soccer analytics~\cite{tuyls2021game}, sports analytics generally has not been adopted as a typical research domain within MAS.
% despite many diverse multiagent characteristics.
This paper highlights several challenges from invasion team sports that are similar to MAS research topics at various levels of complexity and time horizons.
% making invasion team sports a compelling real-world problem space for the development of future MAS algorithms.
Coaches must identify players that coordinate well together, devise team-based strategies, and best responses in-match to outperform opponents.
We draw correlations between coaching challenges and the multiagent areas of team forming, coalition formation, and non-cooperative game theory.
Managing a sports team requires long-horizon planning across multiple seasons, generalizing team performance and planning player acquisitions, facing challenges similar to agent modelling, markets, and resource allocation.
We posit that MAS and sports analytics will benefit from each other's contributions at this intersection.

% Sports teams and leagues are complex multiagent systems composed of individuals or groups that operate at multiple time scales.
% Recent breakthroughs in data collection have been followed by increased prevalence of analysts across various free-flowing sports.
% While the field of sports analytics for free-flowing team sports has grown considerably in recent years, challenges in modeling the complex interactions between players has limited its widespread adoption.




% We argue that the environment of team sports is a rich real-world environment for future multiagent research which encapsulates a wide range of multiagent problems.

%the next three sentences need to directly connect these kinds of challenges with how they manifest in sports at (1) match level and (2) season level. 

% Within individual matches, players on teams operate in a well-defined enclosed environment with specific rules that govern their allowable actions.
% The environment yields explicit rewards in the form of points which can potentially support feedback-based learning algorithms like RL to learn the value of taking actions in various states or devising best response strategies to opponents.

% Team management, operating on a longer timescale, is also a well-defined environment containing a specific number of teams and matches, limited outcomes (wins, losses, draws), and possible financial restrictions such as salary cap or roster size.
% The construction of teams must consider complementary players that operate cohesively while being robust to injuries, poor individual performance, and different types of opponent teams.  
% %Teams may desire a diverse group of players with specialized skills to be robust to different types of opponent teams.
% %Across many matches, teams must also generalize towards several types of opponents to win championships.
% In turn, player evaluation informs financial decisions about how to allocate resources when building a team; however, producing performance metrics for specific roles may be more difficult to extract from data (i.e., defensive players).
% %requiring the development of reliable algorithms to inform various stakeholders. 
% To this end, managing a professional sports team involves economical and game theoretical challenges related to markets, negotiation, and mechanism design.


%my sense is that the following sentence here should say 'Complex inter-player interactions in invasion games create multi-dimensional challenges when attempting to value actions, players or team performance.' then 'Based on their similarities in methods xyz, environment xyz, and -something-, we anticipate that applying the domain ----- of sports to MAS will be a fruitful area of research.}

%citation here?
%These complex interactions range from teammates needing to coordinate and outperform opponents to the financial aspect of professional sports management.
%and includes many problems that are general motivations for MAS research.
%i feel like you don't need to say 'includes many problems that are general motivations for MAS research' we've made that clear now already I think. 

%to dave: this sentence above needs to be split up at the comma, with more elaboration in separate sentence on (1) rewards, and then separate sentence (2) role specialization. make the connected to MAS/AI even clearer.
% In theory, players should fully desire their team to be successful; however, mixed incentives exist that must also be considered (i.e., future contracts or competition for playing time).
%structure of this section of introduction (and corresponding sections in paper) should go: (1) qualities of MAS challenges that align with sports analytics - emphasizing/illustrating this as a relevant domain. (2) brief explanation of how these challenges manifest at two levels: matches, and seasons. (3) sentence like 'in this paper, we connect match level challenges with a coaching strategy, and season level challenges with management strategy, using examples in soccer, ice hockey, and basketball.'



%this paragraph needs to be restructured - purpose of paragraph is to make comparison between problems/applications in MAS and problems/applications in sports, correct? Need to have either individual sentences/examples that show this correlation on many levels (this MAS problem 1 is like sports problem 1) (problem 2 is like problem 2), or two sentences dedicated to MAS problems (list), then connect two sentences dedicated to Sports problems (list) and make them relate in following sentence. Choose which ordering of sentences makes most sense for the examples you want to use. 

% Various models to predict behavior and results encapsulate the sub-areas of agent (and opponent) models and capabilities, value-based modelling and cooperation, and game theory.
%rewrite above sentence. starting with 'various models' is vague and then 'encapsulate' is not directly recognizable verb - read it aloud, its kinda hard to understand. maybe start with something more like 'There are various MAS models, such as ---, that align with sub-areas of ----.' ? Took it out
% Optimizing the composition of a team to determine where specific players play contains problems of coalition structure generation, coordination, and collective behavior while needing to consider conditions and internal goals that agents might have depending on contract or playing status. Got rid of this one too

%suggestion to modify above two sentences: For example, when coaches and general managers work to optimize team composition, they must consider conditions and internal goals relating to financial contracts and playing status; these problems resonate with MAS research areas such as coalition structure generation, coordination, and collective behavior. (only apply this sentence if/when you choose to edit the above sentence ordering suggestion)

% The constraints of coordinating and managing sports teams are comparable to the various goals of team forming problems in MAS. 
% While many of these challenges are addressed by coaches and managers using domain knowledge and high-level statistics, the ability to provide quantitative support for those decisions is one area where MAS can make real impact within sports.
% The results of these decisions can then be measured and inform how models make predictions in the future.
% The ability to provide quantitative support for coaching and management decisions is one area where MAS can make real impact within sports.
% Although the policies of players cannot be modified like with artificial agents, the way teams are coached, organized, and managed is a rich real-world multiagent problem space worthy of future work.
While this paper does not exhaustively address multiagent challenges in sports, it rather works to make correlations between and suggests avenues for advancement in sports analytics and domains within MAS.

%good sentences to finish off I think.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item ``Coaching" - Formation and Strategy (optimal formations for team (or against opponents), who plays with who (special teams, lines, selfish players with contracts) and against who (this can be changing like in hockey), opponent modeling and prediction (IRL possibly?), cooperation/coordination (team structure/line members have large impact on success), need to watch for injuries (load management), who gets training time/resources (COMSOC)).
    
%     \item ``Management" - Roster Composition and Acquisitions (draft - predicting player trajectory (and how they fit in the projected team), scouting/acquisitions - how player fits in current team/would play well with, find gaps in current roster (player modeling), negotiation/markets through time/forward thinking (salary cap/contract negotiations), bonuses as a sub-team bonus?, who gets what fraction of the cap? (COMSOC))
    
%     \item ``Players" - preference elicitation, preference prediction, IRL about values, team/goal alignment

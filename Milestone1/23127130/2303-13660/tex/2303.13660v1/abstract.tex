This paper draws correlations between several challenges and opportunities within the area of team sports analytics and key research areas within multiagent systems (MAS).
% While analytics has revolutionized how sports like baseball are played and managed, free-flowing sports have lagged behind due to the significantly more complex player interactions.
% dynamics for which multiagent systems is well suited to address.
We specifically consider invasion games, defined as sports where players invade the opposing team's territory and can interact anywhere on a playing surface such as ice hockey, soccer, and basketball.
We argue that MAS is well-equipped to study invasion games and will benefit both MAS and sports analytics fields.
% which produces highly complex interactions, making MAS a particularly well suited domain to model these sports.
% progress on these complex challenges, and free-flowing team sports analytics is a compatible real-world domain for multiagent systems research.
Our discussion highlights areas for MAS implementation and further development along two axes: short-term in-game strategy (coaching) and long-term team planning (management).
% Our discussion describes how MAS can produce insights at the two levels where stakeholders make strategic team-based decisions: short-term in-game strategy (coaching) and long-term team planning (management).
% two different classes that operate at time scales and levels of complexity: coaching-based within match challenges and management-based long-horizon challenges.
% This paper connects challenges in invasion game team sports and significant research areas within MAS.

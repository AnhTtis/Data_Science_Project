This paper identified several challenges within invasion game sports analytics that are related to main research problems across MAS. 
We argue that MAS is to invasion games what statistics is to striking games.
% We argue that MAS contributions are necessary for the significant advancement of sports analytics in invasion games.
% , much like how statistics contributed to striking games like baseball.
%In this paper, we identified several challenges within invasion game sports analytics that are related to several main research problems across MAS.
Most team decisions are currently made using domain knowledge; however, the ability to provide quantitative support to these decisions is a promising real-world domain for future multiagent research.
Addressing many of these challenges will require further advancement in multiagent AI to better capture the full complexities of value decomposition, opponent modeling, and resource allocation along multiple time horizons.
% measure marginal contribution for different tasks, assess group performance for different goals, and devise strategies for navigating constrained financial environments.
% Sporting environments have no shortcoming of multiagent challenges, and progress in sports analytics and MAS is mutually beneficial to both areas.

% measure the behavioral and incentive impacts that other agents can have when estimating value, forming effective groups, and navigating financial markets within defined constraints.

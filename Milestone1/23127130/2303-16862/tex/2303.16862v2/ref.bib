	abstract = {We provide sufficient conditions under which the center-outward distribution and quantile functions introduced in Chernozhukov et al. (2017) and Hallin (2017) are homeomorphisms, thereby extending a recent result by Figalli (2018). Our approach relies on Cafarelli's classical regularity theory for the solutions of the Monge-Amp{\`e}re equation, but has to deal with difficulties related with the unboundedness at the origin of the density of the spherical uniform reference measure. Our conditions are satisfied by probabilities on Euclidean space with a general (bounded or unbounded) convex support which are not covered by Figalli. We also provide some additional results about center-outward distribution and quantile functions, including the fact that quantile sets exhibit a limiting form of the so-called ``lighthouse convexity'' property.},

	abstract = {We propose new concepts of statistical depth, multivariate quantiles, vector quantiles and ranks, ranks and signs, based on canonical transportation maps between a distribution of interest on ℝd and a reference distribution on the d-dimensional unit ball. The new depth concept, called Monge-Kantorovich depth, specializes to halfspace depth for d = 1 and in the case of spherical distributions, but for more general distributions, differs from the latter in the ability for its contours to account for non-convex features of the distribution of interest. We propose empirical counterparts to the population versions of those Monge-Kantorovich depth contours, quantiles, ranks, signs and vector quantiles and ranks, and show their consistency by establishing a uniform convergence property for empirical (forward and reverse) transport maps, which is the main theoretical result of this paper.},

@article{HallinReview,
	abstract = { Unlike the real line, the real space, in dimension d ≥ 2, is not canonically ordered. As a consequence, extending to a multivariate context fundamental univariate statistical tools such as quantiles, signs, and ranks is anything but obvious. Tentative definitions have been proposed in the literature but do not enjoy the basic properties (e.g., distribution-freeness of ranks, their independence with respect to the order statistic, their independence with respect to signs) they are expected to satisfy. Based on measure transportation ideas, new concepts of distribution and quantile functions, ranks, and signs have been proposed recently that, unlike previous attempts, do satisfy these properties. These ranks, signs, and quantiles have been used, quite successfully, in several inference problems and have triggered, in a short span of time, a number of applications: fully distribution-free testing for multiple-output regression, MANOVA, and VAR models; R-estimation for VARMA parameters; distribution-free testing for vector independence; multiple-output quantile regression; nonlinear independent component analysis; and so on. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, Volume 9 is March 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates. },

    "abstract": "For a probability P in $R^d$ its center outward distribution function $F_{\\pm}$, introduced in Chernozhukov et al. (2017) and Hallin et al. (2021), is a new and successful concept of multivariate distribution function based on mass transportation theory. This work proves, for a probability P with density locally bounded away from zero and infinity in its support, the continuity of the center-outward map on the interior of the support of P and the continuity of its inverse, the quantile, $Q_{\\pm}$. This relaxes the convexity assumption in del Barrio et al. (2020). Some important consequences of this continuity are Glivenko-Cantelli type theorems and characterisation of weak convergence by the stability of the center-outward map.",

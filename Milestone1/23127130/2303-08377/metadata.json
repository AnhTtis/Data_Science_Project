    "abstract": "PdCrO$_2$ films are synthesized on CuCrO$_2$ buffer layers on Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. This synthesis is accompanied by impurity phase segregation, which hampers the synthesis of high quality PdCrO$_2$ films. The potential causes of impurity phase segregation were studied by using a combination of experiments and ab initio calculations. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments revealed impurity phases of Cu$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$ alloy and chromium oxides, Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Cr$_3$O$_4$, in PdCrO$_2$. Calculations determined that oxygen deficiency can cause the impurity phase segregation. Therefore, preventing oxygen release from delafossites could suppress the impurity phase segregation. The amounts of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Cr$_3$O$_4$ depend differently on temperature and oxygen partial pressure. A reasonable theory-based explanation for this experimental observation is provided.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel construction for secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM) based on algebraic geometry (AG) codes. The proposed construction is inspired by the GASP code, where so-called gaps in a certain polynomial are utilized to achieve higher communication rates. Our construction considers the gaps in a Weierstrass semigroup of a rational place in an algebraic function field to achieve a similar increase in the rate. This construction shows that there is potential in utilizing AG codes and their subcodes in SDMM since we demonstrate a better performance compared to state-of-the-art schemes in some parameter regimes.",

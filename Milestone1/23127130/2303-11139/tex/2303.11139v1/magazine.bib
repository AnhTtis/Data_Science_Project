	abstract = {Briefing: To tackle the complexity of human and social factors in manufacturing systems, parallel manufacturing for industrial metaverses is proposed as a new paradigm in smart manufacturing for effective and efficient operations of those systems, where Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSSs) and the Internet of Minds (IoM) are regarded as its infrastructures and the “Artificial systems”, “Computational experiments” and “Parallel execution” (ACP) method is its methodological foundation for parallel evolution, closed-loop feedback, and collaborative optimization. In parallel manufacturing, social demands are analyzed and extracted from social intelligence for product R\&D and production planning, and digital workers and robotic workers perform the majority of the physical and mental work instead of human workers, contributing to the realization of low-cost, high-efficiency and zero-inventory manufacturing. A variety of advanced technologies such as Knowledge Automation (KA), blockchain, crowdsourcing and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) provide powerful support for the construction of parallel manufacturing, which holds the promise of breaking the constraints of resource and capacity, and the limitations of time and space. Finally, the effectiveness of parallel manufacturing is verified by taking the workflow of customized shoes as a case, especially the unmanned production line named FlexVega.},

Recent Findings The current study shows that a decade was not enough to provide a reference implementation or application of Industry 4.0, like smart factories. In 2011, Industry 4.0 was mentioned for the first time in the scientific community. Industry 4.0 arrived with many new enabling technologies and buzzwords, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Digital Twins (DT).},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0, an initiative from Germany, has become a globally adopted term in the past decade. Many countries have introduced similar strategic initiatives, and a considerable research effort has been spent on developing and implementing some of the Industry 4.0 technologies. At the ten-year mark of the introduction of Industry 4.0, the European Commission announced Industry 5.0. Industry 4.0 is considered to be technology-driven, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven. The co-existence of two Industrial Revolutions invites questions and hence demands discussions and clarifications. We have elected to use five of these questions to structure our arguments and tried to be unbiased for the selection of the sources of information and for the discussions around the key issues. It is our intention that this article will spark and encourage continued debate and discussion around these topics.},

	abstract = {Industry 5.0 blows the whistle on global industrial transformation. It aims to place humans’ well-being at the center of manufacturing systems, thereby achieving social goals beyond employment and growth to provide prosperity robustly for the sustainable development of all humanity. However, the current exploration of In­ dustry 5.0 is still in its infancy where research findings are relatively scarce and little systematic. This paper first reviews the evolutionary vein of Industry 5.0 and three leading characteristics of Industry 5.0: human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency. The connotation system of Industry 5.0 is discussed, and its diversified essence is analyzed. Then, this paper constructs a tri-dimension system architecture for implementing Industry 5.0, namely, the technical dimension, reality dimension, and application dimension. The paper further discusses key enablers, the future implementation path, potential applications, and challenges of realistic scenarios of Industry 5.0. Finally, the limitations of the current research are discussed with potential future research directions highlighted. It is expected that this review work will arouse lively discussions and debates, and bring together the strengths of all beings for building a comprehensive system of Industry 5.0.},

	abstract = {Manufacturers are constantly looking to enhance the performance of their manufacturing systems by improving their ability to address disruptions and disturbances, while reducing cost and maximizing quantity and quality. Even though innovative mechanisms for adaptability and ﬂexibility continuously contribute to the smart manufacturing evolutionary process, they generally stop short of providing a capability for coordinated on-line learning. This is especially true when that learning requires exploration outside of established operational boundaries or uses artiﬁcial intelligence (as opposed to purely human intelligence) as part of the dynamic implementation of learning. In this work, we provide a vision for the development of an automated learning control architecture to extend the adaptability and ﬂexibility capabilities of manufacturing systems. As part of this vision, we describe a set of requirements and objectives that, if addressed, provide an environment to allow distributed and automated learning across the manufacturing ecosystem. We then provide an example communication and control architecture that meets these requirements and objectives by gathering information, building a dynamic knowledge base, distributing intelligence, making decisions, and adapting the control commands sent to the equipment and people across the manufacturing ecosystem. The example architecture leverages both centralized and distributed control strategies and the ability to switch between the strategies to gather and learn from information in the system. Example case studies are provided illustrating how this architecture can be used to improve manufacturing system performance.},

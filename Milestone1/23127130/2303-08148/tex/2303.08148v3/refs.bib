  abstract = {Non-Abelian anyons--particles whose exchange noncommutatively transforms a system’s quantum state--are widely sought for the exotic fundamental physics they harbour and for quantum computing applications. Numerous blueprints now exist for stabilizing the simplest type of non-Abelian anyon, defects binding Majorana modes, by interfacing widely available materials. Here we introduce a device fabricated from conventional fractional quantum Hall states and s-wave superconductors that supports exotic non-Abelian defects binding parafermionic zero modes, which generalize Majorana bound states. We show that these new modes can be experimentally identified (and distinguished from Majoranas) using Josephson measurements. We also provide a practical recipe for braiding parafermionic zero modes and show that they give rise to non-Abelian statistics. Interestingly, braiding in our setup produces a richer set of topologically protected operations when compared with the Majorana case. As a byproduct, we establish a new, experimentally realistic Majorana platform in weakly spin-orbit-coupled materials such as gallium arsenide.},

abstract = {Computing the electric polarization of a crystal is surprisingly tricky, but it can be tackled with the help of a topological concept, the so-called Berry phase. Extensions to higher multiple moments, such as quadrupole and octupole, are even trickier. Benalcazar et al. built a theoretical framework for dealing with these moments in certain types of solids. In the presence of some crystalline symmetries, the quadrupole moment is quantized, and the corners of the system play host to fractionally charged, topologically protected states. These predictions may be testable in cold atom and photonic systems. Science, this issue p. 61 Some crystalline symmetries can quantize the electric quadrupole and octupole moments of a solid. The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological phases of matter.}}

  abstract = {Topological phases in (2+1)-dimensions are frequently equipped with global symmetries, like conjugation, bilayer or electric-magnetic duality, that relabel anyons without affecting the topological structures. Twist defects are static point-like objects that permute the labels of orbiting anyons. Gauging these symmetries by quantizing defects into dynamical excitations leads to a wide class of more exotic topological phases referred as twist liquids, which are generically non-Abelian. We formulate a general gauging framework, characterize the anyon structure of twist liquids and provide solvable lattice models that capture the gauging phase transitions. We explicitly demonstrate the gauging of the Z2-symmetric toric code, SO(2N)1 and SU(3)1 state as well as the S3-symmetric SO(8)1 state and a non-Abelian chiral state we call the “4-Potts” state.},

A deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter---topologically ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research into engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two-dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order in both non-interacting and many-body regimes.},

	Abstract = {The intriguing many-body phases of quantum matter arise from the interplay of particle interactions, spatial symmetries, and external fields. Generating these phases in an engineered system could provide deeper insight into their nature. Using superconducting qubits, we simultaneously realize synthetic magnetic fields and strong particle interactions, which are among the essential elements for studying quantum magnetism and fractional quantum Hall phenomena. The artificial magnetic fields are synthesized by sinusoidally modulating the qubit couplings. In a closed loop formed by the three qubits, we observe the directional circulation of photons, a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate strong interactions through the creation of photon vacancies, or `holes', which circulate in the opposite direction. The combination of these key elements results in chiral ground-state currents. Our work introduces an experimental platform for engineering quantum phases of strongly interacting photons.},

	Abstract = {Extensions of Berry's phase and the quantum Hall effect have led to the discovery of new states of matter with topological properties. Traditionally, this has been achieved using magnetic fields or spin--orbit interactions, which couple only to charged particles. For neutral ultracold atoms, synthetic magnetic fields have been created that are strong enough to realize the Harper--Hofstadter model. We report the first observation of Bose--Einstein condensation in this system and study the Harper--Hofstadter Hamiltonian with one-half flux quantum per lattice unit cell. The diffraction pattern of the superfluid state directly shows the momentum distribution of the wavefunction, which is gauge-dependent. It reveals both the reduced symmetry of the vector potential and the twofold degeneracy of the ground state. We explore an adiabatic many-body state preparation protocol via the Mott insulating phase and observe the superfluid ground state in a three-dimensional lattice with strong interactions.},

These topological obstructions are closely related to obstructions to the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions. We show that by taking two copies of a gapped, free fermionic system with complex conjugate Hamiltonians, it is always possible to overcome these obstructions. This allows us to write the ground state in matrix product form using Grassmann-valued bond variables, and show insensitivity of the ground state density matrix to boundary conditions.}

abstract = {Two genuinely quantum mechanical models for an antiferromagnetic linear chain with nearest neighbor interactions are constructed and solved exactly, in the sense that the ground state, all the elementary excitations and the free energy are found. A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter λ which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.}

We prove that, if two observables anticommute with each other at large distance, then the nonvanishing spectral gap implies exponential decay of the corresponding correlation. When two observables commute with each other at large distance, the connected correlation function decays exponentially under the gap assumption. If the observables behave as a vector under the U(1) rotation of a global symmetry of the system, we use previous results on the large distance decay of the correlation function to show the stronger statement that the correlation function itself, rather than just the connected correlation function, decays exponentially under the gap assumption on a lattice with a certain self-similarity in (fractal) dimensions D < 2. In particular, if the system is translationally invariant in one of the spatial directions, then this self-similarity condition is automatically satisfied. We also treat systems with long-range, power-law decaying interactions.},

From the mathematical point of view, their relationships are described by a certain 2-category associated to an even integer-valued symmetric bilinear form (the matrix of Chern–Simons couplings). We argue that boundary conditions correspond to Lagrangian subgroups in the finite abelian group classifying bulk line operators (the discriminant group). We describe properties of boundary line operators; in particular we compute the boundary associator. We also study codimension one defects (surface operators) in abelian Chern–Simons theories. As an application, we obtain a classification of such theories up to isomorphism, in general agreement with the work of Belov and Moore.}

	Abstract = {We shall define and develop the properties of cohomology groups Hn(G, A) which can be associated to a pair (G, A) where G is a separable locally compact group operating as a topological transformation group of automorphisms on the polonais abelian group A. This work extends the results in [29] and [30], and these groups are to be viewed as analogues of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane groups for discrete G and A. Our cohomology groups in dimension one are classes of continuous crossed homomorphisms, and in dimension two classify topological group extensions of G by A. We characterize our cohomology groups in all dimensions axiomatically, and show that two different cochain complexes can be used to construct them. We define induced modules and prove a version of Shapiro's lemma which includes as a special case the Mackey imprimitivity theorem. We show that the abelian groups Hn(G, A) are themselves topological groups in a natural way and we investigate this additional structure.},

@article{MooreIV,
	Abstract = {In this paper we shall apply the cohomology groups constructed in [14] to a variety of problems in analysis. We show that cohomology classes admit direct integral decompositions, and we obtain as a special case a new proof of the existence of direct integral decompositions of unitary representations. This also leads to a Frobenius reciprocity theorem for induced modules, and we obtain splitting theorems for direct integrals of tori analogous to known results for direct sums. We also obtain implementation theorems for groups of automorphisms of von Neumann algebras. We show that the splitting group topology on the two-dimensional cohomology groups agrees with other naturally defined topologies and we find conditions under which this topology is T2. Finally we resolve several questions left open concerning splitting groups in a previous paper [13].},

In this work, we present an effective proof of the Cartan formula at the cochain level when the field is F2. More explicitly, for an arbitrary pair of cocycles and any non-negative integer, we construct a natural coboundary that descends to the associated instance of the Cartan formula. Our construction of Cartan coboundaries works for general algebras over the Barratt-Eccles operad, in particular, for the singular cochains of spaces, a case for which we have developed open source software.}

  abstract      = {Topology has recently become a focus in condensed matter physics, arising in the context of the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators. In both of these cases, the topology of the system is defined through bulk properties (`topological invariants') but detected through surface properties. Here we measure three topological invariants of a quantum Hall material---photonic Landau levels in curved space---through local electromagnetic and gravitational responses of the bulk material. Viewing the material as a many-port circulator, the Chern number (a topological invariant) manifests as spatial winding of the phase of the circulator. The accumulation of particles near points of high spatial curvature and the moment of inertia of the resultant particle density distribution quantify two additional topological invariants---the mean orbital spin and the chiral central charge. We find that these invariants converge to their global values when probed over increasing length scales (several magnetic lengths), consistent with the intuition that the bulk and edges of a system are distinguishable only for sufficiently large samples (larger than roughly one magnetic length). Our experiments are enabled by applying quantum optics tools to synthetic topological matter (here twisted optical resonators). Combined with advances in Rydberg-mediated photon collisions, our work will enable precision characterization of topological matter in photon fluids.},

We first show that the partition functions of those theories are cobordism invariants after a tuning of the Euler term. Conversely, for a given cobordism invariant, we construct a unitary topological field theory whose partition function is given by the cobordism invariant, assuming that a certain bordism group is finitely generated. Two theories having the same cobordism invariant partition functions are isomorphic.},

  pages={035005},
  year={2016},
  abstract={We discuss (2 + 1)D topological phases on non-orientable spatial surfaces, such as Möbius strip, real projective plane and Klein bottle, etc, which are obtained by twisting the parent topological phases by their underlying parity symmetries through introducing parity defects. We construct the ground states on arbitrary non-orientable closed manifolds and calculate the ground state degeneracy (GSD). Such degeneracy is shown to be robust against continuous deformation of the underlying manifold. We also study the action of the mapping class group on the multiplet of ground states on the Klein bottle. The physical properties of the topological states on non-orientable surfaces are deeply related to the parity symmetric anyons which do not have a notion of orientation in their statistics. For example, the number of ground states on the real projective plane equals the root of the number of distinguishable parity symmetric anyons, while the GSD on the Klein bottle equals the total number of parity symmetric anyons; in deforming the Klein bottle, the Dehn twist encodes the topological spins whereas the Y -homeomorphism tells the particle–hole relation of the parity symmetric anyons.}

	Abstract = {Abstract Instead of studying anyon condensation in various concrete models, we take a bootstrap approach by considering an abstract situation, in which an anyon condensation happens in a 2-d topological phase with anyonic excitations given by a modular tensor category C ; and the anyons in the condensed phase are given by another modular tensor category D . By a bootstrap analysis, we derive a relation between anyons in D -phase and anyons in C -phase from natural physical requirements. It turns out that the vacuum (or the tensor unit) A in D -phase is necessary to be a connected commutative separable algebra in C , and the category D is equivalent to the category of local A-modules as modular tensor categories. This condensation also produces a gapped domain wall with wall excitations given by the category of A-modules in C . A more general situation is also studied in this paper. We will also show how to determine such algebra A from the initial and final data. Multi-condensations and 1-d condensations will also be briefly discussed. Examples will be given in the toric code model, Kitaev quantum double models, Levin--Wen types of lattice models and some chiral topological phases. },

	Abstract = {Given a braided tensor *-category C with conjugate (dual) objects and irreducible unit together with a full symmetric subcategory S we define a crossed product C⋊S. This construction yields a tensor *-category with conjugates and an irreducible unit. (A *-category is a category enriched over VectC with positive *-operation.) A Galois correspondence is established between intermediate categories sitting between C and C⋊S and closed subgroups of the Galois group Gal(C⋊S/C)=AutC(C⋊S) of C, the latter being isomorphic to the compact group associated with S by the duality theorem of Doplicher and Roberts. Denoting by D⊂C the full subcategory of degenerate objects, i.e., objects which have trivial monodromy with all objects of C, the braiding of C extends to a braiding of C⋊S iff S⊂D. Under this condition, C⋊S has no non-trivial degenerate objects iff S=D. If the original category C is rational (i.e., has only finitely many isomorphism classes of irreducible objects) then the same holds for the new one. The category C≡C⋊D is called the modular closure of C since in the rational case it is modular, i.e., gives rise to a unitary representation of the modular group SL(2, Z). If all simple objects of S have dimension one the structure of the category C⋊S can be clarified quite explicitly in terms of group cohomology. },

Defects separating different phases of local \{CFTs\} with the same chiral symmetry are included in our discussion. We show how the resulting one-dimensional phase boundaries can be used to extract symmetries and order--disorder dualities of the CFT. The case of central charge c = 4 / 5 , for which there are two inequivalent world sheet phases corresponding to the tetra-critical Ising model and the critical three-states Potts model, is treated as an illustrative example. },

	Abstract = {A set of localized, non-Abelian anyons---such as vortices in a p x +i p y superconductor or quasiholes in certain quantum Hall states---gives rise to a macroscopic degeneracy. Such a degeneracy is split in the presence of interactions between the anyons. Here, we show that in two spatial dimensions this splitting selects a unique collective state as ground state of the interacting many-body system. This collective state can be a novel gapped quantum liquid nucleated inside the original parent liquid (of which the anyons are excitations). This physics is of relevance for any quantum Hall plateau realizing a non-Abelian quantum Hall state when moving off the center of the plateau.},

	Abstract = {We consider the lowest Landau level on a torus as a function of its circumference L 1 . When L 1  → 0, the ground state at general rational filling fraction is a crystal with a gap---a Tao--Thouless state. For filling fractions ν = p /(2 pm + 1), these states are the limits of Laughlin's or Jain's wavefunctions describing the gapped quantum Hall states when L 1 → ∞. For the half-filled Landau level, there is a transition to a Fermi sea of non-interacting neutral fermions (dipoles), or rather to a Luttinger liquid modification thereof, at L 1 ~ 5 magnetic lengths. Using exact diagonalization we identify this state as a version of the Rezayi--Read state, and find that it develops continuously into the state that is believed to describe the observed metallic phase as L 1 → ∞. Furthermore, the effective Landau level structure that emerges within the lowest Landau level is found to be a consequence of the magnetic symmetries.},

	Abstract = {Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are bulk-gapped quantum phases with symmetries, which have gapless or degenerate boundary states as long as the symmetries are not broken. The SPT phases in free fermion systems, such as topological insulators, can be classified; however, it is not known what SPT phases exist in general interacting systems. We present a systematic way to construct SPT phases in interacting bosonic systems. Just as group theory allows us to construct 230 crystal structures in three-dimensional space, we use group cohomology theory to systematically construct different interacting bosonic SPT phases in any dimension and with any symmetry, leading to the discovery of bosonic topological insulators and superconductors.},

abstract="We define chiral vertex operators and duality matrices and review the fundamental identities they satisfy. In order to understand the meaning of these equations, and therefore of conformal field theory, we define the classical limit of a conformal field theory as a limit in which the conformal weights of all primary fields vanish. The classical limit of the equations for the duality matrices in rational field theory together with some results of category theory, suggest that (quantum) conformal field theory should be regarded as a generalization of group theory.",

@article{ardonne2008,
	Abstract = {We analyze the non-Abelian Read--Rezayi quantum Hall states on the torus, where it is natural to employ a mapping of the many-body problem onto a one-dimensional lattice model. On the thin torus---the Tao--Thouless (TT) limit---the interacting many-body problem is exactly solvable. The Read--Rezayi states at filling ν = k /( kM +2) are known to be exact ground states of a local repulsive k +1-body interaction, and in the TT limit this is manifested in that all states in the ground state manifold have exactly k particles on any kM +2 consecutive sites. For ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2008/04/P04016/jstat275930ieqn1.gif] {M\neq 0} the two-body correlations of these states also imply that there is no more than one particle on M adjacent sites. The fractionally charged quasiparticles and quasiholes appear as domain walls between the ground states, and we show that the number of distinct domain wall patterns gives rise to the nontrivial degeneracies, required by the non-Abelian statistics of these states. In the second part of the paper we consider the quasihole degeneracies from a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective, and show that the counting of the domain wall patterns maps one to one on the CFT counting via the fusion rules. Moreover we extend the CFT analysis to topologies of higher genus.},

	Abstract = {A set of localized, non-Abelian anyons---such as vortices in a p x +i p y superconductor or quasiholes in certain quantum Hall states---gives rise to a macroscopic degeneracy. Such a degeneracy is split in the presence of interactions between the anyons. Here, we show that in two spatial dimensions this splitting selects a unique collective state as ground state of the interacting many-body system. This collective state can be a novel gapped quantum liquid nucleated inside the original parent liquid (of which the anyons are excitations). This physics is of relevance for any quantum Hall plateau realizing a non-Abelian quantum Hall state when moving off the center of the plateau.},

@article{freedman04,
	Abstract = {We describe a class of parity- and time-reversal-invariant topological
   states of matter which can arise in correlated electron systems in
   2+1-dimensions. These states are characterized by particle-like
   excitations exhibiting exotic braiding statistics. P and T invariance
   are maintained by a `doubling' of the low-energy degrees of freedom
   which occurs naturally without doubling the underlying microscopic
   degrees of freedom. The simplest examples have been the subject of
   considerable interest as proposed mechanisms for high-T-c
   superconductivity. One is the `doubled' version of the chiral spin
   liquid. The chiral spin liquid gives rise to anyon superconductivity at
   finite doping and the corresponding field theory is U(1) Chern-Simons
   theory at coupling constant m = 2. The `doubled' theory is two copies of
   this theory, one with m = 2 the other with m = -2. The second example
   corresponds to Z(2) gauge theory, which describes a scenario for
   spin-charge separation. Our main concern, with an eye towards
   applications to quantum computation, are richer models which support
   non-Abelian statistics. All of these models, richer or poorer, lie in a
   tightly organized discrete family indexed by the Baraha numbers, 2
   cos(pi/ (k + 2)), for positive integer k. The physical inference is that
   a material manifesting the Z(2) gauge theory or a doubled chiral spin
   liquid might be easily altered to one capable of universal quantum
   computation. These phases of matter have a field-theoretic description
   in terms of gauge theories which, in their infrared limits, are
   topological field theories. We motivate these gauge theories using a
   parton model or slave-fermion construction and show how they can be
   solved exactly. The structure of the resulting Hilbert spaces can be
   understood in purely combinatorial terms. The highly constrained nature
   of this combinatorial construction, phrased in the language of the
   topology of curves on surfaces, lays the groundwork for a strategy for
   constructing microscopic lattice models which give rise to these phases.

  abstract      = {Symmetry-protected topological phases generalize the notion of topological insulators to strongly interacting systems of bosons or fermions. A sophisticated group cohomology approach has been used to classify bosonic symmetry-protected topological phases, which however does not transparently predict their properties. Here we provide a physical picture that leads to an intuitive understanding of a large class of symmetry-protected topological phases in d=1,2,3 dimensions. Such a picture allows us to construct explicit models for the symmetry-protected topological phases, write down ground state wave function and discover topological properties of symmetry defects both in the bulk and on the edge of the system. We consider symmetries that include a Z2 subgroup, which allows us to define domain walls. While the usual disordered phase is obtained by proliferating domain walls, we show that symmetry-protected topological phases are realized when these domain walls are decorated, that is, are themselves symmetry-protected topological phases in one lower dimension. This construction works both for unitary Z2 and anti-unitary time reversal symmetry.},

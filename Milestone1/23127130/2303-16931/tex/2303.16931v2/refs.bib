title = {InAs-Al Hybrid Devices Passing the Topological Gap Protocol},
howpublished = {arXiv},
year = {2022},
month = {July},
abstract = {We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure devices that are consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and non-local transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations for robustness against non-uniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in Pikulin [\it et al.]\ [arXiv:2103.12217]. This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and non-local transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes. Our experimental results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred micro-electron-volts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and re-opening of the bulk gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at [\it both] ends of the devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The measured maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20-30μeV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero modes.

abstract = {Most experimental claims of Majorana bound states, unusual quasiparticles that may become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing, rest on the observation of a persistent zero bias peak (ZBP) in tunneling spectra. In semiconductor–superconductor heterostructures, this feature may also be caused by the topologically trivial Andreev bound states. Valentini et al. provide comprehensive evidence that the ZBPs observed in their experiments with semiconductor nanowires fully coated with a superconducting shell are indeed of this topologically trivial origin, in contrast to the interpretation of similar earlier experiments. The researchers identify the length of the tunnel junction in their devices as a crucial experimental parameter. Science, abf1513, this issue p. 82 Tunneling into devices made of InAs nanowires fully wrapped with superconducting Al reveals the character of subgap states. A semiconducting nanowire fully wrapped by a superconducting shell has been proposed as a platform for obtaining Majorana modes at small magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate that the appearance of subgap states in such structures is actually governed by the junction region in tunneling spectroscopy measurements and not the full-shell nanowire itself. Short tunneling regions never show subgap states, whereas longer junctions always do. This can be understood in terms of quantum dots forming in the junction and hosting Andreev levels in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime. The intricate magnetic field dependence of the Andreev levels, through both the Zeeman and Little-Parks effects, may result in robust zero-bias peaks—features that could be easily misinterpreted as originating from Majorana zero modes but are unrelated to topological superconductivity.}}

abstract = {We propose a universal mechanism for the Josephson diode effect in short Josephson junctions. The proposed mechanism is due to finite Cooper pair momentum and is a manifestation of simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. The diode efficiency is up to 40\%, which corresponds to an asymmetry between the critical currents in opposite directions Ic+/Ic− ≈ 230\%. We show that this arises from both the Doppler shift of the Andreev bound state energies and the phase-independent asymmetric current from the continuum. Last, we propose a simple scheme for achieving finite-momentum pairing, which does not rely on spin-orbit coupling and thus greatly expands existing platforms for the observation of supercurrent diode effects. A universal mechanism for the Josephson diode effect in short superconducting junctions arises from finite Cooper pair momentum.}}

Especially, non-dissipative and coherent nonreciprocal transport in solids is an important fundamental issue. The recent discovery of superconductor (SC) diodes under external magnetic fields, where the magnitude of the critical current changes as the direction is reversed, significantly boosted this research area. However, a theoretical understanding of such phenomena is lacking. Here, we provide theoretical descriptions of SC diodes with a generalized Ginzburg–Landau method. The theory is applied to Rashba spin–orbit coupled systems, where analytical relations between the nonreciprocal critical currents and the system parameters are achieved. Numerical calculations with mean-field theory are also obtained to study broader parameter regions. These results offer a rather general description and design principles of SC diodes.}

In this work, we show that, in certain classes of two-dimensional superconductors with antisymmetric spin–orbit coupling, Cooper pairs acquire a finite momentum upon the application of an in-plane magnetic field, and, as a result, critical currents in the direction parallel and antiparallel to the Cooper pair momentum become unequal. This supercurrent diode effect is also manifested in the polarity dependence of in-plane critical fields induced by a supercurrent. These nonreciprocal effects may be found in polar SrTiO3 film, few-layer MoTe2 in the Td phase, and twisted bilayer graphene in which the valley degree of freedom plays a role analogous to spin.}}

It is shown that the current-carrying ability in such S/F systems in the domain-wall superconducting state differs for the positive and negative directions of the injected current with respect to the parity-breaking vector, which is proportional to  and thus determined by the local magnetization vector M(r) in the ferromagnetic substrate. We demonstrate that in such S/F systems the realization of the so-called diode effect is possible for both laterally infinite and mesoscopic structures.}

Lack of spatial inversion symmetry in crystals offers a rich variety of physical phenomena, such as ferroelectricity and nonlinear optical effects (for example, second harmonic generation). One such phenomenon is magnetochiral anisotropy, where the electrical resistance depends on the current direction under the external magnetic field. We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that this magnetochiral anisotropy is markedly enhanced by orders of magnitude once the materials enter into a superconducting state. To exemplify this enhancement, we study the magnetotransport properties of the two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconducting state induced by gating of MoS2. These results indicate that electrons feel the noncentrosymmetric crystal potential much coherently and sensitively over the correlation length when they form Cooper pairs, and show open a new route to enhance the nonreciprocal response toward novel functionalities, including superconducting diodes.}}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Simultaneous breaking of inversion- and time-reversal symmetry in Josephson junction (JJ) leads to a possible violation of the I(φ) = −I(−φ) equality for the current–phase relation. This is known as anomalous Josephson effect and it produces a phase shift φ 0 in sinusoidal current–phase relations. In ballistic JJs with non-sinusoidal current phase relation the observed phenomenology is much richer, including the supercurrent diode effect and the magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) of Josephson inductance. In this work, we present measurements of both effects on arrays of JJs defined on epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures. We show that the orientation of the current with respect to the lattice affects the MCA, possibly as the result of a finite Dresselhaus component. In addition, we show that the two-fold symmetry of the Josephson inductance reflects in the activation energy for phase slips.}

                   phases of matter with gapless electronic excitations
                   that are protected by topology and symmetry. As three
                   dimensional analogs of graphene, they have generated
                   much recent interest. Deep connections exist with
                   particle physics models of relativistic chiral

  abstract =      {A wide range of materials, like d-wave
                   superconductors, graphene, and topological
                   insulators, share a fundamental similarity: their
                   low-energy fermionic excitations behave as massless
                   Dirac particles rather than fermions obeying the
                   usual Schr{\"{o}}dinger Hamiltonian. This emergent
                   behavior of Dirac fermions in condensed matter
                   systems defines the unifying framework for a class of
                   materials we call "Dirac materials." In order to
                   establish this class of materials, we illustrate how
                   Dirac fermions emerge in multiple entirely different
                   condensed matter systems and we discuss how Dirac
                   fermions have been identified experimentally using
                   electron spectroscopy techniques (angle-resolved
                   photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling
                   spectroscopy). As a consequence of their common
                   low-energy excitations, this diverse set of materials
                   shares a significant number of universal properties
                   in the low-energy (infrared) limit. We review these
                   common properties including nodal points in the
                   excitation spectrum, density of states, specific
                   heat, transport, thermodynamic properties, impurity
                   resonances, and magnetic field responses, as well as
                   discuss many-body interaction effects. We further
                   review how the emergence of Dirac excitations is
                   controlled by specific symmetries of the material,
                   such as time-reversal, gauge, and spin-orbit
                   symmetries, and how by breaking these symmetries a
                   finite Dirac mass is generated. We give examples of
                   how the interaction of Dirac fermions with their
                   distinct real material background leads to rich novel
                   physics with common fingerprints such as the
                   suppression of back scattering and impurity-induced
                   resonant states. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&}

  abstract =      {The Josephson effect describes the generic appearance
                   of a supercurrent in a weak link between two
                   superconductors. Its exact physical nature deeply
                   influences the properties of the supercurrent. In
                   recent years, considerable efforts have focused on
                   the coupling of superconductors to the surface states
                   of a three-dimensional topological insulator. In such
                   a material, an unconventional induced p-wave
                   superconductivity should occur, with a doublet of
                   topologically protected gapless Andreev bound states,
                   whose energies vary 4$\phi$-periodically with the
                   superconducting phase difference across the junction.
                   In this article, we report the observation of an
                   anomalous response to rf irradiation in a Josephson
                   junction made of a HgTe weak link. The response is
                   understood as due to a 4$\phi$-periodic contribution
                   to the supercurrent, and its amplitude is compatible
                   with the expected contribution of a gapless Andreev
                   doublet. Our work opens the way to more elaborate
                   experiments to investigate the induced
                   superconductivity in a three-dimensional insulator.},

We explain how the inclusion of a capacitance term results in a strong quenching of the first step when the junction is underdamped, while the higher odd steps are less affected. Remarkably, this feature has been observed experimentally. We examine the emission spectrum of phase-locked solutions, showing that the presence of period doubling may make the measurement of the 4$\pi$-periodic contribution from the Fourier spectrum difficult. Finally, we study the voltage response in the quasiperiodic regime and indicate how the Fourier spectra and the first-return maps in this regime reflect the change of periodicity in the supercurrent in the presence of Majorana bound states.},

When the junction is irradiated with a radiofrequency f0 in the absence of an external magnetic field, quantized voltage steps (Shapiro steps) with a height ΔV = hf0/2e are observed, as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is carried by charge- 2e Cooper pairs. At high magnetic fields the height of the first Shapiro step is doubled to hf0/e, suggesting that the supercurrent is carried by charge- e quasiparticles.

The skewness indicates that the Josephson current is predominantly carried by Andreev bound states with high transmittance, and the fact that the skewness persists in junctions that are longer than the mean free path suggests that the effect may be related to the helical nature of the Andreev bound states in the surface of HgTe.

In superconductor–TI–superconductor Josephson junctions, the supercurrent versus the phase difference between the superconductors, referred to as the current–phase relation (CPR), reveals important information including the nature of the superconducting transport. Here, we study the induced superconductivity in gate-tunable Josephson junctions (JJs) made from topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 with superconducting Nb electrodes. We observe highly skewed (non-sinusoidal) CPR in these junctions. The critical current, or the magnitude of the CPR, increases with decreasing temperature down to the lowest accessible temperature (T {\textasciitilde} 20 mK), revealing the existence of low-energy modes in our junctions. The gate dependence shows that close to the Dirac point the CPR becomes less skewed, indicating the transport is more diffusive, most likely due to the presence of electron/hole puddles and charge inhomogeneity. Our experiments provide strong evidence that superconductivity is induced in the highly ballistic topological surface states (TSS) in our gate-tunable TI-based JJs. Furthermore, the measured CPR is in good agreement with the prediction of a model which calculates the phase-dependent eigenstate energies in our system, considering the finite width of the electrodes, as well as the TSS wave functions extending over the entire circumference of the TI.},

We calculate the topological invariant and energy gap of a single stripe, using realistic values for an InAs 2DEG proximitized by an epitaxial Al layer. We show that the topological gap is enhanced when the structure is made asymmetric. This can be achieved either by imposing a phase difference (by driving a supercurrent or using a magnetic-flux loop) over the strip or by replacing one superconductor by a metallic gate. Both strategies also enable control over the MBS splitting, thereby facilitating braiding and readout schemes based on controlled fusion of MBSs.

	abstract = {Topological superconductors admit zero-energy Majorana bound states at their boundaries. In this review article, we discuss how to probe these Majorana bound states in Josephson junctions between two topological superconductors. In the absence of an applied bias, the presence of these states gives rise to an Andreev bound state whose energy varies 4$\pi$-periodically in the superconducting phase difference. An applied voltage bias leads to a dynamically varying phase according to the Josephson relation. Furthermore, it leads to dynamics of the occupation of the bound state via its non-adiabatic coupling to the continuum. While the Josephson relation suggests a fractional Josephson effect due to the 4$\pi$-periodicity of the bound state, its observability relies on the conservation of the occupation of the bound state on the experimentally probed time scale. We study the lifetime of the bound state and identify the time scales it has to be compared to. In particular, we are interested in signatures of the fractional Josephson effect in the Shapiro steps and in current noise measurements. We also discuss manifestations of the zero-energy Majorana states on the dissipative subgap current.
Résumé
Les supraconducteurs topologiques admettent des fermions de Majorana dʼénergie nulle à leurs bords. Dans cet article de revue, nous discutons la manière de sonder ces états liés de Majorana dans une jonction Josephson entre deux supraconducteurs topologiques. En lʼabsence dʼune tension de polarisation, la présence de ces états donne lieu à un état lié dʼAndreev dont lʼénergie varie 4$\pi$-périodiquement vis-à-vis de la différence de phase supraconductrice. Lʼapplication dʼune tension de polarisation induit une variation dynamique de la phase en accord avec la relation de Josephson. De plus, elle donne lieu à une dynamique de lʼoccupation de lʼétat lié à travers son couplage non adiabatique avec les états du continuum. Tandis que la relation de Josephson suggère un effet Josephson fractionnaire dû à la 4$\pi$-périodicité, son observabilité repose sur la conservation de lʼoccupation de lʼétat lié sur lʼéchelle de temps sondée expérimentalement. Nous étudions la durée de vie de lʼétat lié et identifions les échelles de temps auxquelles celle-ci doit être comparée. En particulier, nous nous intéressons aux signatures de lʼeffet Josephson fractionnaire dans les mesures de marches de Shapiro et du bruit en courant. Nous discutons également les manifestations des états de Majorana à énergie nulle dans le courant dissipatif aux tensions plus petites que le gap supraconducteur.},

Inelastic processes, which violate the conservation of fermion parity, lead to telegraph noise in the equilibrium supercurrent.

We demonstrate that Shapiro steps can be used to infer a reduced critical current and an associated local temperature. Our observation of Shapiro steps in the dissipative branch shows that a finite Josephson coupling exists in the dissipative state. Although the nanobridge is heated, our model shows that the temperature remains below the critical temperature. This work provides evidence that Josephson behavior can still exist in thermally hysteretic weak-link devices and will allow extension of the temperature range over which nanobridge-based single-flux-quantum circuits, micron-sized superconducting quantum interference devices (i.e., nanoSQUIDs), and Josephson voltage standards can be used.},

	abstract = {We investigate patterns of critical current as a function of perpendicular and in-plane magnetic fields in superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor (SNS) junctions based on InAs/InGaAs heterostructures with an epitaxial Al layer. This material system is of interest due to its exceptionally good superconductor-semiconductor coupling, as well as large spin-orbit interaction and g factor in the semiconductor. Thin epitaxial Al allows the application of large in-plane field without destroying superconductivity. For fields perpendicular to the junction, flux focusing results in aperiodic node spacings in the pattern of critical currents known as Fraunhofer patterns by analogy to the related interference effect in optics. Adding an in-plane field yields two further anomalies in the pattern. First, higher-order nodes are systematically strengthened, indicating current flow along the edges of the device, as a result of confinement of Andreev states driven by an induced flux dipole; second, asymmetries in the interference appear that depend on the field direction and magnitude. A model is presented, showing good agreement with experiment, elucidating the roles of flux focusing, Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling, and disorder in producing these effects.},

@article{Cao_Gr_2018,
	Abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity---which cannot be explained by weak electron--phonon interactions---in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1$\,^{\circ}$---the first `magic'angle---the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene'exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature--carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

Among the experimental controls are in-plane magnetic field, phase difference across the junction, and carrier density set by electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we investigate planar Josephson junctions with an improved design based on an epitaxial InAs/Al heterostructure, embedded in a superconducting loop, probed with integrated quantum point contacts (QPCs) at both ends of the junction. For particular ranges of in-plane field and gate voltages, a closing and reopening of the superconducting gap is observed, along with a zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) that appears upon reopening of the gap. Consistency with a simple theoretical model supports the interpretation of a topological phase transition. While gap closings and reopenings generally occurred together at the two ends of the junction, the height, shape, and even presence of ZBCPs typically differed between the ends, presumably due to disorder and variation of couplings to local probes.},

The nearly quantized resonances evolve in the tunnel barrier strength, magnetic field and magnetic field orientation in a way consistent with Majorana zero modes. Our devices feature two tunnel probes on both ends of the nanowire separated by a 400 nm nanowire segment covered by the superconductor. We only find nearly quantized zero bias peaks localized to one end of the nanowire, while conductance dips are observed for the same parameters on the other end. This undermines the Majorana explanation as Majorana modes must come in pairs. We do identify states delocalized from end to end near zero magnetic field and at higher electron density, which is not in the basic Majorana regime. We lay out procedures for assessing the nonlocality of subgap wavefunctions and provide a classification of nanowire bound states based on their localization.},

Here, we construct a computational framework that includes a microscopic description of the junction (full fledged treatment of both the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticles) in the presence of a surrounding electrical circuit. Our approach generalizes the standard resistor capacitor Josephson model to arbitrary junctions (including, e.g., multiterminal geometries and/or junctions that embed topological or magnetic elements) and arbitrary electric circuits treated at the classical level. By treating the superconducting condensate and quasiparticles on equal footings, we capture nonequilibrium phenomena such as multiple Andreev reflection. We show that the interplay between the quasiparticle dynamics and the electrical environment leads to the emergence of new phenomena. In a RCRC circuit connected to single channel Josephson junction, we find out-of-equilibrium current-phase relations that are strongly distorted with respect to the (almost sinusoidal) equilibrium one, revealing the presence of the high harmonic ac Josephson effect. In an RLCRLC circuit connected to a junction, we find that the shape of the resonance is strongly modified by the quasiparticle dynamics: close to resonance, the current can be smaller than without the resonator.

	Abstract = {Majorana bound states (MBSs) are peculiar quasiparticles that may one day become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing. To engineer these states, physicists have used semiconductor nanowires in contact with a superconductor. Although many of the observed properties align with theoretical predictions, a closer look into the creation of MBSs is desirable. Deng et al. fabricated nanowires with a quantum dot at one end that served as a spectrometer for the states that formed inside the superconducting gap of the nanowire. Using this setup, topologically trivial bound states were seen to coalesce into MBSs as the magnetic field was varied.Science, this issue p. 1557Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states (MBSs). We demonstrate the emergence of MBSs from coalescing Andreev bound states (ABSs) in a hybrid InAs nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.},

Within this framework we derive all possible energy independent hard wall boundary conditions that are applicable to metallic tubes. The boundary conditions are classified in terms of their symmetry properties and we demonstrate that the use of different boundary conditions will result in varying degrees of valley degeneracy breaking of the single-particle energy spectrum.}

	abstract = {The effects described arise as a consequence of two terms calculated by Josephson in the expression for the electrical current flowing between a pair of weakly coupled superconductors. One of these terms is present at zero voltage and represents a supercurrent which can cross such barriers as thin layers of insulator or normal metal; the other is an extra component of resistive current. The review sets out sufficient theoretical background to allow readers with no previous knowledge of superconductivity to understand the basic physics of the effects. It also caters for those wishing to learn enough to understand devices based on Josephson effects. The article concentrates on fundamentals, and early and recent experimental and theoretical developments in the understanding of Josephson weak links of all types are emphasized.},

	issn = {0034-4885},
	
	abstract = {The design of zero-bias Josephson voltage standards is presented as a case study in nonlinear dynamics. Based on superconducting tunnel junctions, such standards rely on nonlinearity to create a phase lock between an internal junction variable and an applied rf bias. In the terminology of nonlinear dynamics, phase lock corresponds to motion on a periodic attractor. Not all attractors of the rf-biased junction are periodic, however, and both quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors must be avoided in voltage standards. Surprisingly, the optimum operating point for zero-bias standards is near a region of chaos. Thus, the Josephson coupling energy , a measure of the junction's nonlinearity, must be chosen much larger than the thermal energy to avoid disruption by intrinsic noise but not so large that chaos is evoked. The optimum maximizes the activation energy required for thermally induced escape from the phase-locked attractor. For nonequilibrium systems like the rf-biased junction, is a difference in quasipotential that can be calculated by finding the most probable path for escape from a basin of attraction in the limit of low temperature.},

A finite system of length L possesses two ground states with an energy difference proportional to exp(-L/l0) and different fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap induced by proximity of a three-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each spin component counts separately).}

    abstract = { The most important applications of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) are in the field of metrology. The observed quantization of the resistance is primarily used for the reproduction of the SI unit ohm, but is also important for high precision measurements of both the fine structure constant and the Planck constant. Some current QHE research areas include the analysis of new electron–electron correlation phenomena and the development of a more complete microscopic picture of this quantum effect. Recently, scanning force microscopy (SFM) of the potential distribution in QHE devices has been used to enhance the microscopic understanding of current flow in quantum Hall systems. This confirms the importance of the theoretically predicted stripes of compressible and incompressible electronic states close to the boundary of the QHE devices. }

abstract = {The Higgs mechanism, i.e., spontaneous symmetry breaking of the quantum vacuum, is a cross-disciplinary principle, universal for understanding dark energy, antimatter and quantum materials, from superconductivity to magnetism. Unlike one-band superconductors (SCs), a conceptually distinct Higgs amplitude mode can arise in multi-band, unconventional superconductors via strong interband Coulomb interaction, but is yet to be accessed. Here we discover such hybrid Higgs mode and demonstrate its quantum control by light in iron-based high-temperature SCs. Using terahertz (THz) two-pulse coherent spectroscopy, we observe a tunable amplitude mode coherent oscillation of the complex order parameter from coupled lower and upper bands. The nonlinear dependence of the hybrid Higgs mode on the THz driving fields is distinct from any known SC results: we observe a large reversible modulation of resonance strength, yet with a persisting mode frequency. Together with quantum kinetic modeling of a hybrid Higgs mechanism, distinct from charge-density fluctuations and without invoking phonons or disorder, our result provides compelling evidence for a light-controlled coupling between the electron and hole amplitude modes assisted by strong interband quantum entanglement. Such light-control of Higgs hybridization can be extended to probe many-body entanglement and hidden symmetries in other complex systems.},

abstract = {In equilibrium systems amplitude and phase collective modes are decoupled, as they are mutually orthogonal excitations. The direct detection of these Higgs and Leggett collective modes by linear-response measurements is not possible, because they do not couple directly to the electromagnetic field. In this work, using numerical exact simulations we show for the case of two-gap superconductors, that optical pump-probe experiments excite both Higgs and Leggett modes out of equilibrium. We find that this non-adiabatic excitation process introduces a strong interaction between the collective modes, which is absent in equilibrium. Moreover, we propose a type of pump-probe experiment, which allows to probe and coherently control the Higgs and Leggett modes, and thus the order parameter directly. These findings go beyond two-band superconductors and apply to general collective modes in quantum materials.},

However, many challenges continue to hinder the fundamental understanding of how to control the collective modes corresponding to these multiple order parameters 3,4 . Here we demonstrate that, in full analogy with phonons, Raman-active electronic collective modes can be manipulated by intense light pulses. By tuning a sum-frequency excitation process, we selectively trigger collective excitations that can be ascribed to the relative phase fluctuations between two superconducting order parameters—the so-called Leggett mode—in the multiband superconductor MgB 2 . The excellent comparison between experiments and theory establishes a general protocol for the advanced control of Raman-active electronic modes in symmetry-broken quantum phases of matter.},

abstract = {For certain orientations of Josephson junctions between two px-wave or two d-wave superconductors, the subgap Andreev bound states produce a $4\pi$-periodic relation between the Josephson current I and the phase difference $\phi$: $I\propto\sin(\phi/2)$. Consequently, the ac Josephson current has the fractional frequency $eV/\hbar$, where V is the dc voltage. In the tunneling limit, the Josephson current is proportional to the first power (not square) of the electron tunneling amplitude. Thus, the Josephson current between unconventional superconductors is carried by single electrons, rather than by Cooper pairs. The fractional ac Josephson effect can be observed experimentally by measuring frequency spectrum of microwave radiation from the junction. We also study junctions between singlet s-wave and triplet px-wave, as well as between chiral $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave superconductors.},

abstract = {Majorana zero modes are localized quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian exchange statistics. Braiding Majorana zero modes forms the basis of topologically protected quantum operations which could, in principle, significantly reduce qubit decoherence and gate control errors at the device level. Therefore, searching for Majorana zero modes in various solid state systems is a major topic in condensed matter physics and quantum computer science. Since the first experimental signature observed in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire devices, this field has witnessed a dramatic expansion in material science, transport experiments and theory. While making the first topological qubit based on these Majorana nanowires is currently an ongoing effort, several related important transport experiments are still being pursued in the near term. These will not only serve as intermediate steps but also show Majorana physics in a more fundamental aspect. In this perspective, we summarize these key Majorana experiments and the potential challenges.},

abstract = {Ultrafast, high-efficiency single-photon detectors are among the most sought-after elements in modern quantum optics and quantum communication. However, imperfect modal matching and finite photon absorption rates have usually limited their maximum attainable detection efficiency. Here we demonstrate superconducting nanowire detectors atop nanophotonic waveguides, which enable a drastic increase of the absorption length for incoming photons. This allows us to achieve high on-chip single-photon detection efficiency up to 91% at telecom wavelengths, repeatable across several fabricated chips. We also observe remarkably low dark count rates without significant compromise of the on-chip detection efficiency. The detectors are fully embedded in scalable silicon photonic circuits and provide ultrashort timing jitter of 18 ps. Exploiting this high temporal resolution, we demonstrate ballistic photon transport in silicon ring resonators. Our direct implementation of a high-performance single-photon detector on chip overcomes a major barrier in integrated quantum photonics.},

abstract = {Near-unity energy transfer efficiency has been widely observed in natural photosynthetic complexes. This phenomenon has attracted broad interest from different fields, such as physics, biology, chemistry, and material science, as it may offer valuable insights into efficient solar-energy harvesting. Recently, quantum coherent effects have been discovered in photosynthetic light harvesting, and their potential role on energy transfer has seen the heated debate. Here, we perform an experimental quantum simulation of photosynthetic energy transfer using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We show that an N-chromophore photosynthetic complex, with arbitrary structure and bath spectral density, can be effectively simulated by a system with log2 N qubits. The computational cost of simulating such a system with a theoretical tool, like the hierarchical equation of motion, which is exponential in N, can be potentially reduced to requiring a just polynomial number of qubits N using NMR quantum simulation. The benefits of performing such quantum simulation in NMR are even greater when the spectral density is complex, as in natural photosynthetic complexes. These findings may shed light on quantum coherence in energy transfer and help to provide design principles for efficient artificial light harvesting.},

The observed phase dynamics can be perfectly captured within an extended resistively shunted Josephson junction model.

To overcome the obstacles, we vertically sandwiched a cleaved graphene monoatomic layer as the normalconducting spacer between superconducting electrodes. The atomically thin single-crystalline graphene layer serves as an ultimately short conducting channel, with highly transparent interfaces with superconductors. In particular, we show the strong Josephson coupling reaching the theoretical limit, the convex-shaped temperature dependence of the Josephson critical current and the exceptionally skewed phase dependence of the Josephson current; all demonstrate the bona fide short and ballistic Josephson nature.

When the torque I exceeds a critical value the pendulum rotates with a frequency. For infinite damping, or zero mass (=0), the equation can be transformed to the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the Kronig-Penney model. When An is random the pendulum exhibits chaotic motion. In the regular case An=A the frequency is a smooth function of the parameters, so there are no phase-locked subharmonic plateaus in the (I) curve, or the I-V characteristics for the CDW or Josephson-junction systems. For small nonzero the return map expressing the phase (tn+1) as a function of the phase (tn) is a one-dimensional circle map. Applying known analytical results for the circle map one finds narrow subharmonic plateaus at all rational frequencies, in agreement with experiments on CDW systems. {\textcopyright} 1984 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Wiedenmann2016,
abstract = {The Josephson effect describes the generic appearance of a supercurrent in a weak link between two superconductors. Its exact physical nature deeply influences the properties of the supercurrent. In recent years, considerable efforts have focused on the coupling of superconductors to the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator. In such a material, an unconventional induced p-wave superconductivity should occur, with a doublet of topologically protected gapless Andreev bound states, whose energies vary 4$\phi$-periodically with the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In this article, we report the observation of an anomalous response to rf irradiation in a Josephson junction made of a HgTe weak link. The response is understood as due to a 4$\phi$-periodic contribution to the supercurrent, and its amplitude is compatible with the expected contribution of a gapless Andreev doublet. Our work opens the way to more elaborate experiments to investigate the induced superconductivity in a three-dimensional insulator.},

	journal = {Superconductor Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The Shapiro effect is known, with regular steps in the voltage–current characteristic of a Josephson junction in the presence of microwave radiation, and so are its applications. In asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices), in particular the interactions between various current contributions in the two junctions lead to more varied and richer conditions. In this paper, we discuss the possibility and the impacts of a kind of internal Shapiro effect in some portions of the parameter space of the asymmetric high-TC SQUID with overdamped junctions and large loop inductance. In this predicted phenomenon, the required high-frequency radiation is produced spontaneously in the interior of the SQUID. The main message is the importance of achieving a set of nine parameters for the device whose voltage–current characteristics show no indication of spike–step-like structures.}

	abstract = {This paper describes the I-V characteristics (as a function of applied magnetic field) and magnetic field response of a dc SQUID which incorporates two weak-link Josephson junctions in a superconducting ring. These characteristics are derived by digital computer simulation, using the Stewart-McCumber model. The effects of asymmetry (dissimilarity between the junctions) on SQUID critical current Ic, normal resistance R and capacitance C are also simulated. With microwave excitation applied, the Josephson oscillations of the dc SQUID are found to be “frequency-locked” to the applied microwave signal even when critical currents Ic of the two junctions differed, Subharmonic voltage steps are obtained for a symmetric dc SQUID in a magnetic field even when the current-phase relationship is purely sinusoidal.}

Several observations of zero-bias conductance peaks measured by tunnelling spectroscopy above a critical magnetic field have been reported as experimental indications of Majorana zero modes in superconductor–semiconductor nanowires 3–8 . On the other hand, two-dimensional systems offer the alternative approach of confining Majorana channels within planar Josephson junctions, in which the phase difference $\phi$ between the superconducting leads represents an additional tuning knob that is predicted to drive the system into the topological phase at lower magnetic fields than for a system without phase bias 9,10 . Here we report the observation of phase-dependent zero-bias conductance peaks measured by tunnelling spectroscopy at the end of Josephson junctions realized on a heterostructure consisting of aluminium on indium arsenide. Biasing the junction to $\phi$ ≈ $\pi$ reduces the critical field at which the zero-bias peak appears, with respect to $\phi$ = 0. The phase and magnetic-field dependence of the zero-energy states is consistent with a model of Majorana zero modes in finite-size Josephson junctions.

abstract = {Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) in proximity with superconductors are expected to exhibit exotic phenomena, such as topological superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana-bound states (MBS), which may have applications in topological quantum computation. In superconductor–TI–superconductor Josephson junctions, the supercurrent versus the phase difference between the superconductors, referred to as the current–phase relation (CPR), reveals important information including the nature of the superconducting transport. Here, we study the induced superconductivity in gate-tunable Josephson junctions (JJs) made from topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 with superconducting Nb electrodes. We observe highly skewed (non-sinusoidal) CPR in these junctions. The critical current, or the magnitude of the CPR, increases with decreasing temperature down to the lowest accessible temperature (T {\~{}} 20 mK), revealing the existence of low-energy modes in our junctions. The gate dependence shows that close to the Dirac point the CPR becomes less skewed, indicating the transport is more diffusive, most likely due to the presence of electron/hole puddles and charge inhomogeneity. Our experiments provide strong evidence that superconductivity is induced in the highly ballistic topological surface states (TSS) in our gate-tunable TI-based JJs. Furthermore, the measured CPR is in good agreement with the prediction of a model which calculates the phase-dependent eigenstate energies in our system, considering the finite width of the electrodes, as well as the TSS wave functions extending over the entire circumference of the TI.},

In this case, the existence of e/2 charges leads to an 8$\pi$-periodic component of the Josephson current which can be identified through measurement of Shapiro steps in Josephson junctions. In particular, we show that even when there is weak explicit time-reversal symmetry breaking, which causes the two-particle backscattering to be a subleading effect at low energies, its presence can still be detected in driven, current-biased Shapiro step measurements. The disappearance of some of these steps as a function of the drive frequency is directly related to the existence of non-Abelian zero-energy states.

First, the absolute values of the anisotropy energies become greatly enhanced and can significantly exceed the Zeeman energy. Second, the signs of the anisotropy energies due to e-e interactions can change upon renormalization.

abstract = {Transport properties in a quantum resonator structure of a normal-conductor-superconductor (NS) junction are calculated. Quasiparticles in a cavity region undergo multiple reflections due to an abrupt change in the width of the wire and the NS interface. Quantum interference of the reflections modulates the nominal normal reflection probability at the NS boundary. We show that various NS structures can be regarded as the quantum resonator because of the absence of propagation along the NS interface. When the incident energy coincides with the quasibound state energy levels, the zero-voltage conductance exhibits peaks for small voltages applied to the NS junction. The transmission peaks change to dips of nearly perfect reflection when the applied voltage exceeds a critical value. Two branches of the resonance, which are roughly characterized by electron and hole wavelengths, emerge from the individual dip, and the energy difference between them increases with increasing voltage. The electronlike and holelike resonance dips originating from different quasibound states at zero-voltage cross one after another when the voltage approaches the superconducting gap. We find that both crossing and anticrossing can be produced. It is shown that the individual resonance state in the NS system is associated with two zeros and two poles in the complex energy plane. The behavior of the resonance is explained in terms of splitting and merging of the zero-pole pairs. We examine the Greenșs function of a one-dimensional NS system in order to find out how the transmission properties are influenced by the scattering from the NS interface. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

As the thickness is reduced, mode mixing, which is allowed due to the magnetic field, becomes significant and the transmission turns out to be a mixture of resonant transmisison and reflection.

If the normal reflection is enhanced, the conductance exhibits a sinusoidal oscillation. In contrast to the behavior in conventional conductors, the maxima of the oscillation take place at the depopulation thresholds. In high magnetic fields, a periodic transmission resonance with a complete disappearance of the conductance is found, irrespective of the Andreev-reflection probability. The current distribution indicates that this high-field oscillation is ascribed to the skipping orbit along the interface.

abstract = {The quantum Hall effect has recently been generalized from transport of conserved charges to include transport of other approximately conserved-state variables, including spin and valley, via spin- or valley-polarized boundary states with different chiralities. Here, we report a class of quantum Hall effect in Bernal- or ABA-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG), the quantum parity Hall (QPH) effect, in which boundary channels are distinguished by even or odd parity under the system's mirror reflection symmetry. At the charge neutrality point, the longitudinal conductance $\sigma$XX is first quantized to 4e2=h at a small perpendicular magnetic field B$\tau$, establishing the presence of four edge channels. As B$\tau$ increases, $\sigma$XX first decreases to 2e2=h, indicating spin-polarized counterpropagating edge states, and then, to approximately zero. These behaviors arise from level crossings between even- and odd-parity bulk Landau levels driven by exchange interactions with the underlying Fermi sea, which favor an ordinary insulator ground state in the strong B? limit and a spin-polarized state at intermediate fields. The transitions between spin-polarized and -unpolarized states can be tuned by varying Zeeman energy. Our findings demonstrate a topological phase that is protected by a gate-controllable symmetry and sensitive to Coulomb interactions.},

In our previous samples, these states are separated by several microns. Here, a narrow trench perpendicular to the contacts creates counterpropagating quantum Hall edge channels tens of nanometres from each other. Transport measurements demonstrate a change in the low-field Fraunhofer interference pattern for trench devices and show a supercurrent in both trench and reference junctions in the quantum Hall regime.

abstract = {Non-Abelian anyons promise to reveal spectacular features of quantum mechanics that could ultimately provide the foundation for a decoherence-free quantum computer. A key breakthrough in the pursuit of these exotic particles originated from Read and Green's observation that the Moore-Read quantum Hall state and a (relatively simple) two-dimensional p + ip superconductor both support so-called Ising non-Abelian anyons. Here, we establish a similar correspondence between the Z3 Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state and a novel two-dimensional superconductor in which charge-2e Cooper pairs are built from fractionalized quasiparticles. In particular, both phases harbor Fibonacci anyons that-unlike Ising anyons-allow for universal topological quantum computation solely through braiding. Using a variant of Teo and Kane's construction of non-Abelian phases from weakly coupled chains, we provide a blueprint for such a superconductor using Abelian quantum Hall states interlaced with an array of superconducting islands. Fibonacci anyons appear as neutral deconfined particles that lead to a twofold ground-state degeneracy on a torus. In contrast to a p + ip superconductor, vortices do not yield additional particle types, yet depending on nonuniversal energetics can serve as a trap for Fibonacci anyons. These results imply that one can, in principle, combine well-understood and widely available phases of matter to realize non-Abelian anyons with universal braid statistics. Numerous future directions are discussed, including speculations on alternative realizations with fewer experimental requirements.},

The various theoretical methods that have been developed to describe graphene Josephson junctions are examined, together with their advantages and limitations, followed by a discussion on the advances in device fabrication and the relevant length scales. The phase-sensitive properties and phase-particle dynamics of graphene Josephson junctions are examined to provide an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of Josephson coupling via graphene. Thereafter, microscopic transport of correlated quasiparticles produced by Andreev reflections at superconducting interfaces and their phase-coherent behaviors are discussed. Quantum phase transitions studied with graphene as an electrostatically tunable 2D platform are reviewed. The interplay between proximity-induced superconductivity and the quantum-Hall phase is discussed as a possible route to study topological superconductivity and non-Abelian physics.

abstract = {A clear demonstration of topological superconductivity (TS) and Majorana zero modes remains one of the major pending goals in the field of topological materials. One common strategy to generate TS is through the coupling of an s-wave superconductor to a helical half-metallic system. Numerous proposals for the latter have been put forward in the literature, most of them based on semiconductors or topological insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach for the creation of TS in graphene-superconductor junctions without the need for spin-orbit coupling. Our prediction stems from the helicity of graphene's zero-Landau-level edge states in the presence of interactions and from the possibility, experimentally demonstrated, of tuning their magnetic properties with in-plane magnetic fields. We show how canted antiferromagnetic ordering in the graphene bulk close to neutrality induces TS along the junction and gives rise to isolated, topologically protected Majorana bound states at either end.We also discuss possible strategies to detect their presence in graphene Josephson junctions through Fraunhofer pattern anomalies and Andreev spectroscopy. The latter, in particular, exhibits strong unambiguous signatures of the presence of the Majorana states in the form of universal zero-bias anomalies. Remarkable progress has recently been reported in the fabrication of the proposed type of junctions, which offers a promising outlook for Majorana physics in graphene systems.},

abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the $\nu$=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the $\nu$=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We present the results of a numerical calculation on the quantum transport properties in junctions of a two-dimensional electron gas and a superconductor in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The low-field conductance drops in a steplike manner, whenever the Landau levels are depopulated, provided that quasiparticle excitations are almost perfectly Andreev reflected from the interface. If the normal reflection is enhanced, the conductance exhibits a sinusoidal oscillation. In contrast to the behavior in conventional conductors, the maxima of the oscillation take place at the depopulation thresholds. In high magnetic fields, a periodic transmission resonance with a complete disappearance of the conductance is found, irrespective of the Andreev-reflection probability. The current distribution indicates that this high-field oscillation is ascribed to the skipping orbit along the interface. We show that the plateau value in the Hall resistance remains unchanged when one of the leads is replaced by the superconductor. Using the selective edge-state detection technique, the distribution of Andreev-reflected quasiparticles among the edge states can be evaluated. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

Our group has previously observed supercurrents of hundreds of picoamperes in graphene Josephson junctions in the quantum Hall regime. One of the explanations of this phenomenon involves the coupling of an electron edge state on one side of the junction to a hole edge state on the opposite side. In our previous samples, these states are separated by several microns. Here, a narrow trench perpendicular to the contacts creates counterpropagating quantum Hall edge channels tens of nanometres from each other. Transport measurements demonstrate a change in the low-field Fraunhofer interference pattern for trench devices and show a supercurrent in both trench and reference junctions in the quantum Hall regime. The trench junctions show no enhancement of quantum Hall supercurrent and an unexpected supercurrent periodicity with applied field, suggesting the need for further optimization of device parameters.},

abstract = {Topological superconductors can support localized Majorana states at their boundaries 1–5 . These quasi-particle excitations obey non-Abelian statistics that can be used to encode and manipulate quantum information in a topologically protected manner 6,7 . Although signatures of Majorana bound states have been observed in one-dimensional systems, there is an ongoing effort to find alternative platforms that do not require fine-tuning of parameters and can be easily scaled to large numbers of states 8–21 . Here we present an experimental approach towards a two-dimensional architecture of Majorana bound states. Using a Josephson junction made of a HgTe quantum well coupled to thin-film aluminium, we are able to tune the transition between a trivial and a topological superconducting state by controlling the phase difference across the junction and applying an in-plane magnetic field 22 . We determine the topological state of the resulting superconductor by measuring the tunnelling conductance at the edge of the junction. At low magnetic fields, we observe a minimum in the tunnelling spectra near zero bias, consistent with a trivial superconductor. However, as the magnetic field increases, the tunnelling conductance develops a zero-bias peak, which persists over a range of phase differences that expands systematically with increasing magnetic field. Our observations are consistent with theoretical predictions for this system and with full quantum mechanical numerical simulations performed on model systems with similar dimensions and parameters. Our work establishes this system as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and for creating and manipulating Majorana modes and probing topological superconducting phases in two-dimensional systems.},

We show that in the presence of an in-plane Zeeman field, the quasi-one-dimensional region between the two superconductors can support a topological superconducting phase hosting Majorana bound states at its ends. We study the phase diagram of the system as a function of the Zeeman field and the phase difference between the two superconductors (treated as an externally controlled parameter). Remarkably, at a phase difference of p, the topological phase is obtained for almost any value of the Zeeman field and chemical potential. In a setup where the phase is not controlled externally, we find that the system undergoes a first-order topological phase transition when the Zeeman field is varied. At the transition, the phase difference in the ground state changes abruptly from a value close to zero, at which the system is trivial, to a value close to p, at which the system is topological. The critical current through the junction exhibits a sharp minimum at the critical Zeeman field and is therefore a natural diagnostic of the transition. We point out that in the presence of a symmetry under a mirror reflection followed by time reversal, the system belongs to a higher symmetry class, and the phase diagram as a function of the phase difference and the Zeeman field becomes richer.},

abstract = {Using a nonequilibrium-Green-function method, we numerically studied the transport properties of a superconductor-graphene-superconductor Josephson junction hybrid system in the quantum Hall regime. Our numerical calculations show that there are two interference patterns of the critical current due to the unique band structure of graphene. One is caused by the usual intraband Andreev retroreflection process, and the other one is caused by the interband specular Andreev reflection process. In the Andreev retroreflection regime, chiral Andreev edge states are formed and a distinct supercurrent can be observed. The critical current displays an AB oscillation behavior and the period is approximately 2$\Phi$0=h/e. As for the specular Andreev refection process, the reflected holes are bent back to the reverse direction of the incident electrons and the supercurrent flows along both edges. It is similar to a superconductor ring Josephson junction and the period is $\Phi$0=h/2e. However, the critical current for the specular Andreev reflection process is very small and is unlikely to be observable in an experiment. Thus, we conclude that our numerical calculations are inconsistent to the experimental findings by Amet et al. [Science 352, 966 (2016)SCIEAS0036-807510.1126/science.aad6203].},

We show that these new modes can be experimentally identified (and distinguished from Majoranas) using Josephson measurements.

Here we report on missing odd steps in topologically trivial Josephson junctions fabricated on InAs quantum wells. We ascribe our observations to the high transparency of our junctions allowing Landau-Zener transitions. The probability of these processes is shown to be independent of the drive frequency. We analyze our results using a bi-modal transparency distribution which demonstrates that only few modes carrying 4$\pi$ periodic current are sufficient to describe the disappearance of odd steps.

Recently, Josephson junctions using the InAs weak link with epitaxial aluminum contact have improved the product of normal resistance and critical current, IcRN, in addition to fabrication process reliability. Here, we study similar devices with epitaxial contact and find a large supercurrent and substantial product of IcRN in our junctions. However, we find a striking difference when we compare these samples with higher mobility samples in terms of the product of excess current and normal resistance, IexRN. The excess current is negligible in lower mobility devices, while it is substantial and independent of the gate voltage and junction length in high mobility samples. This indicates that even though both sample types have epitaxial contacts, only the high-mobility one has a high transparency interface. In the high mobility short junctions, we observe the values of IcRN/$\Delta$ ∼ 2.2 and IexRN/$\Delta$ ∼ 1.5 in semiconductor weak links.},

abstract = {In a standard Josephson junction the current is zero when the phase difference between superconducting leads is zero. This condition is protected by parity and time-reversal symmetries. However, the combined presence of spin–orbit coupling and magnetic field breaks these symmetries and can lead to a finite supercurrent even when the phase difference is zero. This is the so called anomalous Josephson effect—the hallmark effect of superconducting spintronics—which can be characterized by the corresponding anomalous phase shift. Here we report the observation of a tunable anomalous Josephson effect in InAs/Al Josephson junctions measured via a superconducting quantum interference device. By gate controlling the density of InAs, we are able to tune the spin–orbit coupling in the Josephson junction. This gives us the ability to tune the anomalous phase, and opens new opportunities for superconducting spintronics, and new possibilities for realizing and characterizing topological superconductivity.},

The topic remains controversial because many experiments exhibit a metallic regime with saturating low-temperature resistance, which is at odds with conventional theory. Here, we explore this transition in a highly controllable system, a semiconductor heterostructure with epitaxial aluminium, patterned to form a regular array of superconducting islands connected by a gateable quantum well. Spanning nine orders of magnitude in resistance, the system exhibits regimes of superconducting, metallic and insulating behaviour, along with signatures of flux commensurability and vortex penetration. An in-plane magnetic field eliminates the metallic regime, restoring the direct superconductor–insulator transition; it also improves the scaling behaviour while strongly altering the scaling exponent.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been significant interest in superconducting coherence via chiral quantum-Hall (QH) edge channels at an interface between a two-dimensional normal conductor and a superconductor (N-S) in a strong transverse magnetic field. In the field range where the superconductivity and the QH state coexist, the coherent confinement of electron-and hole-like quasiparticles by the interplay of Andreev reflection and the QH effect leads to the formation of Andreev edge states (AES) along the N-S interface. Here, we report the electrical conductance characteristics via the AES formed in graphene-superconductor hybrid systems in a three-Terminal configuration. This measurement configuration, involving the QH edge states outside a graphene-S interface, allows the detection of the longitudinal and QH conductance separately, excluding the bulk contribution. Convincing evidence for the superconducting coherence and its propagation via the chiral QH edge channels is provided by the conductance enhancement on both the upstream and the downstream sides of the superconducting electrode as well as in bias spectroscopy results below the superconducting critical temperature. Propagation of superconducting coherence via QH edge states was more evident as more edge channels participate in the Andreev process for high filling factors with reduced valley-mixing scattering.},

For (Formula presented) these fall into two phases, weak and strong pairing, which may be distinguished topologically. In the cases with conserved spin, we derive explicitly the Hall conductivity for spin as the corresponding topological invariant. For the spinless p-wave case, the weak-pairing phase has a pair wave function that is asympototically the same as that in the Moore-Read (Pfaffian) quantum Hall state, and we argue that its other properties (edge states, quasihole, and toroidal ground states) are also the same, indicating that nonabelian statistics is a generic property of such a paired phase. The strong-pairing phase is an abelian state, and the transition between the two phases involves a bulk Majorana fermion, the mass of which changes sign at the transition. For the d-wave case, we argue that the Haldane-Rezayi state is not the generic behavior of a phase but describes the asymptotics at the critical point between weak and strong pairing, and has gapless fermion excitations in the bulk. In this case the weak-pairing phase is an abelian phase, which has been considered previously. In the p-wave case with an unbroken (Formula presented) symmetry, which can be applied to the double layer quantum Hall problem, the weak-pairing phase has the properties of the 331 state, and with nonzero tunneling there is a transition to the Moore-Read phase. The effects of disorder on noninteracting quasiparticles are considered. The gapped phases survive, but there is an intermediate thermally conducting phase in the spinless p-wave case, in which the quasiparticles are extended. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a two-dimensional fractional topological superconductor (FTSC) as a strongly correlated topological state which can be achieved by inducing superconductivity into an Abelian fractional quantum Hall state, through the proximity effect. When the proximity coupling is weak, the FTSC has the same topological order as its parent state and is thus Abelian. However, upon increasing the proximity coupling, the bulk gap of such an Abelian FTSC closes and reopens, resulting in a new topological order: a non-Abelian FTSC. Using several arguments we will conjecture that the conformal field theory (CFT) that describes the edge state of the non-Abelian FTSC is U(1)/Z 2 orbifold theory and use this to write down the ground-state wave function. Further, we predict FTSC based on the Laughlin state at $\nu$=1/m filling to host fractionalized Majorana zero modes bound to superconducting vortices. These zero modes are non-Abelian quasiparticles, which is evident in their quantum dimension of dm=√2m. Using the multi-quasi-particle wave function based on the edge CFT, we derive the projective braid matrix for the zero modes. Finally, the connection between the non-Abelian FTSCs and the Z2m rotor model with a similar topological order is illustrated. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

These states support non-Abelian excitations from which protected quantum gates can be designed. However, there is no experimental evidence for these non-Abelian anyons to date. In this paper, we study the $\nu$ = 2/k FQH-superconductor heterostructure and find the superconducting analogue of the Zk parafermion FQH state. Our main tool is the mapping of the FQH into coupled one-dimensional chains, each with a pair of counterpropagating modes. We show that by inducing intrachain pairing and charge preserving backscattering with identical couplings, the one-dimensional chains flow into gapless Zk parafermions when k {\textless} 4. By studying the effect of interchain coupling, we show that every parafermion mode becomes massive except for the two outermost ones. Thus, we achieve a fractional topological superconductor whose chiral edge state is described by a Zk parafermion conformal field theory. For instance, we find that a $\nu$ =2/3 FQH in proximity to a superconductor produces a Z3 parafermion superconducting state. This state is topologically indistinguishable from the non-Abelian part of the $\nu$ =12/5 Read-Rezayi state.

Here, we report transport measurements of just such a system, which consists of a quantum point contact (QPC) in a two-dimensional GaAs/AlGaAs electron gas that itself exhibits a well-developed fractional quantum Hall effect at a bulk filling fraction νbulk=5/2. We observe plateau-like features at an effective filling fraction of νQPC=5/2 for lithographic contact widths of 1.2 μm and 0.8 μm, but not 0.5 μm. Transport near νQPC=5/2 in the QPCs is consistent with a picture of chiral Luttinger-liquid edge states with inter-edge tunnelling, suggesting that an incompressible state at νQPC=5/2 forms in this confined geometry.},

abstract = {The self-consistent quantum-electrostatic (also known as Poisson-Schr{\"{o}}dinger) problem is notoriously difficult in situations where the density of states varies rapidly with energy. At low temperatures, these fluctuations make the problem highly non-linear which renders iterative schemes deeply unstable. We present a stable algorithm that provides a solution to this problem with controlled accuracy. The technique is intrinsically convergent even in highly non-linear regimes. We illustrate our approach with both a calculation of the compressible and incompressible stripes in the integer quantum Hall regime as well as a calculation of the differential conductance of a quantum point contact geometry. Our technique provides a viable route for the predictive modeling of the transport properties of quantum nanoelectronics devices.},

@article{Yuan2020,
abstract = {Near-surface indium arsenide quantum wells have recently attracted a great deal of interest since they can be interfaced epitaxially with superconducting films and have proven to be a robust platform for exploring mesoscopic and topological superconductivity. In this paper, we present magnetotransport properties of two-dimensional electron gases confined to an indium arsenide quantum well near the surface. The electron mass extracted from the envelope of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations shows an average effective mass m∗=0.04 at a low magnetic field. Complementary to our magnetotransport study, we employed cyclotron resonance measurements and extracted the electron effective mass in the ultrahigh magnetic-field regime. Both regimes can be understood by considering a model that includes nonparabolicity of the indium arsenide conduction bands.},

abstract = {We propose a quantitative electrostatic theory of the gate-induced confinement of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall regime. The self-consistent electrostatic potential in the region occupied by 2DEG changes in a steplike manner due to the formation of alternating strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquids. We obtain the dependence of positions and widths of these strips on the filling factor. Incompressible strips are shown to be much more narrow than the compressible ones. The relationship between the widths of the adjacent compressible and incompressible strips is found to be universal: It does not depend on the strip number, magnetic field, or gate voltage. Our theory enables us to explain results obtained in experimental studies of edge-state equilibration. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. It aims to be a user-friendly, universal, and high-performance toolbox for the simulation of physical systems of any dimensionality and geometry that can be described by a tight-binding model. Kwant has been designed such that the natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices, symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) are exposed in a simple and transparent way. Defining a new simulation setup is very similar to describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Greens functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its extensible and modular nature.

The Andreev-type process of the conversion of the quasiparticle current into the superflow is shown to be strongly affected by the mixing of the edge states localized at the NS and insulating boundaries. The magnetoconductance in 2D NS structures is calculated for both quadratic and Dirac-like normal state spectra. Assuming a random scattering of the edge modes we analyze both the average value and fluctuations of conductance for an arbitrary number of conducting channels.

	Abstract = {The coherent tunnelling of Cooper pairs across Josephson junctions (JJs) generates a nonlinear inductance that is used extensively in quantum information processors based on superconducting circuits, from setting qubit transition frequencies1 and interqubit coupling strengths2 to the gain of parametric amplifiers3 for quantum-limited readout. The inductance is either set by tailoring the metal oxide dimensions of single JJs, or magnetically tuned by parallelizing multiple JJs in superconducting quantum interference devices with local current-biased flux lines. JJs based on superconductor--semiconductor hybrids represent a tantalizing all-electric alternative. The gatemon is a recently developed transmon variant that employs locally gated nanowire superconductor--semiconductor JJs for qubit control4,5. Here we go beyond proof-of-concept and demonstrate that semiconducting channels etched from a wafer-scale two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are a suitable platform for building a scalable gatemon-based quantum computer. We show that 2DEG gatemons meet the requirements6 by performing voltage-controlled single qubit rotations and two-qubit swap operations. We measure qubit coherence times up to \~{}2 μs, limited by dielectric loss in the 2DEG substrate.},

@article{Zhao2020,
abstract = {The search for topological excitations such as Majorana fermions has spurred interest in the boundaries between distinct quantum states. Here, we explore an interface between two prototypical phases of electrons with conceptually different ground states: the integer quantum Hall insulator and the s-wave superconductor. We find clear signatures of hybridized electron and hole states similar to chiral Majorana fermions, which we refer to as chiral Andreev edge states (CAESs). These propagate along the interface in the direction determined by the magnetic field and their interference can turn an incoming electron into an outgoing electron or hole, depending on the phase accumulated by the CAESs along their path. Our results demonstrate that these excitations can propagate and interfere over a significant length, opening future possibilities for their coherent manipulation.},

abstract = "InXGa1−XSb has the highest hole mobility amongst all III–V semiconductors which can be enhanced further with the use of strain. The use of confinement and strain in InXGa1−XSb quantum wells lifts the degeneracy between the light and heavy hole bands which leads to reduction in the hole effective mass in the lowest occupied band and an increase in the mobility. We present magnetotransport measurements on compressively strained InXGa1−XSb and GaSb quantum wells. Hall-bar and Van de Pauw structures were fabricated and Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in the temperature range of T=2–10K for magnetic fields of B=0–9T were measured. The reduction of effective hole mass with strain was quantified. These results are in excellent agreement with modeling results from band structure calculations of the effective hole mass in the presence of strain and confinement."

    abstract = { We present a theoretical and experimental study on electronic and magneto-optical properties of p-type paramagnetic InMnAs dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) alloys in ultrahigh (> 100 T) external magnetic fields (B). Theoretical calculations are based on an 8-band Pidgeon–Brown model which is generalized to include the wavevector dependence of the electronic states along B as well as s–d and p–d exchange interactions with localized Mnd-electrons. The spin-dependent electronic structure as a function of Mn doping is computed and the dependence of the valence band structure on parameters such as the sp–d exchange interaction strength and effective masses in paramagnetic p-InMnAs alloys are examined. The cyclotron resonance (CR) and magneto-optical properties of InMnAs are calculated using Fermi's golden rule. Two strong CR peaks are observed in p-type InMnAs alloys which correspond to the transitions within either heavy-hole (HH) or light-hole (LH) Landau levels. Furthermore, we also observed strong resonance absorption for electron-active polarization which can occur in p-type semiconductors originating from transitions between the light and heavy hole Landau levels. }

We make use of these properties to explore some aspects of electron spin in InSb quantum wells with far-infrared magneto-spectroscopy. We observe the clear signature of spin-resolved cyclotron resonance caused by the non-parabolicity of the conduction band. We observe avoided-level crossings at magnetic fields where Landau levels of the same spin are predicted to intersect. We also study electron spin resonance in the far infrared over a wide range of magnetic field. In samples with symmetrically designed quantum wells we find cyclotron masses and observed g-factors in good agreement with a Pidgeon–Brown analysis adapted to the two-dimensional band structure. However, the spin splitting approaches ∼3meV as the magnetic field approaches zero in samples intentionally asymmetrically doped."

Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), an ultra-high vacuum (UHV), thin-film deposition technique, produces the highest quality 2DEGs and has played a central role in a number of discoveries that have at their root the interplay of reduced dimensionality, strong electron-electron interactions, and disorder. This review attempts to describe the latest developments in heterostructure design, MBE technology, and the evolution of our understanding of disorder that result in improved material quality and facilitate discovery of new phenomena at ever finer energy scales. }

	Abstract = {The quantum Hall (QH) effect supports a set of chiral edge states at the boundary of a two-dimensional system. A superconductor (SC) contacting these states can provide correlations of the quasiparticles in the dissipationless edge states. Here we fabricated highly transparent and nanometre-scale SC junctions to graphene. We demonstrate that the QH edge states can couple via superconducting correlations through the SC electrode narrower than the superconducting coherence length. We observe that the chemical potential of the edge state exhibits a sign reversal across the SC electrode. This provides direct evidence of conversion of the incoming electron to the outgoing hole along the chiral edge state, termed crossed Andreev conversion (CAC). We show that CAC can successfully describe the temperature, bias and SC electrode width dependences. This hybrid SC/QH system could provide a novel route to create isolated non-Abelian anyonic zero modes, in resonance with the chiral edge states.},

	Abstract = {The search for topological excitations such as Majorana fermions has spurred interest in the boundaries between distinct quantum states. Here, we explore an interface between two prototypical phases of electrons with conceptually different ground states: the integer quantum Hall insulator and the s-wave superconductor. We find clear signatures of hybridized electron and hole states similar to chiral Majorana fermions, which we refer to as chiral Andreev edge states (CAESs). These propagate along the interface in the direction determined by the magnetic field and their interference can turn an incoming electron into an outgoing electron or hole, depending on the phase accumulated by the CAESs along their path. Our results demonstrate that these excitations can propagate and interfere over a significant length, opening future possibilities for their coherent manipulation.},

	abstract = {In superconductors, the electrical current is carried by {\textquotedblleft}Cooper pairs,{\textquotedblright} formed out of an electron and a hole. This supercurrent will happily cross a thin barrier between two superconductors. But what if a strong magnetic field were applied at the barrier, forcing charge carriers to travel only along the edge of the barrier? Amet et al. explored this regime in a sample consisting of two superconducting electrodes and a graphene barrier under magnetic fields of up to 2 tesla (see the Perspective by Mason). Their transport measurements were consistent with a model in which the supercurrent was carried by the edge states in graphene.Science, this issue p. 966; see also p. 891A promising route for creating topological states and excitations is to combine superconductivity and the quantum Hall (QH) effect. Despite this potential, signatures of superconductivity in the QH regime remain scarce, and a superconducting current through a QH weak link has been challenging to observe. We demonstrate the existence of a distinct supercurrent mechanism in encapsulated graphene samples contacted by superconducting electrodes, in magnetic fields as high as 2 tesla. The observation of a supercurrent in the QH regime marks an important step in the quest for exotic topological excitations, such as Majorana fermions and parafermions, which may find applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

	Abstract = {The fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity, remarkable phenomena in their own right, can harbour even more exotic physics at their interface. In particular, coupling quantum Hall edges with a superconductor can create emergent excitations known as non-Abelian anyons that trap widely coveted Majorana fermion zero-modes and generalizations thereof. We uncover non-local transport signatures of these zero-modes that not only provide striking experimental signatures of the anyons, but moreover allow one to construct novel circuit elements, including superconducting current and voltage mirrors, fractional charge transistors and flux-based capacitors. Underlying this unusual transport is a phenomenon that we term `perfect Andreev conversion'---whereby quasiparticles propagating chirally at the edge reverse their electric charge as a result of hybridization with the zero-modes. Our findings suggest numerous experimental directions in the study of quantum-Hall--superconductor systems hybrids and highlight a fundamentally new application of non-Abelian anyons.},

	Abstract = {At non-zero temperatures, superconductors contain excitations known as Bogoliubov quasiparticles (QPs). The mesoscopic dynamics of QPs inform the design of quantum information processors, among other devices. Knowledge of these dynamics stems from experiments in which QPs are injected in a controlled fashion, typically at energies comparable to the pairing energy1--5. Here we perform tunnel spectroscopy of a mesoscopic superconductor under high electric fields. We observe QP injection due to field-emitted electrons with 106 times the pairing energy, an unexplored regime of QP dynamics. Upon application of a gate voltage, the QP injection decreases the critical current and, at sufficiently high electric field, a field-emission current (<0.1 nA in our device) switches the mesoscopic superconductor into the normal state, consistent with earlier observations6. We expect that high-energy injection will be useful for developing QP-tolerant quantum information processors, will allow rapid control of resonator quality factors and will enable the design of electric-field-controlled superconducting devices with new functionality.},

    "abstract": "Given a construction $f$ on groups, we say that a group $G$ is \\textit{$f$-realisable} if there is a group $H$ such that $G\\cong f(H)$, and \\textit{completely $f$-realisable} if there is a group $H$ such that $G\\cong f(H)$ and every subgroup of $G$ is isomorphic to $f(H_1)$ for some subgroup $H_1$ of $H$ and vice versa.\n  In this paper, we determine completely ${\\rm Aut}$-realisable groups. We also study $f$-realisable groups for $f=Z,F,M,D,Φ$, where $Z(H)$, $F(H)$, $M(H)$, $D(H)$ and $Φ(H)$ denote the center, the Fitting subgroup, the Chermak-Delgado subgroup, the derived subgroup and the Frattini subgroup of the group $H$, respectively.",

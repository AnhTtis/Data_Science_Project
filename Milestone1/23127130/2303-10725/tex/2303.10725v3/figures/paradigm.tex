   \caption{An overview of online updates with offline consolidation paradigm. While awake, agent performs online learning and while asleep, it performs computationally restricted offline learning. This wake/sleep cycles oscillate. Thus, our paradigm can be viewed as a combination of class incremental batch learning and online learning paradigms.

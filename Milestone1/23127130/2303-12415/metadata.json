    "abstract": "Computing the 4D Euclidean path integral to one-loop order we find the large quantum corrections that govern the behavior of a spherically symmetric non-supersymmetric near-extremal black hole at very low temperature. These corrections appear from the near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal black hole. Using first-order perturbation theory we find that such corrections arise from the zero modes of the extremal background. In the logarithm of the partition function, these correspond to terms involving logarithm of temperature. Part of our result matches with the existing one in literature derived from an effective Schwarzian theory.",

	abstract = {An overview of preconditioning for the steady-state compressible inviscid fluid dynamic equations is presented. Extensions to the Navier-Stokes equations are also considered. These preconditioners are necessary for many algorithms in order to have the correct behavior at low speeds and to converge to the solution of the incompressible equations as the Mach number goes to zero. In addition, the preconditioning accelerates the convergence to a steady state for problems in which a significant portion of the flow is low speed. This low speed preconditioner can be combined with Jacobi and line preconditioners to damp high frequencies at all speeds. This is necessary for use with multigrid methods. Such combined methods are also better at accelerating problems with high aspect ratios. Details of the implementation are presented including several different variants for the preconditioning matrix.},

This explains in a rigorous manner why this approximation of the compressible equations fails to compute very subsonic flow. We then show that a preconditioning of the numerical dissipation tensor allows to recover a correct scaling of the pressure.

	abstract = {In recent years, Roe-type schemes based on different ideas have been developed for all-speed flows, such as the preconditioned Roe, the All-Speed Roe, Thornber-Drikakis’s, Rieper’s and Fillion et al.’s modified Roe schemes. This work explores why these schemes succeed or fail with the non-physical behavior, checkerboard and global cut-off problems. Comparison and analysis show that the non-physical behavior and checkerboard problems are caused by the order of the sound speed being too large and too small in the coefficients of the velocity-difference and pressure-difference dissipation terms, respectively. These problems can be resolved by choosing coefficients with zero-order sound speed. In addition, to avoid the negative effects of the global cut-off strategy on accuracy while maintaining computational stability, the terms in the numerator of the coefficients can be determined by local variables, while those in the denominator remain the global cut-off. Applying these three rules, HLL and AUSM+-up can also be analyzed showing the universality of the rules, which are not limited to the Roe-type scheme. Especially, three novel schemes, all-speed preconditioned Roe scheme, all-speed HLL scheme, and all-speed AUSM+-up scheme, are proposed as examples to demonstrate how these ideas can be applied to construct more satisfactory schemes for all-speed flows. Asymptotic analysis and numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis and the rules obtained in the work.},

For an efficient computation, this paper deals with new approaches of implicit time integration method. In this approach, the large sparse matrix system, which consists of flux Jacobian of numerical flux function, has to be solved in each time step. Firstly, a simple Gauss–Seidel iteration method named TC-PGS1(Time Consistent Preconditioned Gauss–Seidel 1) which has flavor of the time derivative preconditioning is introduced. Secondary, we tried to use FGMRES (k) (Flexible Generalized Minimum Residual Method) to solve the non-diagonal dominant linear system arising from Jacobian of flux function SLAU. TC-PGS1 is also used as the matrix preconditioner for FGMRES (k). Optimal parameters for FGMRES (k) is investigated numerically and the performances on computational efficiency of the new methods are compared. It is indicated that FGMRES (k) has apparent advantage on computation of low Mach number flows with sound propagation, however, simpler TC-PGS1 has comparable performance if only flow fields are of interest.},

The scheme is remarkably simple and yet its accuracy rivals, and in some cases surpasses, that of Roe's solver in the Euler and Navier-Stokes solutions carried out in this study, The scheme is robust and converges as fast as the Roe splitting. We propose an appropriately defined cell-face advection Mach number using values from the two straddling cells via associated characteristic speeds. This interface Mach number is then used to determine the upwind extrapolation for the convective quantities. Accordingly, the name of the scheme is coined as the advection upstream splitting method (AUSM). We also introduce a new pressure splitting which is shown to behave successfully, yielding much smoother results than other existing pressure splittings. Of particular interest is the supersonic blunt body problem in which the Roe scheme gives anomalous solutions. The AUSM produces correct solutions without difficulty for a wide range of flow conditions as well as grids.},

This paper describes recent progress toward improving the AUSM. We show that the improved scheme, termed AUSM+, features the following properties: (1) exact resolution of 1D contact and shock discontinuities, (2) positivity preserving of scalar quantity such as the density, (3) free of “carbuncle phenomenon,” (4) free of oscillations at the slowly moving shock, (5) algorithmic simplicity, and (6) easy entension to treat other hyperbolic systems. In this paper, we lay out a general construction for the AUSM+scheme and prove its heretofore unreported mathematical properties. Especially a CFL-like condition for positivity-preserving property is derived. This positivity-preserving proves to be tightly related to the capability of calculating strong rarefaction and near vacuum flows. Finally, results of numerical tests on many problems are given to confirm the capability and improvements on a variety of problems including those failed by other well-known schemes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present ideas and procedure to extend the AUSM-family schemes to solve flows at all speed regimes. To achieve this, we first focus on the theoretical development for the low Mach number limit. Specifically, we employ asymptotic analysis to formally derive proper scalings for the numerical fluxes in the limit of small Mach number. The resulting new scheme is shown to be simple and remarkably improved from previous schemes in robustness and accuracy. The convergence rate is shown to be independent of Mach number in the low Mach number regime up to M∞=0.5, and it is also essentially constant in the transonic and supersonic regimes. Contrary to previous findings, the solution remains stable, even if no local preconditioning matrix is included in the time derivative term, albeit a different convergence history may occur. Moreover, the new scheme is demonstrated to be accurate against analytical and experimental results. In summary, the new scheme, named AUSM+-up, improves over previous versions and eradicates fails found therein.},

The algorithm uses a preconditioning matrix that introduces well-conditioned eigenvalues while simultaneously avoiding nonphysical time reversals for viscous flows. The resulting algorithm also provides a mechanism for controlling the inviscid and viscous time step parameters at very diffusive flows, thereby ensuring rapid convergence for very viscous flows as well as for inviscid flows. Computational capabilities are demonstrated through computation of a wide variety of problems. Convergence rates are shown to be accelerated by as much as two orders of magnitudes, while providing solutions that are indentical to those obtained without preconditioning method.},

Then, we developed schemes that have those two properties above by combining (a) a proposed pressure flux (having Mach-proportional dissipation within numerical shock), and (b) a mass flux of an all-speed AUSM-family scheme (SLAU, AUSM+-up or LDFSS2001).

Incompressibility is only non-trivial in multiple spatial dimensions. Low Mach fixes, however generally are applied to the one-dimensional method and the method is then used in a dimensionally split way. This often reduces its stability. Here, it is suggested to keep the one-dimensional method as it is, and only to extend it to multiple dimensions in a particular, all-speed way. This strategy is found to lead to much more stable numerical methods. Apart from the conceptually pleasing property of modifying the scheme only when it becomes necessary, the multi-dimensional all-speed extension also does not include any free parameters or arbitrary functions, which generally are difficult to choose, or might be problem dependent.

Among them, the F-Roe and T-D-Roe schemes have been found to get incorrect density fluctuation in low Mach flows, which is expected to be with the square of Mach number. Asymptotic analysis presents the mechanism of how the density fluctuation problem relates to the incorrect order of terms in the energy equation \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}rho \}\} \{{\textbackslash}tilde\{a\}\} \{{\textbackslash}tilde\{U\}\}{\textbackslash}varDelta U\}\$\$. It is known that changing the upwind scheme coefficients of the pressure-difference dissipation term \$\$D{\textasciicircum}P\$\$and the velocity-difference dissipation term in the momentum equation \$\$D{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rho U\}\$\$to the order of \$\$O(c{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$\$and \$\$O(c{\textasciicircum}\{0\})\$\$can improve the level of pressure and velocity accuracy at low speeds. This paper shows that corresponding changes in energy equation can also improve the density accuracy in low speeds. We apply this modification to a recently proposed scheme, TV-MAS, to get a new scheme, TV-MAS2. Unsteady Gresho vortex flow, double shear-layer flow, low Mach number flows over the inviscid cylinder, and NACA0012 airfoil show that energy equation modification in these schemes can obtain the expected square Ma scaling of density fluctuations, which is in good agreement with corresponding asymptotic analysis. Therefore, this density correction is expected to be widely implemented into all-speed compressible flow solvers.},

This scaling function is restrained by a shock indicator and free from the cut-off reference Mach number. The resulting scheme is easily implemented and computational expense is negligible. In addition, it avoids global cut-off problem and preserves time consistency unlike preconditioning techniques.

	abstract = {This article examines the performance of all-speed AUSM-family schemes in predicting low Mach number turbulent flow. A fully-developed turbulent channel flow at a friction velocity Reynolds number of 180 is solved as a benchmark problem. Direct numerical simulation is performed at Mach 0.3, 0.1 and 0.01, and the obtained results are compared with existing incompressible DNS results. The present DNS is performed by the AUSM+-up and SLAU schemes, and high-order spatial accuracy is achieved by using several variants of WENO interpolation methods. Numerical tests are performed at Mach 0.3, which is at the limit between compressible and incompressible flows. The results show that the all-speed AUSM-family schemes can compute turbulent channel flow, but great care must be taken to suppress the numerical dissipations inherent in WENO methods to solve turbulent flows accurately. Among the tested interpolation methods, WENO5-RL and WENO6-RL combined with Thornber’s low Mach number correction achieve excellent agreement with the incompressible pseudo-spectral DNS results, and they are recommended to be used in practical applications. DNSs are also performed at Mach 0.1 and 0.01, which are completely in incompressible flow. The obtained results show that the all-speed AUSM-family schemes can compute velocity field in turbulent channel flow accurately in the low Mach number regime. The results of RMS pressure fluctuations suggest that improvement is required for the prediction of small pressure fluctuations in the low Mach number regime.},

In particular, we clearly explain why this inaccuracy problem concerns the 2D or 3D geometry and does not concern the 1D geometry. The theoretical arguments are based on the Hodge decomposition, on the fact that an appropriate well-prepared subspace is invariant for the linear wave equation and on the notion of first-order modified equation. This theoretical approach allows to propose a simple modification that can be applied to any colocated scheme of Godunov type or not in order to define a large class of colocated schemes accurate at low Mach number on any mesh. It also allows to justify colocated schemes that are accurate at low Mach number as, for example, the Roe–Turkel and the AUSM+-up schemes, and to find a link with a colocated incompressible scheme stabilized with a Brezzi–Pitkäranta type stabilization. Numerical results justify the theoretical arguments proposed in this paper.},

	abstract = {We present a low-Mach number fix for Roe’s approximate Riemann solver (LMRoe). As the Mach number Ma tends to zero, solutions to the Euler equations converge to solutions of the incompressible equations. Yet, standard upwind schemes do not reproduce this convergence: the artificial viscosity grows like 1/Ma, leading to a loss of accuracy as Ma→0. With a discrete asymptotic analysis of the Roe scheme we identify the responsible term: the jump in the normal velocity component ΔU of the Riemann problem. The remedy consists of reducing this term by one order of magnitude in terms of the Mach number. This is achieved by simply multiplying ΔU with the local Mach number. With an asymptotic analysis it is shown that all discrepancies between continuous and discrete asymptotics disappear, while, at the same time, checkerboard modes are suppressed. Low Mach number test cases show, first, that the accuracy of LMRoe is independent of the Mach number, second, that the solution converges to the incompressible limit for Ma→0 on a fixed mesh and, finally, that the new scheme does not produce pressure checkerboard modes. High speed test cases demonstrate the fall back of the new scheme to the classical Roe scheme at moderate and high Mach numbers.},

	abstract = {A modification of the Roe scheme called L2Roe for low dissipation low Mach Roe is presented. It reduces the dissipation of kinetic energy at the highest resolved wave numbers in a low Mach number test case of decaying isotropic turbulence. This is achieved by scaling the jumps in all discrete velocity components within the numerical flux function. An asymptotic analysis is used to show the correct pressure scaling at low Mach numbers and to identify the reduced numerical dissipation in that regime. Furthermore, the analysis allows a comparison with two other schemes that employ different scaling of discrete velocity jumps, namely, LMRoe and a method of Thornber et al. To this end, we present for the first time an asymptotic analysis of the last method. Numerical tests on cases ranging from low Mach number (M∞=0.001) to hypersonic (M∞=5) viscous flows are used to illustrate the differences between the methods and to show the correct behavior of L2Roe. No conflict is observed between the reduced numerical dissipation and the accuracy or stability of the scheme in any of the investigated test cases. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present and analyse in this paper a novel colocated Finite Volume scheme for the solution of the Stokes problem. It has been developed following two main ideas. On one hand, the discretization of the pressure gradient term is built as the discrete transposed of the velocity divergence term, the latter being evaluated using a natural finite volume approximation; this leads to a non-standard interpolation formula for the expression of the pressure on the edges of the control volumes. On the other hand, the scheme is stabilized using a finite volume analogue to the Brezzi-Pitkäranta technique. We prove that, under usual regularity assumptions for the solution (each component of the velocity in H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}(∞) and pressure in H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}(∞)), the scheme is first order convergent in the usual finite volume discrete H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} norm and the L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} norm for respectively the velocity and the pressure, provided, in particular, that the approximation of the mass balance flux is of second order. With the above-mentioned interpolation formulae, this latter condition is satisfied only for particular meshes: acute angles triangulations or rectangular structured discretizations in two dimensions, and rectangular parallelepipedic structured discretizations in three dimensions. Numerical experiments confirm this analysis and show, in addition, a second order convergence for the velocity in a discrete L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} norm.},

that the checkerboard modes are the fastest diffused modes when we use the Godunov scheme in monodimensional geometry and that they are constant modes when the Godunov scheme is modified by centering the discretization of the pressure gradient. This study underlines that, on a cartesian mesh, the checkerboard modes do not exist at low Mach number when the compressible Navier-Stokes system is solved with a Godunov type scheme and may appear at large Reynolds number when the Godunov type scheme is modified to obtain an accurate scheme at low Mach number.},

In addition, incompressible scaling of the pressure and density variations are recovered. Numerical tests using a Godunov-type method demonstrate that the new scheme captures shock waves well, significantly improves resolution of low Mach number features and greatly reduces high wave number dissipation in the case of homogeneous decaying turbulence and Richtmyer–Meshkov mixing.

The proposed pressure-velocity coupling and a transient SIMPLEC algorithm are validated and verified for a 1D acoustic wave propagation and a convective isentropic vortex to qualitatively evaluate their convergence properties. Next, both algorithms are used to predict aerodynamic and aeroacoustic behaviour of flow past a wall-mounted side mirror. The proposed scheme is stable at acoustic CFL number greater than one, and at convective Co number equal one. The L2 error norms of both schemes exhibit second order accuracy as grids are refined, while the new scheme requires significantly less computation effort for an equal error.

	abstract = {A semi-implicit numerical method for time accurate simulation of compressible flow is presented. By extending the low Mach number pressure correction method, a Helmholtz equation for pressure is obtained in the case of compressible flow. The method avoids the acoustic CFL limitation, allowing a time step restricted only by the convective velocity, resulting in significant efficiency gains. Use of a discretization that is centered in both time and space results in zero artificial damping of acoustic waves. The method is attractive for problems in which Mach numbers are low, and the acoustic waves of most interest are those having low frequency, such as acoustic combustion instabilities. Both of these characteristics suggest the use of time steps larger than those allowable by an acoustic CFL limitation. In some cases it may be desirable to include a small amount of numerical dissipation to eliminate oscillations due to small-wavelength, high-frequency, acoustic modes, which are not of interest; therefore, a provision for doing this in a controlled manner is included in the method. Results of the method for several model problems are presented, and the performance of the method in a large eddy simulation is examined.},

In Sec. 1, we define and analyze the low Mach number problem through a linear analysis of a perturbed linear wave equation. Then, we show how to modify Godunov-type schemes applied to the linear wave equation to make this scheme accurate at any Mach number. This allows to define an all Mach correction and to propose a linear all Mach Godunov scheme for the linear wave equation. In Sec. 2, we apply the all Mach correction proposed in Sec. 1 to the case of the nonlinear barotropic Euler system when the Godunov-type scheme is a Roe scheme. A linear stability result is proposed and a formal asymptotic analysis justifies the construction in this nonlinear case by showing how this construction is related with the linear analysis of Sec. 1. At last, we apply in Sec. 3 the all Mach correction proposed in Sec. 1 in the case of the full Euler compressible system. Numerous numerical results proposed in Secs. 1–3 justify the theoretical results and show that the obtained all Mach Godunov-type schemes are both accurate and stable for all Mach numbers. We also underline that the proposed approach can be applied to other schemes and allows to justify other existing all Mach schemes.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses entropy generation and the corresponding dissipation of kinetic energy associated with high-resolution, shock-capturing (Godunov) methods. Analytical formulae are derived for the rate of increase of entropy given arbitrary jumps in primitive variables at a cell interface. It is demonstrated that for general continuously varying flows the inherent numerical entropy increase of Godunov methods is not proportional to the velocity jump cubed as is commonly assumed, but it is proportional to the velocity jump squared. Furthermore, the dissipation of kinetic energy is directly linked to temperature multiplied by change in entropy at low Mach numbers. The kinetic energy dissipation rate is shown to be proportional to the velocity jump squared and the speed of sound. The leading order dissipation rate associated with jumps in pressure, density and shear waves is detailed and further shown that at low Mach number it is the dissipation due to the perpendicular velocity jumps which dominates. This explains directly the poor performance of Godunov methods at low Mach numbers. The analysis is also applied to high-order accurate methods in space and time and all analytical results are validated with simple numerical experiments.},

It includes both subchannel scale and CFD scale capabilities. To provide a relevant response to different core concepts and multiple industrial applications, several models coexist in FLICA-OVAP platform: the homogeneous equilibrium model, the drift-flux model which is directly derived from the previous CEA core code FLICA-4 (Royer, Aniel, Bergeron, Fillion, Gallo, Gaudier, Grégoire, Martin, Richebois, Salvadore, Zimmer, Chataing, Clément, François, 2005. FLICA4: status of numerical and physical models and overview of applications. In: Proceedings of NURETH-11, Avignon, France), the two-fluid model, and finally, a general multifield model, with a variable number of fields for both vapor and liquid phases. For each model, an adapted set of closure laws is proposed concerning mass and heat transfer, interfacial and wall forces, and turbulence. The solving of equations is based on finite volume methods for multidimensional unstructured meshes. For instance, Riemann-type solvers, adapted to low Mach number, can be used for the numerical discretization of the convective part of the problem, while the diffusion part is discretized using a diamond-type solver, adequate for non-conforming meshes. An object-oriented architecture allows a flexible and efficient coexistence of several systems of equations, numerical solvers, and the manifold closure laws, which makes FLICA-OVAP a efficient tool for research purpose. The architecture also enables distributed parallel calculations, multidisciplinary couplings (with the neutronics codes CRONOS/APOLLO and with an integrated thermal solver for fuels rods and plates) or multiscale couplings (between different models in our platform or with the system code CATHARE). Some preliminary computations related to industrial needs will be presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {The time-marching approach has clear physical meaning and strict mathematical nature and has been applied in computation of compressible flows widely and extended to many uniform algorithms for All-Speed flows. Remedy for its weakness in the problem of checkerboard decoupling of pressure field for incompressible flows is envisaged with the time-marching momentum interpolation method (MIM) taken into account in this paper. Existing preconditioning methods for suppressing decoupling and time-marching MIM are analyzed for this purpose, and algorithms of time-marching MIM are proposed for steady and unsteady flows and for All-Speed flows. Asymptotic analysis shows that the supposed time-marching MIM has at least a third-order accuracy, better than the existing time-marching coupling methods, which only have an accuracy of the same order as the adopted scheme has. Effects of the time step sizes on the ability of the time-marching MIM to suppress the checkerboard pressure decoupling are particularly discussed in terms of the dual-time stepping approach, and it is revealed how the decreased sizes of either the pseudo- or physical-time step increases the possibility of decoupling and how Choi’s modification, in which the history of the interface velocity is decided by itself instead of the arithmetic average of the velocities on its adjacent nodes, removes the unphysical pressure oscillation with small size of the physical time step but leads to divergence with the pseudo-time step as well. As a remedy for the pseudo-time step, such methods are recommended as implicit methods and the local-time step method with a proposed modification of the time-marching MIM preventing accuracy loss due to very large time step size. Numerical experiments support the theoretical analyses and show the validity of the time-marching MIM proposed.},

Based on preconditioning technology, a new scheme, All-Speed-Roe scheme, is proposed. Compared with Roe scheme, it decreases the effect of acoustic speed in its numerical dissipation when Mach numbers decrease. Compared with traditional preconditioned Roe scheme, it overcomes the limit of being cut-off by the global Mach number through modifying the eigenvalues only and has the good convergence acceleration rate for low-Mach-number flows through multiplying the spatial residual by the preconditioner. From another perspective, All-Speed-Roe scheme suggests that there is no necessity to replace the physical acoustic speed in denominator with pseudo-acoustic speed. In theory, All-Speed-Roe scheme is suitable for all speed flow calculations with capturing shock and simulating low-Mach-number flows. The numerical results of Euler nozzle flow, RANS of NASA rotor 37 flow, Euler simulation, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) of high-loaded blade T106 flow show that All-Speed-Roe scheme can replace traditional preconditioned Roe scheme because it is easier for programming, more robust in computations, more accurate in spatial, and has good convergence rate.},

Compared with traditional preconditioned Roe scheme, All-Speed-Roe scheme changes non-linear eigenvalues in the numerical dissipation terms of Roe-type schemes. With an asymptotic analysis, the low Mach number behaviour of the scheme is studied theoretically in two ways. In one way, All-Speed-Roe scheme is regarded as finite magnification of Low-Speed-Roe scheme in the low Mach number limit. In the other way, a general form of All-Speed-Roe scheme is analyzed. Both ways demonstrate that All-Speed-Roe scheme has the same low Mach number behaviour as the original governing equation in the continuous case, which includes three important features: pressure variation scales with the square of the Mach number, the zero order velocity field is subject to a divergence constraint, and the second order pressure satisfies a Poisson-type equation in the case of constant-entropy. The analysis also leads to an unexpected conclusion that the velocity filed computed by traditional preconditioned Roe scheme does not satisfy the divergence constraint as the Mach number vanishes. Moreover, the analysis explains the reason of checkerboard decoupling and shows that momentum interpolation method provides a similar mechanism as traditional preconditioned Roe scheme inherently possesses to suppress checkerboard decoupling. In the end, general rulers for modifying non-linear eigenvalues are obtained. Finally, several numerical experiments are provided to support the theoretical analysis. All-Speed-Roe scheme has a sound foundation and is expected to be widely studied and applied to all speed flow calculations.},

	abstract = {Ever since the expansion of the finite element method (FEM) into unsteady fluid mechanics, the ‘consistent mass matrix’ has been a relevant issue. Applied to the time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, it virtually demands the use of implicit time integration methods in which full ‘velocity–pressure coupling’ is also inherent. The high cost of such (high-quality) FEM calculations led to the development of simpler but ad hoc methods in which the ‘lumped’ mass matrix is employed and the velocity and pressure are uncoupled to the maximum extent possible. Resulting computer codes were less expensive to use but suffered a significant loss of accuracy, caused by lumping the mass when the flow was advection-dominated and accurate transport of ‘information’ was important. In the second part of this paper we re-introduce the consistent mass matrix into some semi-implicit projection methods in such a way that the cost advantage of lumped mass and the accuracy advantage of consistent mass are simultaneously realized.},

We use the asymptotics as a guideline for developing a low Mach number extension of an explicit higher order shock-capturing scheme. This semi-implicit scheme involves multiple pressure variables, large scale differencing and averaging procedures that are discretized versions of standard operations in multiple scales asymptotic analysis. Advection and acoustic wave propagation are discretized explicitly and upwind and only one scalar elliptic equation is to be solved implicitly at each time step. This equation is a pressure correction equation for incompressible flows when the Mach number is zero. In the low Mach number limit, the time step is restricted by a Courant number based essentially on the maximum flow velocity. For moderate and large Mach numbers the scheme reduces to the underlying explicit higher order shock capturing algorithm.},

Although the compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes equations cover all effects, an approximation via standard compressible solvers does not have the ability to represent acoustic waves correctly. Therefore, different methods have been developed to deal with the problem. In this paper, three of them are considered and compared to each other. They are the Multiple Pressure Variables Approach (MPV), the Expansion about Incompressible Flow (EIF) and a coupling method via heterogeneous domain decomposition. In the latter approach, the non-linear Euler equations are used in a domain as small as possible to cover the sound generation, and the locally linearized Euler equations approximated with a high-order scheme are used in a second domain to deal with the sound propagation. Comparisons will be given in construction principles as well as implementational effort and computational costs on actual numerical examples.},

	abstract = {In this paper a set of approximate equations is derived which is applicable to very nonadiabati c, nondissipative, buoyant flows of a perfect gas. The flows are assumed to be generated by a heat source in which the heat is added slowly. The study is motivated by the occurrence of such f] ows in fires. There, the time scale associated with the fire growth and resultant f]uid moti on is usually long compared with the transil lime of an acoustic signal (based on the temperature derived from the heat added) across the spatial extent of the fire. The appro' mate equations are characterized by a spatially uniform mean pressure appearing in both the energy equa vn and the equation of state with the spat iall y nonuniform portion of the pressure on ly appearing in Ihe momentum equation . Therefore, the pressure remains almost constant in space while significant density and te mperature variations, such as might occur in a fire, are allowed. The approximate equations are shown to reduce to Ihe Boussinesq equations when the heat add ition is mild. These equations are also shown in general to admit internal-wave motions while " filtering out" high-frequency, acoustic waves. ]n addition, they are shown to be express ible in conservation form, the pressure sati sfying an elliptic equation whose homogeneous terms are d e rivable from the wave equation by le tting the sound speed become infinite. An equation for the mean pressu re is also obtained.

Some of the existing flux splitting schemes fall within this framework. For the Euler equations we propose a new flux splitting and study the associated two systems of differential equations, called the advection system and the pressure system. For each of the splittings studied we analyse the resulting two systems of differential equations and propose discretization schemes of the Godunov type. These schemes are simple, robust and accurate when compared with existing methods. Moreover, they enjoy a most desirable property: recognition of contact discontinuities and shear waves.},

This scheme uses the velocity component normal to the volume interface as the characteristic speed and yields the vanishing individual mass flux at the stagnation. The numerical dissipation for the mass and momentum equations also vanishes with the Mach number approaching zero. One of the diffusive terms of the energy equation does not vanish. But the low numerical diffusion for viscous flows may be ensured by using higher-order differencing. The scheme is very simple and easy to be implemented. The scheme has been applied to solve the one dimensional (1D) and multidimensional Euler equations. The solutions are monotone and the normal shock wave profiles are crisp. For a 1D shock tube problem with the shock and the contact discontinuities, the present scheme and Roe scheme give very similar results, which are the best compared with those from Van Leer scheme and Liou–Steffen's advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) scheme. For the multidimensional transonic flows, the sharp monotone normal shock wave profiles with mostly one transition zone are obtained. The results are compared with those from Van Leer scheme, AUSM and also with the experiment.},

The measurement set-up is mounted on the same rotating disk with the test section, allowing to obtain the same accuracy and resolution as in a non-rotating rig. The Reynolds number is 15 000, and the rotation number is 0.38. As the ribbed wall is heated, both the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force play a role in the fluid dynamics. The mean velocity fields highlight the major impact of the rotational buoyancy (characterized by a buoyancy number of 0.31) on the flow along the leading side of the duct. In particular, since the flow is directed radially outward, the near-wall layers experience significant centripetal buoyancy. The recirculation area behind the obstacles is enlarged to the point of spanning the whole inter-rib space. Also the turbulent fluctuations are significantly altered, and overall augmented, with respect to the non-buoyant case, resulting in higher turbulence levels far from the rib. On the other hand the centrifugal force has little or no impact on the flow along the trailing wall. Vortex identification, proper orthogonal decomposition, and two-point correlations are used to highlight rotational effects, and in particular to determine the dominant scales of the turbulent unsteady flow, the time-dependent behavior of the shear layer and of the recirculation bubble behind the wall-mounted obstacles, the lifetime and advection velocity of the coherent structures.},

by vortex shedding from the cylinder surface into its wake. When a vortex is shed 
from one side of the cylinder, a negative pressure pulse is generated from that side 
whereas a positive pressure pulse is generated from the other side; alternate vortex 
shedding from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder produces negative and 
positive pulses alternately and thus produces sound pressure waves on both sides. 
The dipolar nature of the generated sound is confirmed; lift dipole dominates the 
sound field. The Doppler effect is shown to play an important role at finite Mach 
numbers. The direct solutions are also compared with the solutions obtained by 
Curle's acoustic analogy. The results show that Curle's solution describes well not

	abstract = {This paper describes a new boundary condition for subsonic inlets in compressible flow solvers. The method uses characteristic analysis based on wave decomposition and the paper discusses how to specify the amplitude of incoming waves to inject simultaneously three-dimensional turbulence and one-dimensional acoustic waves while still being non-reflecting for outgoing acoustic waves. The non-reflecting property is ensured by using developments proposed by Polifke et al. [1, 2]. They are combined with a novel formulation to inject turbulence and acoustic waves simultaneously at an inlet. The paper discusses the compromise which must be sought by the boundary condition formulation between conflicting objectives: respecting target unsteady inlet velocities (for turbulence and acoustics), avoiding a drift of the mean inlet velocities and ensuring non-reflecting performances for waves reaching the inlet from the computational domain. This well-known limit of classical formulations is improved by the new approach which ensures that the mean inlet velocities do not drift, that the unsteady components of velocity (turbulence and acoustics) are correctly introduced into the domain and that the inlet remains non-reflecting. These properties are crucial for forced unsteady flows but the same formulation is also useful for unforced cases where it allows to reach convergence faster. The method is presented by focusing on the expression of the ingoing waves and comparing it with the classical NSCBC approach [3]. Four tests are then described: (1) the injection of acoustic waves through a non reflecting inlet, (2) the compressible flow establishment in a nozzle, (3) the simultaneous injection of turbulence and ingoing acoustic waves into a duct terminated by a reflecting outlet and (4) a turbulent, acoustically forced Bunsen-type premixed flame.},

	abstract = {Today, much of the current effort in combustion noise is the development of efficient numerical tools to calculate the noise radiated by flames. Although unsteady CFD methods such as LES or DNS can directly provide the acoustic field radiated by noise sources, this evaluation is limited to small domains due to high computational costs. Hybrid methods have been developed to overcome this limitation. In these schemes, the noise sources are decoupled from the radiated sound. The sources are still calculated by DNS or LES codes whereas the radiated sound is evaluated by acoustic codes using an acoustic analogy. In the present paper the assessment of combustion noise is conducted by both direct (LES) and hybrid computations in a premixed swirled combustor. Some comparisons of the sound pressure levels resulting from both approaches are shown, and the main differences between the two methods are explained.},

The work presents a newly improved scheme more reliable in all Mach number regimes to circumvent some typical symptoms of the previous AUSM-family schemes observed in hypersonic and very low speeds. This scheme is facilitated by reconstructing pressure diffusion term in mass flux, velocity diffusion term in pressure flux and numerical sound speed. Then, a variety of benchmark test cases are selected to systematically assess the effects of these key ingredients and investigate the additional features in terms of robustness and accuracy. The proposed scheme attains stronger shock robustness against carbuncle instability, better low-speed accuracy and higher resolution of oblique shocks compared with many existing upwind schemes. Moreover, it can exactly resolve contact discontinuity, preserve positivity, damp numerical overshoots and avert the global cut-off strategy. Numerical results for a wide spectrum of Mach numbers indicate its potential and reliable application to all Mach number flows.},

These are algorithms that split the flux vectors into a part associated to the convection by the fluid particles, and a part associated to the propagation of the pressure waves. For the convection part, the appropriate space discretisation is the upwind one. For the pressure part, there are alternatives. We discern five types of algorithms that all are adapted for use in low Mach number flows, and thus are considered as all Mach number algorithms. We study the behaviour of the different types for the propagation of small pressure perturbations, of discontinuous or smooth shape, in low Mach number flows. We demonstrate that four of the proposed algorithms of convection-pressure split type are dissipative for such applications, although they are designed for low Mach number flows. The objective of the paper is to analyse why some algorithms are appropriate for acoustic propagation simulation and why some are not appropriate.},

	abstract = {Entropy-Stable (ES) schemes, specifically those built from [Tadmor Math. Comput. 49 (1987) 91], have been gaining interest over the past decade, especially in the context of under-resolved simulations of compressible turbulent flows using high-order methods. These schemes are attractive because they can provide stability in a global and nonlinear sense (consistency with thermodynamics). However, fully realizing the potential of ES schemes requires a better grasp of their local behavior. Entropy-stability itself does not imply good local behavior [Gouasmi et al. J. Sci. Comp. 78 (2019) 971, Gouasmi et al. Comput. Methd. Appl. M. 363 (2020) 112912]. In this spirit, we studied ES schemes in problems where global stability is not the core issue. In the present work, we consider the accuracy degradation issues typically encountered by upwind-type schemes in the low-Mach-number regime [Turkel Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 31 (1999) 285] and their treatment using Flux-Preconditioning [Turkel J. Comput. Phys. 72 (1987) 277, Miczek et al. A \& A 576 (2015) A50]. ES schemes suffer from the same issues and Flux-Preconditioning can improve their behavior without interfering with entropy-stability. This is first demonstrated analytically: using similarity and congruence transforms we were able to establish conditions for a preconditioned flux to be ES, and introduce the ES variants of the Miczek's and Turkel's preconditioned fluxes. This is then demonstrated numerically through first-order simulations of two simple test problems representative of the incompressible and acoustic limits, the Gresho Vortex and a right-moving acoustic wave. The results are overall consistent with previous studies. For instance, we observe that Turkel's preconditioner improves accuracy in the incompressible limit with the downside of overly damping acoustic waves [Bruel et al. J. Comput. Phys. 378 (2019) 723]. For Miczek's matrix however, we came across unexpected spurious transients in both problems (a small left-moving acoustic wave in the latter), motivating further analysis. We revisited the pressure fluctuation argument of [Guillard \& Viozat Comput. Fluids 28 (1999) 63] in terms of entropy, showing how the standard ES dissipation operator [Ismail \& Roe J. Comput. Phys. 228 (2009) 5410] can introduce inconsistent discrete entropy fluctuations in space. These analytical results are achieved by introducing mode-by-mode decompositions of the dissipation operator, similar to [Roe \& Pike Computing Methods in Applied Science and Engineering (1984) 499, Tadmor Acta Numer. 12 (2003) 482], leading to what we call discrete Entropy Production Breakdowns (EPBs) in space. These EPBs outline the contributions of convective and acoustic modes to the discrete entropy production, both locally and globally. Ultimately, these EPBs enable us to single-out in the ES Miczek flux a skew-symmetric matrix component which we believe causes entropy transfers between acoustic waves. Removing this contribution eliminates the spurious transients without interfering with entropy-stability. This conjecture is explored numerically and analytically.},

Also, it improves the construction of the pressure flux for low speeds according to theoretical analyses. In terms of the component pu, the E-AUSMPWAS scheme adopts a different method to make it accord with theory better. Series of numerical experiments show that both E-AUSMPWAS and E-AUSMPW are robust against the shock anomaly and the unphysical ‘overheating’ phenomenon in the receding problem. Also, the E-AUSMPWAS scheme is with a high resolution at both high speeds and low speeds. These properties suggest that the E-AUSMPWAS scheme is promising to be widely used to accurately and efficiently simulate both simple and complex flows at all speeds.},

Meanwhile, pressure diffusion term, pressure momentum flux, interface pressure and interface velocity are constructed to measure pressure system. Then, typical test problems are utilized to systematically assess the robustness and accuracy of the resulting scheme.

This procedure is based on the Zha-Bilgen (or previously Baraille et al. for the Euler barotropic system) approach enriched by a dynamic flow-dependent splitting parameter based on the local Mach number. As a consequence, in the present self-adaptive splitting, the convective and acoustic parts decouple in the low-Mach number regime whereas the complete Euler equations are considered for the sonic and highly subsonic regimes. The low diffusive property of the present scheme is obtained by adding anti-diffusion terms to the momentum and the energy components of the pressure flux in the acoustic part of the present splitting. This treatment results from a formal invariance principle preserving the discrete incompressible phase space through the pressure operator. Numerical results for several carefully chosen one- and two-dimensional test problems are finally investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme for a wide variety of configurations from subsonic to highly subsonic flows.},

As an example of the time-step independent category, the AUSM+-up scheme is studied. As an example of the second category, Rhie–Chow momentum interpolation methods are studied. Within the momentum interpolation techniques, again two broad categories can be distinguished based on the time-step dependency of the coupling coefficient used for unsteady flow computations, but when a steady state is reached. Variants of Rhie–Chow interpolation methods in each subcategory are studied on critical test cases. The result of the study is that for a good representation of unsteady flows containing acoustic information, the pressure–velocity coupling coefficient must explicitly depend on the time-step, but that the transporting velocity must become independent of the time-step when a steady state is reached.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a simple robust flux splitting method for all-speed flows with low dissipation. Following the Toro-Vazquez splitting, the inviscid flux is split into the convective and the pressure parts first. Then, we apply the Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) algorithm to each parts with low dissipation modification. Here, the modification improves the method with accurately resolving contact discontinuity and high resolution for low speed flows. Several carefully chosen numerical tests are investigated, and the results show that the proposed scheme is capable of resolving contact discontinuity, robust against the shock anomaly and accurate at all-speeds. Because of these properties, it is expected to be widely applied to all-speed flow studies. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The purpose of this paper is to revisit the thought processes and concepts that led to the rapid evolution of the AUSM family as a highly efficient, highly accurate method for discretization of the Euler equations and their various extensions.No new results are presented; rather, the focus is on (re-)discovering the common threads that link the various members of the AUSM family. Special attention is given to the strategies that lead to accurate results at all flow speeds, and some reviews of more current work in this area are presented. The paper concludes with a few reflections, personal and otherwise, relating to my interactions with Meng over the years and to my view of the essential elements of AUSM-family schemes.},

It pursues a two-fold objective: being able to accurately follow slow material waves as well as strong shock waves in the context of low Mach number flows. The resulting implicit–explicit(IMEX) fractional step approach leans on a dynamic splitting designed to react to the time fluctuations of the maximal flow Mach number. When the latter rises suddenly, the IMEX scheme, so far driven by a material-wave Courant number, turn into a time-explicit approximate Riemann solver constrained by an acoustic-wave Courant number. It is also possible to enrich the dynamic splitting in order to capture high pressure jumps even when the flow Mach number is low. One-dimensional low Mach number test cases involving single or multiple waves confirm that the present approach is as accurate and efficient as an IMEX Lagrange-Projection method. Besides, numerical results suggest that the stability of the present method holds for any Mach number if the Courant number related to the convective subsystem arising from the splitting is of order unity.},

	abstract = {Herein, a Mach-sensitive fractional step approach is proposed for Euler-like systems. The key idea is to introduce a time-dependent splitting which dynamically decouples convection from acoustic phenomenon following the fluctuations of the flow Mach number. By doing so, one seeks to maintain the accuracy of the computed solution for all Mach number regimes. Indeed, when the Mach number takes high values, a time-explicit resolution of the overall Euler-like system is entirely performed in one of the present splitting step. On the contrary, in the low-Mach number case, convection is totally separated from the acoustic waves production. Then, by performing an appropriate correction on the acoustic step of the splitting, the numerical diffusion can be significantly reduced. A study made on both convective and acoustic subsystems of the present approach has revealed some key properties as hyperbolicity and positivity of the density and internal energy in the case of an ideal gas thermodynamics. The one-dimensional results made on a wide range of Mach numbers using an ideal and a stiffened gas thermodynamics show that the present approach is as accurate and CPU-consuming as a state of the art Lagrange-Projection-type method.},

Based on Zha-Bilgen splitting approach, the novel scheme integrates three key ingredients: (i) advection flux estimated by AUSM algorithm; (ii) pressure flux estimated by HLL algorithm; (iii) isentropic condition and low-Mach number fix applied in the difference diffusion term of pressure flux. Then, test problems are carefully selected for systematic assessment of the resulting scheme in terms of robustness and accuracy. The proposed scheme is shock-stable and low-dissipation; meanwhile it can exactly preserve contact discontinuity and eliminate numerical overshoots. A series of hypersonic viscous flow cases, such as 3D Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) reentry capsule, demonstrates its superior performance compared with existing upwind schemes, and is potentially a good candidate for hypersonic heating prediction.},

For a polytropic gas law, with γ {\textgreater} 1, closed formulas have not yet been derived.The scheme produces steady shock profiles with two interior zones. There is evidence [10] that, among implicit versions of upwind methods, those with a two-zone steady-shock representation give faster convergence to a steady solution than those with a one-zone representation.A disadvantage in using any flux-vector splitting is that it leads to numerical diffusion of a contact discontinuity at rest. This diffusion can be removed; present research is aimed at achieving this with minimal computational effort.Numerical solutions by first- and second-order schemes including the above split fluxes can be found in Refs.

However, numerical evidence exists that the eigenvector structure also has an influence on the performance of preconditioners and should therefore be included in the design process. In this paper, we present the mathematical framework for the eigenvector analysis of local preconditioners for the multi-dimensional Euler equations. The non-normality of the preconditioned system is crucial in determining the potential for transient amplification of perturbations. Several existing local preconditioners are shown to possess a highly non-normal structure for low Mach numbers. This non-normality leads to significant robustness problems at stagnation points. A modification to these preconditioners which eliminates the non-normality is suggested, and numerical results are presented showing the marked improvement in robustness.},

	abstract = {Several recently developed AUSM-family numerical flux functions (SLAU, SLAU2, AUSMM+-up2, and AUSMPW+) have been successfully extended to compute compressible multiphase flows, based on the stratified flow model concept, by following two previous works: one by M.-S. Liou, C.-H. Chang, L. Nguyen, and T.G. Theofanous [AIAA J. 46:2345-2356, 2008], in which AUSM+-up was used entirely, and the other by C.-H. Chang, and M.-S. Liou [J. Comput. Phys. 225:840-873, 2007], in which the exact Riemann solver was combined into AUSM+-up at the phase interface. Through an extensive survey by comparing flux functions, the following are found: (1) AUSM+-up with dissipation parameters of Kp and Ku equal to 0.5 or greater, AUSMPW+, SLAU2, AUSM+-up2, and SLAU can be used to solve benchmark problems, including a shock/water-droplet interaction; (2) SLAU shows oscillatory behaviors [though not as catastrophic as those of AUSM+ (a special case of AUSM+-up with Kp = Ku = 0)] due to insufficient dissipation arising from its ideal-gas-based dissipation term; and (3) when combined with the exact Riemann solver, AUSM+-up (Kp = Ku = 1), SLAU2, and AUSMPW+ are applicable to more challenging problems with high pressure ratios.},

	abstract = {Three asymptotic limits exist for the Euler equations at low Mach number - purely convective, purely acoustic, and mixed convective-acoustic. Standard collocated density-based numerical schemes for compressible flow are known to fail at low Mach number due to the incorrect asymptotic scaling of the artificial diffusion. Previous studies of this class of schemes have shown a variety of behaviours across the different limits and proposed guidelines for the design of low-Mach schemes. However, these studies have primarily focused on specific discretisations and/or only the convective limit. In this paper, we review the low-Mach behaviour using the modified equations - the continuous Euler equations augmented with artificial diffusion terms - which are representative of a wide range of schemes in this class. By considering both convective and acoustic effects, we show that three diffusion scalings naturally arise. Single- and multiple-scale asymptotic analysis of these scalings shows that many of the important low-Mach features of this class of schemes can be reproduced in a straightforward manner in the continuous setting. As an example, we show that many existing low-Mach Roe-type finite-volume schemes match one of these three scalings. Our analysis corroborates previous analysis of these schemes, and we are able to refine previous guidelines on the design of low-Mach schemes by including both convective and acoustic effects. Discrete analysis and numerical examples demonstrate the behaviour of minimal Roe-type schemes with each of the three scalings for convective, acoustic, and mixed flows.},

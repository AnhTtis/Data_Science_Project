    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding a subgraph of a given graph which minimizes the sum of given functions at vertices evaluated at their subgraph degrees. While the problem is NP-hard already when all functions are the same, we show that it can be solved for arbitrary functions in polynomial time over graphs of bounded treewidth. Its complexity remains widely open, in particular over complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs.",

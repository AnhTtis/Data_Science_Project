Noting that the kernel matrix implicitly maps the data into a nonlinear feature space, we show how to discover a mapping that "unfolds" the underlying manifold from which the data was sampled. The kernel matrix is constructed by maximizing the variance in feature space subject to local constraints that preserve the angles and distances between nearest neighbors. The main optimization involves an instance of semidefinite programming---a fundamentally different computation than previous algorithms for manifold learning, such as Isomap and locally linear embedding. The optimized kernels perform better than polynomial and Gaussian kernels for problems in manifold learning, but worse for problems in large margin classification. We explain these results in terms of the geometric properties of different kernels and comment on various interpretations of other manifold learning algorithms as kernel methods.},

abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}}

Based on a set of unorganized data points sampled with noise from a parameterized manifold, the local geometry of the manifold is learned by constructing an approximation for the tangent space at each data point, and those tangent spaces are then aligned to give the global coordinates of the data points with respect to the underlying manifold. We also present an error analysis of our algorithm showing that reconstruction errors can be quite small in some cases. We illustrate our algorithm using curves and surfaces both in two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) Euclidean spaces and in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. We also address several theoretical and algorithmic issues for further research and improvements. }

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.}}

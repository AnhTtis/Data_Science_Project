    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study on the self-interaction cross-section of puffy dark matter (DM) particles, which have a significant intrinsic size compared to their Compton wavelength. For such puffy DM self-interaction cross-section in the resonant and classical regimes, our study demonstrates the significance of the Yukawa potential and the necessity of partial wave analysis: (i) Due to the finite-size effect of puffy DM particles, the new Yukawa potential of puffy DM is found to enlarge the Born-effective regime for the self-interaction cross-section, compared with the point-like DM; (ii) Our partial wave analysis shows that depending on the value of the ratio between $R_χ$ (radius of a puffy DM particle) and $1/m_φ$ (force range), the three regimes (Born-effective, resonant and classical) for puffy DM self-interaction cross-section can be very different from the point-like DM; (iii) We find that to solve the small-scale anomalies via self-interacting puffy DM, the Born-effective and the resonant regimes exist for dwarf galaxies, while for the cluster and Milky Way galaxy the non-Born regime is necessary.",

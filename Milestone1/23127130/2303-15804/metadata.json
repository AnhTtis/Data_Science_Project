    "abstract": "The convergence of a sequence of point processes with dependent points, defined by a symmetric function of iid high-dimensional random vectors, to a Poisson random measure is proved. This also implies the convergence of the joint distribution of a fixed number of upper order statistics. As applications of the result a generalization of maximum convergence to point process convergence is given for simple linear rank statistics, rank-type U-statistics and the entries of sample covariance matrices.",

Although mostly spherical microlenses were studied in the past, they may have various shapes and their optimization is highly demanding, especially, when the shape is described with many parameters. We first outline a very powerful mathematical tool: shape optimization based on shape gradient computations. This procedure may be applied with much less numerical cost than traditional optimizers, especially when the number of parameters describing the shape goes to infinity. In order to demonstrate the concept, we optimize microlenses using shape optimization starting from more or less reasonable elliptical and semi-circular shapes. We show that strong increases of the performance of the lenses may be obtained for any reasonable value of the refraction index.},

  abstract = {While topological derivatives have proven useful in applications of topology optimization and inverse problems, their mathematically rigorous derivation remains an ongoing research topic, in particular in the context of nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) constraints. We present a systematic yet formal approach for the numerical computation of topological derivatives of a large class of PDE-constrained topology optimization problems with respect to arbitrary inclusion shapes. Scalar and vector-valued as well as linear and nonlinear elliptic PDE constraints are considered in two and three space dimensions including a nonlinear elasticity model and nonlinear reaction–diffusion problems. The systematic procedure follows a Lagrangian approach for computing topological derivatives. For problems where the exact formula is known, the numerically computed values show good coincidence. Moreover, by inserting the computed values into the topological asymptotic expansion, we verify that the obtained values satisfy the expected behavior also for other, previously unknown problems, indicating the correctness of the procedure.},

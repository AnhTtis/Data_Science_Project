    "abstract": "We study the Schroedinger operators H_{λμ}(K), with K \\in T_2 the fixed quasi-momentum of the particles pair, associated with a system of two identical fermions on the two-dimensional lattice Z_2 with first and second nearest-neighboring-site interactions of magnitudes λ\\in R and μ\\in R, respectively. We establish a partition of the (λ,μ)-plane so that in each its connected component, the Schroedinger operator H_{λμ}(0) has a definite (fixed) number of eigenvalues, which are situated below the bottom of the essential spectrum and above its top. Moreover, we establish a sharp lower bound for the number of isolated eigenvalues of H_{λμ}(K) in each connected component.",

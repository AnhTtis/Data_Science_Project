    "abstract": "In this proceedings we present Qibocal, an open-source software package for calibration and characterization of quantum processing units (QPUs) based on the Qibo framework. Qibocal is specifically designed for self-hosted QPUs and provides the groundwork to easily develop, deploy and distribute characterization and calibration routines for all levels of hardware abstraction. Qibocal is based on a modular QPU platform agnostic approach and it provides a general purpose toolkit for superconducting qubits with the possibility of extensions to other quantum technologies. After motivating the need for such a module, we explain the program's flow and show examples of actual use for QPU calibration. We also showcase additional features provided by the library including automatic report generation and live plotting.",

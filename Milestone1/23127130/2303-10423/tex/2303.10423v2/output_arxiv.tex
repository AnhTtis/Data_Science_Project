\begin{abstract}
The site percolation problem is one of the core topics in statistical physics.
Evaluation of the percolation threshold, which separates two phases (sometimes described as conducting and isolating), is useful for a lot of problems ranging from core condensed matter to interdisciplinary application of statistical physics in epidemiology or any other transportation or connectivity problems. 
In this paper---with Newman--Ziff fast Monte Carlo algorithm and finite-size scaling theory---we compute the random site percolation thresholds $p_c$ for a square lattice with complex neighborhoods containing sites from the sixth coordination zone. 
Complex neighborhoods are those that contain sites from various coordination zones (which are not necessarily compact ones).
We present the source codes of the appropriate procedures (written in C) and the results of their usage in computations of the percolation threshold on the square lattice for neighborhoods containing sites up to the sixth coordination zone.
We conclude that similarly to the honeycomb lattice, the percolation thresholds for complex neighborhoods on a square lattice follow the power law $p_c(\zeta)\propto\zeta^{-\gamma_2}$ with $\gamma_2=0.5454(60)$, where $\zeta=\sum_i z_i r_i$ is the weighted distance of sites in complex neighborhoods ($r_i$ and $z_i$ are the distance from the central site and the number of sites in the coordination zone $i$, respectively).

\section{Introduction}
%% ###############################################################

Percolation \cite{Broadbent1957,Hammersley1957} is one of the core problems in statistical physics with many interdisciplinary applications ranging from
materials science \cite{ISI:000514848600043},
through studies of polymer composites \cite{ISI:000528948100007},
forest fires \cite{Kaczanowska2002}, 
agriculture \cite{ISI:000518460000003},
oil and gas exploration \cite{ISI:000524118200031}, 
diseases propagation \cite{2101.00550}, 
transportation networks \cite{ISI:000528691800009},
quantifying urban areas \cite{ISI:000523958600016},
to Bitcoins transfer \cite{Bartolucci2020} (see References~\onlinecite{Li_2021,Saberi2015} for reviews).

The percolating system undergoes a (purely geometrical) phase transition (in terms of the conductivity or transportation properties of the system) from the phase corresponding to an insulator (for low system connectivity $p<p_c$) to the phase of the conductor (for high system connectivity $p>p_c$). 
The critical connectivity of the system $p_c$ (called the percolation threshold) separates these two phases and depends on the dimension of the system $d$, the topology of the lattice, the number $z$ of sites in the assumed neighborhood, the type of percolation (that is, the bond dilution site), etc. \cite{bookDS,Wierman2014}.

Percolation thresholds were initially estimated for the nearest-neighbor interactions \cite{Dean_1963,Dean_Bird_1967,PhysRevE.60.275} but later also complex neighborhoods (termed also extended for compact neighborhoods) were studied for various lattices embedded in:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d=2$ (for a square \cite{Dalton_1964,Domb1966,Gouker1983,Galam2005a,Galam2005b,Majewski2007,PhysRevE.103.022126}, 
a triangular \cite{Dalton_1964,Domb1966,Iribarne1999,2006.15621,2102.10066}, 
a honeycomb \cite{Dalton_1964,2204.12593} 
and other Archimedean \cite{Lebrecht_2021,PhysRevE.105.024105} lattices);
\item $d=3$ (for a simple cubic \cite{Kurzawski2012,Malarz2015,PhysRevE.103.022126} lattice);
\item $d=4$ (for a simple hypercubic \cite{1803.09504,Zhao_2022} lattice)
\end{itemize}
dimensions.

%% ---------------------------------------------------------------

Simultaneously with the estimation of percolation thresholds for various lattices, some effort went into searching an analytical formula allowing for the prediction of the percolation threshold position based on lattice characteristics.
For example, \citeauthor{PhysRevE.105.024105} \cite{PhysRevE.105.024105} estimated the site and bond percolation thresholds for the 11 Archimedean lattices with complex and compact (extended) neighborhoods containing sites up to the tenth coordination zone.
For the site percolation problem, the critical site occupation probability $p_c$ follows asymptotically
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pc-discs}
p_c(z) = a/z
\end{equation}
with the total number $z$ of sites in the neighborhood and $a\approx 4.51235$.
This dependence should be reached exactly for the percolation of compact neighborhoods with a large number $z$ of sites that make up the neighborhood (for example, for discs).
To take into account the he finite-$z$ effect an additional term $b$ in the denominator of \Cref{eq:pc-discs}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pc-finite-z}
p_c(z) = c/(z+b)
\end{equation}
should be included \cite{PhysRevE.103.022127}.
For the two-dimensional lattices $b=3$ \cite{PhysRevE.105.024105}.
The third universal scaling studied in Reference~\onlinecite{PhysRevE.105.024105} was
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pc-exp}
p_c(z;d) = 1-\exp(d/z)
\end{equation}
proposed by \citeauthor{Koza_2014} \cite{Koza_2014,Koza_2016}.

Much earlier \citeauthor{PhysRevE.53.2177} \cite{PhysRevE.53.2177,PhysRevE.55.1230} proposed a universal formula for site percolation problem 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pc-GM}
p_c(z;d)= \dfrac{p_0}{[(d-1)(z-1)]^a}, 
\end{equation}
where $z$ and $d$ are the total number of sites in the neighborhood and the dimension of the system space, respectively. 
They recognized two classes of systems (two sets of $(p_0,a)$ parameters) \cite{PhysRevE.53.2177}.
Their paper \cite{PhysRevE.53.2177} was immediately criticized by \citeauthor{ISI:A1997WD54600080} \cite{ISI:A1997WD54600080} who showed 
`an example of two networks, where $d$ and $z$ are equal, but the percolation thresholds differ'.

For complex neighborhoods, the situation is even worse, since for a given lattice topology (and thus fixed $d$) there are many neighborhoods with exactly the same total number $z$ of sites in the neighborhood but different percolation thresholds $p_c$ (see: Table 1 and Figure 4 in Reference \onlinecite{Majewski2007} for the square lattice; Table 1 in Reference \onlinecite{2006.15621} and Table 1 and Figure 3(a) in Reference \onlinecite{2102.10066} for the triangular lattice; and Table 1 and Figure 4(a) in Reference \onlinecite{2204.12593} for the honeycomb lattice).

To solve the above-mentioned problems of $p_c(z)$ degeneration the index 
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation} \label{eq:xi} 
\xi=\sum_i z_i r_i^2/i
\end{equation}
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
was proposed \cite{2102.10066}.
The $z_i$ and $r_i$ are the number of sites and their distance from the central site in the neighborhood in the $i$-th coordination zone. 
The index $\xi$ allowed for a successful distinguishing between neighborhoods and cancel $p_c(z)$ degeneration for the triangular lattice with complex neighborhoods containing sites up to the fifth coordination zone.
The percolation thresholds dependence 
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pc_vs_xi} 
p_c(\xi)\propto\xi^{-\gamma_1}
\end{equation}
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
was well fitted with the power law with $\gamma_1(\textsc{tr})\approx 0.710(19)$.
Unfortunately, this dependence does not hold for the honeycomb lattice (see Figure 4(b) in Reference \onlinecite{2204.12593}). 
Thus, another index
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation} \label{eq:zeta} 
\zeta=\sum_i z_i r_i
\end{equation}
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
was introduced to simultaneously resolve the problem of $p_c(z)$ degeneration and to distinguish among various complex neighborhoods for the honeycomb lattice \cite{2204.12593}. 
For honeycomb lattice and complex neighborhoods up to the fifth coordination zone 
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pc_vs_zeta} 
p_c(\zeta)\propto\zeta^{-\gamma_2}
\end{equation}
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
with $\gamma_2(\textsc{hc})\approx 0.4981(90)$ \cite{2204.12593}.

In this paper---using the fast Monte Carlo Newman--Ziff algorithm \cite{NewmanZiff2001}---we calculate critical occupation probabilities $p_c$ (percolation thresholds) for random site percolation in a square lattice and neighborhoods combined with basic neighborhoods presented in \Cref{fig:sq-basic-neighbourhoods}.
The basic neighborhoods contain sites from the first coordination zone (\textsc{sq-1}, \Cref{fig:sq-1nn}) up to the sixth coordination zone (\textsc{sq-6}, \Cref{fig:sq-6nn}).
These complex neighborhoods are presented in \Cref{fig:sq-neighbourhoods} in \Cref{app:shapes}.
Calculations of percolation thresholds are based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis \cite{Finite-Size_Scaling_Theory_1990,bookDS,Guide_to_Monte_Carlo_Simulations_2009}.

The second aim of this paper is to check if \Cref{eq:pc_vs_xi,eq:pc_vs_zeta} holds for a square lattice with complex neighborhoods and, if so, which of them performs better.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The details of the calculations are presented in the following \Cref{sec:computations}.
The results of the calculations are given in \Cref{sec:results}.
The article is summarized and concluded in \Cref{sec:conclusions}.
The Appendices contain: written in C boundaries procedures (\Cref{app:functions}), graphical presentation of neighborhood shapes (\Cref{app:shapes}); and figures presenting results of finite-size scaling analysis (\Cref{app:resuts}).

\section{\label{sec:computations}Computations}
%% ###############################################################

Our calculations of the percolation thresholds $p_c$ are based on finite-size analyses of the probability $\mathcal{P}_\text{max}$ that the randomly selected site belongs to the largest cluster of occupied sites.

According to the finite-size hypothesis \cite{Finite-Size_Scaling_Theory_1990,bookDS,Guide_to_Monte_Carlo_Simulations_2009}, in the vicinity of a phase transition (marked by a critical point $x_c$), many quantities $\mathcal A$ characterizing the system obey a scaling relation
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\mathcal A(x;L)=L^{-\varepsilon_1} \mathcal F \left( (x-x_c)L^{\varepsilon_2} \right),
\end{equation}
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
where $x$ measures the level of system disorder (temperature for the Ising or Potts model, site/bond occupation probability for percolation problem), $L$ is the linear size of the system, $\mathcal F$ is a scaling function (usually analytically unknown) and $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are scaling exponents.
In other words, there exists a function $\mathcal F$, that for properly assumed values of $x_c$, $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ the dependencies of $\mathcal A(x)$ collapse into a single curve independently of the (finite) system size $L$.
This also provides an elegant way to predict the value of the critical parameter $x_c$ as 
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\mathcal A(x;L) L^{\varepsilon_1} = \mathcal F \left( (x-x_c)L^{\varepsilon_2} \right),
\end{equation}
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
which for $x=x_c$ yields
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\mathcal A(x_c;L) L^{\varepsilon_1} = \mathcal F \left( 0 \right).
\end{equation}
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
In other words, we expect the curves $L^{\varepsilon_1} \mathcal A(x)$ plotted for various sizes of linear systems $L$ to intercept each other at $x=x_c$.

For our purposes, we assume that $\mathcal A\equiv \mathcal P_\text{max}$ (the probability that a randomly selected site belongs to the largest cluster) and $x\equiv p$ (the probability of occupation of the sites).
For the problem of site percolation, the critical values of the exponents $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are known exactly \cite[p.~54]{bookDS} as $\varepsilon_1=\frac{5}{36}/\frac{4}{3}=\frac{5}{48}$ and $\varepsilon_2=1/\frac{4}{3}=\frac{3}{4}$, respectively.

To compute the probability of belonging to the largest cluster
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Pmax}
\mathcal{P}_{\max}(p;L)=\mathcal S_\text{max}(p;L)/N
\end{equation}
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
we first need to calculate the sizes of the largest cluster $S_\text{max}$ and $N=L^2$ is the number of all sites available in the system.

To that end, we use three concepts presented in Reference \onlinecite{NewmanZiff2001}.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first is the fast system construction scheme (known as the Newman--Ziff algorithm).
The efficiency of this approach is based on the recursive construction of the system with $n$ occupied sites with the addition of only one occupied site to the system containing $(n-1)$ already occupied sites.
\item The second concept is the way of transforming the $\bar{\mathcal A}(n;N)$ dependence on the integer number of occupied sites $n$ into the dependence $\mathcal A(p;N)$ on the probability of the site occupation $p$
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:An-to-Ap}
\mathcal A(p;N)=\sum_{n=0}^N \bar{\mathcal A}(n;N) \mathcal B(n;N,p),
\end{equation}
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
where
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:binom}
\mathcal B(n;N,p)=\binom{N}{n}p^n(1-p)^{N-n}
\end{equation}
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
are values of the binomial (Bernoulli) probability distribution.
\item The third concept allows us to efficiently construct the binomial coefficients \eqref{eq:binom}.
\end{itemize}

The applied scheme defined in \Cref{eq:An-to-Ap} together with the construction of the binomial distribution coefficients mentioned above is presented in \Cref{alg:Qn2Qp}.

\section{\label{sec:results}Results}
%% ###############################################################

In \Cref{fig:example-results} examples of the results (for neighborhood \textsc{sq-1,2,3,4,5,6} and various sizes of linear systems $L=128$, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096) of the computations obtained with the procedure described in \Cref{sec:computations} are presented.

\Cref{fig:Smaxvsn-SQ-123456-example} shows dependencies of the larger cluster size $\mathcal{S}_\text{max}$ (normalized to the system size $L^2$) vs. the number of occupied sites $n$ (also normalized to the system size $L^2$).
With increasing system linear size $L$ the dependence $\mathcal S_\text{max}(n)$ becomes stepper and stepper.

\Cref{fig:PmaxLbetanuvsp-SQ-123456-example-1} shows $L^{\varepsilon_1} \mathcal P_\text{max}(p)$ for $p$ ranging from 0.134 to 0.152 estimated for every $\Delta p=10^{-4}$.
\Cref{fig:PmaxLbetanuvsp-SQ-123456-example-2} shows close-up of \Cref{fig:PmaxLbetanuvsp-SQ-123456-example-1} in the vicinity of the percolation threshold (for $p$ from 0.1430 to 0.1435 for every $\Delta p=10^{-5}$).
The finite-size effects in $L^{\varepsilon_1} \mathcal P_\text{max}(p)$ vanish at the percolation threshold $p_c$, resulting in a common point of $L^{\varepsilon_1} \mathcal P_\text{max}(p)$ plotted for various linear sizes $L$ of the systems.
The analogous dependencies for all other complex neighborhoods---presented in \Cref{fig:sq-neighbourhoods} in \Cref{app:shapes}---containing sites from the sixth coordination zone are shown in \Cref{fig:PmaxLbetanuvsp} in \Cref{app:resuts}.
The results are averaged over the realizations of the $R=10^5$ system.
The obtained percolation thresholds $p_c$ are gathered in \Cref{tab:sq-pc}.

In \Cref{fig:pc-vs-z-xi-zeta} the dependencies of the percolation threshold $p_c$ on the total number $z=\sum_i z_i$ of sites in the complex neighborhoods containing the sites of the $i$-th coordination zone and the indexes $\xi$ and $\zeta$ are presented.

\Cref{fig:pc_vs_z} shows the dependence of the percolation threshold $p_c$ on $z$.
The percolation thresholds for neighborhoods containing sites up to the fifth coordination zone are taken from References \onlinecite{Galam2005a,Majewski2007} and those for neighborhoods containing sites from the sixth coordination zone presented here in \Cref{tab:sq-pc}.
It is clear that the number $z$ cannot differentiate between the various shapes of the neighborhoods or the percolation thresholds associated with them. 

In \Cref{fig:pc_vs_xi} the dependence \eqref{eq:pc_vs_xi} on the percolation threshold $p_c$ for complex neighborhoods on the square lattice on the index $\xi$ is presented.
Similarly to the earlier observation for the honeycomb lattice \cite{2204.12593}, some deviations from the straight line in \Cref{eq:pc_vs_xi} are observed.
The full circles mark percolation threshold for compact neighbourhoods \textsc{sq}-1,2,$\cdots$,6,7, \textsc{sq}-1,2,$\cdots$,7,8, \textsc{sq}-1,2,$\cdots$,8,9 and \textsc{sq}-1,2,$\cdots$,9,10) taken from References \onlinecite{PhysRevE.103.022126} and \onlinecite{Iribarne1999}.

\section{\label{sec:discussion}Discussion}
%% ###############################################################

The percolation thresholds $p_c$ obtained in simulations range from 0.59275 (for \textsc{sq-6}) to 0.14325 (for \textsc{sq-1,2,3,4,5,6}). 
The latter agrees in five significant digits with its earlier estimate $p_c(\textsc{sq-1,2,3,4,5,6})=0.143255$ \cite{PhysRevE.103.022126}.
The \textsc{sq-6} neighborhood is topologically equivalent to \textsc{sq-1} (but for a three-times larger lattice constant), resulting in identical percolation thresholds $p_c(\textsc{sq-6})=p_c(\textsc{sq-1})$.
For the \textsc{sq-6} neighborhood we deal with several simultaneous independent percolation problems on several identically shaped lattices.
The latter reduces effective system size, but our results show, that this effect is perfectly compensated by effective increase of number of samples.

Similarly to the honeycomb lattice \cite{2204.12593}, the power law \eqref{eq:pc_vs_zeta} also holds for a square lattice with complex neighborhoods with $\gamma_2(\textsc{sq})=0.5454(60)$ given by the least-squares method.

\textsc{sq-1,3} 
and \textsc{sq-1,2,3}, respectively) were excluded from the fitting procedure.

Among the neighborhoods that contain sites up to the sixth coordination zone, there are seven pairs of various neighborhoods with exactly the same $\zeta$ index, namely 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-2,4,5,6}) =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,2,3,4,5}) \approx 46.86$, 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-4,5,6})   =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,3,4,5})   \approx 41.20$, 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-2,5,6})   =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,2,3,5})   \approx 28.97$, 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-2,4,6})   =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,2,3,4})   \approx 35.55$, 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-5,6})     =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,3,5})     \approx 23.31$, 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-2,6})     =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,2,3})     \approx 17.66$ and 
$\zeta(\textsc{sq-6}) 	    =\zeta(\textsc{sq-1,3})       = 12$.

The differentiate power of a scalar index $\zeta$ is still better than the differentiate power of an index $\xi$ and both are much better than the differentiate power of the total number of sites in the neighborhood $z$.

\section{\label{sec:conclusions}Conclusion}
%% ###############################################################

In this paper with \citeauthor{NewmanZiff2001} effective Monte Carlo algorithm we calculated 32 percolation thresholds for complex neighbourhoods (containing sites from the sixth coordination zone) on a square lattice.

As scalar indexes $\xi$ \eqref{eq:xi} and $\zeta$ \eqref{eq:zeta} allow simultaneously for (more or less effective) distinguishing between various neighbourhoods and accordingly fitting $p_c$ to the inverse power-low on $\xi$ \eqref{eq:pc_vs_xi} or $\zeta$ \eqref{eq:pc_vs_zeta} (with various efficiency depending on the underlying lattice shape) searching for another index seems to be still an open task.
The index may involve various powers of $z_i$, $r_i$ and $i$, where $i$ stands for the number of coordination zone from which sites constituting neighbourhood come from and $z_i$ and $r_i$ are the number and the distance of sites in this coordination zone to the central site in the neighbourhood, respectively.

The results obtained in this paper may be helpful in further searching for the universal formula, in the spirit of \Cref{eq:pc-GM} \cite{Galam_Mauger_1994}, for percolation threshold $p_c$, also for complex neighborhoods, but independently of the underlying two-dimensional lattice shape.
Also further studies on the topic presented here may result in finding universal formula for $p_c$ not only for two-dimensional lattices but in higher dimensions (including nonphysical dimensions, like on four- \cite{1803.09504,Zhao_2022} and five-dimensional simple hyper-cubic \cite{PhysRevE.98.022120} lattices).

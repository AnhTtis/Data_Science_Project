	abstract = {This paper introduces a new class of multi-agent discrete-time dynamic games, known in the literature as dynamic graphical games. For that reason a local performance index is defined for each agent that depends only on the local information available to each agent. Nash equilibrium policies and best-response policies are given in terms of the solutions to the discrete-time coupled Hamilton–Jacobi equations. Since in these games the interactions between the agents are prescribed by a communication graph structure we have to introduce a new notion of Nash equilibrium. It is proved that this notion holds if all agents are in Nash equilibrium and the graph is strongly connected. A novel reinforcement learning value iteration algorithm is given to solve the dynamic graphical games in an online manner along with its proof of convergence. The policies of the agents form a Nash equilibrium when all the agents in the neighborhood update their policies, and a best response outcome when the agents in the neighborhood are kept constant. The paper brings together discrete Hamiltonian mechanics, distributed multi-agent control, optimal control theory, and game theory to formulate and solve these multi-agent dynamic graphical games. A simulation example shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a leader-synchronization case along with optimality guarantees.},

	abstract = {Active load variations in uncertain dynamical power system environments affect the energy exchange and efficiency in multi-area power systems, which could compromise the stability of power grids. Hence, model-free load frequency control mechanisms are needed in order to sustain proper performances under such conditions. An online model-free adaptive control scheme based on integral reinforcement learning is proposed to regulate load frequency deviations in multi-area power systems. This scheme takes into account the generation rate constraints of the power generation units and the optimal control decisions do not employ any knowledge about the dynamical model of the power system. This approach reformulates Bellman equation and approximates the associated solving value functions and model-free control strategies using neural networks. The adaption mechanism uses value iteration processes to evaluate the underlying modified-Bellman equation and model-free control strategy in real time. The performance of the adaptive learning scheme is compared with other control methodologies using challenging validation scenarios.},

This paper discusses the identification of the parameters at the antecedent and consequent parts of the fuzzy model. For the antecedent fuzzy parameters, genetic algorithm is used to tune them while at the consequent part, recursive least squares approach is used to identify the system parameters. This approach is applied to a process control rig with three subsystems: a heating element, a heat exchanger and a compartment tank. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides better modeling when compared with Takagi Sugeno fuzzy modeling technique and the linear modeling approach.}

It is assumed that the reference trajectory is generated by a linear command generator system. An augmented system composed of the original system and the command generator is constructed and it is shown that the value function for the LQT is quadratic in terms of the state of the augmented system. Using the quadratic structure of the value function, a Bellman equation and an augmented algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) for solving the LQT are derived. In contrast to the standard solution of the LQT, which requires the solution of an ARE and a noncausal difference equation simultaneously, in the proposed method the optimal control input is obtained by only solving an augmented ARE. A Q-learning algorithm is developed to solve online the augmented ARE without any knowledge about the system dynamics or the command generator. Convergence to the optimal solution is shown. A simulation example is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {The design of a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for vehicle road following is discussed. There are many factors which make automatic lateral control of vehicles difficult. These include changing vehicle parameters, changing road conditions, as well as disturbances caused by wind and other factors. Traditional controllers have difficulty guaranteeing performance and stability over a wide range of parameter changes. Model reference adaptive controllers on the other hand, can guarantee both stability and performance over a wide range of slowly varying parameter changes as long as several conditions are met. Difficulties with model reference adaptive controllers (as well as other controllers) arise when saturation appears on the input or states. For vehicle applications, the steering angle is limited. Therefore, the adaptation gains for the MRAC designed in this paper were chosen so that the steering command remained reasonable, even during adaptation. We finally show that there is a tradeoff regarding input amplitude and input frequency during adaptation.},

  abstract = {Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) has been used in numerous applications to improve system performance in the presence of system uncertainties. To achieve stringent tracking performance specifications, fast adaptation is required in the MRAC framework. However, fast adaptation with high gain adaptive rates could cause high frequency oscillation in the control response, resulting in system instability. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to improve the transient performance, and to restrain high frequency oscillation of the control signal, without modifying the selected reference model. An error feedback compensator is introduced into the control signal in this method, to restrict the control signal oscillation, caused by the estimate error of unknown parameter. Based on the augmented error dynamics, the compensator is designed as a robust controller. Moreover, the error feedback matrix can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. The control method is applied to a controlled wing rock aircraft dynamics model to verify the effectiveness. Simulation results show that the proposed method allows for fast adaptation with high gain adaptive rates, while eliminating high frequency oscillation and guaranteeing transient performance.},

  abstract = {Model uncertainty and saturation in actuators are among some of the practical challenges in the controller design of autonomous vehicles. Incorporating adaptive control with anti-windup (AW) compensators can provide a convenient combination to counteract the challenge. In this manuscript, an adaptive control with a dynamic anti-windup compensator is proposed for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Due to industrial and academic interests, the proposed method is embedded with a Proportional–Derivative–Integral (PID) controller. A modern AW technique is employed to cope with the saturation problem. Typical performance of the adaptive control system is achieved in the absence of actuator saturation. The performance is shown to degrade when the saturation has occurred. However the quality of the adaptive controller is improved when it is combined with an anti-windup compensator. Primarily six degrees of freedom (DOF) nonlinear motion equations of the vehicle are derived. Then, the proposed scheme is applied to this nonlinear model. Performance of the modified system is compared by the baseline controller. The effectiveness of the presented method in the presence of the actuator saturation, considering uncertainties, noise and disturbance is assessed and verified through simulation scenarios.},

  abstract = { This paper is concerned with the problem that fast-transient response and excellent robustness cannot be satisfied simultaneously in the process of dynamic positioning (DP) for underactuated surface vessel (USV) in shallow water. By combing the improved L1 adaptive control with backstepping method, a novel control scheme is designed, which can ensure a fast adaptation with a guaranteed smooth transient response without any overshoot and chattering phenomenon. System uncertainties and disturbances are estimated by the nonlinear observer. Moreover, the optimized extremum seeking control (ESC) is employed to reduce energy consumption under environmental disturbances. Rigorous theoretical analysis shows that all closed-loop signals are bounded-input bounded-state. Simulation and sea test results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed strategy under the condition of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. },

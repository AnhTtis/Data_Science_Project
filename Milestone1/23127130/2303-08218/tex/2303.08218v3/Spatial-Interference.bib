abstract = {Non-gaussian spatial data are very common in many disciplines. For instance, count data are common in disease mapping, and binary data are common in ecology. When fitting spatial regressions for such data, one needs to account for dependence to ensure reliable inference for the regression coefficients. The spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM) offers a very popular and flexible approach to modeling such data, but the SGLMM suffers from three major shortcomings: (1) uninterpretability of parameters due to spatial confounding, (2) variance inflation due to spatial confounding, and (3) high-dimensional spatial random effects that make fully Bayesian inference for such models computationally challenging. We propose a new parameterization of the SGLMM that alleviates spatial confounding and speeds computation by greatly reducing the dimension of the spatial random effects. We illustrate the application of our approach to simulated binary, count, and Gaussian spatial datasets, and to a large infant mortality dataset.},

abstract = {The expansion of sugarcane growing in Brazil, spurred particularly by increased demand for ethanol, has triggered the need to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental impacts of this process, both on the country as a whole and on the growing regions. Even though the balance of costs and benefits is positive from an overall standpoint, this may not be so in specific producing regions, due to negative externalities. The objective of this paper is to estimate the effect of growing sugarcane on the human development index (HDI) and its sub-indices in cane producing regions. In the literature on matching effects, this is interpreted as the effect of the treatment on the treated. Location effects are controlled by spatial econometric techniques, giving rise to the spatial propensity score matching model. The authors analyze 424 minimum comparable areas (MCAs) in the treatment group, compared with 907 MCAs in the control group. The results suggest that the presence of sugarcane growing in these areas is not relevant to determine their social conditions, whether for better or worse. It is thus likely that public policies, especially those focused directly on improving education, health, and income generation/distribution, have much more noticeable effects on the municipal HDI.},

abstract = {For obtaining causal inferences that are objective, and therefore have the best chance of revealing scientific truths, carefully designed and executed randomized experiments are generally considered to be the gold standard. Observational studies, in contrast, are generally fraught with problems that compromise any claim for objectivity of the resulting causal inferences. The thesis here is that observational studies have to be carefully designed to approximate randomized experiments, in particular, without examining any final outcome data. Often a candidate data set will have to be rejected as inadequate because of lack of data on key covariates, or because of lack of overlap in the distributions of key covariates between treatment and control groups, often revealed by careful propensity score analyses. Sometimes the template for the approximating randomized experiment will have to be altered, and the use of principal stratification can be helpful in doing this. These issues are discussed and illustrated using the framework of potential outcomes to define causal effects, which greatly clarifies critical issues.},

abstract = {The health impact of long-term exposure to air pollution is now routinely estimated using spatial ecological studies, due to the recent widespread availability of spatial referenced pollution and disease data. However, this areal unit study design presents a number of statistical challenges, which if ignored have the potential to bias the estimated pollution-health relationship. One such challenge is how to control for the spatial autocorrelation present in the data after accounting for the known covariates, which is caused by unmeasured confounding. A second challenge is how to adjust the functional form of the model to account for the spatial misalignment between the pollution and disease data, which causes within-area variation in the pollution data. These challenges have largely been ignored in existing long-term spatial air pollution and health studies, so here we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model that addresses both challenges, and provide software to allow others to apply our model to their own data. The effectiveness of the proposed model is compared by simulation against a number of state of the art alternatives proposed in the literature, and is then used to estimate the impact of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter concentrations on respiratory hospital admissions in a new epidemiological study in England in 2010 at the Local Authority level.},

Installation of SCR on coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) has grown substantially since the onset of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) first cap and trade program for oxides of nitrogen in 1999, the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) NOx Budget Program. Installations have increased from 6 units present in 1998 in the states that encompass the current Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) ozone season program to 250 in 2014. In recent years, however, the degree of usage of installed SCR technology has been dropping significantly at individual plants. Average seasonal NOx emission rates increased substantially during the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) program.

abstract = {The prespecification of the network is one of the biggest hurdles for applied researchers in undertaking spatial analysis. In this letter, we demonstrate two results. First, we derive bounds for the bias in nonspatial models with omitted spatially-lagged predictors or outcomes. These bias expressions can be obtained without prior knowledge of the network, and are more informative than familiar omitted variable bias formulas. Second, we derive bounds for the bias in spatial econometric models with nondifferential error in the specification of the weights matrix. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that an omitted spatial input is the limit condition of including a misspecificed spatial weights matrix. Simulated experiments further demonstrate that spatial models with a misspecified weights matrix weakly dominate nonspatial models. Our results imply that, where cross-sectional dependence is presumed, researchers should pursue spatial analysis even with limited information on network ties.},

abstract = {In an optimal nonbipartite match, a single population is divided into matched pairs to minimize a total distance within matched pairs. Nonbipartite matching has been used to strengthen instrumental variables in observational studies of treatment effects, essentially by forming pairs that are similar in terms of covariates but very different in the strength of encouragement to accept the treatment. Optimal nonbipartite matching is typically done using network optimization techniques that can be quick, running in polynomial time, but these techniques limit the tools available for matching. Instead, we use integer programming techniques, thereby obtaining a wealth of new tools not previously available for nonbipartite matching, including fine and near-fine balance for several nominal variables, forced near balance on means and optimal subsetting. We illustrate the methods in our on-going study of out-comes of late-preterm births in California, that is, births of 34 to 36 weeks of gestation. Would lengthening the time in the hospital for such births reduce the frequency of rapid readmissions? A straightforward comparison of ba-bies who stay for a shorter or longer time would be severely biased, because the principal reason for a long stay is some serious health problem. We need an instrument, something inconsequential and haphazard that encourages a shorter or a longer stay in the hospital. It turns out that babies born at cer-tain times of day tend to stay overnight once with a shorter length of stay, whereas babies born at other times of day tend to stay overnight twice with a longer length of stay, and there is nothing particularly special about a baby who is born at 11:00 pm. Therefore, we use hour-of-birth as an instrument for a longer hospital stay. Using integer programming, we form 80,600 pairs of two babies who are similar in terms of observed covariates but very different in anticipated lengths of stay based on their hours of birth. We ask whether encouragement to stay an extra day reduces readmissions within two days of discharge. A sensitivity analysis addresses the possibility that the instru-ment is not valid as an instrument, that is, not random but rather biased by an unmeasured covariate associated with the hour of birth. Bias can give the impression of a treatment effect when there is no effect, but it can also mask 25 26 J. R.

We propose a principal stratification method designed to examine causal effects of a regulation on health that are and are not associated with causal effects of the regulation on air quality. A novel feature of our approach is the accommodation of a continuously scaled multivariate intermediate response vector representing multiple pollutants. Furthermore, we use a spatial hierarchical model for potential pollution concentrations and ultimately use estimates from this model to assess validity of assumptions regarding interference.

abstract = {8 Joint species distribution models have become ubiquitous for studying species-habitat relationships and dependence among species. Accounting for community structure often improves predictive power, but can also alter inference on species-habitat relationships. Modulated species-habitat relationships are indicative of community confounding: The situation in which interspecies dependence and habitat effects compete to explain species distributions. We discuss community confounding in a case study of mammalian responses to the Colorado bark beetle epidemic in the subalpine forest by comparing the inference from independent single species distribution models and a joint species distribution model. We present a method for measuring community confounding and develop a restricted version of our hierarchical model that orthogonalizes the habitat and species random effects. Our results indicate that variables associated with the severity and duration of the bark beetle epidemic suffer from community confounding. This implies that mammalian responses to the bark beetle epidemic are governed by interconnected habitat and community effects. Disentangling habitat and community effects can improve our understanding of the ecological system and possible management strategies. We evaluate restricted regression as a method for alleviating community confounding and distinguish it from other inferential methods for confounded models. 9},

A literature in political science has attempted to document whether the presence of an initiative can increase voter turnout. Here, we study this question for an initiative that appeared on the ballot in Milwaukee, WI in 2008. We study this question using a natural experiment based on geography. This form of natural experiment exploits variation in geography where units in one geographic area receive a treatment while units in another area do not. The hope is that assignment to treatment via geographic location creates as-if ran-dom variation in treatment assignment. When this happens, adjustment for baseline covariates is unnecessary. In many applications, however, some adjustment for base-line covariates may be necessary. As such, analysts may wish to combine identification strategies–using both spatial proximity and covariates. We develop a matching algo-rithm to flexibly incorporate information about both the discontinuity and observed covariates which allows us to minimize spatial distance while preserving balance on observed covariates. Integrating these two strategies results in weaker assumptions for identification. Also, with this approach it is straightforward to conduct a sensitivity analysis to bias from hidden confounders.},

The REML method fits the local spatial process correctly, however the drawback is the lengthy computation. Meanwhile WNLS fits only the shape of the calculated empirical variogram, and parameters estimated from WNLS can be misleading.

The gbm package takes the approach described in [2] and [3].

In addition, the gbm package implements boosting for models commonly used in statistics but not commonly associated with boosting. The Cox proportional hazard model, for example, is an incred-ibly useful model and the boosting framework applies quite readily with only slight modification [5]. Also some algorithms implemented in the gbm package differ from the standard implementation. The AdaBoost algorithm [1] has a particular loss function and a particular optimization algorithm associated with it. The gbm implementation of AdaBoost adopts AdaBoost's exponential loss function (its bound on misclassification rate) but uses Friedman's gradient de-scent algorithm rather than the original one proposed. So the main purposes of this document is to spell out in detail what the gbm package implements. 1 Gradient boosting This section essentially presents the derivation of boosting described in [2].

Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods–or developing methods related to matching–do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

@article{King2016,
abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its in-tended goal — thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. PSM supposedly makes it easier to find matches by projecting a large number of covariates to a scalar propensity score and applying a single model to produce an unbiased estimate. However, in observational analysis the data generation process is rarely known and so users typically try many models before choosing one to present. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely random-ized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large por-tion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM ap-proximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have many other productive uses.},

Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such " TreeBoost " models are presented. Gradient boost-ing of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. A comparison and evaluation is made of recent proposals for multivariate matched sampling in observational studies, where the following three questions are answered: (1) Algorithms: In current statistical practice, matched samples are formed using "nearest available" matching, a greedy algorithm. Greedy matching does not minimize the total distance within matched pairs, though good algorithms exist for optimal matching that do minimize the total distance. How much better is optimal matching than greedy matching? We find that optimal matching is sometimes noticeably better than greedy matching in the sense of producing closely matched pairs, sometimes only marginally better, but it is no better than greedy matching in the sense of producing balanced matched samples. (2) Structures: In common practice, treated units are matched to one control, called pair matching or 1-1 matching, or treated units are matched to two controls, called 1-2 matching, and so on. It is known, however, that the optimal structure is a full matching in which a treated unit may have one or more controls or a control may have one or more treated units. Optimal 1 -k matching is compared to optimal full matching, finding that optimal full matching is often much better. (3) Distances: Matching involves defining a distance between covariate vectors, and several such distances exist. Three recent proposals are compared. Practical advice is summarized in a final section.},

abstract = {Fast algorithms are developed for Bayesian analysis of Gaussian hierarchical models with intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) spatial random effects. To achieve computational speed-ups, first a result is proved on the equivalence between the use of an improper CAR prior with centering on the fly and the use of a sum-zero constrained ICAR prior. This equivalence result then provides the key insight for the algorithms, which are based on rewriting the hierarchical model in the spectral domain. The two novel algorithms are the Spectral Gibbs Sampler (SGS) and the Spectral Posterior Maximizer (SPM). Both algorithms are based on one single matrix spectral decomposition computation. After this computation, the SGS and SPM algorithms scale linearly with the sample size. The SGS algorithm is preferable for smaller sample sizes, whereas the SPM algorithm is preferable for sample sizes large enough for asymptotic calculations to provide good approximations. Because the matrix spectral decomposition needs to be computed only once, the SPM algorithm has computational advantages over algorithms based on sparse matrix factorizations (which need to be computed for each value of the random effects variance parameter) in situations when many models need to be fitted. Three simulation studies are performed: the first simulation study shows improved performance in computational speed in estimation of the SGS algorithm compared to an algorithm that uses the spectral decomposition of the precision matrix; the second simulation study shows that for model selection computations with 10 regressors and sample sizes varying from 49 to 3600, when compared to the current fastest state-of-the-art algorithm implemented in the R package INLA, SPM computations are 550 to 1825 times faster; the third simulation study shows that, when compared to default INLA settings, SGS and SPM combined with reference priors provide much more adequate uncertainty quantification. Finally, the application of the novel SGS and SPM algorithms is illustrated with a spatial regression study of county-level median household income for 3108 counties in the contiguous United States in 2017.},

abstract = {Many statisticians have had the experience of fitting a linear model with uncorrelated errors, then adding a spatially-correlated error term (random effect) and finding that the estimates of the fixed-effect coefficients have changed substantially. We show that adding a spatially-correlated error term to a linear model is equivalent to adding a saturated collection of canonical regressors, the coefficients of which are shrunk toward zero, where the spatial map determines both the canonical regressors and the relative extent of the coefficients' shrinkage. Adding a spatially-correlated error term can also be seen as inflating the error variances associated with specific contrasts of the data, where the spatial map determines the contrasts and the extent of error-variance inflation. We show how to avoid this spatial confounding by restricting the spatial random effect to the orthogonal complement (residual space) of the fixed effects, which we call restricted spatial regression. We consider five proposed interpretations of spatial confounding and draw implications about what, if anything, one should do about it. In doing so, we debunk the common belief that adding a spatially-correlated random effect adjusts fixed-effect estimates for spatially-structured missing covariates.

abstract = {The paper describes a Bayesian spatial discrete time survival model to estimate the effect of air pollution on the risk of preterm birth. The standard approach treats prematurity as a binary outcome and cannot effectively examine time varying exposures during pregnancy. Time varying exposures can arise either in short-term lagged exposures due to seasonality in air pollution or long-term cumulative exposures due to changes in length of exposure. Our model addresses this challenge by viewing gestational age as time-to-event data where each pregnancy becomes at risk at a prespecified time (e.g. the 28th week). The pregnancy is then followed until either a birth occurs before the 37th week (preterm), or it reaches the 37th week, and a full-term birth is expected. The model also includes a flexible spatially varying baseline hazard function to control for unmeasured spatial confounders and to borrow information across areal units. The approach proposed is applied to geocoded birth records in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for the period 2001-2005.We examine the risk of preterm birth that is associated with total cumulative and 4-week lagged exposure to ambient fine particulate matter.},

abstract = {Statisticians commonly make causal inferences from the results of randomized experiments, but usually question causal inferences from observational studies on the grounds that untestable assumptions are required. This paper explains the basis for this situation and examines, within quite a general framework, various assumptions that appear in the literature. It is demonstrated how the role of each assumption is intimately related to the sort of causal inference being considered. Contrary to general belief, it is shown that neither `no confounding' nor `randomization' are sufficient assumptions for testing the fundamental causal hypothesis of `no causation'. They become sufficient, however, if supplemented by a `modelling' assumption for how unobserved covariates affect potential responses. Without supplementary assumptions, no confounding and randomization allow testing of weaker but more important hypotheses, such as `no mean effect'. This follows from the sufficiency of an assumption of `ignorable treatment assignment' for testing the hypothesis of `no distribution effect'. It is argued that these ideas will have some operational relevance if we can quantify our beliefs about how closely assumptions hold. To illustrate, a novel form of sensitivity analysis is contrasted with an analysis presented by Rosenbaum and Rubin.},

I consider the effects of residual spatial structure on the bias and precision of regression coefficients, developing a simple framework in which to understand the key issues and derive informative analytic results. When unmeasured confounding introduces spatial structure into the residuals, regression models with spatial random effects and closely-related models such as kriging and penalized splines are biased, even when the residual variance components are known. Analytic and simulation results show how the bias depends on the spatial scales of the covariate and the residual: one can reduce bias by fitting a spatial model only when there is variation in the covariate at a scale smaller than the scale of the unmeasured confounding. I also discuss how the scales of the residual and the covariate affect efficiency and uncertainty estimation when the residuals are independent of the covariate. In an application on the association between black carbon particulate matter air pollution and birth weight, controlling for large-scale spatial variation appears to reduce bias from unmeasured confounders, while increasing uncertainty in the estimated pollution effect.},

abstract = {Studies in air pollution epidemiology may suffer from some specific forms of confounding and exposure measurement error. This contribution discusses these, mostly in the framework of cohort studies. Evaluation of potential confounding is critical in studies of the health effects of air pollution. The association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mortality has been investigated using cohort studies in which subjects are followed over time with respect to their vital status. In such studies, control for individual-level confounders such as smoking is important, as is control for area-level confounders such as neighborhood socio-economic status. In addition, there may be spatial dependencies in the survival data that need to be addressed. These issues are illustrated using the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention II cohort. Exposure measurement error is a challenge in epidemiology because inference about health effects can be incorrect when the measured or predicted exposure used in the analysis is different from the underlying true exposure. Air pollution epidemiology rarely if ever uses personal measurements of exposure for reasons of cost and feasibility. Exposure measurement error in air pollution epidemiology comes in various dominant forms, which are different for time-series and cohort studies. The challenges are reviewed and a number of suggested solutions are discussed for both study domains.},

A common assumption in the causal inference literature in the presence of interference is par-tial interference, implying that the population can be partitioned in clusters of individuals whose potential outcomes only depend on the treatment of units within the same cluster. Previous literature has defined average potential outcomes under counterfactual scenarios where treatments are randomly allocated to units within a cluster. However, within clusters there may be units that are more or less likely to receive treatment based on covariates or neighbors' treatment. We define esti-mands that describe average potential outcomes for realistic counterfactual treat-ment allocation programs taking into consideration the units' covariates, as well as dependence between units' treatment assignment. We discuss these estimands, propose unbiased estimators and derive asymptotic results as the number of clusters grows.

This phenomenon is known as spatial confounding and has been studied primarily in the case where the spatial support of the process being studied is discrete (e.g., areal spatial data). In this case, the most common approach suggested is restricted spatial regression (RSR) in which the spatial random effects are constrained to be orthogonal to the fixed effects. We consider spatial confounding and RSR in the geostatistical (continuous spatial support) setting. We show that RSR provides computational benefits relative to the confounded SGLMM, but that Bayesian credible intervals under RSR can be inappropriately narrow under model misspecification. We propose a posterior predictive approach to alleviating this potential problem and discuss the appropriateness of RSR in a variety of situations.

abstract = {In 2002, methodological issues around time series analyses of air pollution and health attracted the attention of the scientific community, policy makers, the press, and the diverse stakeholders concerned with air pollution. As the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was finalizing its most recent review of epidemiologic evidence on particulate matter air pollution (PM), statisticians and epidemiologists found that the S–PLUS implementation of generalized additive models (GAMs) can overestimate effects of air pollution and understate statistical uncertainty in time series studies of air pollution and health. This discovery delayed completion of the PM Criteria Document prepared as part of the review of the U. S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard, because the time series findings represented a critical component of the evidence. In addition, it raised concerns about the adequacy of current model formulations and their software implementations. In this article we provide improvements in semiparametric regression directly relevant to risk estimation in time series studies of air pollution. First, we introduce a closed-form estimate of the asymptotically exact covariance matrix of the linear component of a GAM. To ease the implementation of these calculations, we develop the S package gam. exact, an extended version of gam. Use of gam. exact allows a more robust assessment of the statistical uncertainty of the estimated pollution coefficients. Second, we develop a bandwidth selection method to reduce confounding bias in the pollution-mortality relationship due to unmeasured time-varying factors, such as season and influenza epidemics. Third, we introduce a conceptual framework to fully explore the sensitivity of the air pollution risk estimates to model choice. We apply our methods to data of the National Mortality Morbidity Air Pollution Study, which includes time series data from the 90 largest U. S. cities for the period 1987–1994.},

The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the par-ticular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propen-sity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard approach for estimating the effects of treatments, interventions, and exposures (hereafter referred to as treatments) on outcomes. Random treatment allocation ensures that treatment status will not be confounded with either measured or unmeasured baseline characteristics. Therefore, the effect of treatment on outcomes can},

However, there are likely to be unobserved influences on risk, typically spatially clustered, which can be modeled as random effects. Regression impacts may be biased if no account is taken of spatially structured influences on risk. Furthermore a default assumption of linear effects of area variables may also misstate or understate their impact. This paper considers variations in suicide outcomes for small areas across England, and investigates the impact on them of area socio-economic variables, while also investigating potential nonlinearity in their impact and allowing for spatially clustered unobserved factors.

abstract = {Statistical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions are increasingly challenged by the inherent interconnectedness of units. Specifically, a recent flurry of methods research has addressed the problem of interference between observations, which arises when one observational unit's outcome depends not only on its treatment but also the treatment assigned to other units. We introduce the setting of bipartite causal inference with interference, which arises when (1) treatments are defined on observational units that are distinct from those at which outcomes are measured and (2) there is interference between units in the sense that outcomes for some units depend on the treatments assigned to many other units. The focus of this work is to formulate definitions and several possible causal estimands for this setting, highlighting similarities and differences with more commonly considered settings of causal inference with interference. Toward an empirical illustration, an inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator is adapted from existing literature to estimate a subset of simplified, but interesting, es-timands. The estimators are deployed to evaluate how interventions to reduce air pollution from 473 power plants in the U.S. causally affect cardiovascular hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries residing at 18,807 zip code locations},

abstract = {We consider adaptive designs for a trial involving N individuals that we follow along T time steps. We allow for the variables of one individual to depend on its past and on the past of other individuals. Our goal is to learn a mean outcome, averaged across the N individuals, that we would observe, if we started from some given initial state, and we carried out a given sequence of counterfactual interventions for $\tau$ time steps. We show how to identify a statistical parameter that equals this mean counter-factual outcome, and how to perform inference for this parameter, while adaptively learning an oracle design defined as a parameter of the true data generating distribution. Oracle designs of interest include the design that maximizes the efficiency for a statistical parameter of interest, or designs that mix the optimal treatment rule with a certain exploration distribution. We also show how to design adaptive stopping rules for sequential hypothesis testing. This setting presents unique technical challenges. Unlike in usual statistical settings where the data consists of several independent observations, here, due to network and temporal dependence, the data reduces to one single observation with dependent components. In particular, this precludes the use of sample splitting techniques. We therefore had to develop a new equicontinuity result and guarantees for estimators fitted on dependent data. Furthermore, since we want to design an adaptive stopping rule, we need guarantees over the joint distribution of the sequence of estimators. In particular, this requires our equicontinuity result to hold almost surely, and our convergence guarantees on nuisance estimators to hold uniformly in time. We introduce a nonparametric class of functions, which we argue is a realistic statistical model for nuisance parameters, and is such that we can check the required equicontinuity condition and show uniform-in-time convergence guarantees. We were motivated to work on this problem by the following two questions. (1) In the context of a sequential adaptive trial with K treatment arms, how to design a procedure to identify in as few rounds as possible the treatment arm with best final outcome? (2) In the context of sequential randomized disease testing at the scale of a city, how to estimate and infer the value of an optimal testing and isolation strategy?},

abstract = {SUMMARY Propensity score matching is a common tool for adjusting for observed confounding in observational studies, but is known to have limitations in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In many settings, researchers are confronted with spatially-indexed data where the relative locations of the observational units may serve as a useful proxy for unmeasured confounding that varies according to a spatial pattern. We develop a new method, termed distance adjusted propensity score matching (DAPSm) that incorporates information on units' spatial proximity into a propensity score matching procedure. We show that DAPSm can adjust for both observed and some forms of unobserved confounding and evaluate its performance relative to several other reasonable alternatives for incorporating spatial information into propensity score adjustment. The method is motivated by and applied to a comparative effectiveness investigation of power plant emission reduction technologies designed to reduce population exposure to ambient ozone pollution. Ultimately, DAPSm provides a framework for augmenting a " standard " propensity score analysis with information on spatial proximity and provides a transparent and principled way to assess the relative trade-offs of prioritizing observed confounding adjustment versus spatial proximity adjustment.},

We might refer to the first of these mechanisms as a contagion effect and the second as an infectiousness effect. In the simple setting of a randomized vaccine trial with households of size two, we use counterfactual theory under interference to provide formal definitions of a contagion effect and an unconditional infectiousness effect. Using ideas analogous to mediation analysis, we show that the indirect effect (the effect of one person's vaccine on another's outcome) can be decomposed into a contagion effect and an unconditional infectiousness effect on the risk difference, risk ratio, odds ratio, and vaccine efficacy scales. We provide identification assumptions for such contagion and unconditional infectiousness effects and describe a simple statistical technique to estimate these effects when they are identified. We also give a sensitivity analysis technique to assess how inferences would change under violations of the identification assumptions. The concepts and results of this paper are illustrated with hypothetical vaccine trial data.},

abstract = {Background: Decisions about the use of killed oral cholera vaccines, which confer moderate levels of direct protection to vaccinees, can depend on whether the vaccines also provide indirect (herd) protection when high levels of vaccine coverage are attained. We reanalysed data from a field trial in Bangladesh to ascertain whether there is evidence of indirect protection from killed oral cholera vaccines. Methods: We analysed the first year of surveillance data from a placebo-controlled trial of B subunit-killed whole-cell and killed whole-cell-only oral cholera vaccines in children and adult women in Bangladesh. We calculated whether there was an inverse, monotonic trend for the relation between the level of vaccine coverage in a residential cluster and the incidence of cholera in individual vaccine recipients or placebo recipients residing in the cluster after controlling for potential confounding variables. Findings: Vaccine coverage of the targeted population ranged from 4{\%} to 65{\%}. Incidence rates of cholera among placebo recipients were inversely related to levels of vaccine coverage (7{\textperiodcentered}01 cases per 1000 in the lowest quintile of coverage vs 1{\textperiodcentered}47 cases per 1000 in the highest quintile; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for trend). Receipt of vaccine by an individual and the level of vaccine coverage of the individual's cluster were independently related to a reduced risk of cholera. Moreover, after adjustment for the level of vaccine coverage of the cluster, vaccine protective efficacy remained significant (55{\%} [95{\%} CI 41-66], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Interpretation: In addition to providing direct protection to vaccine recipients, killed oral cholera vaccines confer significant herd protection to neighbouring non-vaccinated individuals. Use of these vaccines could have a major effect on the burden of cholera in endemic settings.},

The effect of one individual's vaccination on another's outcome can be de-composed into two different causal effects, called the " infectiousness " and " contagion " effects. We present identifying assumptions and estimation or testing procedures for infectiousness and contagion effects in two different settings: (1) using data sampled from independent groups of observations, and (2) using data collected from a single interdependent social network. The methods that we propose for social network data require fitting generalized linear models (GLMs). GLMs and other statistical models that require inde-pendence across subjects have been used widely to estimate causal effects in social network data, but because the subjects in networks are presumably not independent, the use of such models is generally invalid, resulting in in-ference that is expected to be anticonservative. We describe a subsampling scheme that ensures that GLM errors are uncorrelated across subjects despite the fact that outcomes are nonindependent. This simultaneously demonstrates the possibility of using GLMs and related statistical models for network data and highlights their limitations.},

If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, indepen-dent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

For replicating such analysis:

- Acquire groups for partial interference

- Fit a logistic mixed effect model for the probability of treatment (in the paper the used model for participation - but that's study specific)

- Check the possible values of $\alpha$ in the group assignment. For example, in the groups what is the proportion of treated units? This will give us a sense of the values of $\alpha$ we can estimate effects for.

- In eq 4, we know how to calculate the numerator (it's the conditional probability - look at note in the text), the denominator is calculated using the integrate function in R.

- Calculate the weights of the IPW estimator and check the range of the weights.

abstract = {A fundamental assumption usually made in causal inference is that of no interference between individuals (or units); that is, the potential outcomes of one individual are assumed to be unaffected by the treatment assignment of other individuals. However, in many settings, this assumption obviously does not hold. For example, in the dependent happenings of infectious diseases, whether one person becomes infected depends on who else in the population is vaccinated. In this article, we consider a population of groups of individuals where interference is possible between individuals within the same group. We propose estimands for direct, indirect, total, and overall causal effects of treatment strategies in this setting. Relations among the estimands are established; for example, the total causal effect is shown to equal the sum of direct and indirect causal effects. Using an experimental design with a two-stage randomization procedure (first at the group level, then at the individual level within groups), unbiased estimators of the proposed estimands are presented. Variances of the estimators are also developed. The methodology is illustrated in two different settings where interference is likely: assessing causal effects of housing vouchers and of vaccines.},

In the observational setting where the treatment assignment mechanism is not known, inverse probability-weighted estimators have been proposed when individuals can be partitioned into groups such that there is no interference between individuals in different groups. Unfortunately this assumption, which is sometimes referred to as partial interference, may not hold, and more-over existing weighted estimators may have large variances. In this paper we consider weighted estimators that could be employed when interference is present. We first propose a generalized inverse probability-weighted estimator and two H{\'{a}}jek-type stabilized weighted estimators that allow any form of interference. We derive their asymptotic distributions and propose consistent variance estimators assuming partial interference. Empirical results show that one of the H{\'{a}}jek estimators can have substantially smaller finite-sample variance than the other estimators.

Sukhatme (1958), Randles (1982), and Pierce (1982) all consider the changes, if any, in the statistic's limiting normal distribution. This paper gives conditions for a law of the iterated logarithm for U-statistics which have a kernel with an estimator substituted into it. It also gives conditions for both strong and weak convergence. Applications of the theory are illus-trated by constructing a sequential test for scale differences with power one. The theory also produces convergence results for adaptive M-estimators and for cross-validation assessment statistics. In addition, it is shown how to extend LIL results to a broad class of statistics with estimators substituted into them by use of the differential. In particular, a law of the iterated loga-rithm is described for adaptive L-statistics and is illustrated by an example of de Wet and van Wyk (1979).},

abstract = {Recently, increasing attention has focused on making causal inference when interference is possible. In the presence of interference, treatment may have several types of effects. In this paper, we consider inference about such effects when the population consists of groups of individuals where interference is possible within groups but not between groups. A two stage randomization design is assumed where in the first stage groups are randomized to different treatment allocation strategies and in the second stage individuals are randomized to treatment or control conditional on the strategy assigned to their group in the first stage. For this design, the asymptotic distributions of estimators of the causal effects are derived when either the number of individuals per group or the number of groups grows large. Under certain homogeneity assumptions, the asymptotic distributions provide justification for Wald-type confidence intervals (CIs) and tests. Empirical results demonstrate the Wald CIs have good coverage in finite samples and are narrower than CIs based on either the Chebyshev or Hoeffding inequalities provided the number of groups is not too small. The methods are illustrated by two examples which consider the effects of cholera vaccination and an intervention to encourage voting.},

@article{Barkley2017a,
abstract = {Inferring causal effects from an observational study is challenging because participants are not ran-domized to treatment. Observational studies in infectious disease research present the additional challenge that one participant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i.e., there may be interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects in the presence of interference are considered, and new causal estimands designed specifically for use with observational studies are proposed. Previously defined estimands target counterfactual scenarios in which individuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in settings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it may be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in the same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe counterfactual scenarios in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as in the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in the individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for policy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of increasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse probability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The large-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented. The proposed methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a study of cholera vaccination in over 100,000 individuals in Bangladesh.},

Our general approach is to define an artificial experiment, such that the null hypothesis that was not sharp for the original experiment is sharp for the artificial experiment, and such that the ran-domization analysis for the artificial experiment is validated by the design of the original experiment.},

This approach is compared with models that ignore the hierarchy, and models in which the hierarchy is represented by a fixed parameter for each cluster. It is shown, by simulation, that simple models with dummy variables outperform both random effect models and models ignoring the hierarchy in terms of balance of cluster-level unobserved covariates and omitted variable bias. The representation of the clusters by fixed or random effects defines a model more general than would be ideal if the relevant cluster-level variables were available. The general conclusion confirms that when conducting propensity score analysis it is safer to specify a more general model than pursuing model parsimony.},

abstract = {Methods for inferring average causal effects have traditionally relied on two key assumptions: (i) the intervention received by one unit cannot causally influence the outcome of another; and (ii) units can be organized into non-overlapping groups such that outcomes of units in separate groups are independent. In this paper, we develop new statistical methods for causal inference based on a single realization of a network of connected units for which neither assumption (i) nor (ii) holds. The proposed approach allows both for arbitrary forms of interference, whereby the outcome of a unit may depend on interventions received by other units with whom a network path through connected units exists; and long range dependence, whereby outcomes for any two units likewise connected by a path in the network may be dependent. Under network versions of consistency and no unobserved confounding, inference is made tractable by an assumption that the networks outcome, treatment and covariate vectors are a single realization of a certain chain graph model. This assumption allows inferences about various network causal effects via the auto-g-computation algorithm, a network generalization of Robins' well-known g-computation algorithm previously described for causal inference under assumptions (i) and (ii).},

abstract = {During the past 20 years, social scientists using observational studies have generated a large and inconclusive literature on neighborhood effects. Recent workers have argued that estimates of neighborhood effects based on randomized studies of housing mobility, such as the " Moving to Opportunity " (MTO) demonstration, are more credible. These estimates are based on the implicit assumption of no interference between units; that is, a subject's value on the response depends only on the treatment to which that subject is assigned, not on the treatment assignments of other subjects. For the MTO studies, this assumption is not reasonable. Although little work has been done on the definition and estimation of treatment effects when interference is present, interference is common in studies of neighborhood effects and in many other social settings (e.g., schools and networks), and when data from such studies are analyzed under the " no-interference assumption, " very misleading inferences can result. Furthermore, the consequences of interference (e.g., spillovers) should often be of great substantive interest, even though little attention has been paid to this. Using the MTO demonstration as a concrete context, this article develops a frame-work for causal inference when interference is present and defines a number of causal estimands of interest. The properties of the usual estimators of treatment effects, which are unbiased and/or consistent in randomized studies without interference, are also characterized. When interference is present, the difference between a treatment group mean and a control group mean (unadjusted or adjusted for covari-ates) estimates not an average treatment effect, but rather the difference between two effects defined on two distinct subpopulations. This result is of great importance, for a researcher who fails to recognize this could easily infer that a treatment is beneficial when in fact it is universally harmful.},

    "abstract": "This paper presents the second-order perturbation theory of the Navier-Stokes equations for free surface flows, with the wave amplitude considered as the perturbation parameter. Gravity-capillary surface waves in incompressible viscous fluids are subjected. The results provide a systematic derivation of a nonlinear surface wave equation that fully takes into account dispersion, while nonlinearity is included in the leading order. However, the presence of infinitely many overdamped modes has been neglected, and only the two least damped modes are considered. Finally, to describe the elevations and evolution of the surface wave, we introduce a differential equation.",

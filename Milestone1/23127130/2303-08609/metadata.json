    "abstract": "We study the implementation of the even-odd Wilson fermion matrix for lattice QCD simulations on the A64FX architecture. Efficient coding of the stencil operation is investigated for two-dimensional packing to SIMD vectors. We measure the sustained performance on the supercomputer Fugaku at RIKEN R-CCS and show the profiler result of our code, which may signal an unexpected source of slow-down in addition to the detailed efficiency of each part of the code.",

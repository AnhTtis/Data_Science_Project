    "abstract": "In this article, we consider mechanical billiard systems defined with Lagrange's integrable extension of Euler's two-center problems in the Euclidean space, on the sphere, and in the hyperbolic space of arbitrary dimension $n \\ge 3$. In the three-dimensional Euclidean space, we show that the billiard systems with any finite combination of quadrics having two foci at the Kepler centers are integrable. The same holds for the projections of these systems on the three-dimensional sphere and the hyperbolic space by means of central projection. With the same approach, we also extend these results to the $n$-dimensional cases.",

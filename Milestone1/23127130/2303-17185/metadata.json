    "abstract": "Tests of gravity are important to the development of our understanding of gravitation and spacetime. Binary pulsars provide a superb playground for testing gravity theories. In this chapter we pedagogically review the basics behind pulsar observations and pulsar timing. We illustrate various recent strong-field tests of the general relativity (GR) from the Hulse-Taylor pulsar PSR~B1913+16, the double pulsar PSR~J0737$-$3039, and the triple pulsar PSR~J0337+1715. We also overview the inner structure of neutron stars (NSs) that may influence some gravity tests, and have used the scalar-tensor gravity and massive gravity theories as examples to demonstrate the usefulness of pulsar timing in constraining specific modified gravity theories. Outlooks to new radio telescopes for pulsar timing and synergies with other strong-field gravity tests are also presented.",

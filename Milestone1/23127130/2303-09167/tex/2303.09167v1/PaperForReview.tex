%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   This paper introduces our method for the Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation Challenge, in CVPR 2023: 5th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW). Based on the multimodal data provided by the originazers, we extract acoustic and visual features with different pretrained models. The multimodal features are mixed together by Transformer Encoders with cross-modal attention mechnism. In this paper, 
   \begin{enumerate*}
   
   \item better features are extracted with the SOTA pretrained models. 
   \item Compared with the baseline, we improve the Pearson's Correlations Coefficient a lot. 
   \item We process the data with some special skills to enhance  performance ability of our model.
   \end{enumerate*} 

\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Emotional reaction intensity estimation is an important part of recognizing and understanding people's feelings, especially for those robots that can interact with human beings. Thus, the interaction should not be dependent on the respective context, nor the human's age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, profession, or social position. And there are numerous and different dimensions of data during the interaction between machines and humans. In this paper, we present out methods for the Emotional reaction intensity estimation Challenge, in CVPR 2023: 5th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW)\cite{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Our methods gets a good performance on the training, validation, and testing dataset.

The ERI\cite{10} estimation challenge, which targets at predicting the audience's intensities of seven different emotions. Each audience's reactions are aroused by the specific kind of videos. The reactions includes facial expressions, words, gestures. These multimodal data are usually disturbed by the
environment, such as light, noise, the quality of camera and so on. Even the different parts of the data can affect each other, so as to make the estimation more difficult. The ERI estimation needs us to utilize and analysis these multimodal data carefully to create a model, and the model should recognize human emotion states robustly by analyzing the audio information, visual information and gesture information. 

Our main contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We extract better audio features and video features with some pretrained models.
    \item In this challenge, compared with the baseline provided by the organizers, we improve the Pearson's Correlations Coefficient a lot.
    \item We process the data efficiently with some special fine tuning skills to enhance  performance ability of our model.
\end{enumerate}

The remaining paper is organized as follows. We introduce our pretrained models to extract audio and visual features in Section 2. And Section 3 describes our methods and framework. Then Section 4 presents the results based on the method before-mentioned. The conclusion is in Section 5.

\iffalse
\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

\subsection{Dual submission}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a
discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

\subsection{Paper length}
Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length.
The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section.
For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
{\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confName\ \confYear.}

Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.
This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide.
Note that this \LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts.
The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review.
The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution.
If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\ document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages.
The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.
The camera-ready copy should not contain a ruler.
(\LaTeX\ users may use options of cvpr.sty to switch between different versions.)

Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper --- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.
Just use fractional references (\eg, this line is $087.5$), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.


\subsection{Paper ID}
Make sure that the Paper ID from the submission system is visible in the version submitted for review (replacing the ``*****'' you see in this document).
If you are using the \LaTeX\ template, \textbf{make sure to update paper ID in the appropriate place in the tex file}.


\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations as in these examples:
\begin{equation}
  E = m\cdot c^2
  \label{eq:important}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  v = a\cdot t.
  \label{eq:also-important}
\end{equation}
It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.
Just because you did not refer to it in the text does not mean some future reader might not need to refer to it.
It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''.
(Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers).
All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

\subsection{Blind review}

Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review.
Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available.

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing previous work.
That is all.
(But see below for tech reports.)

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy Smith;
it says that you are building on her work.
If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
    An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
   Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Removed for blind review
\end{quote}


An example of an acceptable paper:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of the  paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
   Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''. Nature 381(12), 1-213.
\end{quote}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as supplemental material and cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324, Supplied as supplemental material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
\end{quote}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.
For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.
Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.
Then submit the tech report as supplemental material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool that is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.
For example, let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.
The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.
Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
Instead write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
   This system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
   Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
   It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors.
A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B.

\noindent
FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double-blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper.
For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge.
Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
Thus, the following is correct:
   ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{3} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.


% Update the cvpr.cls to do the following automatically.
% For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
% chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to

\section{Formatting your paper}
\label{sec:formatting}

All text must be in a two-column format.
The total allowable size of the text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54 cm) high.
Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a $\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them.
The main title (on the first page) should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page.
The second and following pages should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge.
On all pages, the bottom margin should be $1\frac{1}{8}$ inches (2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper;
for A4 paper, approximately $1\frac{5}{8}$ inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area $6\frac{7}{8}$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac{7}{8}$ inches (22.54 cm)
high.
%
Page numbers should be in the footer, centered and $\frac{3}{4}$ inches from the bottom of the page.
The review version should have page numbers, yet the final version submitted as camera ready should not show any page numbers.
The \LaTeX\ template takes care of this when used properly.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used.
If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE.
Center the title $1\frac{3}{8}$ inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the first page.
The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs;
do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).
Leave two blank lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type.
This information is to be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT.
Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced.
Do NOT use double-spacing.
All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx.~$\frac{1}{6}$ inch or 0.422 cm).
Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, flush left and flush right.
Please do not place any additional blank lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short}.
Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS.
(For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS.
(For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements}) should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one after.
If you require a third-order heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote{This is what a footnote looks like.
It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).
If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced.
Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cross-references}

For the benefit of author(s) and readers, please use the
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \cref{...}
\end{verbatim}}  command for cross-referencing to figures, tables, equations, or sections.
This will automatically insert the appropriate label alongside the cross-reference as in this example:
\begin{quotation}
  To see how our method outperforms previous work, please see \cref{fig:onecol} and \cref{tab:example}.
  It is also possible to refer to multiple targets as once, \eg~to \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short-a}.
  You may also return to \cref{sec:formatting} or look at \cref{eq:also-important}.
\end{quotation}
If you do not wish to abbreviate the label, for example at the beginning of the sentence, you can use the
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \Cref{...}
\end{verbatim}}
command. Here is an example:
\begin{quotation}
  \Cref{fig:onecol} is also quite important.
\end{quotation}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the end of your paper.
When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{0}.
Where appropriate, include page numbers and the name(s) of editors of referenced books.
When you cite multiple papers at once, please make sure that you cite them in numerical order like this \cite{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
If you use the template as advised, this will be taken care of automatically.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
    \toprule
    Method & Frobnability \\
    \midrule
    Theirs & Frumpy \\
    Yours & Frobbly \\
    Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
  \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.
In \LaTeX, avoid using the \texttt{center} environment for this purpose, as this adds potentially unwanted whitespace.
Instead use
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \centering
\end{verbatim}}
at the beginning of your figure.
Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.
Resize fonts in figures to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths that render effectively in print.
Readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic copy, may choose to print your paper in order to read it.
You cannot insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use \verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a discussion of the use of color in your document.

If you use color in your plots, please keep in mind that a significant subset of reviewers and readers may have a color vision deficiency; red-green blindness is the most frequent kind.
Hence avoid relying only on color as the discriminative feature in plots (such as red \vs green lines), but add a second discriminative feature to ease disambiguation.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Feature Extraction}
In this section we present our approach to extract visual and audio information. Mainly, we introduce the models used to extract features.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Visual Information}

At first, we get the video frames from the video at intervals of 0.2 seconds. After getting the video frames, use DeepFace\cite{taigman2014deepface} to get the faces in the video frames in chronological order and save 224x224 face images. DeepFace is an efficient face recognition technology based on convolutional neural network proposed by Facebook AI, which can achieve high accuracy in different angles, lighting, and expressions. It is an essential technological advancement in the field of face recognition. 

After converting the video into a series of face images, we try out the model to obtain the visual features.

\textbf{FAb-Net}\cite{wiles2018self}: Facial Attributes-Net is trained to embed multiple frames from the same video face-track into a common low-dimensional space. The network learns a meaningful facial embedding that encodes information about the pose of the head, facial signs, and facial expressions without being supervised by any data from labels.

\textbf{EfficientNet}\cite{savchenko2021facial}: EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on various computer vision tasks. It was proposed by Google researchers in 2019 as a novel way of scaling CNNs based on a compound coefficient that balance the network depth, width, and resolution. The authors of EfficientNet use an automated neural architecture search(NAS) technique called MNAS to find the optimal base network architecture that can be scaled up efficiently. Similarly, we also use an automated fine tuning tools called Ray\cite{Ray} to help us find the most proper hyper parameters, which will be introduced in the detailed version of this paper.

\textbf{DAN}\cite{wen2021distract}: DAN leverages multi-head cross attention to capture subtle facial feature and reduce inter-class confusion. The network consists of three main components: a backbone network, a multi-head cross attention module, and a classifier. It concentrates on two problems: Firstly, multiple classed of facial expressions share inherently similar underlying facial appearance, and their differences could be subtle and localized. Secondly, existing FER methods tend to focus on the most salient regions of the face, such as the eyes and mouth, but neglect other regions that may contain useful information for FER.

Our experiments results on visual featured extracted with different pretrained models or tools are showing in Table \ref{table 1}. And the ensemble part of different models' experiments are showing in Table \ref{table 2}. 

\subsection{Audio Information}

According to audio information, we process the original wav files provided by organizers directly, with the help of several audio pretrained models or tools. In fact, we have tried a few different extracting methods to process audio data, while most of them perform not well. Therefore, we just pick some results that are not so bad, and the experiments results are showing in Table \ref{table 3}. Specifically, we design our own ResNet model just by replacing the conv2d to conv1d and using 7 residual blocks. Besides, we find that the modality of audio do not contribute to the final evaluation metric, while the single modality of video makes the proposed model perform better. It means that when acoustic features and visual features are fused together, the performance of our proposed model is not as good as before. 

\textbf{Wav2Vec2}: Wav2Vec2\cite{wav2vec2} is a large model pretrained and fine-tunued on 960 hours of Libri-Light and Librispeech\cite{kahn2020libri} on 16kHz sampled speech audio. Model was trained with Self-Training objective\cite{self}. Wav2Vec2.0 masks the speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent representations which are jointly learned. We use the model provided by Facebook AI\cite{wav2vec2} to extract 768-dimensional acoustic features from the present audio files. 

\textbf{VGGish}: VGGish\cite{vggish} is a deep neural network model that was designed specifically for the task of audio classification. It was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the VGG network architecture. It has been used for a variety of audio classification tasks, including environmental sound classification and music classification. It has also been used to create embeddings for audio signals, which can be used for tasks such as audio similarity search and audio clustering. Given this, we also choose VGGish to extract 128-dimensional acoustic features.

\section{METHODOLOGY}

\subsection{TE}
Our approach is mainly based on a CNN and a Transformer-Encoder\cite{9257201}.First, take the previously extracted features as input of the 1-dimensional temporal convolutional network to extract local temporal information. Then, the output of the 1-D CNN is fed into the transformer-encoder to achieve long-range dependencies with dynamic attention weights. Finally,  fully connected layers are used to inference the intensity of emotional reaction.

\subsection{Loss: MSE and PCC}

MSE can evaluate the degree of change in the data, and the smaller the value of the MSE, the better the accuracy of the predictive model in describing the experimental data. We use MSE to measure the matching degree between the predicted value and grand truth, so that the distribution between predicted value and grand truth can be similar.The Pearson correlation coefficient(PCC) is widely used to measure the degree of correlation between two variables, with values between -1 and 1.It is used to ensure the similarity of distribution between individual attributes.

\subsection{Training process and Integration strategy}
In the process of converting video frames to face images, we found that there were some videos that could not recognize faces, so we did some filtering of the training set and discarded the videos that could not recognize faces, but for the validation set, we scaled the video frames that could not recognize faces to the same size as the face images. The data in Table \ref{table 1} are obtained by training on the filtered training set and then validating on the full validation set, where the numbers in the last row in parentheses are the results obtained using the full training and validation sets.

Ray\footnote{https://www.ray.io/ray-tune} is a Python-based distributed computing framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for building and debugging distributed applications.  We use RAY to help us find better parameters to make the model work, where our settings in RAY are as follows: for the learning rate, we use it evenly between $1\times10^{-5}$ and $2\times10^{-4}$, for the batch size we set it between 8 and 32, and we limit the dimension  of the transformer hidden layer to 512 to 1024. We try 100 trials in RAY using MSE loss and PCC loss respectively, where each trial goes through a maximum of 10 epochs and how many epochs each trial goes through is determined by RAY, to obtain better hyperparameters through these trials.

\section{RESULTS}
We use the extracted face features as the visual information in the TE network framework and optimize them using MSE loss and PCC loss, respectively. As shown in Table \ref{table 1}, using only the visual information, we stitch the three visual features together and we achieve an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.3894 and 0.3904 in the validation set under MSE and PCC, respectively. For the audio information, after obtaining the audio features extracted by Wav2Vec2 and VGGish, we fed them into the TE and ResNet models, respectively, and optimized them using PCC losses. As shown in Table \ref{table 3}, using the TE network and the features extracted by VGGish, we achieve an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.1440 on the validation set.




\section{CONCLUSION}
In this paper, we introduce our method for the Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation Challenge, in CVPR 2023: 5th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW). We utlize the acoustic features extracted by Wav2Vec2 and VGGish, and the visual features extracted by FAb-Net, EfficientNet and DAN. Based on the extracted features, we conduct experiments with TE model on each modality respectively. Besides, we train two models, which have the same network architecture, with different limitations. These two models have different performance on validation data, but when we ensemble these two models, then the ensemble model gets significant performance finally. The task's evaluation metric is Pearson's correlations coefficient, which is 0.4014 on validation set, outperforming the baseline a lot.

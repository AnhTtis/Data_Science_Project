    "abstract": "Efficient integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) into the current wireless network standard is not a trivial task due to the overhead generated by performing channel estimation (CE) and phase-shift optimization. In this paper, we propose a framework enabling the coexistence between orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and RIS technologies. Instead of wasting communication symbols for the CE and optimization, the proposed framework exploits the localization information obtainable by RIS-aided communications to provide a robust allocation strategy for user multiplexing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to CE-based transmission methods.",

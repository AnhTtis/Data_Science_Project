	abstract = {In the light of recent significant progress on both the observational and theoretical fronts, we review the status of white dwarf stars as cosmochronometers. These objects represent the end products of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars and, as such, can be used to constrain the ages of various populations of evolved stars in the Galaxy. For example, the oldest white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (the remnants of the very first generation of intermediate‐mass stars in the Galactic disk) are still visible and can be used, in conjunction with cooling theory, to estimate the age of the disk. More recent observations suggest the tantalizing possibility that a population of very old white dwarfs inhabits the Galactic halo. Such a population may contribute significantly to baryonic “dark” matter in the Milky Way and may be used to obtain an independent estimate of the age of the halo. In addition, white dwarf cosmochronology is likely to play a very significant role in the coming era of giant 8–10 m telescopes when faint white dwarf populations should be routinely discovered and studied in open and globular clusters.}

	abstract = {WHITE dwarf stars represent the final evolutionary state for most main-sequence stars. They cool slowly enough that even the oldest white dwarfs are still observable in sufficiently deep surveys and they therefore provide a record of the age and star-formation history of the local disk of the Milky Way1–7—and hence a useful constraint on the age of the Galaxy itself. Here we report the initial results of a very deep survey of white dwarfs, that avoids many of the problems associated with the incompleteness of earlier surveys. We use model age–luminosity relations to interpret the luminosity function of our sample of stars, and thus obtain a minimum age for the local Galactic disk of ∼9.5 Gyr. Our results lend weight to an emerging picture of the evolutionary history of the Milky Way, in which the halo formed ∼14–17 Gyr ago8,9, followed by the bulge globular clusters ∼12–14 Gyr ago10, with a modest hiatus before the onset of star formation in the local disk ∼10 Gyr ago.},

We provide an intuitive example of the source of this symmetry by analogy with a vibrating string. For the stellar case, we focus on the white dwarf stars, establishing the practical consequences for high-order white dwarf pulsations both analytically and numerically. In addition, we verify the effect empirically by cross-fitting two different structural models, and we discuss the consequences that this approximate symmetry may have for past and present asteroseismological fits of the pulsating DBV, GD 358. Finally, we show how the signatures of composition transition zones that are brought about by physically distinct processes may be used to help alleviate this potential ambiguity in our asteroseismological interpretation of the pulsation frequencies observed in white dwarf stars.}",

We find that for essentially all observed pulsation modes, the amplitude rises to the ultraviolet as the theoretical models predict for l = 1 nonradial g-modes. We do not find any pulsation mode visible only in the ultraviolet, nor any modes whose phase flips by 180° in the ultraviolet, as would be expected if high l pulsations were excited. We find one periodicity in the light curve of G185-32, at 141 s, which does not fit theoretical models for the change of amplitude with wavelength of g-mode pulsations.}

We use CO5BOLD radiation-hydrodynamics 3D simulations covering Teff = 6000–11,500 K and log g = 5–6.5 (g in cm s−2) to derive analytical functions to convert spectroscopically determined 1D temperatures and surface gravities to 3D atmospheric parameters. Along with the previously published 3D models, the 1D to 3D corrections are now available for essentially all known convective DA WDs (i.e., log g = 5–9). For low-mass WDs, the correction in temperature is relatively small (a few percent at the most), but the surface gravities measured from the 3D models are lower by as much as 0.35 dex. We revisit the spectroscopic analysis of the extremely low-mass (ELM) WDs, and demonstrate that the 3D models largely resolve the discrepancies seen in the radius and mass measurements for relatively cool ELM WDs in eclipsing double WD and WD + millisecond pulsar binary systems. We also use the 3D corrections to revise the boundaries of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, including the recently found ELM pulsators.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We first review and rebut the arguments that have been put forward recently against the use of optical spectroscopy in the determinations of the atmospheric parameters of ZZ Ceti and neighboring stars in the log g-Teff diagram. We reiterate instead the conclusion of Bergeron et al. that optical spectroscopy alone, when properly handled and modeled, leads to very accurate and reliable estimates of the surface gravities and effective temperatures of ZZ Ceti pulsators. The optical spectroscopy approach has had a yield of 100% so far in predicting the variability of candidate ZZ Ceti stars, and we present evidence here of its successful application to two more objects. We hence report the detection of multiperiodic luminosity variations in the light curves of two DA white dwarfs, MCT 0145-2211 and HE 0532-5605, selected on the basis of an analysis of their optical spectra. This brings the number of known ZZ Ceti stars to a total of 34. Our study reveals that MCT 0145-2211 has Teff = 11,550 K and log g = 8.14, while HE 0532-5605 has Teff = 11,560 K and log g = 8.49, which places them both inside the empirical instability strip uncovered by Bergeron et al. We find that the amplitudes, periods, and degree of complexity of the light curves are consistent with the positions of the stars rather near the red edge. Using the same homogeneous approach, we have, so far, analyzed high-quality optical spectra for some 103 nonvariable DA white dwarfs and all of the 34 known ZZ Ceti stars. The picture of the empirical instability strip that emerges is that of a pure strip, in which no nonvariable stars are found. It has a trapezoidal shape in the log g-Teff plane, with the blue edge showing a stronger dependence on the surface gravity than the red edge does.}

	abstract = {We present atmospheric parameters for a large sample of DA white dwarfs that are known to be photometrically constant. For each star, we determine the effective temperature and surface gravity by comparing high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra to the predictions of detailed model atmosphere calculations. We also report the successful prediction and detection of photometric variability in G232-38 based on similar Teff and log g determinations. The atmospheric parameters derived for this sample of constant stars, as well as those for the known sample of bright ZZ Ceti stars (now boosted to a total of 39), have been obtained in a highly homogeneous way. We combine them to study the empirical red and blue edges, as well as the purity of the ZZ Ceti instability strip. We find that the red edge is rather well constrained, whereas there exists a rather large range of possibilities for the slope of the blue edge. Furthermore, the ZZ Ceti instability strip that results from our analysis contains no nonvariable white dwarfs. Our sample of constant stars is part of a much broader spectroscopic survey of bright (V < 17) DA white dwarfs, which we have recently undertaken. We also present here some preliminary results of this survey. Finally, we revisit the analysis by Mukadam et al. of the variable and nonvariable DA stars uncovered as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Their erroneous conclusion of an instability strip containing several nonvariable stars is traced back to the low signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic observations used in that survey.}

	abstract = {This study compares the theoretical pulsation periods from a new grid of evolutionary DA white dwarf models to the observed periods of the ZZ Ceti white dwarfs G117-B15A and R548 (≡ ZZ Ceti) in order to constrain their internal structure. Assuming that the similar periods of the two stars is the result of their having nearly identical internal structures, then they must have a hydrogen layer mass of ~10-7M⋆ or greater. If we follow Clemens's work and identify the period near 215 s as the ℓ=1, k = 2 mode, then the hydrogen layer mass is close to 10-4M⋆, quite close to the maximum hydrogen layer mass allowed by stellar evolution theory. Based on this analysis, G117-B15A and R548 probably have masses near 0.60 M☉ and MH ~ 10-4M⋆, and R548 is about 0.04 M☉ less massive than G117-B15A. Alternatively, if 215 s is the k = 1 mode, then the hydrogen layer mass decreases to about 10-7M⋆, but the stellar mass remains near 0.60 M☉. In all cases, the helium layer mass is near 10-2M⋆, and the C/O core of both stars is oxygen rich. The existence of the 304 s mode of G117-B15A strongly restricts the allowable core structure. At 0.60 M☉, the core is either 50:50 C/O to 0.75M⋆ or 20:80 C/O to 0.83M⋆. The fine-structure splitting of R548 is due to slow rotation, and we can duplicate the observed splitting trend and periods if the 213 s mode is k = 2, the model mass is near 0.54 M☉, and the hydrogen layer mass is near 1.5 × 10-4M⋆.}

	abstract = {We present a summary of what is currently known about the three distinct families of isolated pulsating white dwarfs. These are the GW Vir stars (He/C/O-atmosphere stars with Teff ≃ 120,000 K), the V777 Her stars (He-atmosphere, Teff ≃ 25,000 K), and the ZZ Ceti stars (H-atmosphere, Teff ≃ 12,000 K), all showing multiperiodic luminosity variations caused by low-order and low-degree g-mode instabilities. We also provide, in an Appendix, a very brief overview of the newly found evidence in favor of the existence of a fourth category of oscillating white dwarfs bearing strong similarities with these families of pulsators. We begin our survey with a short historical introduction, followed by a general discussion of pulsating white dwarfs as compact pulsators. We then discuss the class properties of these objects, including an updated census. We next focus on the instability domains for each family of pulsators in the log g - Teff diagram, and present their time-averaged properties in more detail. This is followed by a section on excitation physics, i.e., the causes of the pulsational instabilities, with emphasis on the common properties of the different types of pulsator. We then discuss the time-dependent properties of the pulsating white dwarfs featuring, among other things, a brief “picture tour” across the ZZ Ceti instability strip. We next review the methods used to infer or constrain the angular geometry of a pulsation mode in a white dwarf. These include multicolor photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy, the exploitation of the nonlinear features in the observed light curves, and rotational splitting. We also consider basic adiabatic asteroseismology starting with a discussion of the reaction of the period spectrum to variations of model parameters. We next review the various asteroseismological inferences that have so far been claimed for white dwarfs. We also discuss the potential of exploiting the rates of period change. We finally provide some concluding remarks, including a list with several suggestions for future progress in the field.}

    abstract = { Galactic history is written in the white dwarf stars. Their surface properties hint at interiors composed of matter under extreme conditions. In the forty years since their discovery, pulsating white dwarf stars have moved from side-show curiosities to center stage as important tools for unraveling the deep mysteries of the Universe. Innovative observational techniques and theoretical modeling tools have breathed life into precision asteroseismology. We are just learning to use this powerful tool, confronting theoretical models with observed frequencies and their time rate-of-change. With this tool, we calibrate white dwarf cosmochronology; we explore equations of state; we measure stellar masses, rotation rates, and nuclear reaction rates; we explore the physics of interior crystallization; we study the structure of the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, and we test models of dark matter. The white dwarf pulsations are at once the heartbeat of galactic history and a window into unexplored and exotic physics. }

	title = {Pruning The {ELM} Survey: Characterizing Candidate Low-mass White Dwarfs through Photometric Variability},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We assess the photometric variability of nine stars with spectroscopic Teff and log g values from the ELM Survey that locates them near the empirical extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf instability strip. We discover three new pulsating stars: SDSS J135512.34+195645.4, SDSS J173521.69+213440.6, and SDSS J213907.42+222708.9. However, these are among the few ELM Survey objects that do not show radial velocity (RV) variations that confirm the binary nature expected of helium-core white dwarfs. The dominant 4.31 hr pulsation in SDSS J135512.34+195645.4 far exceeds the theoretical cut-off for surface reflection in a white dwarf, and this target is likely a high-amplitude δ Scuti pulsator with an overestimated surface gravity. We estimate the probability to be less than 0.0008 that the lack of measured RV variations in four of eight other pulsating candidate ELM white dwarfs could be due to low orbital inclination. Two other targets exhibit variability as photometric binaries. Partial coverage of the 19.342 hr orbit of WD J030818.19+514011.5 reveals deep eclipses that imply a primary radius >0.4 R⊙—too large to be consistent with an ELM white dwarf. The only object for which our time series photometry adds support to ELM white dwarf classification is SDSS J105435.78−212155.9, which has consistent signatures of Doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations. We conclude that the ELM Survey contains multiple false positives from another stellar population at Teff ≲ 9000 K, possibly related to the sdA stars recently reported from SDSS spectra.}

abstract = {Abstract Cluster analysis is a statistical technique that sorts observations into similar sets or groups. The use of cluster analysis presents a complex challenge because it requires several methodological choices that determine the quality of a cluster solution. This paper chronicles the application of cluster analysis in strategic management research, where the technique has been used since the late 1970s to investigate issues of central importance. Analysis of 45 published strategy studies reveals that the implementation of cluster analysis has been often less than ideal, perhaps detracting from the ability of studies to generate knowledge. Given these findings, suggestions are offered for improving the application of cluster analysis in future inquiry.},

    abstract = "{We report the discovery of 74 new pulsating DA white dwarf stars, or ZZ Cetis, from the data obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission, from Sectors 1 to 39, corresponding to the first 3 cycles. This includes objects from the Southern hemisphere (Sectors 1–13 and 27–39) and the Northern hemisphere (Sectors 14–26), observed with 120 s- and 20 s-cadence. Our sample likely includes 13 low-mass and one extremely low-mass white dwarf candidate, considering the mass determinations from fitting Gaia magnitudes and parallax. In addition, we present follow-up time series photometry from ground-based telescopes for 11 objects, which allowed us to detect a larger number of periods. For each object, we analysed the period spectra and performed an asteroseismological analysis, and we estimate the structure parameters of the sample, i.e. stellar mass, effective temperature, and hydrogen envelope mass. We estimate a mean asteroseismological mass of 〈Msis〉 = 0.635 ± 0.015 M⊙, excluding the candidate low or extremely low-mass objects. This value is in agreement with the mean mass using estimates from Gaia data, which is 〈Mphot〉 = 0.631 ± 0.040 M⊙, and with the mean mass of previously known ZZ Cetis of 〈M*〉 = 0.644 ± 0.034 M⊙. Our sample of 74 new bright ZZ Cetis increases the number of known ZZ Cetis by ∼20 per cent.}",

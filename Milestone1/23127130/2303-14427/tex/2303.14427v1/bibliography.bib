abstract = {“How thick is your light sheet?” is a question that has been asked frequently after talks showing impressive renderings of 3D data acquired by a light-sheet microscope. This question is motivated by the fact that most of the time the thickness of the light-sheet is uniquely associated to the axial resolution of the microscope. However, the link between light-sheet thickness and axial resolution has never been systematically assessed and it is still unclear how both are connected. The question is not trivial because commonly employed measures cannot readily be applied or do not lead to easily interpretable results for the many different types of light sheet. Here, by using simulation data we introduce a set of intuitive measures that helps to define the relationship between light sheet thickness and axial resolution. Unexpectedly, our analysis revealed a trade-off between better axial resolution and thinner light-sheet thickness. Our results are surprising because thicker light-sheets that provide lower image contrast have previously not been associated with better axial resolution. We conclude that classical Gaussian illumination beams should be used when image contrast is most important, and more advanced types of illumination represent a way to optimize axial resolution at the expense of image contrast.},

abstract = {Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has now become a unique tool in different fields ranging from three-dimensional (3D) tissue imaging to real-time functional imaging of neuronal activities. Nevertheless, obtaining high-quality artifact-free images from large, dense and inhomogeneous samples is the main challenge of the method that still needs to be adequately addressed. Here, we demonstrate significant enhancement of LSFM image qualities by using scanning non-diffracting illuminating beams, both through experimental and numerical investigations. The effect of static and scanning illumination with several beams are analyzed and compared, and it is shown that scanning 2D Airy light-sheet is minimally affected by the inhomogeneities in the samples, and provides higher contrasts and uniform resolution over a wide field-of-view, due to its reduced spatial coherence, self-healing feature and longer penetration depth. Further, the capabilities of the illumination scheme is utilized for both single-and double-wavelength 3D imaging of large and dense mammospheres of cancer tumor cells as complex inhomogeneous biological samples.},

Unlike popular wide-field and confocal methods, plane-illumination microscopy limits excitation to the information-rich vicinity of the focal plane, providing effective optical sectioning and high speed while minimizing out-of-focus background and premature photobleaching. Here we used scanned Bessel beams in conjunction with structured illumination and/or two-photon excitation to create thinner light sheets (<0.5 {\`{i}}m) better suited to three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging. As demonstrated by imaging the dynamics of mitochondria, filopodia, membrane ruffles, intracellular vesicles and mitotic chromosomes in live cells, the microscope currently offers 3D isotropic resolution down to ∼0.3 {\`{i}}m, speeds up to nearly 200 image planes per second and the ability to noninvasively acquire hundreds of 3D data volumes from single living cells encompassing tens of thousands of image frames. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

We observed a three-fold average improvement in image quality at 50 $\mu$m depth with the Airy light-sheet. We also used optical clearing to tune the scattering properties of the tissue and found that the improvement when using an Airy light-sheet is greater in the presence of stronger sample-induced aberrations. Finally, we used homogeneous resolution probes in these tissues to quantify absolute depth penetration in cleared samples with each beam type.

abstract = {Multimodal non-linear microscopy combining coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon excited fluorescence has proved to be a versatile and powerful tool enabling the label-free investigation of tissue structure, molecular composition, and correlation with function and disease status. For a routine medical application, the implementation of this approach into an in vivo imaging endoscope is required. However, this is a difficult task due to the requirements of a multicolour ultrashort laser delivery from a compact and robust laser source through a fiber with low losses and temporal synchronization, the efficient signal collection in epi-direction, the need for small-diameter but highly corrected endomicroobjectives of high numerical aperture and compact scanners. Here, we introduce an ultra-compact fiber-scanning endoscope platform for multimodal non-linear endomicroscopy in combination with a compact four-wave mixing based fiber laser. The heart of this fiber-scanning endoscope is an in-house custom-designed, single mode, double clad, double core pure silica fiber in combination with a 2.4 mm diameter NIR-dual-waveband corrected endomicroscopic objective of 0.55 numerical aperture and 180 µm field of view for non-linear imaging, allowing a background free, low-loss, high peak power laser delivery, and an efficient signal collection in backward direction. A linear diffractive optical grating overlays pump and Stokes laser foci across the full field of view, such that diffraction-limited performance is demonstrated for tissue imaging at one frame per second with sub-micron spatial resolution and at a high transmission of 65% from the laser to the specimen using a distal resonant fiber scanner.},

In this Letter we demonstrate the first use of the Airy light beam in optical micromanipulation. Based on the characteristic intensity pattern, the beam drags particles into the main intensity maximum, which guides particles vertically along a parabolic trajectory. This unusual property of Airy beams leads to a new feature in optical micromanipulation - the removal of particles and cells from a section of a sample chamber.

Accelerating optical waves exhibit a number of highly desirable attributes. They move along a curved or accelerating trajectory while being resilient to perturbations (self-healing), and, are diffraction-free.

Previous strategies for designing such accelerating beams rely mainly on caustic methods, which start from diffraction integrals and deal only with two-dimensional fields. Here we introduce an alternate perspective to construct accelerating beams in phase space by designing the corresponding Wigner distribution function (WDF). We find that such a WDF-based method is capable of providing both the initial field distribution and the angular spectrum in need by projecting the WDF into the real space and the Fourier space, respectively. Moreover, this approach applies to the construction of both two- and three-dimensional fields, greatly generalizing previous caustic methods. It may therefore open a new route for construction of highly tailored accelerating beams and facilitate applications ranging from particle manipulation and trapping to optical routing as well as material processing.},

In particular, the ability to image a large field of view at high temporal resolution and with efficient out-of-focus background rejection still raises technical difficulties. Here, we present a novel fiberscope system that provides fast (up to 200 Hz) background-free fluorescence imaging in freely behaving mice over a field of view of diameter 230 {$\mu$}m. The fiberscope is composed of a custom-made multipoint-scanning confocal microscope coupled to the animal with an image guide and a micro-objective. By simultaneously registering a multipoint-scanning confocal image and a conventional widefield image, we subtracted the residual out-of-focus background and provided a background-free confocal image. Illumination and detection pinholes were created using a digital micromirror device, providing high adaptability to the sample structure and imaging conditions. Using this novel imaging tool, we demonstrated fast fluorescence imaging of microvasculature up to 120 {$\mu$}m deep in the mouse cortex, with an out-of-focus background reduced by two orders of magnitude compared with widefield microscopy. Taking advantage of the high acquisition rate (200 Hz), we measured red blood cell velocity in the cortical microvasculature and showed an increase in awake, unrestrained mice compared with anaesthetized animals.},

The controlled reduction of scattering and beam spreading would enable a new illumination concept for light microscopes, particularly for those designed to look deep into scattering tissue. By investigating three different classes of refractive index inhomogeneity, using two large glass spheres, a cluster of smaller spheres and a piece of human skin, respectively, we show that beam self-reconstruction is indeed possible. We demonstrate that a Bessel beam is unexpectedly robust against deflection at objects, and we define measures for self-reconstruction in this context. We present a prototype of a microscope with self-reconstructing beams (MISERB) and show that a holographically shaped, scanned Bessel beam not only reduces scattering artefacts, but also simultaneously increases image quality and penetration depth in dense media. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

However, since its re-discovery, it has started to transform in vivo and increasingly intact organ imaging in a number of areas of biology. This review looks back at the beginning of the method and then the crucial role that modern optical technology, frequently developed for other fields, has played in advancing the instrumentation. This paper will also look at the OpenSPIM route that was developed whereby, through the purchase of a few optical components, researchers have been able to develop their own bespoke instruments and we consider if this may be a route forward for the rapid development of other technological breakthroughs.},

This information has the potential to act as "optical biopsy" to aid clinical decision-making, including the possibility of adopting new paradigms such as a "resect and discard" approach for low-risk lesions. The technologies discussed in this review include confocal laser endomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography, multiphoton microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. These are in different stages of development and clinical readiness, but all show the potential to produce reliable in vivo discrimination of different tissue types. A structured literature search of the imaging techniques for colorectal polyps has been conducted. The significant developments in endoscopic imaging were identified for each modality, and the status of current development was discussed. Of the advanced imaging techniques discussed, confocal laser endomicroscopy is in clinical use and, under optimal conditions with an experienced operator, can provide accurate histological assessment of tissue. The remaining techniques show potential for incorporation into endoscopic equipment and practice, although further component development is needed, followed by robust prospective validation of accuracy. Optical coherence tomography illustrates tissue "texture" well and gives good assessment of mucosal thickness and layers. Multiphoton microscopy produces high-resolution images at a subcellular resolution. Raman spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging are less developed endoscopically but provide a tissue "fingerprint" which can distinguish between tissue types. Molecular imaging may become a powerful adjunct to other techniques, with its ability to precisely label specific molecules within tissue and thereby enhance imaging.},

These applications mostly serve as a quality check of the built system, but do not answer a specific biomedical research question.

Fluorescence images with histology-like quality can be collected instantaneously from the epithelium of hollow organs. Currently, scanning is performed at the proximal end of probe-based instruments used routinely in the clinic, and flexibility to control the focus is limited. We demonstrate use of a parametric resonance scanner packaged in the distal end of the endomicroscope to perform high speed lateral deflections. An aperture was etched in the center of the reflector to fold the optical path. This design reduced the dimensions of the instrument to 2.4~mm diameter and 10~mm length, allowing for forward passage through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope. A compact lens assembly provides lateral and axial resolution of 1.1 and 13.6~{$\mu$}m, respectively. A working distance of 0~{$\mu$}m and field-of-view of 250~{$\mu$}m \texttimes{} 250~{$\mu$}m was achieved at frame rates up to 20~Hz. Excitation at 488~nm was delivered to excite fluorescein, an FDA-approved dye, to generate high tissue contrast. The endomicroscope was reprocessed using a clinically-approved sterilization method for 18 cycles without failure. Fluorescence images were collected during routine colonoscopy from normal colonic mucosa, tubular adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's colitis. Individual cells, including colonocytes, goblet cells, and inflammatory cells, could be identified. Mucosal features, such as crypt structures, crypt lumens, and lamina propria, could be distinguished. This instrument has potential to be used as an accessory during routine medical endoscopy.},

It allows for the illumination of the biological sample with fiber-coupled LED light at 455 nm and the imaging of the red-shifted fluorescence light above 500 nm in epi-direction. A large numerical aperture of 0.7 leads to a sub-cellular resolution and yields to high-contrast images within a field of view of 160 \textmu m.

  abstract = {Light-sheet microscopy facilitates rapid, high-contrast, volumetric imaging with minimal sample exposure. However, the rapid divergence of a traditional Gaussian light sheet restricts the field of view (FOV) that provides innate subcellular resolution. We show that the Airy beam innately yields high contrast and resolution up to a tenfold larger FOV. In contrast to the Bessel beam, which also provides an increased FOV, the Airy beam's characteristic asymmetric excitation pattern results in all fluorescence contributing positively to the contrast, enabling a step change for light-sheet microscopy. \textcopyright{} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

  abstract = {We developed a miniaturized two-photon microscope (MINI2P) for fast, high-resolution, multiplane calcium imaging of over 1,000 neurons at a time in freely moving mice. With a microscope weight below 3 g and a highly flexible connection cable, MINI2P allowed stable imaging with no impediment of behavior in a variety of assays compared to untethered, unimplanted animals. The improved cell yield was achieved through a optical system design featuring an enlarged field of view (FOV) and a microtunable lens with increased z-scanning range and speed that allows fast and stable imaging of multiple interleaved planes, as well as 3D functional imaging. Successive imaging across multiple, adjacent FOVs enabled recordings from more than 10,000 neurons in the same animal. Large-scale proof-of-principle data were obtained from cell populations in visual cortex, medial entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, revealing spatial tuning of cells in all areas.},

    "abstract": "Lieb lattice is one of the simplest bipartite lattices where compact localized states (CLS) are observed. This type of localisation is induced by the peculiar topology of the unit cell, where the modes are localized only on one sublattice due to the destructive interference of partial waves. The CLS exist in the absence of defects and are associated with the flat bands in the dispersion relation. The Lieb lattices were successfully implemented as optical lattices or photonic crystals. This work demonstrates the possibility of magnonic Lieb lattice realization where the flat bands and CLS can be observed in the planar structure of sub-micron in-plane sizes. Using forward volume configuration, we investigated numerically (using the finite element method) the Ga-dopped YIG layer with cylindrical inclusions (without Ga content) arranged in a Lieb lattice of the period 250 nm. We tailored the structure to observe, for the few lowest magnonic bands, the oscillatory and evanescent spin waves in inclusions and matrix, respectively. Such a design reproduces the Lieb lattice of nodes (inclusions) coupled to each other by the matrix with the CLS in flat bands.",

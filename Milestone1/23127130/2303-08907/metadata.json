    "abstract": "The worldline formalism has previously been used for deriving compact master formulas for the QED $N$ - photon amplitudes in vacuum, in a constant field and in a plane-wave field. Here we carry this program one step further by deriving master formulas for the scalar and spinor QED $N$-photon amplitudes in the background of the \"parallel\" special case of a combined constant and plane-wave field.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven surrogate models of dynamical systems based on the extended dynamic mode decomposition are nowadays well-established and widespread in applications. Further, for non-holonomic systems exhibiting a multiplicative coupling between states and controls, the usage of bi-linear surrogate models has proven beneficial. However, an in-depth analysis of the approximation quality and its dependence on different hyperparameters based on both simulation and experimental data is still missing. We investigate a differential-drive mobile robot to close this gap and provide first guidelines on the systematic design of data-efficient surrogate models.",

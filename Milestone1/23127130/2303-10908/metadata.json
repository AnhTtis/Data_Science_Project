    "abstract": "Racialized economic segregation, a key metric that simultaneously accounts for spatial, social and income polarization, has been linked to adverse health outcomes, including morbidity and mortality; however, statistical methods for measuring the association between racialized economic segregation and health outcomes are not well-developed and are usually studied at the individual level. In this paper we propose a two-stage Bayesian statistical framework that provides a broad, flexible approach to studying the spatially varying association between premature mortality and racialized economic segregation, while accounting for neighborhood-level latent health factors across US counties. We apply our method by using data from three sources: (1) the CDC WONDER, (2) the County Health Rankings, and (3) the Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project. Findings from our study show that the posterior estimates of latent health factors clearly demonstrate geographical patterning across US counties. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of accounting for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in racialized economic segregation measures, in health equity focused settings.",

A finite topology $\mathcal{T} = (A, T)$ consists of a finite set $A$ together
with a family $T$ of subsets of $A$, the open sets, satisfying the axioms of a topology. $\mathcal{T}_{\phi}(n)$ is the number of distinct topolgies $T$ of subsets
of $[n]$ which satisfy $\phi$, where $\phi$ is a property of topologies expressible
in $\TMSOL$, topological monadic second order logic.

A sequence $s(n)$ of integers is C-finite if it satisfies a linear recurrence
relation with constant coefficients. It is MC-finite of for every modulus $m$
the sequence $s^m(n) = s(n) \pmod{m}$ satisfies a linear recurrence
relation with constant coefficients depending in $m$. In general $\mathcal{T}_{\phi}(n)$ is not C-finite, because it grows too fast.

In this paper we show that $\mathcal{T}_{\phi}(n)$ is MC-finite for every
$\phi \in \TMSOL$. We also show that this is still true for $\TCMSOL$, the extensions of
$\TMSOL$ with modular counting quantifiers.

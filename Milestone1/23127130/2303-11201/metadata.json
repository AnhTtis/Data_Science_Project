    "abstract": "Three-nucleon forces are crucial for the accurate description of nuclear systems, including dense matter probed in neutron stars. We explore nuclear Hamiltonians that reproduce two-nucleon scattering data and properties of light nuclei, but differ in the three-nucleon interactions among neutrons. While no significantly improved constraints can be obtained from current astrophysical data, we show that observations of neutron star mergers by next-generation detectors like the proposed Einstein Telescope could provide strong evidence to distinguish between these Hamiltonians.",

    "abstract": "A perfect Kagome lattice features flat bands that usually lead to strong electronic correlation effects, but how electronic correlation, in turn, stabilizes a perfect Kagome lattice has rarely been explored. Here, we study such effect in a superconducting ($T_c \\sim 7.8$ K) Kagome metal LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ with a distorted Kagome plane consisting of pure Ru ions, using density functional theory plus $U$ and plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that increasing electronic correlation can stabilize a perfect Kagome lattice and induce substantial ferromagnetic fluctuations in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$. By comparing the calculated magnetic susceptibilities to experimental data, LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is found to be on the verge of becoming a perfect Kagome lattice. It thus shows moderate but non-negligible electronic correlations and ferromagnetic fluctuations, which are crucial to understanding the experimentally observed non-Fermi-liquid behavior and the pretty high superconducting $T_c$ of LaRu$_3$Si$_2$.",

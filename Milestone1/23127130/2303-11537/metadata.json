    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method that enables the interactive geometry editing for neural radiance fields manipulation. We use two cages(inner cage and outer cage) to enable editing of a scene. Various operations are applicable to the two cages. Operations on the inner cage lead to desired deformation of inner cage and adjustment of the outer cage. Operations on the outer cage lead to deformation without changing the rest space. Users can editing the scene with translation, rotation, scaling or any combination of these. And the operations on the corners and edges of the cage are also supported. Our method does not need any explicit 3D geometry representations. The interactive geometry editing applies directly to the implicit neural radiance fields. The deformation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

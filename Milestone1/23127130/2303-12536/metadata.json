    "abstract": "Blockchain, the backbone of Bitcoin, has recently gained a lot of attention. Blockchain functions as an immutable record that enables decentralized transactions. Blockchain-based applications are sprouting up in a variety of industries, including financial services, reputation systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT), among others. However, many hurdles of blockchain technology, including scalability and security issues, have to be overcome. Many industries, including finance, medicine, manufacturing, and education, use blockchain applications to capitalize on this technology's unique set of properties. Blockchain technology (BT) has the potential to improve trustworthiness, collaboration, organization, identity, credibility, and transparency. We provide an overview of blockchain architecture, various different kinds of blockchain as well as information about the Decentralized apps which are also known as Dapps. This paper provides an in-depth look at blockchain technology",

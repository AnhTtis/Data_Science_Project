@unpublished{LLR22,
	abstract = {We consider a model for two types (bath and tracers) of 2D quantum particles in a perpendicular magnetic field. Interactions are short range and inter-species, and we assume that the bath particles are fermions, all lying in the lowest Landau level of the magnetic field. Heuristic arguments then indicate that, if the tracers are strongly coupled to the bath, they effectively change their quantum statistics, from bosonic to fermionic or vice-versa. We rigorously compute the energy of a natural trial state, indeed exhibiting this phenomenon of statistics transmutation. The proof involves estimates for the characteristic polynomial of the Ginibre ensemble of random matrices.},

	abstract = {We prove that multiplicative chaos measures can be constructed from extreme level sets or thick points of the underlying logarithmically correlated field. We develop a method which covers the whole subcritical phase and only requires asymptotics of suitable exponential moments for the field. As an application, we establish these estimates hold for the logarithm of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of a Haar distributed random unitary matrix (CUE), using known asymptotics for Toeplitz determinant with (merging) Fisher-Hartwig singularities. Hence, this proves a conjecture of Fyodorov and Keating concerning the fluctuations of the volume of thick points of the CUE characteristic polynomial.},

@unpublished{Forrester_review,
	abstract = {The Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) consists of $N \times N$ random matrices with independent complex standard Gaussian entries. This was introduced in 1965 by Ginbre, who showed that the eigenvalues form a determinantal point process with an explicit correlation kernel, and after scaling they are supported on the unit disk with constant density. For some time now it has been appreciated that GinUE has a fundamental place within random matrix theory, both for its applications and for the richness of its theory. Here we review the progress on a number of themes relating to the study of GinUE. These are eigenvalue probability density functions and correlation functions, fluctuation formulas, sum rules and asymptotic behaviours of correlation functions, and normal matrix models. We discuss too applications in quantum many body physics and quantum chaos, and give an account of some statistical properties of the eigenvectors.},

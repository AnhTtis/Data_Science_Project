    "abstract": "Blast furnace modeling and control is one of the important problems in the industrial field, and the black-box model is an effective mean to describe the complex blast furnace system. In practice, there are often different learning targets, such as safety and energy saving in industrial applications, depending on the application. For this reason, this paper proposes a framework to design a domain knowledge integrated classification model that yields a classifier for industrial application. Our knowledge incorporated learning scheme allows the users to create a classifier that identifies \"important samples\" (whose misclassifications can lead to severe consequences) more correctly, while keeping the proper precision of classifying the remaining samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by two real blast furnace datasets, which guides the operators to utilize their prior experience for controlling the blast furnace systems better.",

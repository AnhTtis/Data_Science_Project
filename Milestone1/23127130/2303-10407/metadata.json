    "abstract": "In the category of log schemes, it is unclear how to define the blow-ups for non-strict closed immersions. In this article, we introduce the notion of divided log spaces. We obtain the category of divided log spaces by locally inverting log blow-ups in the category of log schemes. We show that blow-ups exist for closed immersions of log smooth divided log spaces. This is an ingredient of the motivic six-functor formalism for log schemes.",

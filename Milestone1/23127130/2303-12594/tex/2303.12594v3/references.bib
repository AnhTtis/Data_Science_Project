We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this.},

abstract = {One of the central elements in systems biology is the interaction between mathematical modeling and measured quantities. Typically, biological phenomena are represented as dynamical systems, and they are further analyzed and comprehended by identifying model parameters using experimental data. However, all model parameters cannot be found by gradient-based optimization methods by fitting the model to the experimental data due to the non-differentiable character of the problem. Here, we present POPI4SB, a Python-based framework for population-based parameter identification of dynamic models in systems biology. The code is built on top of PySCeS that provides an engine to run dynamic simulations. The idea behind the methodology is to provide a set of derivative-free optimization methods that utilize a population of candidate solutions to find a better solution iteratively. Additionally, we propose two surrogate-assisted population-based methods, namely, a combination of a k-nearest-neighbor regressor with the Reversible Differential Evolution and the Evolution of Distribution Algorithm, that speeds up convergence. We present the optimization framework on the example of the well-studied glycolytic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

@inproceedings{Cheney2014,
abstract = {The embodied cognition paradigm emphasizes that both bodies and brains combine to produce complex behaviors, in contrast to the traditional view that the only seat of intelligence is the brain. Despite recent excitement about embodied cognition, brains and bodies remain thought of, and implemented as, two separate entities that merely interface with one another to carry out their respective roles. Previous research co-evolving bodies and brains has simulated the physics of bodies that collect sensory information and pass that information on to disembodied neural networks, which then processes that information and return motor commands. Biological animals, in contrast, produce behavior through physically embedded control structures and a complex and continuous interplay between neural and mechanical forces. In addition to the electrical pulses flowing through the physical wiring of the nervous system, the heart elegantly combines control with actuation, as the physical properties of the tissue itself (or defects therein) determine the actuation of the organ. Inspired by these phenomena from cardiac electrophysiology (the study of the electrical properties of heart tissue), we introduce electrophysiological robots, whose behavior is dictated by electrical signals flowing though the tissue cells of soft robots. Here we describe these robots and how they are evolved. Videos and images of these robots reveal lifelike behaviors despite the added challenge of having physically embedded control structures. We also provide an initial experimental investigation into the impact of different implementation decisions, such as alternatives for sensing, actuation, and locations of central pattern generators. Overall, this paper provides a first step towards removing the chasm between bodies and brains to encourage further research into physically realistic embodied cognition.},

abstract = {Twelve cultivars and 10 F6-derived breeding lines of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and two cultivars of purple clover (T. purpureum) were screened in the field for their response to clover scorch disease caused by race 2 of Kabatiella caulivora that is restricted in distribution in Western Australia but is generally more virulent than race 1. Two of the cultivars (viz. Coolamon subterranean clover and Electra purple clover), and the breeding line SL031 showed outstanding resistance, with disease scores significantly lower than the resistant cultivar Denmark that had a disease score of 3.3 (010 scale with 0 ≤ no disease and 10 ≤ death of all plants). A further two cultivars (viz. Goulburn, and Karridale) and four of the breeding lines (viz. SL019, SL027, SL029 and SM033) had similar levels of resistance to Denmark. Host responses to race 2 were compared with those against race 1 of K. caulivora. Genotypes, such as SL029 and SL031, with combined resistances to both races of K. caulivora were identified, and their potential for effective management of K. caulivora, in areas where both races occur, highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2009 Australasian Plant Pathology Society.},

abstract = {Science instructors from a wide range of disciplines agree that hands-on laboratory components of courses are pedagogically necessary (Freedman, 1997). However, certain shortcomings of current laboratory exercises have been pointed out by several authors (Mataric, 2004; Hofstein and Lunetta, 2004). The overarching theme of these analyses is that hands-on components of courses tend to be formulaic, closed-ended, and at times outdated. To address these issues, we envision a novel platform that is not only a didactic tool but is also an experimental testbed for users to play with different ideas in evolutionary robotics (Nolfi and Floreano, 2000), neural networks, physical simulation, 3D printing, mechanical assembly, and embedded processing. Here, we introduce RoboGenTM: an open-source software and hardware platform designed for the joint evolution of robot morphologies and controllers a la Sims (1994); Lipson and Pollack (2000); Bongard and Pfeifer (2003). Robo-Gen has been designed specifically to allow evolved robots to be easily manufactured via widely available desktop 3D printers, and the use of simple, open-source, low-cost, offthe- shelf electronic components. RoboGen features an evolution engine complete with a physics simulator, as well as utilities both for generating design files of body components for 3D printing, and for compiling neural-network controllers to run on an Arduino microcontroller board. In this paper, we describe the RoboGen platform, and provide some metrics to assess the success of using it as the hands-on component of a masters-level bio-inspired artificial intelligence course.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract = {Essential behaviours such as walking or breathing are rhythmic, that is, characterised by repetitive activation of muscles in a specific temporal sequence. A basic version of the underlying neural activity is generated in the central nervous system by networks called central pattern generators (CPGs). CPGs can produce these patterns even in the absence of inputs that carry specific timing information. The core rhythmic activity can be based on intrinsic oscillatory properties of pacemaker neurons or emerge from the synaptic connectivity of nonoscillatory neurons. In both cases, other neurons are recruited into this rhythmic activity to generate a whole pattern. Neuronal and synaptic properties underlying the precise temporal patterning of sequential bursting activity are shaped by neuromodulators to generate different versions of motor patterns. The circuitry controlling rhythmic behaviours of a whole animal is organised in modules that control different body parts and can be coordinated in different ways to generate different behaviours.},

abstract = {Phototaxis in the broadest sense means positive or negative displacement along a light gradient or vector. Prokaryotes most often use a biased random walk strategy, employing type I sensory rhodopsin photoreceptors and two-component signalling to regulate flagellar reversal. This strategy only allows phototaxis along steep light gradients, as found in microbial mats or sediments. Some filamentous cyanobacteria evolved the ability to steer towards a light vector. Even these cyanobacteria, however, can only navigate in two dimensions, gliding on a surface. In contrast, eukaryotes evolved the capacity to follow a light vector in three dimensions in open water. This strategy requires a polarized organism with a stable form, helical swimming with cilia and a shading or focusing body adjacent to a light sensor to allow for discrimination of light direction. Such arrangement and the ability of three-dimensional phototactic navigation evolved at least eight times independently in eukaryotes. The origin of three-dimensional phototaxis often followed a transition from a benthic to a pelagic lifestyle and the acquisition of chloroplasts either via primary or secondary endosymbiosis. Based on our understanding of the mechanism of phototaxis in single-celled eukaryotes and animal larvae, it is possible to define a series of elementary evolutionary steps, each of potential selective advantage, which can lead to pelagic phototactic navigation. We can conclude that it is relatively easy to evolve phototaxis once cell polarity, ciliary swimming and a stable cell shape are present. This journal is {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Whether, when, how, and why increased complexity evolves in biological populations is a longstanding open question. In this work we combine a recently developed method for evolving virtual organisms with an information-theoretic metric of morphological complexity in order to investigate how the complexity of morphologies, which are evolved for locomotion, varies across different environments. We first demonstrate that selection for locomotion results in the evolution of organisms with morphologies that increase in complexity over evolutionary time beyond what would be expected due to random chance. This provides evidence that the increase in complexity observed is a result of a driven rather than a passive trend. In subsequent experiments we demonstrate that morphologies having greater complexity evolve in complex environments, when compared to a simple environment when a cost of complexity is imposed. This suggests that in some niches, evolution may act to complexify the body plans of organisms while in other niches selection favors simpler body plans. {\textcopyright} 2014 Auerbach, Bongard.},

abstract = {The intertwined processes of learning and evolution in complex environmental niches have resulted in a remarkable diversity of morphological forms. Moreover, many aspects of animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these evolved morphologies. However, the principles governing relations between environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of intelligent control, remain elusive, because performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning is challenging. Here, we introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, we demonstrate a morphological Baldwin effect i.e., in our simulations evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the descendants lifetime. Third, we suggest a mechanistic basis for the above relationships through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.},

This paper explores the effects of learning combined with a genetic algorithm to evolve control system parameters for a four-legged robot. Here, learning corresponds to the application of a local search algorithm on individuals during evolution. Two types of learning were implemented and tested, i.e. Baldwinian and Lamarckian learning. On the direct results from evolution in simulation, Lamarckian learning showed promising results, with a significant increase in final fitness compared with the results from evolution without learning. Further experiments with learning on the real robot demonstrated an efficient adaptation of the robot gait to the real world environment, and increased the performance to the level measured in simulation. This paper demonstrates that Lamarckian evolution is effective in improving the performance of robot controller evolution, and that the same learning process on the physical robot efficiently reduces the negative impact of the simulation-reality gap.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {Despite the recent successes in robotic locomotion control, the design of robots, i.e., the design of their body structure, still heavily relies on human engineering. Automatic robot design has been a long studied subject, however, progress has been slow due to large combinatorial search space and the difficulty to efficiently evaluate the candidate structures. Note that one needs to both, search over many possible body structures, and choose among them based on how the robot with that structure performs in an environment. The latter means training an optimal controller given a candidate structure, which in itself is costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose Neural Graph Evolution (NGE), which performs evolutionary search in graph space, by iteratively evolving graph structures using simple mutation primitives. Key to our approach is to parameterize the control policies with graph neural networks, which allows us to transfer skills from previously evaluated designs during the graph search. This significantly reduces evaluation cost of new candidates and makes the search process orders of magnitude more efficient than that of past work. In addition, NGE applies Graph Mutation with Uncertainty (GM-UC) by incorporating model uncertainty, which reduces the search space by balancing exploration and exploitation. We show that NGE significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of convergence rate and final performance. As shown in experiments, NGE is the first algorithm that can automatically discover kinematically preferred robotic graph structures, such as a fish with two symmetric flat side-fins and a tail, or a cheetah with athletic front and back legs. NGE is extremely efficient, it finds plausible robotic structures within a day on a single 64 CPU-core Amazon EC2 machine.},

abstract = {The importance of bird song in sexual selection and the widespread existence of geographical variation in song has raised the question of whether dialects can promote the evolution of new, reproductively isolated, subgroups. However, the effect of song learning on the relation between song divergence and gene flow is still poorly understood. We explored the origin and maintenance of song divergence and its consequences for male dispersal between populations. To do this, we used a spatially explicit model to study the effect of vocal learning mode (predispersal and postdispersal) and the role of intrasexual selection among males. The majority of scenarios simulated in the model led to significant genetic and phenotypic song divergence, consistent with the widespread occurrence of dialects in natural populations. Intrasexual selection in the form of male exclusion, dependent on song matching between neighbours, was an efficient mechanism driving song divergence. Most importantly, song learning was decisive in causing an incongruence of genetic divergence and song divergence between populations. As a consequence, song learning often prevented the expected negative relation between the degree of song divergence and dispersal. These findings may help to interpret empirical data on song divergence and gene flow and provide qualitative and testable predictions for conditions under which intraspecific song variation may promote reproductive divergence and speciation.

The first solution representation (SR-1) is a (n + 2m)-dimensional particle for CVRP with n customers and m vehicles. The decoding method for this representation starts with the transformation of particle into a priority list of customer to enter route and a priority matrix of vehicle to serve each customer. The vehicle routes are then constructed based on the customer priority list and vehicle priority matrix. The second representation (SR-2) is a 3m-dimensional particle. The decoding method for this representation starts with the transformation of particle into the vehicle orientation points and the vehicle coverage radius. The vehicle routes are constructed based on these points and radius. The proposed representations are applied using GLNPSO, a PSO algorithm with multiple social learning structures, and tested using some benchmark problems. The computational result shows that representation SR-2 is better than representation SR-1 and also competitive with other methods for solving CVRP. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently, genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique have attracted considerable attention among various modern heuristic optimization techniques. The GA has been popular in academia and the industry mainly because of its intuitiveness, ease of implementation, and the ability to effectively solve highly non-linear, mixed integer optimization problems that are typical of complex engineering systems. PSO technique is a relatively recent heuristic search method whose mechanics are inspired by the swarming or collaborative behavior of biological populations. Since the two approaches are supposed to find a solution to a given objective function but employ different strategies and computational effort, it is appropriate to compare their performance. This paper presents the application and performance comparison of PSO and GA optimization techniques, for flexible ac transmission system (FACTS)-based controller design. The design objective is to enhance the power system stability. The design problem of the FACTS-based controller is formulated as an optimization problem and both PSO and GA optimization techniques are employed to search for optimal controller parameters. The performance of both optimization techniques in terms of computational effort, computational time and convergence rate is compared. Further, the optimized controllers are tested on a weakly connected power system subjected to different disturbances over a wide range of loading conditions and parameter variations and their performance is compared with the conventional power system stabilizer (CPSS). The eigenvalue analysis and non-linear simulation results are presented and compared to show the effectiveness of both the techniques in designing a FACTS-based controller, to enhance power system stability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Job shop scheduling is well-known as one of the hardest combinatorial optimization problems and has been demonstrated to be NP-hard problem. In the past decades, several researchers have devoted their effort to develop evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for job shop scheduling problem. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is a more recent evolutionary algorithm which has been widely applied and shown its strength in many application areas. However, the applications of DE on scheduling problems are still limited. This paper proposes a one-stage differential evolution algorithm (1ST-DE) for job shop scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm employs random key representation and permutation of m-job repetition to generate active schedules. The performance of proposed method is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems and compared with results from an existing PSO algorithm. The numerical results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is able to provide good solutions especially for the large size problems with relatively fast computing time.},

year = {2009},
isbn = {9781424429585},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as navigating rough terrain,
but the design of their control software is both challenging and laborious. Traditional
evolutionary algorithms can produce these controllers, but require manual decomposition
or other problem simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have
trouble taking advantage of a problem's regularities and symmetries. Such active intervention
is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and requires the user
to possess a deep understanding of the problem's structure. This paper demonstrates
that HyperNEAT, a new and promising generative encoding for evolving neural networks,
can evolve quadruped gaits without an engineer manually decomposing the problem. Analyses
suggest that HyperNEAT is successful because it employs a generative encoding that
can more easily reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary
algorithms that exploits a problem's geometric symmetries, which may aid its performance.
We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and find that HyperNEAT
is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative
analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals are more holistically affected by genetic
operators, resulting in better leg coordination. Overall, the results suggest that
HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex, yet regular,
devices, such as robots.},

abstract = {Real world systems with unknown dynamics, uncertainties and disturbances pose a great challenge in developing control schemes. As a consequence, conventional controllers cannot be used for such nonlinear systems acted upon uncertainties. Hence, more advanced techniques such as robust control to mitigate disturbances and uncertainties, adaptive control using neural networks to learn unknown dynamics, and robust adaptive control to mitigate unknown dynamics and uncertainties have been introduced in the past decade. As a first step, the unknown system dynamics have to be constructed using online approximates such as neural networks and then controllers have to be designed. In this chapter, estimation or system identification and control using neural networks is thoroughly investigated. To begin with, some basic concepts on the neural networks are introduced, and then some stability properties are proposed for a general class of nonlinear discretetime systems. Later, the development of nonlinear estimation techniques for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems is introduced. Finally, neural networks control strategies are presented for controlling a class of nonlinear discrete-time system. Rigorous mathematical results for asymptotic stability on the estimation and control scheme are demonstrated. Additionally, some simulation examples are used to illustrate the performance of the estimation and control schemes, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer London.},

@article{Thor2019,
abstract = {In this letter, we present an online learning mechanism called the dual integral learner for fast frequency adaptation in neural central pattern generator (CPG) based locomotion control of a hexapod robot. The mechanism works by modulating the CPG frequency through synaptic plasticity of the neural CPG network. The modulation is based on tracking error feedback between the CPG output and joint angle sensory feedback of the hexapod robot. As a result, the mechanism will always try to match the CPG frequency to the walking performance of the robot, thereby ensuring that the entire generated trajectory can be followed with low tracking error. Real robot experiments show that our mechanism can automatically generate a proper walking frequency for energy-efficient locomotion with respect to the robot body as well as being able to quickly adapt the frequency online within a few seconds to deal with external perturbations such as leg blocking and a variation in electrical power. These important features will allow a hexapod robot to be more robust and also extend its operating time. Finally, the generality of the mechanism is shown by successfully applying it to a compliant robotic manipulator arm called GummiArm.},

abstract = {The complexity associated with musculoskeletal modeling, simulation, and neural control of the human spine is a challenging problem in the field of biomechanics. This paper presents a novel method for simulation of a 3D trunk model under control of 48 muscle actuators. Central pattern generators (CPG) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used simultaneously to generate muscles activation patterns. The parameters of the ANN are updated based on a novel learning method used to address the kinetic redundancy due to presence of 48 muscles driving the trunk. We demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method with numerical simulation of experiments involving rhythmic motion between upright standing and 55 degrees of flexion. The tracking performance of the model is accurate to within 2 while reciprocal muscle activation patterns were similar to the observed experimental coordination patterns in normal subjects. The suggested method can be used to map high-level control strategies to low-level control signals in complex biomechanical and biorobotic systems. This will also provide insight about underlying neural control mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2011 {IEEE}.},

abstract = {Models are among the most essential tools in robotics, such as kinematics and dynamics models of the robot's own body and controllable external objects. It is widely believed that intelligent mammals also rely on internal models in order to generate their actions. However, while classical robotics relies on manually generated models that are based on human insights into physics, future autonomous, cognitive robots need to be able to automatically generate models that are based on information which is extracted from the data streams accessible to the robot. In this paper, we survey the progress in model learning with a strong focus on robot control on a kinematic as well as dynamical level. Here, a model describes essential information about the behavior of the environment and the influence of an agent on this environment. In the context of model-based learning control, we view the model from three different perspectives. First, we need to study the different possible model learning architectures for robotics. Second, we discuss what kind of problems these architecture and the domain of robotics imply for the applicable learning methods. From this discussion, we deduce future directions of real-time learning algorithms. Third, we show where these scenarios have been used successfully in several case studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag.},

Besides, with the aid of the minimal learning parameter technique, only one parameter needs to be updated online regardless of the system input-output dimension and the number of neural network nodes.

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics (ER) is often viewed as the application of a family of black-box optimization algorithms-evolutionary algorithms-to the design of robots, or parts of robots. When considering ER as black-box optimization, the selective pressure is mainly driven by a user-defined, black-box fitness function, and a domain-independent selection procedure. However, most ER experiments face similar challenges in similar setups: the selective pressure, and, in particular, the fitness function, is not a pure user-defined black box. The present review shows that, because ER experiments share common features, selective pressures for ER are a subject of research on their own. The literature has been split into two categories: goal refiners, aimed at changing the definition of a good solution, and process helpers, designed to help the search process. Two sub-categories are further considered: task-specific approaches, which require knowledge on how to solve the task and task-agnostic ones, which do not need it. Besides highlighting the diversity of the approaches and their respective goals, the present review shows that many task-agnostic process helpers have been proposed during the last years, thus bringing us closer to the goal of a fully automated robot behavior design process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This survey article focuses on the extreme other end of the spectrum: how can a robot adapt with only a handful of trials (a dozen) and a few minutes? By analogy with the word "big-data", we refer to this challenge as "micro-data reinforcement learning". We show that a first strategy is to leverage prior knowledge on the policy structure (e.g., dynamic movement primitives), on the policy parameters (e.g., demonstrations), or on the dynamics (e.g., simulators). A second strategy is to create data-driven surrogate models of the expected reward (e.g., Bayesian optimization) or the dynamical model (e.g., model-based policy search), so that the policy optimizer queries the model instead of the real system. Overall, all successful micro-data algorithms combine these two strategies by varying the kind of model and prior knowledge. The current scientific challenges essentially revolve around scaling up to complex robots (e.g., humanoids), designing generic priors, and optimizing the computing time.},

The inverse-dynamics model is acquired by heterosynaptic plasticity using feedback motor command (torque) as an error signal. In this paper, we apply hierarchical arrangement of the transcortical loop and the inverse-dynamics model for learning trajectory control of an industrial robotic manipulator. Although neither strict modeling of the manipulator nor precise parameter estimation was required, the control performance by the neural-network model improved gradually during 30 minutes of learning. Once the neural-network model learned to control some movement, it could control quite different and faster movements. That is, the neural-network model has capability to generalize learned movements. Advantages of the neural-network control over conventional control methods are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Control of insect walking can be considered hierarchical and modular. The brain determines onset, direction, and speed of walking. Coordination is done locally in the ganglia that control leg movements. Typically, networks of neurons capable of generating alternating contractions of antagonistic muscles (termed central pattern generators, or CPGs) control the stepping movements of individual legs. The legs are coordinated by interactions between the CPGs and sensory feedback from the moving legs. This peripheral feedback provides information about leg load, position, velocity, and acceleration, as well as information about joint angles and foot contact. In addition, both the central pattern generators and the sensory information that feeds them may be modulated or adjusted according to circumstances. Consequently, locomotion in insects is extraordinarily robust and adaptable.},

abstract = {Animal's rhythmic movements such as locomotion are considered to be controlled by neural circuits called central pattern generators (CPGs). This article presents a reinforcement learning (RL) method for a CPG controller, which is inspired by the control mechanism of animals. Because the CPG controller is an instance of recurrent neural networks, a naive application of RL involves difficulties. In addition, since state and action spaces of controlled systems are very large in real problems such as robot control, the learning of the value function is also difficult. In this study, we propose a learning scheme for a CPG controller called a CPG-actor-critic model, whose learning algorithm is based on a policy gradient method. We apply our RL method to autonomous acquisition of biped locomotion by a biped robot simulator. Computer simulations show our method is able to train a CPG controller such that the learning process is stable.},

abstract = {We address the problem of foothold selection in robotic legged locomotion over very rough terrain. The difficulty of the problem we address here is comparable to that of human rock-climbing, where foot/hand-hold selection is one of the most critical aspects. Previous work in this domain typically involves defining a reward function over footholds as a weighted linear combination of terrain features. However, a significant amount of effort needs to be spent in designing these features in order to model more complex decision functions, and hand-tuning their weights is not a trivial task. We propose the use of terrain templates, which are discretized height maps of the terrain under a foothold on different length scales, as an alternative to manually designed features. We describe an algorithm that can simultaneously learn a small set of templates and a foothold ranking function using these templates, from expert-demonstrated footholds. Using the LittleDog quadruped robot, we experimentally show that the use of terrain templates can produce complex ranking functions with higher performance than standard terrain features, and improved generalization to unseen terrain. {\textcopyright} 2009 {IEEE}.},

abstract = {This paper describes a biologically-inspired control architecture for the McKibben actuated limbs of a humanoid robot. The antagonistically driven joints are actuated using a biological control model observed in the measurement of human muscle electromyograms (EMG) during reaching movements in the vertical plane. The paradigm uses the summation of tonic and phasic EMG signals to activate the human muscles. The humanoid robot's muscles, actuated by pressure control, are controlled with feedforward pressure patterns analogous to the tonic and phasic activation in the human model. Proprioceptive feedback is utilized in the control architecture to correct for misperceived loading conditions and time variance of the actuators. The control architecture, initial experimental results, and experiments are discussed in this paper. A result of this control paradigm is the realization of actuation with lower stiffness and therefore safer operation for human-humanoid interaction. It is expected that such a motion of the humanoid will closely resemble human motion and will facilitate a more human-friendly human-robot interaction.},

abstract = {While it is well-known that model can enhance the control performance in terms of precision or energy efficiency, the practical application has often been limited by the complexities of manually obtaining sufficiently accurate models. In the past, learning has proven a viable alternative to using a combination of rigid-body dynamics and handcrafted approximations of nonlinearities. However, a major open question is what nonparametric learning method is suited best for learning dynamics? Traditionally, locally weighted projection regression (LWPR), has been the standard method as it is capable of online, real-time learning for very complex robots. However, while LWPR has had significant impact on learning in robotics, alternative nonparametric regression methods such as support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) offer interesting alternatives with fewer open parameters and potentially higher accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate these three alternatives for model learning. Our comparison consists out of the evaluation of learning quality for each regression method using original data from SARCOS robot arm, as well as the robot tracking performance employing learned models. The results show that GPR and SVR achieve a superior learning precision and can be applied for real-time control obtaining higher accuracy. However, for the online learning LWPR presents the better method due to its lower computational requirements.},

This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to 1.5 cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment.

abstract = {Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are becoming a popular model for the control of locomotion of legged robots. Biological CPGs are neural networks responsible for the generation of rhythmic movements, especially locomotion. In robotics, a systematic way of designing such CPGs as artificial neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators with sensory feedback inclusion is still missing. In this contribution, we present a way of designing CPGs with coupled oscillators in which we can independently control the ascending and descending phases of the oscillations (i.e. the swing and stance phases of the limbs). Using insights from dynamical system theory, we construct generic networks of oscillators able to generate several gaits under simple parameter changes. Then we introduce a systematic way of adding sensory feedback from touch sensors in the CPG such that the controller is strongly coupled with the mechanical system it controls. Finally we control three different simulated robots (iCub, Aibo and Ghostdog) using the same controller to show the effectiveness of the approach. Our simulations prove the importance of independent control of swing and stance duration. The strong mutual coupling between the CPG and the robot allows for more robust locomotion, even under non precise parameters and non-flat environment. {\textcopyright}2008 {IEEE}.},

Then, the closed loop between the CPG and the mechanical system allows to study the modulation of rhythmic patterns and the effect of the sensing loop via sensory neurons during the locomotion task. Firstly simulations show that the proposed architecture easily allows to modulate rhythmic patterns of the leg, and therefore the velocity of the robot. Secondly, simulations show that sensori-feedbacks from foot/ground contact of the leg make the hip velocity smoother and larger.

We hypothesize that, in situations where a robot experiences occasional impacts with the environment, anti-compliance can help negotiate unknown obstacles, similar to biological systems where positive feedback enables fast responses to external stimuli. A novel parallel controller, based on a bi-stable dynamical system, continuously adjusts the robot's direction of locomotion, and reverts it in reaction to major swerves. We present experimental results, demonstrating how our framework allows a snake robot to autonomously locomote through a row of unevenly-spaced obstacles.

abstract = {Although familiar to each of us, the sensation of inhabiting a body is ineffable. Traditional senses like vision and hearing monitor the external environment, allowing humans to have shared sensory experiences. But proprioception, the sensation of body position and movement, is fundamentally personal and typically absent from conscious perception. Nonetheless, this ‘sixth sense' remains critical to human experience, a fact that is most apparent when one considers those who have lost it. Take, for example, the case of Ian Waterman who, at the age of 19, suffered a rare autoimmune response to a flu infection that attacked the sensory neurons from his neck down. This infection deprived him of the sense of position, movement and touch in his body. With this loss of feedback came a complete inability to coordinate his movements. While he could compel his muscles to contract, he lost the ability to orchestrate these actions into purposeful behaviors, in essence leaving him immobile, unable to stand, walk, or use his body to interact with the world. Only after years of dedicated training was he able to re-learn to move his body entirely under visual control. In this Primer, John Tuthill and Eiman Azim examine proprioceptive feedback systems in mammals and insects, and argue that functional parallels across species can reveal fundamental principles of sensorimotor control.},

In this respect, these methods are similar to Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) applied to linear or linearized systems.

As a first step, the unknown system dynamics have to be constructed using online approximates such as neural networks and then controllers have to be designed. In this chapter, estimation or system identification and control using neural networks is thoroughly investigated. To begin with, some basic concepts on the neural networks are introduced, and then some stability properties are proposed for a general class of nonlinear discretetime systems. Later, the development of nonlinear estimation techniques for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems is introduced.

abstract = {Research in neuroevolution - that is, evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs) through evolutionary algorithms - is inspired by the evolution of biological brains, which can contain trillions of connections. Yet while neuroevolution has produced successful results, the scale of natural brains remains far beyond reach. This article presents a method called hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) that aims to narrow this gap. HyperNEAT employs an indirect encoding called connective compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs) that can produce connectivity patterns with symmetries and repeating motifs by interpreting spatial patterns generated within a hypercube as connectivity patterns in a lower-dimensional space. This approach can exploit the geometry of the task by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network, thereby shifting problem difficulty away from dimensionality to the underlying problem structure. Furthermore, connective CPPNs can represent the same connectivity pattern at any resolution, allowing ANNs to scale to new numbers of inputs and outputs without further evolution. HyperNEAT is demonstrated through visual discrimination and food-gathering tasks, including successful visual discrimination networks containing over eight million connections. The main conclusion is that the ability to explore the space of regular connectivity patterns opens up a new class of complex high-dimensional tasks to neuroevolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The steady state/input description simply copies the exosystem dynamics for simple systems, however, it relies on more complicated steady-state generators in most non-linear scenarios. Once the steady state/input is characterised, it can be estimated by an internal model. Proper construction of internal model can well compensate for the desired steady state/input resulting in a stabilisation problem about an equilibrium point. The control objective is achieved if such a stabilisation problem is solved. This paper does not ambitiously aim at a complete overview picture of the three decade development of output regulation theory. It attempts to show a small trail in the garden of vast collections of output regulation results that may lead the audience from simple to advanced internal model design techniques. In particular, it reviews the simple PID structure, the p-copy internal model for linear systems, various internal models for non-linear systems, and the recent development of generalised internal model to accommodate adaptive scheme.},

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics using real hardware has been almost exclusively restricted to evolving robot controllers, but the technology for evolvable morphologies is advancing quickly. We discuss a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate real robots that can reproduce. Following a general system plan, we implement a robotic habitat that contains all system components in the simplest possible form. We create an initial population of two robots and run a complete life cycle, resulting in a new robot, parented by the first two. Even though the individual steps are simplified to the maximum, the whole system validates the underlying concepts and provides a generic workflow for the creation of more complex incarnations. This hands-on experience provides insights and helps us elaborate on interesting research directions for future development.},

The purpose of this article is threefold: (a) to highlight a spate of recent work by a number of researchers in replicating, and in some cases extending, Sims' results using standard PCs (Sims' original work was done on a Connection Machine CM-5 parallel computer). In particular, a re-implementation of Sims' work by the authors will be described and discussed; (b) to illustrate how off-the-shelf physics engines can be used in this sort of work, and also to highlight some deficiencies of these engines and pitfalls when using them; and (c) to indicate how these recent studies stand in respect to Sims' original work. {\textcopyright} 2001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

	abstract = {Most technologies are made from steel, concrete, chemicals, and plastics, which degrade over time and can produce harmful ecological and health side effects. It would thus be useful to build technologies using self-renewing and biocompatible materials, of which the ideal candidates are living systems themselves. Thus, we here present a method that designs completely biological machines from the ground up: computers automatically design new machines in simulation, and the best designs are then built by combining together different biological tissues. This suggests others may use this approach to design a variety of living machines to safely deliver drugs inside the human body, help with environmental remediation, or further broaden our understanding of the diverse forms and functions life may adopt.Living systems are more robust, diverse, complex, and supportive of human life than any technology yet created. However, our ability to create novel lifeforms is currently limited to varying existing organisms or bioengineering organoids in vitro. Here we show a scalable pipeline for creating functional novel lifeforms: AI methods automatically design diverse candidate lifeforms in silico to perform some desired function, and transferable designs are then created using a cell-based construction toolkit to realize living systems with the predicted behaviors. Although some steps in this pipeline still require manual intervention, complete automation in future would pave the way to designing and deploying unique, bespoke living systems for a wide range of functions.},

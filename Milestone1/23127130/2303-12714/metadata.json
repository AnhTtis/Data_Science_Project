    "abstract": "The size distribution of planned and forced outages in power systems have been studied for almost two decades and has drawn great interest as they display heavy tails. Understanding of this phenomenon has been done by various threshold models, which are self-tuned at their critical points, but as many papers pointed out, explanations are intuitive, and more empirical data is needed to support hypotheses. In this paper, the authors analyze outage data collected from various public sources to calculate the outage energy and outage duration exponents of possible power-law fits. Temporal thresholds are applied to identify crossovers from initial short-time behavior to power-law tails. We revisit and add to the possible explanations of the uniformness of these exponents. By performing power spectral analyses on the outage event time series and the outage duration time series, it is found that, on the one hand, while being overwhelmed by white noise, outage events show traits of self-organized criticality (SOC), which may be modeled by a crossover from random percolation to directed percolation branching process with dissipation. On the other hand, in responses to outages, the heavy tails in outage duration distributions could be a consequence of the highly optimized tolerance (HOT) mechanism, based on the optimized allocation of maintenance resources.",

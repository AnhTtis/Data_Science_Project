    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the Poisson process time-changed by independent Lévy subordinators, namely, the incomplete gamma subordinator, the $ε$-jumps incomplete gamma subordinator and tempered incomplete gamma subordinator. We derive their important distributional properties such as probability mass function, mean, variance, correlation, tail probabilities and fractional moments. The long-range dependence property of these processes are discussed. An application in insurance domain is studied in detail. Finally, we present the likelihood plots, the pdf plots and the simulated sample paths for the subordinators and their corresponding subordinated Poisson processes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the new sage_acsv package for the SageMath computer algebra system, allowing users to rigorously compute asymptotics for a large variety of multivariate sequences with rational generating functions. Using Sage's support for exact computations over the algebraic number field, this package provides the first rigorous implementation of algorithms from the theory of analytic combinatorics in several variables.",

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we did the first survey that comprehensively investigates and summarizes the status of software vulnerability detection benchmarking. We review the current literature on benchmarking vulnerability detection, including the benchmarking approaches in technique proposing papers, empirical studies. We also separately discuss the benchmarking approaches for traditional and deep learning-based vulnerability detection techniques. Our survey analyzes the lack of software vulnerability detection benchmarking and the respective difficulties. 
We summarize the challenges of benchmarking software vulnerability detection techniques and describe the possible solutions for solving the challenges.

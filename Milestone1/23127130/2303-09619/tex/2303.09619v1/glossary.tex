\newglossaryentry{lidar}{
    name=LiDAR,
    description={LiDAR is an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging or Light Imaging, Detection and Ranging. It is a method of range measurement that uses a laser beam to measure time-of-flight between the sensor and an object or surface. LiDAR sensors can be single-beam, 2D or 3D, providing different formats of data such as distance, depth maps or point-clouds.}

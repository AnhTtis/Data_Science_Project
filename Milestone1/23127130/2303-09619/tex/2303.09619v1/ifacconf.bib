It is no longer necessary to have expensive machines to see a world in 3D; a simple computer can do the trick. Historically, research has focused on the development of 3D information and acquisition techniques from scenes and objects. These acquisition methods require expertise and complex calibration procedures whenever the acquisition system was used. All this creates an important demand for flexibility in these methods of acquisition because of these different factors, many techniques have emerged. Many of them only need a camera and a computer to create a 3D world from a scene.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fiducial marker system specially appropriated for camera pose estimation in applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.}

  abstract = {Squared planar markers have become a popular method for pose estimation in applications such as autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles and virtual trainers. The markers allow estimating the position of a monocular camera with minimal cost, high robustness, and speed. One only needs to create markers with a regular printer, place them in the desired environment so as to cover the working area, and then registering their location from a set of images. Nevertheless, marker detection is a time-consuming process, especially as the image dimensions grows. Modern cameras are able to acquire high resolutions images, but fiducial marker systems are not adapted in terms of computing speed. This paper proposes a multi-scale strategy for speeding up marker detection in video sequences by wisely selecting the most appropriate scale for detection, identification and corner estimation. The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. Our method is up to 40 times faster than the state-of-the-art method, achieving over 1000 fps in 4 K images without any parallelization.}

  abstract   = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

However, due to the field of view limitation of cameras, typical point features are difficult to extract, where commonly adopted position-based visual servoing cannot be valid anymore. To provide robot{\&}{\#}x2019;s relative position and attitude with the target, we propose a monocular visual servoing control method using only the edge lines of satellite brackets. Firstly, real time detection of edge lines is achieved based on image gradient and region growing. Then, we build an edge line based model to estimate the relative position and attitude between the robot and the target. Finally, we design a visual servoing controller combined with PD controller. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can extract edge lines stably and adjust the robot{\&}{\#}x2019;s attitude to satisfy the grasping requirements.},

    "abstract": "Let $\\mathrm{Mod}(S)$ be the mapping class group of a compact connected orientable surface $S$, possibly with punctures and boundary components, with negative Euler characteristic. We prove that for any infinite virtually abelian subgroup $H$ of $\\mathrm{Mod}(S)$, there is a subgroup $H'$ commensurable with $H$ such that the commensurator of $H$ equals the normalizer of $H'$. As a consequence we give, for each $n \\geq 2$, an upper bound for the geometric dimension of $\\mathrm{Mod}(S)$ for the family of abelian subgroups of rank bounded by $n$. These results generalize work by Juan-Pineda--Trujillo-Negrete and Nucinkis--Petrosyan for the virtually cyclic case.",

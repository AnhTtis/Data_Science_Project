\section{Introduction}
Given a group $\Gamma$, we say a collection $\calF$ of subgroups of $\Gamma$ is a \emph{family} if it is non-empty, closed under conjugation and under taking subgroups. Fix a group $\Gamma$ and a family $\calF$ of subgroups of $\Gamma$. We say that a $\Gamma$-CW-complex $X$ is a \emph{model for the classifying space} $E_{\calF}\Gamma$ if every isotropy  group of $X$ belongs to the family $\calF$ and the fixed point set $X^H$ is contractible whenever  $H$ belongs to $\calF$. It can be shown that a model for the classifying space   $E_{\calF}\Gamma$ always exists and it is unique up to $\Gamma$-homotopy equivalence. We define the \emph{$\calF$-geometric dimension} of $\Gamma$   as
$$\gd_{\calF}(\Gamma)=\min\{n\in \mathbb{N}| \text{ there is a model for } E_{\calF}\Gamma \text{ of dimension } n \}.$$
Examples of  families of subgroups are: the family that only consists of the trivial subgroup $\{1\}$, and the family $\fin$ of finite subgroups of $\Gamma$. The $\calF$-geometric dimension  has been widely studied in the last decades, and the present paper contributes to this topic.

Let $n\geq0$ be an integer. A group is said to be \emph{virtually $\mathbb{Z}^n$} if it contains a subgroup of finite index isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Define the family \[\calF_n=\{H\leq\Gamma| H \text{ is virtually } \mathbb{Z}^r \text{ for some 
} 0\le r \le n \}.\] The  families $\{1\}$, $\calF_0=\fin$ and $\calF_1=\vcyc$  are relevant due to its connection with the Farrell-Jones and Baum-Connes isomorphism conjectures.  The families $\calF_n$  have been recently studied by
several people, see for instance \cite{SS20}.

    "abstract": "Reliable and prompt identification of active users is critical for enabling random access in massive machine-to-machine type networks which typically operate within stringent access delay and energy constraints. In this paper, an energy efficient active user identification protocol is envisioned in which the active users simultaneously transmit On-Off Keying (OOK) modulated preambles whereas the base station uses non-coherent detection to avoid the channel estimation overheads. The minimum number of channel-uses required for active user identification in the asymptotic regime of total number of users $\\ell$ when the number of active devices k scales as $k = Θ(1)$ is characterized along with an achievability scheme relying on the equivalence of activity detection to a group testing problem. A practical scheme for active user identification based on a belief propagation strategy is also proposed and its performance is compared against the theoretical bounds.",

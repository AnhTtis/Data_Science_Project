    "abstract": "Let $Ω:=\\{0,1\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ be the Cantor space, and let $τ:Ω\\to Ω$ be the Bernoulli shift.\n  For the flow on the crossed product $C(Ω)\\rtimes_τ\\mathbb{Z}$ determined by a potential that depends on only one coordinate, we show that for every $β\\neq 0$, there is an extremal $β$-KMS state on $C(Ω)\\rtimes_τ\\mathbb{Z}$ of type $II_\\infty$.\n  Also, when the potential takes values that are rationally dependent, we determine the values of $λ\\in (0,1)$ for which there is a an extremal $β$-KMS state of type $III_λ$.",

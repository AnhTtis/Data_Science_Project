    "abstract": "Nonreciprocal phenomena in the normal state are well established and key to many commercial applications. In contrast, superconducting analogs, such as the superconducting diode effect (SDE), are only starting to be experimentally explored and pose significant challenges to their theoretical understanding. In this work we put forth a phenomenological picture of the SDE based on the generalized Ginzburg-Landau free energy, which includes a Lifshitz invariant as the hallmark of noncentrosymmetric helical phase of the finite-momentum Cooper pairs. We reveal that such a Lifshitz invariant drives the SDE in quasi-two-dimensional systems in an applied magnetic field and cannot be removed by a gauge transformation, due to the inherently inhomogeneous magnetic response. For a thin film, the SDE scales with the square of its thickness and nonlinearly with the strength of the in-plane magnetic field. We derive an explicit formula that relates the SDE at small magnetic fields to the strength of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, g-factor, and Fermi energy. For a noncentrosymmetric Josephson junction, we self-consistently obtain generalized anharmonic current-phase relation which support the SDE. The transparency of our approach, which agrees well with experimentally-measured SDE, offers an important method to study nonreciprocal phenomena, central to superconducting spintronics and topological superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "The first measurement of the top quark pair ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$) production cross section in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV is presented. Data recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in Summer 2022, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.21 fb$^{-1}$, are analyzed. Events are selected with one or two charged leptons (electrons or muons) and additional jets. A maximum likelihood fit is performed in event categories defined by the number and flavors of the leptons, the number of jets, and the number of jets identified as originating from b quarks. An inclusive $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ production cross section of 882 $\\pm$ 23 (stat+syst) $\\pm$ 20 (lumi) pb is measured, in agreement with the standard model prediction of 921$^{+29}_{-37}$ pb.",

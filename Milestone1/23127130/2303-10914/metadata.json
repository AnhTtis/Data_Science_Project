    "abstract": "The spectral landscape and the transport property of a translationally invariant network with side-coupled quantum dots are demonstrated within the tight-binding framework. For periodic environment band structure is demonstrated analytically in details. Moreover, if the side-coupling here follows a typical quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre-Harper type of modulation then such off-diagonal disorder invites an exotic spectral feature for this model quantum system. We perform an in-depth numerical analysis followed by the evaluation of the density of eigenstates and the inverse participation ratio. The description shows that this network creates a typical self-similar kind of multifractal pattern in the energy landscape. The impacts of the strength of such aperiodic connectivity and the slowness parameter are reported in this analysis. In the present era of advanced technology and lithography techniques all such non-trivial results definitely throw an achievable challenge to the experimentalists to study the localization of excitation in such network",

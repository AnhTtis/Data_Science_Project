    "abstract": "Magnetization switching in ferromagnets has so far been limited to the current-induced spin-orbit-torque effects. Recent observation of helicity-independent all-optical magnetization switching in exchange-coupled ferromagnet ferrimagnet heterostructures expanded the range and applicability of such ultrafast heat-driven magnetization switching. Here we report the element-resolved switching dynamics of such an exchange-coupled system, using a modified microscopic three-temperature model. We have studied the effect of i) the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet, ii) ferrimagnet composition, iii) the long-range RKKY exchange-coupling strength, and iv) the absorbed optical energy on the element-specific time-resolved magnetization dynamics. The phase-space of magnetization illustrates how the RKKY coupling strength and the absorbed optical energy influence the switching time. Our analysis demonstrates that the threshold switching energy depends on the composition of the ferrimagnet and the switching time depends on the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet as well as RKKY coupling strength. This simulation anticipates new insights into developing faster and more energy-efficient spintronics devices.",

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we abandon the CNN-based image learning methods and devise a new paradigm of lithography model
which separates the influence of mask and lithographic system, aiming to learn optical kernels with neural fields for lithography simulation.
The model starts with deriving the maximum dimension of the optical kernels from physical \textit{`resolution limit'}.
Then Nitho leverages a $\operatorname{\mathbb{C}MLP}$ to learn the implicit mapping from positional encoded coordinates to optical kernel values,
which reflects information from the location-dependent imaging system.
With the predicted kernels, high-precision aerial and resist images  can be obtained following the SOCS formula.
Experiments show Nitho framework outperforms SOTA with a smaller model size in both aerial and resist stages.
At the same time, Nitho demonstrates superior generalization capability than SOTA by a large margin.

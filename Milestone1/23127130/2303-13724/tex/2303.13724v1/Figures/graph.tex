    \caption{The illustration of the between-class subgraph and the within-class subgraph. Each node denotes a class, and the edge weight between the two nodes is computed by the cosine similarity of their prototypes. The solid \textcolor{red}{red} lines denote the between-class edges, and the dotted \textcolor{teal}{teal} lines denote the within-class edges.
    The between-class distance is computed by prototypes from the $t^{th}$ iteration, while the within-class distance is computed between $t^{th}$ and $(t-1)^{th}$ iterations.}

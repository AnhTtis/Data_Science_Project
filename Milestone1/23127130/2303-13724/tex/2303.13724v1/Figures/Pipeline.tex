    The pipeline of our method. Given a set of support and query images, we extract features from these images and use them to update the prototypes through prototype learning. The $D$ denotes the dimension of the prototypes, while the $C$ denotes the number of categories. We propose a class contrastive loss and a relationship loss to increase the distance between different classes while updating the prototypes in a stable manner. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{Figure: Qualitified_image}, our method is able to accurately locate objects and assign the correct classes.

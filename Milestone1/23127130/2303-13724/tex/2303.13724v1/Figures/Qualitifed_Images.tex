    \caption{ Our qualitative examples on the PASCAL VOC and the MS COCO dataset. The first two rows are the results from PASCAL VOC, and the last two rows are the results from the MS COCO dataset. The qualitative examples are obtained under the 1-shot setting.
    Most of the time, the prediction of the previous method CAPL~\cite{capl} is able to locate the objects. However, the prediction is not able to identify the class of the objects. Our prediction is able to locate the objects and identify the corresponding classes accurately. }

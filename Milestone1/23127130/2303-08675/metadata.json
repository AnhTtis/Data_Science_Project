    "abstract": "We examine the linear completeness of trajectories of eigenfunctions associated to non-linear eigenvalue problems, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on a segment. We pursue two specific goals. On the one hand, we establish that linear completeness persists for the non-linear Schr{ö}dinger equation, even when the trajectories lie far from those of the linear equation where bifurcation occurs. On the other hand, we show that this is also the case for a fully non-linear version of this equation which is naturally associated with Apell hypergeometric functions. Both models shed new light on a framework for completeness in the non-linear setting, considered by L.E. Fraenkel over 40 years ago, that may have significant potential but which does not seem to have received much attention.",

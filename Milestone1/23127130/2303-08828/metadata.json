    "abstract": "We derive optimal estimators for the two-, three-, and four-point correlators of statistically isotropic scalar fields defined on the sphere, such as the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature fluctuations, allowing for arbitrary (linear) masking and inpainting schemes. In each case, we give the optimal unwindowed estimator (obtained via a maximum-likelihood prescription, with an associated Fisher deconvolution matrix), and an idealized form, and pay close attention to their efficient computation. For the trispectrum, we include both parity-even and parity-odd contributions, as allowed by symmetry. The estimators can include arbitrary weighting of the data (and remain unbiased), but are shown to be optimal in the limit of inverse-covariance weighting and Gaussian statistics. The normalization of the estimators is computed via Monte Carlo methods, with the rate-limiting steps (involving spherical harmonic transforms) scaling linearly with the number of bins. An accompanying code package, PolyBin, implements these estimators in Python, and we demonstrate the estimators' efficacy via a suite of validation tests.",

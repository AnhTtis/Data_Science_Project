\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we studied the problem of multidimensional resource fragmentation-aware VNE in edge networks.
To quantify the resource fragments at PNs and PLs, we defined the LoI and a threshold for judging fragmentation.
To achieve efficient resource utilization, a coupled VNoE and VLiE problem was formulated.
The problem was transformed into a bilevel optimization problem with VNoE for the upper-level optimization problem and VLiE for the lower-level optimization problem.
To solve this problem, we proposed a nested method named BiVNE.
In the upper level of BiVNE, ACS was used to find the most promising VNoE result.
In the lower level of BiVNE, the optimal link resource allocation corresponding to each VNoE decision was determined using the Dijkstra algorithm and the exact-fit spectrum slot allocation approach.
Simulation results reveal that our proposed BiVNE method outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of acceptance ratio, R/C ratio and InP's profit.

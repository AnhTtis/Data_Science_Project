\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduce \AlgoName -- a novel test-time threat model-agnostic method that enhances AT models through conditional image transformation and distance-based prediction.
Our method leverages AT models specialized in a specific threat model, boosts their performance on the trained threat model, and equips them with threat model-agnostic capabilities without further training or access to the training data.   
Additionally, we provide a controllable, clean-robust accuracy trade-off mechanism that can be adapted by the user as required.
Moreover, we propose \AlgoNameTop, an efficient method that speeds up the inference time.
Finally, we conducted an extensive evaluation to demonstrate state-of-the-art results on various architectures, convolution or transformer based, AT training methods, white-box and black-box attacks, and four widely used datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, and Flowers.

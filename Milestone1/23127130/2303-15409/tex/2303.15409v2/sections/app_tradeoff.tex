\section{Alpha-Controlled Tradeoff for Robustness and Accuracy}
\label{app:alpha_tradeoff}


The trade-off between clean and robust accuracy is controlled by the step size $\alpha$, as demonstrated not only on CIFAR-10 but also on larger datasets like ImageNet. 
In \cref{fig:app_alpha_tradeoff}, we illustrate that adjusting $\alpha$ allows for flexible control over this trade-off on ImageNet, further validating our approach. 
Additionally, while Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 show that clean accuracy may drop, this drop is manageable and adjustable by fine-tuning $\alpha$. 
This supports our claim that CODIP can effectively manage the clean-robust accuracy balance, even on more complex datasets with more classes, such as ImageNet, by adjusting the value of $\alpha$. 


Note that \cref{fig:app_alpha_tradeoff} was evaluated on a random subset of $500$ examples from the ImageNet validation set, as it is intended for exemplification purposes.

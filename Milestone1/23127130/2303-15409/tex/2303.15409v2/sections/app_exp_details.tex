\subsection{Randomized Smoothing} 
Randomized Smoothing \cite{cohen2019certified} requires that the robust classifier be trained with Gaussian noise augmentations to be effective at test-time. 
This requirement is documented in \cite{cohen2019certified} and demonstrated by CIFAR-10 results using AT \cite{madry2017towards} RN50. 
Despite its limitations, we chose to incorporate this method by selecting a small random noise value, $\sigma=0.05$, as larger values significantly degrade clean accuracy.
Additionally, we attacked this model using AutoAttack \cite{croce2020reliable} (random version), applying $10$ augmentations per image to adhere to memory constraints.

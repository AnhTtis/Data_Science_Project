We consider a local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk with sufficiently high spatial resolution. We describe the structure of the gas flow onto and around the protoplanet in detail. We find that the gas flows onto the protoplanet system in the vertical direction, crossing the shock front near the Hill radius of the protoplanet, which is qualitatively different from the picture established by two-dimensional simulations. The specific angular momentum of the gas accreted by the protoplanet system increases with the protoplanet's mass. At a Jovian orbit, when the protoplanet's mass Mp is Mp≲ 1MJup, where MJup is the Jovian mass, the specific angular momentum increases as j ∝ Mp. On the other hand, it increases as j ∝ Mp2/3 when the protoplanet's mass is Mp≳ 1MJup. The stronger dependence of the specific angular momentum on the protoplanet's mass for Mp≲ 1MJup is due to the thermal pressure of the gas. The estimated total angular momentum of a system of a gas giant planet and a circumplanetary disk is 2 orders of magnitude larger than those of the present gas giant planets in the solar system. A large fraction of the total angular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. We also discuss the formation of satellites from the circumplanetary disk.},

In the Hill framework, we obtained an expression for the rotational angular momentum of a protoplanet brought by colliding planetesimals per unit time, whose scaled value is denoted by q. And we evaluated q numerically by coplanar and off-planar orbital integration. The results are summarized in terms of e and i, which are the eccentricity and inclination of the relative motion scaled by the reduced Hill radius h; h is defined as (mp/3M⊙)13, where mp is the mass of the protoplanet. q(e, i) has four properties: (i) q(e, i) depends very weakly on i, (ii) q(e, i) is negative (i.e., retrograde) for e < 1, (iii) q(e, i) has a narrow prograde region in 1 ⩽ e ⩽ 2, and (iv) q(e, i) is reduced to zero as e and i increase. Averaging the q(e, i) obtained over the Gaussian velocity distribution of planetesimal swarm, we examined the rotation of terrestrial planets; Earth's and Mars' rotations are realized if e in the late accumulation stage is 1–2, which is a reasonable value in the light of planetary accumulation theory.},

  abstract = {Most major planetary bodies in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as their orbital motion: their spin is prograde. Theoretical studies to explain the direction as well as the magnitude of the spin vector have had mixed success. When the accreting building blocks are ∼ km-size planetesimals – as predicted by the classical model – the accretion process is so symmetric that it cancels out prograde with retrograde spin contributions, rendering the net spin minute. For this reason, the currently-favored model for the origin of planetary rotation is the giant impact model, in which a single collision suffices to deliver a spin, which magnitude is close to the breakup rotation rate. However, the giant impact model does not naturally explain the preference for prograde spin. Similarly, an increasing number of spin vector measurement of asteroids also shows that the spin vector of large (primordial) asteroids is not isotropic. Here, we re-assess the viability of smaller particles to bestow planetary bodies with a net spin, focusing on the pebble accretion model in which gas drag and gravity join forces to accrete small particles at a large cross section. Similar to the classical calculation for planetesimals, we integrate the pebble equation of motion and measure the angular momentum transfer at impact. We consider a variety of disk conditions and pebble properties and conduct our calculations in the limits of 2D (planar) and 3D (homogeneous) pebble distributions. We find that in certain regions of the parameter space, the angular momentum transfer is significant, much larger than with planetesimals and on par with or exceeding the current spin of planetary bodies. We link this large net spin delivery to the appearance of asymmetries during the accretion process of pebbles. For example, prograde contribution may dominate (in certain regions of the parameter space) because they originate from trajectories that are preferentially captured. For simplicity, our calculations have ignored certain important effects (e.g., collisions, the back-reaction on the gas, and formation of atmospheres) and do not address how the eventual distribution of spin vectors is obtained for which collisions and post-formation processes must have played a role to explain the scatter. Irrespective of these issues, pebble accretion is a viable mechanism to not only grow planetary bodies, but also to impart them with a significant spin.},

Rapid recycling of the envelope gas of planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc has been proposed to delay the cooling and following accretion of disc gas. We compare isothermal and non-isothermal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet to investigate the influence on the feasibility of the recycling mechanism. Radiative cooling is implemented by using the β cooling model. We find that, in either case, gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through the mid-plane regions, or vice versa when disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian. However, in contrast to the isothermal case where the recycling flow reaches the deeper part of the envelope, the inflow is inhibited from reaching the deep envelope in the non-isothermal case. Once the atmosphere starts cooling, buoyant force prevents the high-entropy disc gas from intruding the low-entropy atmosphere. We suggest that the buoyancy barrier isolates the lower envelope from the recycling and allows further cooling, which may lead runaway gas accretion on to the core.}},

  abstract = {{In the core accretion paradigm of planet formation, gas giants only form a massive atmosphere after their progenitors exceeded a threshold mass: the critical core mass. Most (exo)planets, being smaller and rock/ice-dominated, never crossed this line. Nevertheless, they were massive enough to attract substantial amounts of gas from the disc, while their atmospheres remained in pressure-equilibrium with the disc. Our goal is to characterize the hydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such embedded planets and the implications for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper – the first in series – we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid flow past a small, embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical simulations. Using the pluto code, we confirm that the flow is steady and bound. This steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with the grid spacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets, Cartesian grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow the circular, large speeds in the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of rotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find that more massive atmospheres rotate faster – a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation theorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire from the nebula. Dependent on the Toomre-Q parameter of the circumstellar disc, the planet's atmosphere will reach Keplerian rotation before self-gravity starts to become important.}},

These are now extended to three dimensions, employing a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown to reduce rotational motions. Contrasting the 2D case, no clear boundary demarcates bound atmospheric gas from disc material; instead, we find an open system where gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through the mid-plane regions, or, vice versa, when the disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian. The simulations do not converge to a time-independent solution; instead, the atmosphere is characterized by a time-varying velocity field. Of particular interest is the time-scale to replenish the atmosphere by nebular gas, treplenish. It is shown that the replenishment rate, Matm/treplenish, can be understood in terms of a modified Bondi accretion rate, ∼\\$R\_\\mathrm\\{Bondi\\}^2\\rho \_\\mathrm\\{gas\\}v\_\\mathrm\\{Bondi\\}\\$, where vBondi is set by the Keplerian shear or the magnitude of the sub-Keplerian motion of the gas, whichever is larger. In the inner disc, the atmosphere of embedded protoplanets replenishes on a time-scale that is shorter than the Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) time-scale. As a result, atmospheric gas can no longer contract and the growth of these atmospheres terminates. Future work must confirm whether these findings continue to apply when the (thermodynamical) idealizations employed in this study are relaxed. But if shown to be broadly applicable, replenishment of atmospheric gas provides a natural explanation for the preponderance of gas-rich but rock-dominant planets like super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.}},

In the case of ordered accretion, the planet's obliquity is expected to be near 0° or 180°, whereas, if accretion is stochastic, there should be a wide range of obliquities. Analytic arguments and extensive orbital integrations are used to calculate the expected distributions of spin rate and obliquity as a function of the planetesimal mass and velocity distributions.

As initial conditions, we adopt the oligarchic growth model of protoplanets. For the standard disk model, typically two Earth-sized planets form in the terrestrial planet region. We find that the spin angular velocity of the planets is well expressed by a Gaussian distribution, and their obliquity is well expressed by an isotropic distribution. The typical spin angular velocity is given by the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability under the assumption of perfect accretion in collisions. We show the dependencies of the spin parameters on the initial protoplanet system parameters. The initial orbital separation and velocity anisotropy of protoplanets barely affect the spin parameters. The bulk density of protoplanets does not affect the obliquity distribution, while the spin angular velocity increases with the bulk density.},

As of 2008 December, data for 3741 asteroids based on more than 10650 separate detail records derived from entries in various journals were included in the LCDB. Of those 3741 asteroids, approximately 3100 have data of sufficient quality for statistical analysis, including 7 that have “dual citizenship” – meaning that they have (or had) asteroid designations as well comet designations. Here we present a discussion of the nature of LCDB data, i.e., which values are actually measured and which are derived. For derived data, we give our justification for specific values. We also present some analysis based on the LCDB data, including new default albedo (pV) and phase slope parameter (G) values for the primary taxonomic classes and a review of the frequency–diameter distribution of all asteroids as well as some selected subsets. The most recent version of data used in this analysis is available for download from the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) site at http://www.MinorPlanetObserver.com/astlc/default.htm. Other data sets, some only subsets of the full LCDB, are available in the Ephemeris of Minor Planets, The Planetary Data System, and the Minor Planet Center web site.},

  abstract = {Planet formation models suggest the primordial main belt experienced a short but intense period of collisional evolution shortly after the formation of planetary embryos. This period is believed to have lasted until Jupiter reached its full size, when dynamical processes (e.g., sweeping resonances, excitation via planetary embryos) ejected most planetesimals from the main belt zone. The few planetesimals left behind continued to undergo comminution at a reduced rate until the present day. We investigated how this scenario affects the main belt size distribution over Solar System history using a collisional evolution model (CoEM) that accounts for these events. CoEM does not explicitly include results from dynamical models, but instead treats the unknown size of the primordial main belt and the nature/timing of its dynamical depletion using innovative but approximate methods. Model constraints were provided by the observed size frequency distribution of the asteroid belt, the observed population of asteroid families, the cratered surface of differentiated Asteroid (4) Vesta, and the relatively constant crater production rate of the Earth and Moon over the last 3 Gyr. Using CoEM, we solved for both the shape of the initial main belt size distribution after accretion and the asteroid disruption scaling law QD∗. In contrast to previous efforts, we find our derived QD∗ function is very similar to results produced by numerical hydrocode simulations of asteroid impacts. Our best fit results suggest the asteroid belt experienced as much comminution over its early history as it has since it reached its low-mass state approximately 3.9–4.5 Ga. These results suggest the main belt's wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution is a “fossil” from this violent early epoch. We find that most diameter D≳120 km asteroids are primordial, with their physical properties likely determined during the accretion epoch. Conversely, most smaller asteroids are byproducts of fragmentation events. The observed changes in the asteroid spin rate and lightcurve distributions near D∼100–120 km are likely to be a byproduct of this difference. Estimates based on our results imply the primordial main belt population (in the form of D<1000 km bodies) was 150–250 times larger than it is today, in agreement with recent dynamical simulations.},

  abstract  = {The Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt are relics from the formation of our solar system. Understanding the size and spin distribution of the two belts is crucial for a deeper understanding of the formation of our solar system and the dynamical processes that govern it. In this paper, we investigate the effect of collisions on the evolution of the spin distribution of asteroids and KBOs. We find that the power law nature of the impactors’ size distribution leads to a Lévy distribution of the spin rates. This results in a power law tail in the spin distribution, in stark contrast to the usually quoted Maxwellian distribution. We show that for bodies larger than 10 km, collisions alone lead to spin rates peaking at 0.15–0.5 revolutions per day. Comparing that to the observed spin rates of large asteroids (R > 50 km), we find that the spins of large asteroids, peaking at ∼1–2 revolutions per day, are dominated by a primordial component that reflects the formation mechanism of the asteroids. Similarly, the Kuiper Belt has undergone virtually no collisional spin evolution, assuming current densities. Collisions contribute a spin rate of ∼0.01 revolutions per day, thus the observed fast spin rates of KBOs are also primordial in nature.},

  abstract = {{Many studies on the origin of the solar system have so far been made until now. These are divided into three categories; Cameron's model, Safronov's model and Kyoto model. In Cameron's model, as an initial stage of the formation of the solar system, a massive solar nebula is assumed whose mass is as large as one solar mass. This solar nebula is unstable against gravitational fragmentation, which leads to massive gaseous protoplanets. On the other hand, in both models of Safronov and us, the mass of the nebula is of the order of a few percent of the solar mass or less. However, a significant difference between Safronov's and ours lies in the continuing accumulation process of planetesimals; in the former, the accumulation is assumed to proceed in a gas-free space, but in the latter, the gas drag effect of the solar nebula is fully taken into account on the planetary growth.In this paper, the scenario of Kyoto model is reviewed, which has been developed by Hayashi and his co-workers in Kyoto group for these ten years. We will see that the gas of the solar nebula has played extensively important roles on the various stages of the planetary formation.}},

  abstract = {Characteristic time scales relevant to the accumulation of planetesimals in a gaseous nebula are examined and the accumulation toward the planets is simulated by numerically solving a growth equation for a mass distribution function. The eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals are assumed to be determined by a balance between excitation due to mutual gravitational scattering and dissipation due to gas drag. Two kinds of mass motion in the radial direction, i.e., diffusion due to mutual scattering and inward flow due to gas drag, are both taken into account. The diffusion is shown to be effective in later stages with a result of accelerating the accumulation. As to the coalescent collision cross section, the usual formula for a binary encounter in a free space is used but the effect of tidal disruption which increases substantially the cross section is taken into account. Numerical results show that the gravitational enhancement factor (i.e., the so-called “Safronov number”), contained in the cross section formula, always takes a value of the order of unity but the accumulation proceeds relatively rapidly owing to the effects of radial diffusion and tidal disruption. That is, a proto-Earth, a proto-Jupiter, and a proto-Saturn with masses of 1×1027 g are formed in 5×106, 1×107, and 1.6×108 years, respectively. Also, a tentative numerical computation for the Neptune formation shows that a proto-Neptune with the same mass requires a long accumulation time, 4.6×109 years. Finally, the other effects which are expected to reduce the above growth times further are discussed.},

The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents.Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected.Finally, a comment is given on the initial condition of a collapsing interstellar cloud from which the solar nebula is formed at the end of the collapse.}},

It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but its flexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a “task list” that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

We reexamine settling and growth of dust particles in the subsequent laminar phase of the solar nebula in detail, treating a dust layer as a two-component fluid composed of the dust and the gas. We obtain analytic expressions for the settling path, the growing size, and the settling time. The settling process is divided into two phases, i.e., an early gas-dominant phase and a later dust-dominant phase. So far, only the former phase, where the particle path finally turns from vertical to radial, has been investigated. In the latter phase, dust particles drag the gas, rather than the gas does dust particles. Consequently, the particle path turns from radial to vertical. Dust particles grow most appreciably and rapidly in a radially sweeping phase. The final radii of dust particles at the onset of gravitational instability of the dust layer are 20, 5.9, and 0.60 cm in the Earth's, Jupiter's, and Neptune's zones, respectively. These values are much smaller than those obtained previously by S.J. Weidenschilling [1980, Icarus44, 172–189] and Y. Nakagawa et al. [1981, Icarus45, 517–528]. The total settling times are 1.9 × 103, 4.6 × 103, and 2.8 × 104 years in the above-mentioned three zones, respectively. These are somewhat smaller than those obtained by the previous studies.

If the planet travels on a circular orbit, the accretion process is described by two dimensionless parameters r and s , which measure the ratio of the planet's radius to its Hill radius and the ratio of the rms radial velocity of the planetesimals to the shear across the Hill radius, respectively. Using a combination of analytic arguments and numerical simulations, we derive the mass and angular momentum accretion rates and their scaling with r and s. By introducing an additional parameter, the effective mass of the planetesimals relative to the planet, we can derive the obliquities and spins arising from the stochastic nature of the accretion process. Our results are consistent with those of previous calculations by J. J. Lissauer and D. M. Kary (Icarus 94, 126-159 (1991)) wherever there is overlap in parameter space. In particular, we conclude that ordered accretion from a uniform or slowly varying disk of small bodies cannot result in rotation as rapid as that of Earth or Mars for any value of the disk velocity dispersion s. The spin rates of these planets are most naturally explained as arising from one or a few "giant" impacts by planetesimals.},

During this stage, particles are able to settle toward the midplane into a layer of mass density comparable to or much greater than that of the gas. Nonlinear, coupled interactions between the particles and the nebula gas become significant and ultimately determine the vertical profiles of the particle density and the mean velocities of the particles and the nearby gas. This is the environment in which the earliest planetesimals probably form. Our numerical models rely on the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the gas and particles and are fully viscous and turbulent (and, for the particles, compressible). Our turbulence modeling uses a Prandtl local shear parametrization, validated by laboratory experiments. We have developed a new model for particle diffusion involving the profile of the nebula gas turbulence and the particle Schmidt number, which is a function of particle size and density. We model a cool, quiescent nebula at 1 AU (280K) and 10 AU (90K) and a higher temperature stage (1000K) at 1 AU. Our main results include: (a) rapid accretion of planetesimals by gravitationally unstable fragmentation on an orbital time scale (the "Goldreich-Ward instability") is unlikely to occur until objects have already accreted by some other process to the mass of the largest known meteorite samples, if at all; (b) from "seeds" as small as 10 m, growth of 10- to 100-km planetesimals can proceed rapidly by drift-augmented accretion in the particle-rich midplane with orbital decay of about 1% for the growing planetesimals; (c) outward transport of vapor and small entrained chips can account for significant radial compositional and mineralogical mixing in primitive meteorite parent bodies. Other implications may be drawn concerning particle random collisional velocities and the time scales of midplane turbulence.},

  abstract = {We describe the diffusion and random velocities of solid particles due to stochastic forcing by turbulent gas. We include the orbital dynamics of Keplerian disks, both in-plane epicycles and vertical oscillations. We obtain a new result for the diffusion of solids. The Schmidt number (ratio of gas to particle diffusivity) is Sc≈1+(Ωtstop)2, in terms of the particle stopping time tstop and the orbital frequency Ω. The standard result, Sc=1+tstop/teddy, in terms of the eddy turnover time, teddy, is shown to be incorrect. The main difference is that Sc rises quadratically, not linearly, with stopping time. Consequently, particles larger than ∼10 cm in protoplanetary disks will suffer less radial diffusion and will settle closer to the midplane. Such a layer of boulders would be more prone to gravitational collapse. Our predictions of RMS speeds, vertical scale height and diffusion coefficients will help interpret numerical simulations. We confirm previous results for the vertical stirring of particles (scale heights and random velocities), and add a correction for arbitrary ratios of eddy to orbital times. The particle layer becomes thinner for teddy>1/Ω with the strength of turbulent diffusion held fixed. We use two analytic techniques—the Hinze–Tchen formalism and the Fokker–Planck equation with velocity diffusion—with identical results when the regimes of validity overlap. We include simple physical arguments for the scaling of our results.},

As initial conditions, we adopt the oligarchic growth regime of protoplanets in a disc where several embryos are allowed to form. We take different initial planetary system parameters and for each initial condition, we consider an evolution of 2 × 107 yr of the system. We perform simulations for 1000 different discs, and from their results we derive the statistical properties of the assembled planets. We have taken special attention to the planetary obliquities and rotation periods, such as the information obtained from the mass and semimajor axis diagram, which reflects the process of planetary formation. The distribution of obliquities was found to be isotropic, which means that planets can rotate in direct or indirect sense, regardless of their mass. Our results regarding the primordial rotation periods show that they are dependent on the region where the embryo was formed and evolved. According to our results, most of the planets have rotation periods between 10 and 10 000 h and there are also a large population of planets similar to terrestrial planets in the Solar system.}},

  abstract  = {3D modifications to the well-studied 2D flow topology around an embedded planet have the potential to resolve long-standing problems in planet formation theory. We present a detailed analysis of the 3D isothermal flow field around a 5 Earth-mass planet on a fixed circular orbit, simulated using our graphics processing unit hydrodynamics code PEnGUIn. We find that, overall, the horseshoe region has a columnar structure extending vertically much beyond the Hill sphere of the planet. This columnar structure is only broken for some of the widest horseshoe streamlines, along which high altitude fluid descends rapidly into the planet’s Bondi sphere, performs one horseshoe turn, and exits the Bondi sphere radially in the midplane. A portion of this flow exits the horseshoe region altogether, which we refer to as the “transient” horseshoe flow. The flow continues as it rolls up into a pair of up–down symmetric horizontal vortex lines shed into the wake of the planet. This flow, unique to 3D, affects both planet accretion and migration. It prevents the planet from sustaining a hydrostatic atmosphere due to its intrusion into the Bondi sphere, and leads to a significant corotation torque on the planet, unanticipated by 2D analysis. In the reported simulation, starting with a radial surface density profile, this torque is positive and partially cancels with the negative differential Lindblad torque, resulting in a factor of three slower planet migration rate. Finally, we report 3D effects can be suppressed by a sufficiently large disk viscosity, leading to results similar to 2D.},

Previous three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of low-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc, contrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this paper, we investigate the recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the evolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D atmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high-entropy gas from the disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction, potentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction. Recycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous studies. However, we also identify an ‘inner core’ – in size ≈25 per cent of the Bondi radius – where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are needed to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically isolated on long time-scales.}},

  abstract  = {Planetesimal accretion during planet formation is usually treated as collisionless. Such accretion from a uniform and dynamically cold disk predicts protoplanets with slow retrograde rotation. However, if the building blocks of protoplanets, planetesimals, are small, of the order of a meter in size, then they are likely to collide within the protoplanet's sphere of gravitational influence, creating a prograde accretion disk around the protoplanet. The accretion of such a disk results in the formation of protoplanets spinning in the prograde sense with the maximal spin rate allowed before centrifugal forces break them apart. As a result of semicollisional accretion, the final spin of a planet after giant impacts is not completely random, but is biased toward prograde rotation. The eventual accretion of the remaining planetesimals in the post-giant-impact phase might again be in the semicollisional regime and delivers a significant amount of additional prograde angular momentum to the terrestrial planets. We suggest that in our solar system, semicollisional accretion gave rise to the preference for prograde rotation observed in the terrestrial planets and perhaps the largest asteroids.},

  abstract  = {The Kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations of the Kepler targets and of physical companions or stars in the background to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the mission. Using real noise level estimates, we compute the number and characteristics of detectable eclipsing pairs involving main-sequence stars and non-main-sequence stars or planets, and we quantify the fraction of those that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4%, peaking for giant planets (6–22 R⊕) at 17.7%, reaching a low of 6.7% for small Neptunes (2–4 R⊕), and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8–1.25 R⊕) to 12.3%. Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5% ± 3.6% of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 R⊕ with orbital periods up to 85 days. This result is a significant step toward the determination of eta-earth, the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we also derive a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.},

On average, planets with radii up to RP = 1.5 R⊕ increase in density with increasing radius. Above 1.5 R⊕, the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. Including the solar system terrestrial planets with the exoplanets below 1.5 R⊕, we find ρP = 2.43 + 3.39(RP/R⊕) g cm−3 for RP < 1.5 R⊕, which is consistent with rocky compositions. For 1.5 ⩽ RP/R⊕ < 4, we find MP/M⊕ = 2.69(RP/R⊕)0.93. The rms of planet masses to the fit between 1.5 and 4 R⊕ is 4.3 M⊕ with reduced χ2 = 6.2. The large scatter indicates a diversity in planet composition at a given radius. The compositional diversity can be due to planets of a given volume (as determined by their large H/He envelopes) containing rocky cores of different masses or compositions.},

  abstract  = {Kepler’s observation shows that many of the detected planets are super-Earths. They are inside a range of critical masses overlapping the core masses (2–20 M ⊕), which would trigger the runaway accretion and develop the gas giants. Thus, super-Earths/sub-Neptunes can be formed by restraining runaway growth of gaseous envelopes. We assess the effect of planetary rotation in delaying the mass growth. The centrifugal force, induced by spin, will offset a part of the gravitational force and deform the planet. Tracking the change in structure, we find that the temperature at the radiative–convective boundary (RCB) is approximate to the boundary temperature. Since rotation reduces the radiation energy densities in the convective and radiative layers, RCB will penetrate deeper. The cooling luminosity would decrease. Under this condition, the evolutionary timescale can exceed the disk lifetime (10 Myr), and a super-Earth/sub-Neptune could be formed after undergoing additional mass-loss processes. In the dusty atmosphere, even a lower angular velocity can also promote a super-Earth/sub-Neptune forming. Therefore, we conclude that rotation can slow down the planet’s cooling and then promote a super-Earth/sub-Neptune forming.},

The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth--Moon system has proved difficult3,4,5,6. Previous works4,5 found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth--Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller---and thus more likely---object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

  abstract = {Results of about 100 hydrodynamic simulations of potential Moon-forming impacts are presented, focusing on the “late impact” scenario in which the lunar forming impact occurs near the very end of Earth's accretion (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708–712). A new equation of state is utilized that includes a treatment of molecular vapor (“M-ANEOS”; Melosh, 2000, in: Proc. Lunar Planet. Sci. Conf. 31st, p. 1903). The sensitivity of impact outcome to collision conditions is assessed, in particular how the mass, angular momentum, composition and origin (target vs. impactor) of the material placed into circumterrestrial orbit vary with impact angle, speed, impactor-to-target mass ratio, and initial thermal state of the colliding objects. The most favorable conditions for producing a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk involve collisions with an impact angle near 45 degrees and an impactor velocity at infinity <4 km/sec. For a total mass and angular momentum near to that of the current Earth–Moon system, such impacts typically place about a lunar mass of material into orbits exterior to the Roche limit, with the orbiting material composed of 10 to 30% vapor by mass. In all cases, the vast majority of the orbiting material originates from the impactor, consistent with previous findings. By mapping the end fate (escaping, orbiting, or in the planet) of each particle and the peak temperature it experiences during the impact onto the figure of the initial objects, it is shown that in the successful collisions, the impactor material that ends up in orbit is primarily that portion of the object that was heated the least, having avoided direct collision with the Earth. Using these and previous results as a guide, a continuous suite of impact conditions intermediate to the “late impact” (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708–712) and “early Earth” (Cameron, 2000, in: Canup, R.M., Righter, K. (Eds.), Origin of the Earth and Moon, pp. 133–144; 2001, Meteorit. Planet. Sci. 36, 9–22) scenarios is identified that should also produce iron-poor, ∼lunar-sized satellites and a system angular momentum similar to that of the Earth–Moon system. Among these, those that leave the Earth >95% accreted after the Moon-forming impact are favored here, implying a giant impactor mass between 0.11 and 0.14 Earth masses.},

  abstract = {Prior models of lunar-forming impacts assume that both the impactor and the target protoearth were not rotating prior to the Moon-forming event. However, planet formation models suggest that such objects would have been rotating rapidly during the late stages of terrestrial accretion. In this paper I explore the effects of pre-impact rotation on impact outcomes through more than 100 hydrodynamical simulations that consider a range of impactor masses, impact angles and impact speeds. Pre-impact rotation, particularly in the target protoearth, can substantially alter collisional outcomes and leads to a more diverse set of final planet–disk systems than seen previously. However, the subset of these impacts that are also lunar-forming candidates—i.e. that produce a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk—have properties similar to those determined for collisions of non-rotating objects [Canup, R.M., Asphaug, E., 2001. Nature 412, 708–712; Canup, R.M., 2004a. Icarus 168, 433–456]. With or without pre-impact rotation, a lunar-forming impact requires an impact angle near 45 degrees, together with a low impact velocity that is not more than 10% larger than the Earth's escape velocity, and produces a disk containing up to about two lunar masses that is composed predominantly of material originating from the impactor. The most significant differences in the successful cases involving pre-impact spin occur for impacts into a retrograde rotating protoearth, which allow for larger impactors (containing up to 20% of Earth's mass) and provide an improved match with the current Earth–Moon system angular momentum compared to prior results. The most difficult state to reconcile with the Moon is that of a rapidly spinning, low-obliquity protoearth before the giant impact, as these cases produce disks that are not massive enough to yield the Moon.},

  abstract = {It is thought that the Moon formed after a Mars-sized planet hit Earth about 4.5 billion years ago. Computer simulations of this event predict that the Moon was produced primarily from material from the impacting planet. However, the Moon has a similar composition to that of Earth, and the impacting planet would likely have had a different composition. Prior models assumed that the impact left the Earth-Moon system with the same angular momentum as it has today (see the Perspective by Halliday). Ćuk and Stewart (p. 1047, published online 17 October; see the cover) show that the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system could have decreased by half after the Moon-forming impact, opening the door to new impact models. For example, simulations suggest that high-velocity impacts onto a fast-spinning early Earth can lead to a Moon formed primarily from Earth's mantle. Canup (p. 1052, published online 17 October) considered instead lower-velocity impacts by planets comparable in mass to the proto-Earth, which could generate a Moon and an Earth with similar compositions. Computer simulations show that a giant impact on early Earth could lead to a Moon with a composition similar to Earth’s. A common origin for the Moon and Earth is required by their identical isotopic composition. However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth’s mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

Here we report the results of a large number of simulations in which we use both models to develop a statistical picture of atmosphere--bolide interaction for iron and stony objects with initial diameters up to ∼1{\thinspace}km.

  abstract = {The rotation rate of a planet which accretes from small, solid planetesimals is computed as a function of the eccentricities of the planetesimals' orbits. Planets acquire spin angular momentum from the relative motion of planetesimals at impact. The calculations presented herein assume that the planet is spherical and that its orbit is circular. The planetesimals orbit in or very near the plane of the planet's orbit and are uniformly distributed in periapse longitude. Unless otherwise stated, the planetesimal distribution is also assumed to be uniform in semimajor axis. The stochastic effects of accretion of large planetesimals are ignored. The spin angular momentum produced by a particular collision can be either positive or negative; due to symmetries these contributions nearly cancel. Thus, in order to obtain meaningful nonzero results, perturbation expansions must be carried through to second order in the ratio of the planet's radius to the amplitude of the radial excursions of the planetesimals, and numerical simulations require the calculation of a very large number of impacts. We find that nongravitating planets accreted from the disk of planetesimals described above rotate very slowly in the prograde direction; their spin period is longer than their orbital period. When the planet's gravity is included in a three-body treatment of the problem, the rotation rate is a function of eH, the ratio of the amplitude of the planetesimals' radial (eccentric) motion to the radius of the planet's Hill Sphere, and rH, the ratio of the planet's radius to the radius of its Hill Sphere. The number of rotations per orbit generally increases as rH decreases. For eH ≲ 1 (nearly circular initial orbits), the planet rotates in the retrograde direction. Rotation is prograde for larger eccentricities. For small rH, the rotation rate peaks at eH ≈1.2 and decreases to the nongravitating limit as eH → ∞. The maximum rates of systematic prograde rotation are comparable to those observed in our Solar System; however, rapid prograde rotation only occurs for a very narrow range of eH values. In simulations which start with a Rayleigh distribution of planetesimal eccentricities, we find that the maximum prograde rotation rates are much slower than those observed in the Solar System, suggesting that other factors are important. Material accreted from near the outer edges of a planet's feeding zone tends to provide the planet with positive spin angular momentum. If the surface mass density in these regions is greater than that in the rest of the planet's accretion zone, due, e.g., to the expansion of a growing planet's feeding range into parts of the disk not depleted by previous accretion, then the observed spin periods of the planets could be accounted for. Alternatively, the stochastic component of rotation due to impacts of large planetesimals may overwhelm the ordered prograde component of rotation for solid planets, and/or unmodeled effects, such as the orbital eccentricity of a growing planet, might be important in determining planetary rotation rates.},

Lissauer 1990,Icarus87, 40–77, and 1992,Icarus100, 440–463) to the case of a planet on an eccentric orbit. We have found that the dependence of accretion rates on planetary and planetesimal eccentricities can be reduced to a single parameter and that the extent of a planet's single-pass feeding zones depends (in the limit of small planetary mass) only upon the sum of the eccentricities of the planet and the planetesimals and their mutual inclination. We have also addressed the problem of the origin of planetary rotation by calculating the spin angular momentum contributed by all particles which are accreted by a planet in a uniform particle disk. Previous authors (J. J. Lissauer and D. M. Kary 1991,Icarus94, 126–159; L. Dones and S. Tremaine 1993,Icarus103, 67–92) have obtained analytic solutions for nongravitating planets on circular orbits in two-dimensional disks. We have developed new techniques which allow us to extend these calculations to the cases in which the planet's orbit is eccentric and the disk is three-dimensional. Nongravitating planets on eccentric orbits accrete the same specific rotational angular momentum as planets on circular orbits in disks of planetesimals on eccentric orbits. Planetesimal inclinations reduce the specific angular momentum accreted by nongravitating planets by 25–65%. By performing a series of numerical three-body simulations, we have found that a gravitating planet on an orbit with eccentricitye0⪡ in a disk of planetesimals on circular orbits obtains the same rotation rate as a planet on a circular orbit in a disk of planetesimals which havee=e0. When the planet and the planetesimals are both on eccentric orbits withe⪡ 1, the spin angular momentum is determined by the distribution of relative eccentricity vectors. If the eccentricities of the planet and planetesimals differ significantly, inclination typically acts to reduce the magnitude of the rotation rate by a few tens of percent. However, in certain cases where the eccentricities of the planet and planetesimals are comparable, inclination can change slow retrograde rotation to slow prograde rotation. A planet which accretes material primarily from the extremities of its feeding zone during the latter stage of its growth attains rapid systematic prograde rotation only if the amplitude of its epicyclic motion is comparable to or smaller than the radius of its Hill sphere.},

There are many, often competing, processes that regulate the accretion rate of protoplanets. To assess their effects we present a new, publicly available toy model. The rationale behind the toy model is that it encompasses as many physically relevant processes as possible, but at the same time does not compromise its simplicity, speed, and physical insight. The toy model follows a modular structure, where key features—e.g., planetesimal fragmentation, radial orbital decay, nebula turbulence—can be switched on or off. Our model assumes three discrete components (fragments, planetesimals, and embryos) and is zero dimensional in space. We have tested the outcomes of the toy model against literature results and generally find satisfactory agreement. We include, for the first time, model features that capture the three-way interactions among small particles, gas, and protoplanets. Collisions among planetesimals will result in fragmentation, transferring a substantial amount of the solid mass to small particles, which couple strongly to the gas. Our results indicate that the efficiency of the accretion process then becomes very sensitive to the gas properties—especially to the turbulent state and the magnitude of the disk headwind (the decrease of the orbital velocity of the gas with respect to Keplerian)—as well as to the characteristic fragment size.},

The properties of these atmospheres strongly depend on the nature of the coupling between the atmosphere and the surrounding disc. We examine the formation of gaseous envelopes around massive planetary cores via three-dimensional inviscid and isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We focus the changes in the envelope properties as the core mass varies from low (subthermal) to high (superthermal) values, a regime relevant to close-in super-Earths. We show that global envelope properties such as the amount of rotational support or turbulent mixing are mostly sensitive to the ratio of the Bondi radius of the core to its physical size. High-mass cores are fed by supersonic inflows arriving along the polar axis and shocking on the densest parts of the envelope, driving turbulence, and mass accretion. Gas flows out of the core’s Hill sphere in the equatorial plane, describing a global mass circulation through the envelope. The shell of shocked gas atop the core surface delimits regions of slow (inside) and fast (outside) material recycling by gas from the surrounding disc. While recycling hinders the runaway growth towards gas giants, the inner regions of protoplanetary atmospheres, more immune to mixing, may remain bound to the planet.}},

The thick atmosphere of Venus is thought to keep it from the same fate, but Leconte et al. present models showing that even a much sparser atmosphere may suffice for lower-mass stars. The non-instantaneous thermal response of the planet (when the hottest time of day is after noon) may speed up or slow down the planet. Such thermal tides may be important in assessing potential extraterrestrial habitable zones. Science, this issue p. 632 Climate models show that a thin atmosphere can save a short-period exoplanet from perpetually locked day and night sides. Planets in the habitable zone of lower-mass stars are often assumed to be in a state of tidally synchronized rotation, which would considerably affect their putative habitability. Although thermal tides cause Venus to rotate retrogradely, simple scaling arguments tend to attribute this peculiarity to the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets’ rotation away from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than ~0.5 to 0.7 solar mass. Thus, many recently discovered terrestrial planets could exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation, even with a thin atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The age of Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, is still unknown. Gas-giant planet formation likely involved the growth of large solid cores, followed by the accumulation of gas onto these cores. Thus, the gas-giant cores must have formed before dissipation of the solar nebula, which likely occurred within less than 10 My after Solar System formation. Although such rapid accretion of the gas-giant cores has successfully been modeled, until now it has not been possible to date their formation. Here, using molybdenum and tungsten isotope measurements on iron meteorites, we demonstrate that meteorites derive from two genetically distinct nebular reservoirs that coexisted and remained spatially separated between ∼1 My and ∼3–4 My after Solar System formation. The most plausible mechanism for this efficient separation is the formation of Jupiter, opening a gap in the disk and preventing the exchange of material between the two reservoirs. As such, our results indicate that Jupiter’s core grew to ∼20 Earth masses within \&lt;1 My, followed by a more protracted growth to ∼50 Earth masses until at least ∼3–4 My after Solar System formation. Thus, Jupiter is the oldest planet of the Solar System, and its solid core formed well before the solar nebula gas dissipated, consistent with the core accretion model for giant planet formation.},

In this work, we present NASDM, a nuclei-aware semantic tissue generation framework. We demonstrate the model on a colon dataset and qualitatively and quantitatively establish the proficiency of the framework at this task. In future works, further conditioning on properties like stain-distribution, tissue-type, disease-type, etc. would enable patch generation in varied histopathological settings. Additionally, this framework can be extended to also generate semantic masks enabling an end-to-end tissue generation framework that first generates a mask and then synthesizes the corresponding patch. Further, future works can explore generation of patches conditioned on neighboring patches, as this enables generation of larger tissue areas by composing patches together. 

% could be additionally conditioned on properties like stain-distribution, tissue-type, disease-type etc. to enable the framework to generate patches in varied settings. It should also be noted that our model mimics

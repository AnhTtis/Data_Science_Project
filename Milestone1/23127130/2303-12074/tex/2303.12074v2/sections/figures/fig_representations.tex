\textbf{Conceptual Analysis} -- We visually illustrate the difference between the proposed 3D neural field architecture (d), to that used in GIRAFFE~\cite{niemeyer2021giraffe}, GSN~\cite{devries2021unconstrained}, and EG3D~\cite{chan2022efficient}.
Our extrusion operator is computationally much cheaper than those of GIRAFFE or GSN, and compared to EG3D, it better preserves the geometry of the output space: features that are close in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (i.e. volume) have a higher likelihood to be close in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (i.e. image/generator space); given the limited receptive field of 2D convolutions, this results in higher-quality generation.

\caption{\textbf{Architecture} --
Our method takes a floorplan projection of the semantic scene layout and a noise vector as inputs. We use a conditional StyleGAN2 backbone to generate a 2D feature field based on the given layout and reshape the channels into a 3D feature volume. This feature volume is queried using trilinear interpolation and subsequently decoded into color and density using a small MLP. We use a superresolution module to upsample volume rendered images to target resolution and use a standard StyleGAN2 discriminator. In order to ensure semantic consistency between the layout and the rendering, we sample equidistant coordinates from the feature volume and process the sampled features with a semantic segmentation decoder added to the discriminator. We train our model on a combination of an adversarial loss and cross entropy loss.

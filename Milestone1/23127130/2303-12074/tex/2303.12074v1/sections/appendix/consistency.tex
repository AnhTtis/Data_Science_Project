\section{Layout Consistency}
\label{sec:app_consistency}


We conduct an experiment to measure the layout consistency between the input semantic layouts and output top-down renderings of the scenes. To this end, we render all 5515 bedroom scenes with our trained models from top-down views. To test the effects of the layout consistency loss, as introduced in Sec. 3.3 of the main document, we obtain two generated top-down images, one rendered from the model trained with and the other one trained without the layout consistency loss. We pair the top-down renderings with ground truth semantic labels and separate the obtained datasets into train and test splits using a ratio of 0.85. Then, we train a DeepLabv3 \cite{chen2017rethinking} semantic segmentation model to predict the ground truth semantic segmentations from the rendered town-down images. Essentially, the more consistent the layouts and the top-down renderings the easier it becomes for the segmentation model to learn. Therefore, better test performance likely indicates higher consistencies. In Tab. \ref{table:semantic}, we indeed observe an improved IoU numbers when training our model with layout consistency loss.

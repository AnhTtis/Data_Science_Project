\section{Video Results}
\label{sec:video_results}

\textbf{We urge reviewers to view the additional video generation results on the 3D-FRONT and KITTI scenes.} We show our novel rendering videos in comparison to EG3D~\cite{chan2022efficient} and GSN~\cite{devries2021unconstrained}.
The videos are best viewed by opening the supplementary website.
We note that our model consistently produces more realistic scenes that are view-consistent, whereas the generated scenes from our baselines have more artifacts. Furthermore,
to showcase that our generated scenes have more accurate geometries, we visualize the corresponding depth maps for our generated scenes. We observe that in comparison to EG3D~\cite{chan2022efficient} our depth maps are consistently plausible, less noisy and better capture the 3D object geometries as well as the backgrounds.

More specifically, we note that the results of EG3D on the bedroom datasets suffer not only from the lower visual qualities but also from the structural errors of creating two symmetric scenes about the feature plan. Moreover, in the more challenging living room scenes with many objects, GSN and EG3D fail to generate recognizable objects. In contrast, CC3D consistently synthesizes high-quality, view-consistent scenes. Finally, on the \kitti scenes, EG3D and GSN suffer from significant artifacts in both RGB and depths with large view changes.

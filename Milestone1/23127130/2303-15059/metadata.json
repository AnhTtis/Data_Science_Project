    "abstract": "We shortly present two small results regarding the study formal duality in finite abelian groups as introduced by Cohn, Kumar, Reiher and Schürmann. In particular, we give a new example of a formally self dual set in $\\mathbb{Z}_2^2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_4^2$ and computed nonexistence of primitive formally dual sets of size $8$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_8^2$.",

    "abstract": "Coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) -- often considered the \"gold standard\" of main-group quantum chemistry -- is inapplicable to three-dimensional metals due to an infrared divergence, preventing its application to many important problems in materials science. We study the full, nonperturbative inclusion of triple excitations (CCSDT) and propose a new, iterative method, which we call ring-CCSDT, that resums the essential triple excitations with the same $N^7$ run-time scaling as CCSD(T). CCSDT and ring-CCSDT are used to calculate the correlation energy of the uniform electron gas at metallic densities and the structural properties of solid lithium. Inclusion of connected triple excitations is shown to be essential to achieving high accuracy. We also investigate semiempirical CC methods based on spin-component scaling and the distinguishable cluster approximation and find that they enhance the accuracy of their parent ab initio methods.",

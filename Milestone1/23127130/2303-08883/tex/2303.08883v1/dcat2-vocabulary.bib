	abstract = {Research data management requires stable, trustworthy repositories to safeguard scientific research results. In this context, rich markup with metadata is crucial for the discoverability and interpretability of the relevant resources. SEEK is a web-based software to manage all important artifacts of a research project, including project structures, involved actors, documents and datasets. SEEK is organized along the ISA model (Investigation – Study – Assay). It offers several machine-readable serializations, including JSON and RDF. In this paper, we extend the power of RDF serialization by leveraging the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT). DCAT was specifically designed to improve interoperability between digital assets on the Web and enables cross-domain markup. By using community-consented gold standard vocabularies and a formal knowledge description language, findability and interoperability according to the FAIR principles are significantly improved.},

abstract="Citizen Science (CS) initiatives encourage citizens to collect local data, contributing to knowledge creation and scientific development. However, these CS initiatives do not follow metadata nor data-sharing standards, which hampers their discoverability and reusability out of the scope of them. To improve this scenario in CS is crucial to consider Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) guidelines for research data sharing. This work proposes a FAIRification process (i.e. making CS initiatives more FAIR compliant), enhancing data sharing capacities in the CS context. It will be considered the adoption of Web standards, Web application programming interfaces (APIs) and Web augmentation. This approach contributes to the production of FAIR data in CS for data consumers. As preliminary results this paper explains the FAIRification process. The research objectives and plan are also presented.",

We present the core components and features of the FDP, its approach to metadata provision, the criteria to evaluate whether an application adheres to the FDP specifications and the service to register, index and allow users to search for metadata content of available FDPs.}",

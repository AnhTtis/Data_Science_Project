\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed ACE, an approach to generate counterfactual explanations using adversarial attacks. ACE relies on DDPMs to enhance the robustness of the target classifier, allowing it to create semantic changes through adversarial attacks, even when the classifier itself is not robust. ACE has multiple advantages regarding previous literature, notably seen in the counterfactual metrics. Moreover, we highlight that our explanations are capable of showing natural feature to find sparse and actionable modifications in real life, a characteristic not presented before. For instance, we were able to fool the classifier with real world changes, as well as finding natural adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "The Zee model provides a simple model for one-loop Majorana neutrino masses. The new scalars can furthermore explain the long-standing deviation in the muon's magnetic moment and the recent CDF measurement of the $W$-boson mass. Together, these observations yield predictions for lepton flavor violating processes that are almost entirely testable in the near future. The remaining parameter space makes testable predictions for neutrino masses.",

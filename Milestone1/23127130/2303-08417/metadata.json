    "abstract": "Urschel introduced a notion of spectral partitioning to prove an upper bound on the number of nodal decomposition of discrete Laplacian eigenvectors. The result is an analogue to the well-known Courant's nodal domain theorem on continuous Laplacian. In this article, using the same notion of partitioning, we will discuss the lower bound (or lack thereof) on the number of nodal decomposition of eigenvectors in the class of all graphs with a fixed number of vertices (however large) which can be treated as a discrete analogue to the results of Stern and Lewy in the continuous Laplacian case.",

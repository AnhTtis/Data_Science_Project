    "abstract": "We study a link between complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) and permutations exhibited by Daniel Chen and Sebastian Ohlig in recent work. In this, they associate a certain permutation to the leaves of a CNAT, and show that the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly one CNAT is $2^{n-2}$. We connect this to work by the first author and co-authors linking complete non-ambiguous trees and the Abelian sandpile model. This allows us to prove a number of conjectures by Chen and Ohlig on the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly $k$ CNATs for various $k > 1$, via bijective correspondences between such permutations. We also exhibit a new bijection between $(n-1)$-permutations and CNATs whose permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\\cdots1$. This bijection maps the left-to-right minima of the permutation to dots on the bottom row of the corresponding CNAT, and descents of the permutation to empty rows of the CNAT.",
